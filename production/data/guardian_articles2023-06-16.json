Give him a good hand \u2013 and, if you want to get in touch, you can email him or tweet @jimbo_cricket. Thanks for your company and emails, sorry I couldn\u2019t round to them all. I\u2019ll leave you with this from Marcus Abdullahi. \u201cLaura Cooney writes that she used to watch cricket in the sixth form during lunch breaks and free periods,\u201d writes Marcus. \u201cThey weren\u2019t free periods; they were study periods. No wonder the country is going to hell in a handcart.\u201d And that was 18 years ago. \u201cSat doing admin in an empty physio office,\u201d says James Brotherton. \u201cMy last three patients have not attended their appointments. Are they feet up following the OBO? No complaints from me, as this has allowed me to tune the radio towards the cricket. \u201cMy only gripe is the constant mention of Bazball and it\u2019s apparent synonyms. Every other word is Bazball-aggression-front-foot-taking-it-to-them look-at-all-the-fast-scoring-ness and intent we\u2019re showing... \u201cAussies protecting boundaries in the third over of a first Ashes Test is lovely and all, but all Bazball and Bazball Bazball makes Bazball a Bazball Bazball. Keep up the good work!\u201d It\u2019s time the clown who coined such an egregious term was brought to justice. People have been cancelled for less. Some more Ashes memories \u201cI was 17 in the summer of 2005, and started my second year of sixth form that September,\u201d writes Laura Cooney. \u201cMy A-level politics teacher was an avid cricket fan and when he wasn\u2019t teaching would have the game on patchy signal on the TV in his classroom, so during lunch or free periods those of us students who were cricket fans would head up there to watch an hour or two and chat about the game. \u201cI bonded with another girl in the group whilst watching the final Test, and we would talk about the series (we\u2019re also both from Preston so obviously Freddie Flintoff was a massive local hero then) and before long that quickly evolved into talking about everything else. Eighteen years later, she\u2019s still my best friend and we\u2019ve been through a ton of ups and downs together, but it was that Ashes series that brought us together and I\u2019m immensely grateful to cricket for indirectly bringing her into my life.\u201d What I like about this is that it was pre-Twitter, so those relatively niche shared interests were even more precious. Lunchtime reading And I recommend this with a heavy heart, because I\u2019ve only just heard the news. Jeremy was a near flawless sub-editor, one of those unsung heroes who save writers from typos (and from themselves) day after day after day. No ego, no byline, just standards, professional pride and love of language. And he didn\u2019t have a mobile phone, which made me admire him even more. That was a snorter from Boland, which seamed and lifted to hit Crawley\u2019s thumb on its way through to Carey. Crawley goes for a fine, tone-setting 61 from 73 balls, but I reckon that third wicket makes it Australia\u2019s session. It was a fascinating start to the series, both eventful and a little cagey. Australia\u2019s defensive tactics were questioned throughout, especially when England were milking singles with ease, but three wickets before lunch on a featherbed is an admirable effort. Duckett and Pope will feel they got themselves out; Crawley was jaffad by Scott Boland. England won\u2019t be too worried, especially as they are scoring at 4.65 an over and still have a lot of batting to come. Joe Root will resume on 20 not out, with Harry Brook the new batter. I can promise you it will not be dull. He\u2019s gone! A rare howler from Marais Erasmus \u2013 not even he is perfect - and a brilliant way for Australia to end the session. Australia appeal for caught behind against Crawley! This looks like a straightforward nick \u2013 but Marais Erasmus didn\u2019t give it on the field. 26th over: England 121-2 (Crawley 61, Root 17) An intriguing move from Cummins, who brings Lyon back for a single over before lunch. It\u2019s a low-key over, from which Crawley and Root milk five low-risk runs. 25th over: England 116-2 (Crawley 58, Root 15) Boland got Root four times in the Australia 18 months ago, which I must confess had passed me by. In my defence, the darts world championship was really good that year, and I\u2019ve had a lot of therapy about the 2021-22 Ashes The fourth ball of Boland\u2019s over is a bit too straight, which allows Root to work his first boundary behind square on the leg side. He has 15 from 26 balls; Crawley has 58 from 70 Bazballs. \u201cI write to you from Oxford, where (little more than 12 hours after my final Final) I\u2019m sitting in a pub garden with my mates, nursing a hangover \u2014 and a Stella \u2014 and jittering about Crawley\u2019s tendency to waft merrily down the corridor of uncertainty,\u201d writes Felix Kirkby. \u201cThings couldn\u2019t be any better. \u201c(Isn\u2019t it funny, by the way, that Ashes series run like a thread through every cricket fan\u2019s life? I still remember languishing in the garden with my mates, aged 13, as Broad plus Trent Bridge turned the Aussies inside out and wore them like one of Stokes\u2019s bucket hats. Scenes.)\u201d You have no idea how lucky you are to be this age at this moment in Ashes history. Savour every last Stella minute. 24th over: England 111-2 (Crawley 58, Root 10) Root is sporadically walking down the wicket to Hazlewood, which usually takes the LBW out of the equation. There is definitely some swing now, which will change the balance between bat and ball. Five runs from Hazlewood\u2019s over, including a pull for two from Crawley. \u201cSo the main story in the first session is that Australia didn\u2019t appeal aggressively enough?\u201d says Thomas Atkins. \u201cI bet that wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s bingo card.\u201d 23rd over: England 106-2 (Crawley 56, Root 7) Okay, Tim de Lisle (17th over) isn\u2019t at Glastonbury, mainly because the festival isn\u2019t till next weekend. Boland replaces Cummins; you\u2019d expect him to bowl well to Root as well given his ability to nick the ball back from a length. Root, who has made an entirely orthodox start to his innings, cuts a couple and then works a single behind square on the off side. Crawley is then beaten on the inside, driving extravagantly at a big inducker. There has been a hint of movement in the last couple of overs. 22nd over: England 103-2 (Crawley 56, Root 4) Smith shrieks for LBW when Root, pushing forward to Hazlewood, squeezes the ball between bat and pad. I\u2019m pretty sure it was pad first, but he looked outside the line. Nobody else seemed too interested, and replays confirm Root was indeed outside the line. It was good bowling though, and that is how Hazlewood will try to get Root, by working him across the crease and then nipping one back. Later in the over Root\u2019s head falls over a touch and he gets a leading edge that lands safely on the off side. For a man who has played so little Test cricket in recent times, Hazlewood\u2019s rhythm looks absolutely fine. 21st over: England 102-2 (Crawley 56, Root 3) A short ball from Cummins is slugged to the midwicket boundary by Crawley. Doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s much value in the short ball on this pitch. Cummins has been pretty expensive: 7-0-32-0. Only once in his magnificent Test career, at Dharamsala in 2016-17, has he had a higher economy rate. Long way to go, I realise. \u201cHi Rob, thanks for the reply, but I feel a bit of a seamer would be a real worry for some of our batsmen,\u201d says Scott Campbell. \u201cAnd I absolutely agree some of the pitches in Australia have not been a real bat/ball contest. (Hobart last ashes, Brisbane versus SA last season).\u201d I agree. But, as the last Ashes showed, they\u2019d be an even bigger worry for the England batters! In 2015, slow seamers made perfect sense and helped England win the Ashes. This year it feels different; I\u2019m not sure England can beat Australia on such pitches. 20th over: England 96-2 (Crawley 50, Root 2) Pat Cummins hooks Nathan Lyon, who took the wicket of Pope with the last ball of his previous over. And with good reason. Josh Hazlewood, who along with Cummins has a fine record against Root, is back in the attack. Eventually he\u2019ll try to trap Root LBW, but for now he\u2019s working him across the crease. Root opens the face to steer another single. It\u2019s an odd thing to say when the run rate is nearly five an over, but this has been a fairly cagey morning session. Fascinatingly so, I must stress. \u201cGlorious weather, exciting cricket, and I\u2019m enjoying it parked in front of the telly in London,\u201d writes Sarah Bacon. \u201cAustralia DO need a wicket right now -- thanks, Tubs -- but I\u2019m just letting all this Bazball vs Aussie-tactics deliciously wash over me. I\u2019m in for the long haul though! Sarah, Aussie in Ingerland. Still.\u201d 19th over: England 93-2 (Crawley 50, Root 1) Root is beaten by his first ball from Cummins, almost yorking himself as he walks down the pitch. Mark Taylor wondered if there was an edge but I don\u2019t think so. There was a similar incident at the start of his innings on the first day in the 2015 Ashes, when he edged Starc and was dropped by Haddin, except nobody noticed the edge. I\u2019m rambling. Root gets off the mark with a steer to third man. 18.2 overs: England 92-2 (Crawley 50, Root 0) Crawley pushes Cummins for a single to reach a charming half-century from 56 balls. He\u2019s had a couple of moments of fortune \u2013 of course he has \u2013 but he has also played some storming shots. And if England do win this series, his belting cover drive off the first ball of the series will go into Ashes folklore. 18th over: England 92-2 (Crawley 49, Root 0) \u201cWhy has England served up an Australian pitch/road in England?\u201d says Scott Campbell. \u201cUs Aussie fans like to see conditions where batters are challenged by the moving ball not having the keeper stand up to a fast/medium bowler on the first morning of a much anticipated Test match!\u201d They think it\u2019s their best chance of winning/entertaining. It\u2019s notable that the pitches in the last two Ashes series have almost been the wrong way round \u2013 some very lively seamers in 2021-22, and now a load of roads. Three reds and Pope is on his way, swishing his bat in disgust because it was an avoidable dismissal. Australia needed that wicket. It was a really good ball from Lyon though, which turned a fair way and skidded on to hit the pad. Pope, who had driven the previous ball through mid-off for four, goes for 31 from 44 balls. Lyon got one to straighten sharply from round the wicket to Pope, who missed an attempted work to leg. I can\u2019t see much wrong with this. Australia review for LBW against Pope! This looks really close to me. 17th over: England 84-1 (Crawley 46, Pope 26) Cummins replaces Boland, whose figures of 4-0-23-0 should have a one in them, and I\u2019m not talking about a maiden. The defensive fields continue, and Crawley plays a couple of confident drives for two and one. The first was made possible by a misfield from the sub Josh Inglis (I think). Tim de Lisle, who will be part of our coverage later in the series (I think he might be at Glastonbury) points out that this is already in the top 25 per cent of Crawley\u2019s Test innings. In other news, this pitch looks seriously flat. 16th over: England 79-1 (Crawley 43, Pope 24) A few more low-risk singles off Lyon. It was worth a look from Cummins, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s working. \u201cCan I just say,\u201d begins Romeo, \u201cthat Brian Withington is not only an old friend to the OBO, he is a very kind, generous and good person.\u201d You can indeed. That County Cricket Live! community you have is in danger of giving the internet a good name. Hang on, Crawley was caught behind but Australia didn\u2019t appeal! UltraEdge shows that he nicked that jaffa from Boland in the previous over, but nobody appealed. Crawley turned straight on his heels and smiled broadly. 15th over: England 75-1 (Crawley 41, Pope 22) Carey stands back again for Boland, so Pope charges him and carves the ball past point for a single. Boland digs one in to Crawley, the first short ball of the match from memory, but Crawley has plenty of time to sway out of the way. It\u2019s a flat pitch, I know, but Zak Crawley is batting delightfully at the moment. He slams a back cut for four more to bring up the fifty partnership, his first with Pope apparently, in 10.5 overs. But then he gets a big carried away, trying to whip Boland to leg on the walk and missing completely. It was a cracking delivery which bounced more than expected. Funnily enough, that extra bounce might have saved Crawley from getting a leading edge. \u201cOn the subject of first days, in 2006 at the Gabba my wife and I had a great one,\u201d writes Dan Johnson. \u201cWe managed to miss Harmy\u2019s first ball due to the usual faffing around with getting through the turnstiles (so that was good) then heard about a local brew-your-own place doing free beer, which we spent the lunch break drinking (even better). Then, likely due to the free beer, we found ourselves in a sort of chant-based Barmy Army ceilidh in the car park at some point after the match, which ended up on local TV. \u201cWe went back to the brewery for liquid lunch on days two and three, but then they asked us if we were actually going to BUY anything; we hadn\u2019t realised it was only free to try if you committed to brewing 72 bottles of the stuff. Bit difficult to take back to our apartment in Sydney so we had to go and buy some beer after that, terrible.\u201d 14th over: England 69-1 (Crawley 36, Pope 21) \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see Australia so defensive,\u201d says Kevin Pietersen, starting his stint with the commentary equivalent of a slog-sweep for six. A Red Bull single would\u2019ve sufficed Kev! In fairness, his fellow commentator Mark Taylor concurs that Australia went on the defensive too early and that England have adjusted their approach well. Three more singles from Lyon\u2019s over, including a confident reverse-sweep from Pope. \u201cKnocking off singles against the spinner,\u201d says Jonathan Wood. \u201cI do hate these boring middle overs.\u201d 13th over: England 66-1 (Crawley 35, Pope 18) The first bit of swing for Boland, though Crawley offers no stroke outside off stump. Both sides have taken a backward step of sorts, which in many ways has made the first hour even more intriguing. England haven\u2019t hit that many boundaries of late \u2013 three in the last nine overs I think \u2013 but they are milking the bowlers well enough to still be going at five an over. Hang on, make that four boundaries in the last nine overs: Crawley has just driven Boland\u2019s last ball magnificently through extra cover. That\u2019s drinks. 12th over: England 59-1 (Crawley 30, Pope 17) Lovely bowling from Lyon, who gets one to turn sharply into Crawley from around the wicket. Crawley inside-edges onto his pad, with the ball rebounding past off stump and between Carey\u2019s legs. He almost caught it in his pads, but he had no chance of taking an orthodox catch. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well to call for off-the-wall discussions in the OBO,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cbut if the A.N. Onymous Whimsy had had his/her name included, we wouldn\u2019t have to debate the probity or otherwise of nameless contributors.\u201d Ach, it was our old friend Brian Withington. I\u2019ve amended it now. Apologies for the absent scoreboard, which has now been digitally erected. You may have to press F5 though. 11th over: England 55-1 (Crawley 28, Pope 15) Pope charges Boland but is unable to do much with the ball. A single to third man brings up the fifty in the 11th over. \u201cSlow going for them\u2026\u201d deadpans Nasser Hussain on Sky. Carey comes up to the stumps for Boland to stop England\u2019s batters walking down the pitch. Crawley stands tall in his crease and bashes the next ball to the extra cover boundary. He\u2019s playing ever so well and has reached 28 from 31 balls. At this stage in 2005, since you asked, England were 50 for none. 10th over: England 47-1 (Crawley 22, Pope 13) Nathan Lyon is coming on for a bowl. I really like this move from Pat Cummins, because Pope has had trouble with offspin in his Test career \u2013 especially Lyon and Ravichandran Ashwin. Lyon starts around the wicket to Pope, who does well to keep out a grubber. \u201cJust like Adelaide boysssss!\u201d barks somebody behind the stumps. After a few singles, two of them reverse swept, Crawley drives through extra cover for four. That\u2019s another beautiful shot from Crawley, who has started very fluently. \u201cJohn Dalby mentioned Edgbaston 97, and that brings back fond memories for me,\u201d writes Steven Pye. \u201cI was young, I was in love, I had hair, and the Ashes were coming home!\u201d 9th over: England 40-1 (Crawley 17, Pope 11) This is a big moment: Scott Boland (Test average: 14.57; Ashes average: 9.55) replaces Pat Cummins. He doesn\u2019t do looseners, so Crawley has no chance of hitting his first ball for four as he did against Cummins and Hazlewood. Crawley does crash the fourth ball through extra cover, with the sweeper Head running round the boundaries to save two runs. Boland responds with a textbook delivery that straightens to beat the edge. He\u2019d find seam movement on the M4. \u201cAmongst all the analysis of the strengths and potential pitfalls of the Brave New World order, I have seen no recognition of one of the sadder casualties of unrelenting all-action Test cricket,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cI refer of course to the demise of the occasionally heated OBO threads of yore on esoteric topics like number theory (and cricket-themed cocktail design). These helped to while away the quieter passages in play that were such a feature of cricket in the BB era. \u201cWhen again will we be able to discuss at length why 0.999\u2026 recurring and 1.0 are exactly the same number? Or explain that the range of potential cricket averages is countably infinite, whilst between any two such averages, however close together, there exists uncountably infinitely many other numbers that can never be expressed as an average? I ask you (for a friend).\u201d Can\u2019t you save these emails for a more sedate format? England start their 50-over series against New Zealand on 8 September. 8th over: England 38-1 (Crawley 15, Pope 11) This is a really interesting struggle, with Hazlewood in particular trying to tempt Pope to chase slightly wider deliveries on an awkward innings. Pope has probably left more balls in this short innings than Ben Duckett has since his recall last year. Pope, who doesn\u2019t want to be hemmed in, runs down the track but is unable to beat midwicket. Hazlewood tarnishes an otherwise fine over with a slightly short ball that is back cut for four by Pope. That\u2019s his first boundary, and he follows it with a confident flick through square leg for two. \u201c1997, also at Edgbaston, is the first day of an Ashes series that sticks in the mind,\u201d says John Dalby. \u201cI was at Uni and about 20 of us bundled into a single halls common room to watch on the biggest TV any of us had - a portable 20in job. Half still in pyjamas, all hungover, the uproar as an Australian collapse played out was sublime. One chap, Graham I think, missed two wickets while making breakfast because he assumed our cheering was fake and didn\u2019t want to get gotcha\u2019d.\u201d Were the two wickets Blewett and Blewett? (13m 15s if it doesn\u2019t open at the right bit.) 7th over: England 32-1 (Crawley 15, Pope 5) Crawley edges Cummins short of slip! He felt for a channel delivery, and on a faster pitch that would have gone straight into the hands of Smith at second slip. This time it landed well short. Australia have had reasonable control of the scoreboard since the wicket: 20 balls, 10 runs, no boundaries. 6th over: England 30-1 (Crawley 14, Pope 4) Cummins and Hazlewood are into their work now, bowling with the usual control of line and length \u2013 if not, so far, of the scoreboard. Pope receives a few good deliveries in a row and plays them respectfully, culminating in a flick for a single. He has 4 from 10 balls, Crawley 14 from 16. Thanks again for all your emails. There are loads I haven\u2019t had chance to read, never mind publish, but we do appreciate them. 5th over: England 27-1 (Crawley 12, Pope 3) Australia have a very defensive field for the first morning of a Test match, though I keep coming back to how well that counter-intuitive approach worked for Michael Vaughan in 2005. What was it Shane Warne said about the start of a legspinner\u2019s spell: attack with the ball, defend with the field. The defensive field allows Crawley and Pope to work three singles and then a two on the leg side. That\u2019s clever cricket, a reminder \u2013 not that it should be needed \u2013 that Bazball does require a decent IQ. \u201cSurprising pitch so far from my eyes,\u201d says Huw Swanborough. \u201cThose first two overs had a lot of deliveries relying on some seam action, but the bounce has been lacking. It almost seems like it might be spongey. \u201cIf this pitch doesn\u2019t turn into a dustbowl within three days, we\u2019re going to be looking at a very high scoring draw I suspect as I don\u2019t think spinners or paces will get much at all here.\u201d I suppose England\u2019s plan is for scoreboard pressure and funky fields to do what the pitch can\u2019t. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves. 4th over: England 22-1 (Crawley 10, Pope 0) The new batter is Ollie Pope, who had a grisly Ashes 18 months ago but has re-emerged as England\u2019s No3 and vice-captain. \u201cRe: Dave Adams (10:47) and memorable Ashes first mornings,\u201d says Si Williams. \u201cIn November 2006, after playing (and losing) at the world frisbee championships in Perth, I was in NW Australia at a place called Monkey Mia. With the timezone difference to the Gabba there were seven of us packed into a Toyota listening to the radio at 7am in a baking hot car park... After Harmison\u2019s first over, we gave up and went paddling with the dolphins.\u201d Goddim! The ball after inside-edging past off stump for four, Duckett edges Hazlewood behind. It was a good delivery, with a tight line and length, and Duckett edged an attempted cut. The ball started to die on Alex Carey, who dived forward to take a fine low catch. Duckett goes for 12 from 10 balls, and he\u2019ll be annoyed to fall to one of his favourite shots. 3rd over: England 18-0 (Crawley 10, Duckett 8) Ben Stokes asked for fast, flat pitches in this series. One out of two ain\u2019t bad: the pitch looks slowish but an absolute belter. Duckett, who has a strike rate of 97 since his recall last year, times Cummins off the pads for his first Ashes boundary. Three overs, three boundaries for England. Pat Cummins is already fiddling with the field. Mike Atherton wonders whether Australia have been \u201cspooked\u201d and are being too defensive, certainly with the new ball: the only close fielders are two slips and a gully. It\u2019s a fine balance, especially as the ball is doing absolutely nothing. \u201cHard to convey just how febrile the atmosphere is here - expectations are sky high!\u201d writes Gary Naylor. \u201cWhether this is a good thing or a bad thing, I don\u2019t know. But Test cricket does not look like it\u2019s in the midst of an existential crisis, that\u2019s for sure!\u201d 2nd over: England 11-0 (Crawley 10, Duckett 1) Josh Hazlewood takes the new ball ahead of Scott Boland, who can take the new ball but is a perfect first-change bowler. He has played very little Test cricket in the last two years because of injury, just four Tests since January 2021. Hazlewood\u2019s first ball is a real loosener, on the pads and pinged through square leg for four by Crawley. It was beautifully timed, even if it was a bit of a freebie. Ricky Ponting, commentating on Sky in England, doesn\u2019t like the field \u2013 he thinks they should have a deep square rather than a deep point to Crawley. The deep point is in action later in the over when Crawley clouts a wide ball for a single. Michael Vaughan used a similar tactic to great effect in 2005, most crucially when, with three needed to win on this ground, Brett Lee creamed a Steve Harmison full toss to the cover sweeper. Back in 2023, Duckett gets off the mark with a work round the corner for a single. Australia are already bowling a really tight line to Duckett, which makes sense because he is so good between backward point and mid off when he can free his arms. A technical note (with thanks to OBO regular John Starbuck): if the preamble is still appearing at the top of the page, press F5 and it will magically disappear. 1st over: England 5-0 (Crawley 5, Duckett 0) Crawley leaves the next two deliveries, then thinks of a single to the right of Green at gully. Duckett wisely sends him bad. Crawley gets his single next ball with a push to mid-on. Cummins\u2019s first ball to Duckett is on leg stump and pushed to midwicket. Was he trying to bowl him round his legs there? \u201cEngland\u2019s brave new style is making Test cricket interesting again,\u201d writes Philip Sutherland. \u201cMany cynics here Downunder. Love to see England\u2019s way triumph because Test cricket is otherwise doomed in modern society. \u201cSpent ten years in Yorkshire at Ampleforth in school days. Loved our cricket. Fred Trueman bowled an over to me one day in the nets. Such a gentleman; he missed my stumps! Lovely man. \u201cBest of luck with your commentary during the series. Watching with great interest. Postscript: can\u2019t stay up all night watching because tomorrow Saturday my wedding anniversary and we have 6am start.\u201d 0.1 overs: England 4-0 (Crawley 4, Duckett 0) Zak Crawley wallops the first ball through extra cover for four! That was so reminiscent of Michael Slater cutting Phil DeFreitas to the fence in 1994-95, and a thumping statement of intent. Even Ben Stokes looks a bit shocked. Pat Cummins will bowl the first ball to Zak Crawley, and his field includes a deep backward point. \u201cA ain\u2019t got nuffink to say, Rob,\u201d says Peter Gibbs. \u201cJust that it\u2019s good to be back with the gang.\u201d Amen to that. Often when journalists talk about their work being a privilege, I instinctively cringe. Today, I get it. The anthems have been sung with abundant gusto, and now the 13 active players are getting ready for business. That drum-and-bass track you can hear is Zak Crawley\u2019s heartbeat. And yours. \u201cJust to let folks know that Aussie station SEN Sports 1116 radio have full Ashes commentary and it\u2019s not geo-blocked,\u201d writes Nick Varley. \u201cIt\u2019s what I normally use to listen to Aus Tests, living here in Manila, Philippines.\u201d And their team includes our very own Adam Collins. I\u2019m off to grab a coffee and give my eyes a little break. I\u2019ll leave you with this lovely analogy from Dave Adams. \u201cOne of the almost infinite number of things I love about the first day of the Ashes is that where you were for the first ball serves an amusing personal fossil record... \u201cFor example, for 1990/91 I was 12 and tucked up in bed, listening to Radio 4 longwave on those headphones with the foam outer, hoping to avoid a parental brollocking. For 1997 I was sat in a student union bar. In 2002/03 I heard about Nasser\u2019s brainfade at the toss on the radio in a mate\u2019s car coming back from Wolves v Pompey. In 2009 I missed the first few balls because I was outside the Walkabout hammering on the door to get them to open up. By 2010/11 I had a small baby son (who gets a mention in \u2018766 &amp; All That\u2019) and I watched the opening exchanges with him sat on my lap. \u201cDo other people know where they were at the start of every series?\u201d I do with the exception of 1998-99. I mean, I know where I was in life \u2013 straight out of university, temping in the civil service, dreaming of writing about sport \u2013 but I can\u2019t remember anything specific about the first day. \u201cRob, I am surprised to find you local to Pylle and its animal shelter,\u201d writes Dan Catton. \u201cThis email comes to you from sunny Evercreech, where the pre-Ashes excitement level is only subdued by the thought of the impassable roads that await us next week, thanks to Mr Eavis\u2019s little gathering...\u201d This is my first year living close to Glastonbury during the festival. I haven\u2019t really noticed it yet, apart from all the people wearing bucket hats on my TV. Moeen Ali speaks \u201cMy concern with Hazlewood is fitness,\u201d says Robert Speed. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been able to get through a Test match unscathed for a while now. I would have stuck with Starc instead.\u201d Yeah I can understand that, though Green (and Lyon) give you enough insurance I think. The conditions, and the potential for reverse swing, is another reason why I thought they might play Starc. \u201cFirst, let\u2019s get one thing straight,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThe bucket hat has never not been fashionable. (Possibly the Welsh football fan in me talking\u2026). Second, English cricket has often gone in cycles, focussed on Ashes series. What if the whole Bazball thing has actually been a fantastic ploy to confuse the Australians? Really playing the long game? What if Crawley and Ducket come out and put on an obdurate 37-0 in the morning session? Admittedly, it\u2019s not likely, but it would mess incredibly with Australian heads.\u201d You do realise only two 1.5 overs will be possible in the morning session because of an unexpected storm? What do you think of Hazlewood over Starc? I suspect England would have preferred to face Starc, simply because he is more hittable. Hazlewood\u2019s Test economy rate is 2.71, Starc\u2019s 3.32. It probably comes down to that. Ian Ward\u2019s last question to Pat Cummins is simple. \u201cEngland will come at you, is that okay?\u201d Cummins smiles broadly. \u201cAh, I think so. Yeah.\u201d \u201cTough call on Mitchy,\u201d says Pat Cummins, \u201cI thought he was really impressive last week. The squad mentality\u2026 it\u2019s a good problem to have. Managing the bowlers and conditions will be important.\u201d England Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes (c), Bairstow (wk), Ali, Broad, Robinson, Anderson. Australia Warner, Khawaja, Labuschagne, Smith, Head, Green, Carey (wk), Cummins (c), Lyon, Hazlewood, Boland. \u201cLooks a really good cricket wicket,\u201d says Ben Stokes. \u201cGood toss to win, now we\u2019ve gotta put some runs on the board.\u201d Pat Cummins says he would have batted as well. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Dom Besley, though it\u2019s anything but in his part of the world. \u201c9:15pm in New Zealand and the family are in bed. I\u2019m getting ready to pull an all-nighter. My first energy drink is open and the coffee machine is ready. When my four-year-old wakes, I\u2019m likely to be as bouncing off the walls as he is. \u201cI\u2019ve not been this excited for an Ashes since 2005. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how England\u2019s aggression fares against this Australian attack and how the plan goes if they find themselves in a spot of bother.\u201d If in doubt, go even harder. I don\u2019t know if it will work, but I\u2019m 99.94 per cent sure England won\u2019t change their approach. \u201cMornin\u2019 from a chilly Southern Highlands NSW,\u201d writes Jon Greig. \u201cDespite wishes to the contrary... Can see Eng being three down within an hour... or, Oz 90 for one at lunch. Forever optimistic. Ahem.\u201d Ricky Ponting on Steve Smith Hopefully this isn\u2019t geoblocked in Australia. Here\u2019s Geoff Lemon on David Warner, the great survivor who wants to land one last haymaker on England. If the pitches are generally flat, I fancy him to have a good series. \u201cRegarding whether England were better than India in 2005: worth remembering that England went to India a few months later and held them to 1-1. Though that was admittedly after the 0-2 drubbing in Pakistan, so maybe England were actually behind Pakistan, not India.\u201d Ah but Pakistan were Pakistan: they hadn\u2019t won a series for two years before beating India. For reference, these were the rankings at the start of the English summer: 1 Aus 2 Daylight 3 Eng 4 Ind 5 Pak. \u201cMorning Rob, morning everyone,\u201d says David Clark. \u201cThe Aussies always try to pick off the English captain. Ben Stokes will know this. Presumably, he will fight fire with even more fire than usual. Is that possible?\u201d I\u2019m sorry I assumed that was a rhetorical question. \u201cLast night I dreamed that I logged into the OBO this morning, only to discover that the Ashes had started yesterday,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cFortunately, it was displaying the close of play score as 275-4, at which point I knew that it must be a dream. Gone are the days of so few runs being scored on day one of an England Test.\u201d You do realise only 34 overs were possible because of an unexpected storm? Win the toss and bat win the toss and win the toss and bat win the toss and we\u2019ll have a bowl Talking of good causes, my local animal shelter Happy Landings does the most wonderful work and is always in need of donations \u2013 whether it\u2019s a box of grain-free dog food or a contribution towards Travis the pug\u2019s eye operation and dental work. If you\u2019re feeling generous, or unfairly pressured by this post, you can donate here. \u201c\ufeffRob! A Very Good Morning!\u201d writes Kim Thonger. \u201cMay I ask you, on the first day of what we all hope will be a wonderful series, to mention a good cause? We long-suffering sixtysomething cricket watchers have huge admiration for the exciting changes brought about by Bazball, but there is a downside. The constant excitement is affecting our ability to take our traditional after lunch forty winks. I therefore announce on behalf of silver snoozers everywhere a global campaign called Preserve Elderly Naptime In Sport. \u201cWe demand that this summer, with a window of tranquility the objective, batters should observe a half hour of deliberate shouldering of arms outside off stump from 1430 to 1500 BST every match day. Straight balls must get the full forward defensive. Short balls are to be evaded, by swaying or ducking. Leg side half tosses to be disdainfully ignored. \u201cI do not need to spell out the obvious acronym for this initiative. It may be short, but trips off the tongue nicely. I do hope you can provide rigorous editorial agitation so we can get the thing out and in front of the general public and make it a towering all conquering success. Cricket club members globally need the Guardian OBO writers to step up and deliver hands on active encouragement.\u201d This is a very longwinded way of pushing for Dom Sibley to be recalled. (And hats off to Dom, so unfairly maligned in recent years, for showing there is more than one way to skin a target of 501. In a Bazball world \u2013 and I\u2019m not being flippant - he is now the maverick.) It looks like Josh Hazlewood will play ahead of Mitch Starc (and Mitch Marsh) Don\u2019t thank me, thank Simon in Luxembourg, who has sent in the link below. \u201cSurely 2005 was the last Ashes series involving the two best sides in the world,\u201d says Matt Hipkiss. \u201cAustralia go without saying, but England leading into that series had won all seven tests at home the previous summer, and won away in both South Africa and the West Indies in the preceding 12 months.\u201d I agree, though I suppose the argument is that \u2013 a bit like this team \u2013 they were a nose behind India. I can see both sides. Ultimately I think that if England and India played a 10-Test series, five at home and five away, India would edge it. This entry is for England fans only Let\u2019s get this out of the way, shall we Thanks for all your emails this morning. I won\u2019t have time to read them all, but I\u2019ll do my best. So far they all have one common theme: everyone feels like they\u2019re 25 years old again. \u201cHappy Ashes morning Rob!\u201d says Patrick Connolly. \u201cI\u2019m delighted you\u2019ve got the OBO open nice and early as I need somewhere to direct my excitement this glorious morning. \u201cThe sheer beauty of a five-Test series is that it condenses so many dramas on so many levels into a short period of time that also happens to be a long time. It\u2019s a short period of time relative to, say, a whole football season, but a long period of time relative to any other sporting contest in the world. Yet it has all the drama (and more) of a full sporting season, and hundreds of mini-contests within it. \u201cLike a soap opera we get to know the participants and see their story develop over the series and we get to watch the most joyous part of sport - momentum shifts - play out in something like slow-motion. The momentum of a spell, a session, a day, an innings, all wrapped up in the momentum of a test and the momentum of a series. And even if we have to go do something else, it\u2019s always there in the background, from 11am-6pm, the gradual moving of the dial back and forth. \u201cOther series are great, but the Ashes and the five-Test format just pushes it into the sublime. (And for those of us lucky enough to get a ticket in the cheap seats for a day, we also get to stack our empty beer glasses into a giant snake construction to be passed between the congregation like a collection at mass.) \u201cIt\u2019s strange to think too that in the time I\u2019ve been reading the OBO people have been born, completed their schooling and are now actual adults.... \u201cAnyways, I\u2019m probably a bit over-excited. Enjoy the cricket!\u201d \u201cMorning Rob, morning all,\u201d says Matt Turland. \u201cWell, here we are again. But it feels different. A whole lot of different. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Australia win the series 3-2. But, and maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been brainwashed by all the \u201cgood vibes\u201d, It almost doesn\u2019t matter what the result is. Almost. But that\u2019s still a long way removed from years gone by \u201cIf England give it a go and stick to their guns, glorious failure will be accepted by me. Much more enjoyable going down swinging than some of the dross we\u2019ve been served up in the past.\u201d Admirable sentiments, and I completely agree, but the mood will change quickly if they score at 5.5 an over and lose 5-0. There were so many encouraging signs for Australia in the WTC win over India. The greatest of them all was the rhythm and form of Steve Smith (second-innings yahoos notwithstanding). There are great players on both sides, but only one of them has won an Ashes series almost single-handedly. Mitch Marsh marking out his run-up must be a red herring, surely. He\u2019s a fine cricketer and all, but it would only make sense if Cam Green has picked up an injury. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cCome on then, prediction time. Mine? Not a bloody clue. I think anything, literally anything, could happen. Though maybe not five draws, eh? Let\u2019s hope the Hundred Test cricket is the real winner...\u201d I\u2019ve never felt less confident in predicting an Ashes series, and not only because I\u2019m subconsciously terrified of being cancelled. Could be 4-0, 0-4 or anything inbetween. And for that expertise, you are most welcome. Mitch Marsh to play? To mix metaphors in a frankly egregious way, this would be a helluva funky tank to park on England\u2019s lawn. Musical interlude There\u2019s going to be a lot of noise in the next six weeks, so let\u2019s enjoy eight minutes of peace. \u201cHow exciting is this?\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cJust spent the night gaming every possible first day scenario in my mind while trying to sleep, from England being 8/540 at stumps to Australia being 3/298, and everything in between. My question \u2013 when was the last Ashes series between the two best teams in the world? It wasn\u2019t 2005 \u2013 I suspect it may have been 1974-75? Any other possibilities?\u201d At the risk of sounding like, well, me, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s 2023. India are actually top of the ICC rankings and, though those rankings aren\u2019t gospel, I\u2019d still India them above England as of 9.40am on 16 June 2023. That said, I wouldn\u2019t abuse you on the internet for having an alternative view. I think there\u2019s a decent case for 2005, personally, as India had just lost at home to Australia and, though much better than in the 20th century, could still be vulnerable away from home. Before that, goodness knows, probably 1974-75 as you say. It wasn\u2019t 1989, I\u2019ll tell you that for free. \u201cHere we go,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cMorning Rob, the day is here. Six weeks of uber-cricket, and whatever happens, it won\u2019t be boring. The subtle fluctuations of form and fitness has meant while Australia have the usual suspects, we don\u2019t have the team we hoped we would a year ago. But that\u2019s not pessimism (no more than any 90s England fan) it\u2019s just a slight readjustment of the Stokes protagonists, but the ethos won\u2019t change. And that\u2019s the big hope for us. Because we all know that other way didn\u2019t work. But mainly, we can stop talking about two winters ago. I wonder if Rory Burns will be watching? Come on England!\u201d Poor Rory Burns, to be forever remembered for one ball rather than a pretty strong series in 2019. Ben Stokes was almost comically laid-back at his press conference yesterday. If he\u2019s bluffing, a career in poker awaits because he is seriously good at it. Mark Ramprakash\u2019s column \u201cIf England win the toss, they\u2019ll bat, right?\u201d says Francis Barton. \u201cDry, hot, good pitch, possible cloud on Sunday, possible fourth-innings turn. You\u2019ve got to bat... right? But Stokes loves to chase. Cummins would definitely bat first. What do you think? Ridiculously excited about this series.\u201d All logic says bat first, so I fully expect Ben Stokes to \u2026 bat, actually, as he went away from chasing over the winter and it would feel damagingly ostentatious to bowl first on a dry, flat pitch \u2013 especially given what Nathan Lyon did on the final day at Edgbaston in 2019. But I don\u2019t say this with complete confidence. Many of us fancy Ollie Robinson to be England\u2019s leading wickettaker in this series. He\u2019s also an endearingly straight talker, and this chat with Don McRae \u2013 the best sports interviewer in the business IMO \u2013 is particularly good. Bazball by numbers Trust me, this is one euphoric statgasm after another. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d writes Jim Wallace, who I\u2019m very glad to say will be covering the second half of the day. \u201cOn the rattler to Brum. (John Snow Hill station.) Will send over a few \u2018vibes\u2019 (urgh) from the ground. I\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s gonna be good.\u201d At my age you don\u2019t get too many Friday feelings, but I\u2019d happily experience this once a week. Also, good idea to get the train after 7am so that you could pop into M&amp;S. England named their XI on Wednesday, as is their wont, with Stuart Broad preferred to Mark Wood. Australia also have a choice between scalpel and sledgehammer: Josh Hazlewood or Mitchell Starc. The remarkable Scott Boland is no longer in that particular conversation. England Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes (c), Bairstow (wk), Ali, Broad, Robinson, Anderson. Australia Warner, Khawaja, Labuschagne, Smith, Head, Green, Carey (wk), Starc/Hazlewood*, Cummins (c), Lyon, Boland. * Hazlewood will bat below Cummins and Lyon if he plays. It\u2019ll be interesting to see who takes the new ball for England. It\u2019s usually James Anderson and Ollie Robinson, but one of the reasons Stuart Broad has been picked is to take care of David Warner. I suspect Robinson will revert to first-change, with England hoping he can crack the Labuschagne/Smith code. There\u2019s plenty to do before flip gets real \u2013 just over two hours to go - so for now I\u2019ll leave you with Ali Martin\u2019s series preview. It\u2019s the Ashes! And a tip of the hat to this tinder-dry response. Usually in this thing, only one team has to win the series. A draw will be enough for Australia to retain the urn they have held since December 2017, but they are aiming higher than that. They are desperate to cement their legacy by becoming the first Australian side to win a series in England since 2001. The folks below the line on our County Cricket blog have set up a fantasy league if you want to get involved. I\u2019ve picked my team, with Moeen Ali ahead of Ben Stokes. It\u2019s a budget thing, I\u2019m not an idiot. I am an idiot, but it\u2019s still a budget thing. The CricketXI link is here and the code is YOZYDMWJ. Well that\u2019s the next six weeks sorted. From WhatsApp to the watercooler, the dinner table to the dive bar, one thing is going to dominate conversation between now and 31 July, and it\u2019s not peerages. In three hours\u2019 time, at a roastingly hot Edgbaston, the most eagerly anticipated Ashes series since 2006-07 will begin. That anticipation is easily explained: it\u2019s the most exciting team in the world versus the best team in the world. Cricket could do with a classic Ashes series, given the existential crisis about the future of sport\u2019s greatest format. But while both teams have a shared purpose to advertise Test cricket in all its abundant glory, they disagree on how it should be played in 2023. The Ashes has always been a clash of cultures, yet England have never parked so many tanks on Australia\u2019s lawn. They are enjoying a Bazball epiphany, playing perhaps the most attacking Test cricket in the 146-year history of the game, and have won 11 of their 13 games under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. But Australia are the new world champions and look as formidable as they have in many a year, maybe since the retirement of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne in 2007. They aim show that their brand of cricket \u2013 relentlessly aggressive, just not hyper aggressive \u2013 will always be the best way, as it was when they shattered the first incarnation of Bazball at the 2015 World Cup. There\u2019s little doubt England can score big, fast runs against bowlers as good as Australia\u2019s, because they did it against South Africa last year. The question is whether they can do so amid the brain-scrambling, sanity-questioning intensity of an Ashes series. But the same is true of Australia\u2019s bowlers. In an otherwise dominant series four years ago, when they had England\u2019s batters in a vice most of the time, a great attack lost the noggin when Ben Stokes went berserk at Headingley. Australia would love to puncture England\u2019s new-age serenity by inducing a few old-fashioned collapses, and see how their bohemian vibe survives being plugged by 300 runs at fortress Edgbaston. Both teams are world-class at riding the wave; the ability to respond to the choppier stuff will probably decide who wins the series. England have spoken about the result being secondary to the process. Yet it was abundantly clear from Stokes\u2019 press conference yesterday that his team are determined to do something astonishing this summer: make the bucket hat fashionable. But seriously folks. England have scored at 4.85 runs per over since Stokes became full-time captain last summer. Their overall run-rate under him (including a Test in 2020) is 4.65. The next highest of anybody who has captained more than two Tests is Steve Waugh with 3.66. Under Cummins, Australia have gone at 3.52 per over. Admirably aggressive by any measure, except Bazball. A recurring theme of the most exciting Ashes series is aggression: sporting aggression, that is, be it paint-stripping pace bowling, extravagant wristspin or, most crucially, the once rare sight of English batters trying to hit sixes. There will be no wristspin genius this summer, on the pitch or in the commentary box, but the other ingredients are all there. It could \u2013 sod it, should \u2013 be a classic. It\u2019s hard to recall an Ashes series in which both teams have been so comfortable in their own skin beforehand. We know from experience that there is always plenty of bluff when England play Australia; we\u2019re about to find out just how much. The match starts at 11am BST (8pm AEST), with the toss at 10.30/7.30."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a63b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/16/mortgage-rates-uk-government-urged-to-provide-emergency-help-costs-rising-nationwide-liberal-democrats-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK government urged to help mortgage holders as rates keep rising; company insolvencies jump 40% \u2013 business live", "lead": "Lib Dems call for emergency mortgage protection fund, as new data shows two-year fixed rate mortgage has jumped to 5.98% and confidence in Bank of England falls", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 12:32:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111220", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b5998fc850a2f2df51b84d4679e5889a69a50acb/0_257_4102_2461/500.jpg", "body": "Bad news for mortgage holders \u2013 French bank BNP Paribas predict UK interest rates will rise by a whole percentage point before the end of the year.

At face value, this could seem too tepid for a central bank that is facing a significant problem of underlying inflationary pressures.

Indeed, we expect the MPC to hike by a cumulative 100bp to take Bank Rate to a terminal level of 5.50% by November. The UK\u2019s railway regulator is examining whether customers are being ripped off when they buy food and drink at railway stations. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has launched a market study into railway station catering today, to examine if customers are losing out to excessively high prices. Grahame Horgan, ORR\u2019s head of competition, said: \u201cAs consumers across the country are affected by the rising cost of living, we want to ensure that passengers are getting affordable food and beverages when using station facilities. It is important that the railway industry gives consumers good value for money and improves their journey experience.\u201d Matt Smith, Rightmove\u2019s mortgage expert, says: \u201cIt\u2019s been a volatile couple of weeks for the mortgage market and we\u2019ve continued to see average fixed rates creep up this week in both two-year and five-year fixed deals. \u201cThe average rate for a five-year fixed, 85% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage is now 5.24%, having been 5.20% earlier this week and 5.16% this time last week. \u201cThis equates to a \u00a315 per month increase for someone taking out this kind of mortgage now rather than last week based on the current average asking price for a home. Next week\u2019s inflation figures and Bank of England base rate decision will be really key for setting the tone for the mortgage market over the coming weeks.\u201d Global shares have risen 14-month highs today, Reuters reports, as investors took the view that the Federal Reserve may not need to raise rates much more. The MSCI All-World index has gained 0.2% to around its highest since mid-April 2022, following the Fed\u2019s decision to leave interest rates on hold on Wednesday. Philip Shaw of Investec predicts the Bank of England will raise interest rates to a peak of 5.25% this autumn. That will start with a quarter-point rise to 4.75% next Thursday, Shaw forecasts, adding that the outlook for rates further ahead looks exceptionally hazy. He says: However our conclusion is that in addition to next week, the MPC will raise the Bank rate in August and September resulting in a terminal rate of 5.25%. Previously we had expected the Bank rate to peak at 4.75%. Our baseline case is that rates will not rise as far as 6%, but policymakers are currently in a state of heightened data dependency and we note that that significant risks exist in both directions. If we are correct about a household consumption-led slowdown, interest rates could come down in 2024 but this seems more likely to take place in Q2 rather than Q1. Odey Asset Management has suspended trading in a fourth fund following a \u201csizeable level\u201d of withdrawal requests, as sexual misconduct allegations against founder Crispin Odey continue to rock the company. The firm said in a letter to investors on Friday that it was temporarily suspending trading in its $80mn Special Situations fund to sell assets in an \u201corderly fashion\u201d to meet the redemptions, the Financial Times reports. It emerged yesterday that OAM is to be broken up, one week after multimillionaire Conservative and Brexit donor Odey was accused of sexual misconduct by junior female members of staff. Odey Asset Management (OAM), the \u00a33.5bn hedge fund Odey founded 32 years ago, announced on Thursday it was in \u201cadvanced discussions for rehousing funds and transferring certain fund management activities and individuals to other asset managers\u201d. Buying agent Henry Pryor argues that the UK government will resist calls to support mortgage-holders, as it would undermine the Bank of England\u2019s efforts: Not only has the pound hit a one-year high, it\u2019s on track for its best week of 2023. Sterling has gained 2.2 cents. or 1.75%, against the US dollar so far this week to around $1.28. That would be its best week since November 2022, lifted by expectations that UK interest rates will keep rising to squeeze out inflation. The boss of Tesco said food inflation has probably peaked but warned that prices were likely to stay high and urged the government to ease Brexit rules, which are driving up the cost of importing groceries.

PA Media have written a Q&amp;A about the UK mortgage market: Q: What has been happening in the mortgage market in recent weeks? Rates have been on the increase and some lenders temporarily withdrew deals available through brokers, later putting them back on sale, to help manage the flow of applications. Q: Why have mortgage rates been increasing? Some variable rate mortgage deals directly track the Bank of England base rate and they automatically increase in line with the base rate. The rate has climbed 12 times in a row. Borrowers can also end up on a standard variable rate (SVR) when their initial mortgage deal ends. The SVR is set by lenders individually but it can often roughly follow movements in the base rate. The bulk of mortgaged UK homeowners tend to take out fixed-rate deals. Swap rates underpin the pricing of fixed-rate mortgages and these have been rising amid expectations around inflation, which has turned out to be more \u201csticky\u201d than some had expected. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation rose by 8.7% in the 12 months to April 2023, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures. Q: Is there more mortgage pain to come? Given that a large chunk of homeowners are sitting on fixed rates, many are yet to feel the impact of recent mortgage rate increases on their budgets. This will add to the squeeze that households are already feeling from a range of other bills, such as surging food costs. Around 800,000 fixed-rate deals are due to end in the second half of this year, according to trade association UK Finance. Q: What is next for mortgage rates? No one can say for certain what will happen to mortgage rates in the future. What we do know, however, is that the next Bank of England base rate decision is next week. Experts are predicting that there will be a 13th base rate increase, with a potential 0.25 percentage point rate hike, taking the base rate to 4.75%. Meanwhile, fixed-rate mortgages have already been on an upward march. The average two-year fixed-rate residential mortgage on the market was sitting at just below 6% on Friday, according to financial information website Moneyfactscompare.co.uk. Q: What help is available if I am struggling with my payments? Speak to your lender as early as possible. They may be able to suggest various options to keep monthly payments more manageable, although some, such as extending the mortgage term, may mean paying more over the longer term, so any decision needs to be weighed up carefully. If you are coming to the end of a mortgage, a broker could help with finding a deal that is right for you. UK fixed-term mortgage rates are continuing to climb towards 6% today, adding to the pressure on borrowers looking for a new loan. Data from Moneyfacts shows that the average two-year fixed rate increased from 5.92% yesterday to 5.98% today. The average five-year fixed rate increased from 5.56% to 5.62%. Lenders also withdrew deals, with the number of residential mortgages available falling from 5,080 yesterday to 4,923 this morning. As we mentioned earlier, mortgage rates of 6% will be as painful as much higher headline rates in the last century, due to the increase in loan amounts vs incomes. The British public are increasingly unhappy with the Bank of England\u2019s flailing attempts to get a grip on inflation, a new survey has found. The BoE\u2019s own quarterly survey of public attitudes to inflation has found that net satisfaction with the central bank hit its lowest level since records began in 1999. Respondents were asked to assess the way the Bank of England is \u2018doing its job to set interest rates to control inflation\u2019. The net satisfaction balance, the proportion satisfied minus the proportion dissatisfied, fell to -13%, down from -4% in February 2023. Perhaps not a surprise, given inflation hit a four-decade high last autum at 11.1%, over the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. The better news for policymakers is that the British public\u2019s expectations for inflation in the coming 12 months cooled in May, falling to 3.5% from 3.9% in February. For inflation in five years\u2019 time, expectations were steady at 3.0%. When asked about the future path of interest rates, 57% of respondents expected rates to rise over the next 12 months, down from 58% in February 2023. Asked what would be \u2018best for the economy\u2019 \u2013 higher interest rates, lower rates or no change \u2013 16% thought rates should \u2018go up\u2019, unchanged from February 2023. 37% of respondents thought that interest rates should \u2018go down\u2019, up from 33% in February When asked what would be \u2018best for you personally\u2019, 26% of respondents said it would be better for them if interest rates were to \u2018go up\u2019, down from 27% in February. 31% of respondents said it would be better for them if interest rates were to \u2018go down\u2019, up from 30% in February. Perhaps surprisingly, 3% of respondents thought that interest rates had fallen over the past 12 months, while 75% knew they had risen. The UK\u2019s competition regulator has cleared Amazon.com\u2019s planned $1.7bn acquisition of iRobot Corp, maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had concluded that the deal would not lead to competition concerns in the UK, giving Amazon its green light to expand its stable of smart-home devices. In April, the CMA had launched a \u201cPhase 1\u201d probe into the deal, which was announced in August last year. Today\u2019s ruling comes at a time when antitrust regulators are increasingly wary of giant companies acquiring smaller rivals; as shown by the CMA blocking Microsoft\u2019s takeover of Activision Blizzard. Rising interest rates pushed more companies to collapse across England and Wales in May, explains David Kelly, head of insolvency at PwC. \u201cToday\u2019s data shows that the number of insolvencies in May has shot up, following a brief dip in April due to the Easter break. The 2,552 insolvencies is the highest monthly number we\u2019ve seen this year so far and, given that trading conditions remain extremely challenging, the number will likely continue to climb through the second half of the year. \u201cIn addition, rising interest rates have been a blow to struggling businesses, with the potential for more pain when the Bank of England meets next week to decide the base rate. For small businesses in particular, these higher rates make it increasingly difficult to take on and finance debt, with many having to use their emergency cash reserves to do so, thus intensifying liquidity issues. As such, we\u2019re seeing an uptick in the number of firms needing debt restructuring services and looking at ways to compromise their existing on and off balance sheet liabilities. \u201cApproximately 99% of liquidations in the first quarter of this year have related to companies with annual turnover of less than \u00a31m. As both interest rates and inflation look set to remain high in the short term, our analysis indicates that this trend will persist, with smaller businesses continuing to come under the most pressure.\u201d Nick O\u2019Reilly, Director of Restructuring and Recovery at accountancy group MHA, argues that the rise in insolvencies (see last post) is down to the fallout from a lack of due diligence over the Government\u2019s Covid loan scheme: O\u2019Reilly says the majority of companies entering administration will be those that would have failed, if Covid-19 never happened, but were kept afloat by support: \u201cThe UK is suffering the consequences of the government\u2019s reckless Covid-19 loan scheme, with greater numbers of companies now failing who were previously propped up during the pandemic by government lending. \u201cThe government\u2019s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemes and Future Funds should have served companies who had the ability to survive and with adequate cash reserves. Instead loans were given to anyone who asked, regardless of whether they could pay them back. Three years after the pandemic began, high inflation, burdensome energy prices and low consumer confidence has prevented millions of businesses from recovering, with many now facing the wall. Newsflash: Company insolvencies in England and Wales have jumped by 40% year-on-year There were 2,552 registered company insolvencies in May, new statistics from the Insolvency Service show, up from 1,825 in May 2022. It\u2019s also an increase on April, when 1,688 insolvences in England and Wales were reported. This is \u201chigher than levels seen while the Government support measures were in place in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and also higher than pre-pandemic numbers\u201d, the report says. There were 189 compulsory liquidations in May 2023, 34% higher than in May 2022, as more companies collapse under the strain of rising costs and higher interest rates. The number of Creditors\u2019 Voluntary Liquidations (where directors opt to wind up an insolvent company with no prospect of recovery) rose by38% to 2,181. The Insolvency Service explains: Numbers of compulsory liquidations have increased from historical lows seen during the coronavirus pandemic, partly as a result of an increase in winding-up petitions presented by HMRC. A support package for mortgage holders would be a mistake, says Tim Pitt of consultancy Flint, a former senior adviser to former chancellors Philip Hammond and Sajid Javid. Pitt argues it would undermine the transmission of monetary policy (the process by which higher interest rates reach the economy), would unfairly help wealthier people, distort the housing market, and be a poor use of fiscal resources. Deutsche Bank expects the Bank of England to hike Bank Rate for a thirteenth consecutive meeting next Thursday, by a quarter-point to 4.75%. But the decision by the monetary policy committee probably won\u2019t be unanimous; they predict a 7-2 vote tally, with both Silvana Tenreyro and Swati Dhingra voting to keep rates on hold. Deutsche then expect two further rate hikes taking Bank Rate to 5.25% in September, before a pause in November. Senior economist Sanjay Raja explains: Inflation, we think, will continue to remain volatile and skewed to stronger prints in the near-term. And the labour market will also likely remain hot in the very near-term as the ONS incorporates more of the forthcoming pay deals into the hard data. We do, however, see downside risks emerging from late Q3 to early Q4, allowing the MPC to push the pause button at the November meeting. If mortgage rates do hit 6% thent homeowners will be spending 23.6% of their incomes on mortgage repayments, the most since 1991, Neal Hudson, a property market analyst at BuiltPlace, has calculated (via The Times). He\u2019s also made this excellent chart, showing how effective mortgage costs are close to their levels in the 1980s even though interest rates are lower: (because mortgage are much bigger today, meaning repayments are a large bite of income). Economists at RSM, the accountancy group, have predicted this morning that UK interest rates will peak at 5%. That\u2019s half a percentage point higher than today, but lower than the 5.75% peak currently implied in the money markets. RSM argue that falling fuel, energy and food prices on the international markets will pull UK inflation down to 4% by the end of this year (hitting the government\u2019s target of halving it). That means the case for further rate hikes becomes a bit less convincing, argues RSM economist Thomas Pugh. He says: \u2018Another two interest rate hikes seem likely, which would take interest rates to 5%. It would, therefore, seem sensible for the MPC to take a hawkish pause in much the same way that the Fed did on Wednesday. This would allow the MPC to examine the impact of its previous rate hikes, while giving it the option to hike further if needed. \u2018As it happens, we think by September it will become clear that inflation is on a steep downward track and that enough slack has emerged in the labour market for the MPC to stop its tightening cycle at 5%. However, the risks are definitely weighted toward intertest rates going higher. Financial markets are probably \u201cover-egging\u201d the chances that rates reach 6%, Pugh says, cautioning \u201cbut don\u2019t rule it out\u201d\u2026. Homeowners are spending a bigger slice of their income on mortgage repayments than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008 as rates continue to rise towards 6%, The Times reports this morning. They explain: Mortgage repayments on new loans made up 20.4 per cent of borrowers\u2019 incomes on average between January and April, according to the trade association UK Finance. This is up from under 17 per cent in 2020 and the largest percentage since November 2008. There are \u201cencouraging early signs\u201d that food price inflation is starting to ease, according to the boss of Tesco. Tesco CEO Ken Murphy told reporters this morning: \u201cWe do believe that we\u2019re past the peak inflation.\u201d That would cheer the Bank of England, as it weighs up how high interest rates must rise to fight the cost of living crisis. Murphy also claimed the BoE has been unfair in blaming supermarkets for Britain\u2019s stubbornly high inflation level. Asked if he believed the Bank of England was being unfair in calling out the industry, Murphy said: \u201cYes I do.\u201d Murphy was speaking after Tesco reported a 9% rise in UK sales in the 13 weeks to 27 May. Britain\u2019s largest supermarket says it has \u201cled the way\u201d in cutting prices on everyday essential items, amid criticism of the retail sector for price rises. UK building supplier housebuilder Travis Perkins has warned its profits will miss expectations, in a sign that difficulties are building in the UK housing market. Travis Perkins has 1,400 branches around the UK, and says it is the country\u2019s largest distributor of building materials, supplying cement, bricks, roof tiles, tools, plumbing, heating kit and electricals products to constructors. But this morning, the company warns that the housing market is being hit by higher interest rates and weaker consumer confidence. In light of ongoing challenging market conditions, full year adjusted operating profits are now expected to be around \u00a3240m, missing the \u00a3266m which the City expected. It told shareholders: The Group delivered a resilient performance in the first quarter but has not seen the anticipated easing of market conditions in the second quarter to date. Volumes in both the new build housing and private domestic RMI [repair, maintenance, and improvement] markets continue to be impacted by higher interest rates and weaker consumer confidence driven by persistent, higher than anticipated consumer price inflation. Shares in Travis Perkins have fallen over 6% in early trading, while housebuilder Barratt Development has dipped 1.5%. In the City, the pound has hit a new one-year high above $1.28 agains the US dollar. The rally, to the highest level since April 2022, comes as traders anticipate further increases in UK interest rates, while America\u2019s central bank paused its rate increases on Wednesday. My colleague Hilary Osborne has examined what support the government could prove. It could, for example, widen the existing support for people on benefits who are struggling to meet their monthly mortgage payments. Tax relief on mortgage payments could potentially be brought back, which would provide financial relief to borrowers, or lenders could be urged to exercise more forbearance rather than repossessing homes. Or (and this is rather unlikely), the government could take control of interest rates back off the Bank of England. At this stage, though, the government has been backing the BoE as it tries to tame inflation. Here\u2019s the full piece: Atom Bank is also lifting its mortage rates today \u2013 by between 0.25% to 0.6% on certain products. Mark Mullen, Atom\u2019s chief executive, says the bank raised rates because the financial markets are pricing in further increases in Bank of England base rate. Mullen isn\u2019t sure that UK interest rates will hit 6%, as some have forecasts, but believes we are in a higher rate environment: I think that the current interest rate environment is likely to remain there-or-there abouts where we are today for much longer than perhaps people might wish. Q: So do home owners and borrowers need support, as the Liberal Democrats are calling for? Mullen says they do, adding that support can take many forms. As well as the interest rate environment, but also, \u201cwhat are banks doing to help them in their savings rates?\u201d and are they helping customers before they miss mortgage repayments, Mullen asks. So there\u2019s lots that banks can do, but sure, they absolutely needs support. Q: But when public finances are strained, is it right to give money to people who have borrowed money to buy a house? Mullen warns that people who took out mortgages a few years are going to \u201cget a shock\u201d when they remortgage, and move onto a rather higher rate. The reality is there\u2019s pain all around in a high-inflationary environment. Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, is calling for a \u00a33bn emergency mortgage protection fund to protect people who would otherwise be repossessed. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Davey says the government should provide the kind of help that was available after the last financial crisis. Davey explains: We\u2019ve already seen the number of people\u2019s homes been reposessed going up massively \u2013 surging by 50% in the latest quarter, and my worry is that we\u2019re going to see lots of other families losing their homes, and we could be in a spiral of repossessions. The banks have got to play a bigger role. They need to step in and help people who are in trouble. But just as there was before, there needs to be more protection for those who are really suffering and the government just aren\u2019t doing that. Q: But this would be regressive \u2013 people who don\u2019t own homes shouldn\u2019t support those who do? It would heat up demand, when the Bank of England is trying to cool it, and aren\u2019t there better uses of public money? Plus, lax monetary policy has helped people who own assets\u2026 Davey says the Lib Dems\u2019 proposal is \u201cquite targeted and time-limited\u201d and it will get help to people who would otherwise lose their homes. If we don\u2019t give that sort of help to those people, you\u2019d see a spiral down and it will hit the whole economy. He adds that there also needs to be more support for carers, and for renters \u201cwho are getting a really poor deal\u201d. Davey argues that MPs should spend next Monday debating the cost of living crisis, not all day debating Boris Johnson following yesterday\u2019s privileges committee report. Davey says: We should spend the day thinking about how we help people, whether it\u2019s the Liberal Democrat idea of a mortgage protection fund, our proposals to help people with energy bills\u2026 We need to help people. Families and pensioners, millions of them are struggling and the Conservatives are just failing because of their chaos. Q: You\u2019re proposing spending \u00a33bn to help people who borrowed to buy homes, when many people can\u2019t afford to, and younger people are looking forward to a housing crash so they can get onto the housing latter. What does that say about your priorities? Davey says the Liberal Democrats want to reverse the tax cuts given to the banks in the last few years, and use some of that extra money to help people who would otherwise lose their homes. This isn\u2019t their only policy, he points out \u2013 citing the need to invest in the health service so the UK has enough GPs, and to tackle the wider cost of living crisis. But if we don\u2019t tackle the mortgage crisis, it\u2019s going to see a spiral downwards. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK mortgage rates are heading towards 6% as the squeeze on borrowers tightens \u2013 prompting calls for the government to provide emergency help. The average rate on a two-year fixed mortgages rose to 5.92% yesterday, up from 5.9% on Wednesday, and 5.26% at the start of last month. Average five-year fixed rate mortgage rates hit 5.56 per cent, up from 5.54% 24 hours earlier \u2013 and 4.97% at the beginning of May. Nationwide, the building society, is joining the rush to raise rates today \u2013 increasing its new fixed rates by up to 0.7 percentage points. These moves come as City traders predict UK interest rates could hit 5.75% by the end of this year, up from 4.5% today. The Bank of England seems certain to raise interest rates next week. The yield (or interest rate) on two-year government bonds \u2013 used to price fixed-term mortgages \u2013 is trading at 15-year highs this week. Although rates are below their levels before the 1990s housing crash, mortgages today are much higher \u2013 and mortgage payments make up a larger slice of people\u2019s income. So, the squeeze is already the worst since the early 90s, analysts say: The Liberal Democrats are calling for an emergency support fund for mortgage borrowers, which would provide temporary grants to those most at risk of losing their homes. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney MP said earlier this week: \u201cThis Conservative government has unleashed mortgage hell for millions of homeowners but isn\u2019t lifting a finger to help. \u201cRishi Sunak is totally out of touch with the concerns of people across the country worried sick about how they will afford their monthly mortgage payments. \u201cThe Prime Minister should haul the banks into Downing Street and discuss what extra support can be given to homeowners on the brink. The very least that Conservative Ministers should do is take responsibility for the mess they\u2019ve created instead of sitting on the sidelines.\u201d The inflation squeeze in the eurozone prompted the European Central Bank to lift its interest rates again yesterday. But earlier today, the Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-easy monetary policy even though Japanese inflation is higher than expected. The BoJ signalled it would focus on supporting Japan\u2019s fragile economic recovery, and remains confident that inflation will slow later this year.

The building is across the street from the empty LA convention centre which, in Junes gone by, would have been the thronging heart of the games industry universe. But that universe has changed irrevocably over the past two years. Things have to be done differently now \u2013 the future is uncertain. Nobody knows that better than Spencer. Earlier today, he\u2019d hosted a live showing of the Xbox 2023 Showcase in this auditorium, the seats packed with members of the Xbox fanbase. It was a raucous two hours of whooping and cheering, but Xbox has ground to make up. \u201c2022 was a light year,\u201d Spencer says, before instantly checking himself. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a positive way to put it.\u201d A few weeks ago, he gave a downbeat interview to the Kinda Funny podcast, in which he referred to Xbox as being third in the console market and poured scorn on the idea that a perfect Starfield game could convert PS5 owners to Xbox. A few skeptics saw this as his way of hitting back at the regulators stalling Microsoft\u2019s purchase of Activision, calling it anti-competitive. Others saw in it the honesty he\u2019s always tried to bring to his comms. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I did a great job,\u201d he says of the chat. \u201cMy fundamental point was that we\u2019re not here to grow at the expense of the other players. Our plan is to help grow the industry and obviously to get our share of that growth. Sometimes from members of the press, definitely from members of the community \u2026 you need your Spider-Man, you need your God of War, you need to go create a movie or a television series that\u2019s as good as The Last of Us. And what I try to get through to people \u2013 and I don\u2019t always do it the best way \u2013 is that\u2019s not our strategy. If we\u2019re just growing and Sony\u2019s shrinking, that doesn\u2019t help anybody. Maybe if all you care about is Xbox success versus Sony\u2019s success, but in terms of an industry, it doesn\u2019t help Electronic Arts. It doesn\u2019t help Ubisoft, it doesn\u2019t help Fortnite. It doesn\u2019t help anybody if all we\u2019re doing is trading one customer for another customer on a different console.\u201d \u201cThe part I didn\u2019t like about what I said was, quality games is critically important to our strategy. So it\u2019s not that Starfield getting at 11 out of 10 isn\u2019t our goal \u2013 although, that\u2019s a silly way of putting it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna use review scores as the mark of all quality. But making the best Starfield is absolutely our goal. I want to build the absolute best games we can.\u201d The show went well today. Almost 30 games, many on Game Pass, a third of them from first-party studios. Starfield, Fable, Forza and Flight Simulator, but also interesting new stuff like South of Midnight and Clockwork Revolution. The social media response has been positive \u2013 it\u2019s allowed Spencer to come into our interview with a more bullish mood. \u201cI knew that our first party was gonna be strong,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have over 20 studios, and it was somewhat expected that they would get up to speed after Covid and get their product coming out. We knew the flow coming out of both Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios was gonna hit. I\u2019ll be honest, I always feel like we have a lot to live up to. The expectation of our customers is high. We know we didn\u2019t hit that bar in 2022 and we wanted to make sure we had a great show.\u201d One thing that popped up on the screen before all the first-party games was the message \u2018GamePass Day One.\u2019 The Xbox streaming service is clearly seen as integral. Sarah Bond, Xbox\u2019s head of devices, said during the panel discussion that many developers came back to the service after trialling it for the first time \u2013 it\u2019s allowed studios to be more experimental. But look across at the more mature TV streaming industry and we\u2019re now seeing a very different picture: bloated services carrying far too much mediocre content, shows getting canned after barely a season, falling subscriber figures, unhappy creators. Should read as a warning? \u201cLook at the stats,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cThe number of games that are in Game Pass relative to unique videos on Netflix is vastly, vastly different. I think we\u2019re somewhere between 300 and 400 games. It\u2019s still a lot, but we\u2019re not trying to inundate you. When I get negative feedback on Game Pass, it\u2019s when quality isn\u2019t what people expected. But then there\u2019s a marginal cost for them in trying something they would\u2019ve never tried before. If there\u2019s any signal, it\u2019s how are our players feeling \u2013 how\u2019s the subscriber number going, and are creators coming back? Game Pass creates this interesting content fund for us to go out and work with partners early on in their progress. I wouldn\u2019t call [Game Pass] a minimum guarantee, but we\u2019re obviously signing up when they launch that there\u2019s money coming from the content fund, which then has them maybe aspire to do something a little different. I love that \u2013 I wanna see creativity from the creators.\u201d There\u2019s an interesting friction between Spencer\u2019s view of the games industry as inevitably evolving \u2013 new business models, new developers, new countries, new platforms \u2013 and the nostalgia of the Xbox fanbase. Veterans will often look back at the Xbox 360 era as the glory days of the machine, leading the industry with its excellent games and groundbreaking online multiplayer functionality. Xbox One possibly never recovered from its disastrous opening \u2013 employees still shudder about it to this day. Spencer knows how to present himself as a typical gamer and how to romanticise the past: during the panel discussion, he speaks of playing games throughout his childhood and his industry start at Computer Mart in Vancouver, Washington. But he also knows the future of Xbox isn\u2019t backward-looking. \u201cOur business right now, from a revenue standpoint, is about twice the size as it was in the Xbox 360 generation. And we\u2019re millions of consoles ahead of where we would\u2019ve been compared to 360. We\u2019ve never had more Xbox players than we have right now.\u201d Xbox has to exist beyond the box itself, beyond the console, if it\u2019s going to survive. It has to be on PC, on mobile, on tablets and on set-top boxes \u2013 because in order to grow the audience for games, games have to be available to people who don\u2019t want or can\u2019t afford a black box under their TV. But that doesn\u2019t mean the console is going anywhere. \u201cWe know that for players, especially Xbox players, where we come from is people sitting in front of their television with a console plugged in,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cIt\u2019s what developers are targeting. It\u2019s what so many of us play. Like, \u2018Box\u2019 is in the name of our product, right? That console is critical to what we\u2019re building. But it\u2019s not the only thing we\u2019re going to focus on. We\u2019re going to focus on allowing player choice.\u201d It may be a symbol of how Xbox is looking to evolve that Halo wasn\u2019t present at all today, I said \u2013 that would have been unthinkable in the Xbox 360 era. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Halo is of lesser importance, but we have over 20 studios now,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the years where I had basically four games \u2013 Fable, Forza, Halo, Gears, the four horseman of the apocalypse. We have a lot more games now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty public about the leadership change at 343,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can kind of see that in some of the social things [the team have] been doing around seasons, but I don\u2019t wanna force them to talk about their longer-term vision until they\u2019re ready. I think you\u2019ll see some pretty cool things coming. The PR rep who has sat in on our interview quietly signals to me that it\u2019s almost over. Whatever the future of the industry, it\u2019s happening outside the empty auditorium we\u2019re sitting in. \u201cOne of the things we do on these kind of shows is run analysis of what are people interested in, we kind of track it,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cIt always makes me chuckle \u2013 maybe this is kind of my own ego check, how many people have absolutely zero idea who I am. Which is fine. Most people who play video games do not know the relationship of game to studio to publisher to platform. Most people who play just want to find a great game.\u201d Stepping outside, the vast walls of the Hotel Figuoera are visible just across the street. During E3, they were always emblazoned with gigantic video game murals: GTA V, Fallout, Doom. Now, it\u2019s the Transformers movie.

In a video posted on Twitter, he says it will be \u201ccompletely unexpurgated stuff\u201d. But he jokes about covering politics \u201cas little as possible\u201d, implying it won\u2019t be entirely Westminster focused. He also says the column is going to be \u201cexactly what I think\u201d. This may present a challenge. In their excellent book Johnson at 10, Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell say that one of the many problems Johnson had as a prime minister was that he kept changing his mind. They quote one official as saying: He wildly oscillated in what he thought. In one day he would have three meetings in which he would say three completely different things depending on who was present, and then deny that he had changed his position. It became difficult when he took a decision to know whether it would hold, and how much importance to give it, because so often he changed his mind, even on Covid. Sir James Duddridge, the former parliamentary private secretary to Boris Johnson, has gone public with a version of a message from the former PM to his supporters this morning, urging them not to vote against the privileges committee report. (See 11.47am.) He has told Politico that \u201cpeople just want to move on\u201d. This is from Politico\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio. No 10 has said that the government will not be taking a view on the privileges committee report into Boris Johnson, because it is a matter for individual MPs. Rishi Sunak did not express a view on the matter yesterday. He gave an interview earlier yesterday morning, before the report was published, when he said he had not read it. Asked if he would give another interview later when he had read it, he was evasive. This morning a No 10 spokesperson said Sunak had still not had time to read the report properly. He said: [The PM] was in meetings all yesterday and continues to have meetings today. So he hasn\u2019t fully had time to consider the report \u2026 The prime minister takes these processes very seriously, which is why he intends to take the time to study the report closely. But the spokesperson said Sunak would not be endorsing the report on behalf of the government because the vote was a matter for individual MPs (there is a free vote). He said: The prime minister doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to express a government view or a view on behalf of the government given that it\u2019s a matter for individual MPs and MPs have a free vote on this on Monday. The spokesperson also declined to say whether Sunak would be present for the vote on Monday. Sunak is in a quandary because, if he were to endorse the report, he would infuriate Johnson\u2019s supporters among the Conservative party membership and (more importantly, from No 10\u2019s perspective) in the Tory media. He might upset some Tory MPs too, thought probably not very many. But if Sunak were to criticise the report, he would be undermining the privileges committee process, and he would allow the opposition to associate him with Johnson\u2019s lying and rule breaking. It is normal for MPs to get a free vote on motions endorsing recommendations from the standards committee or the privileges committee, because these are seen as House of Commons matters, not party political matters. But the recommendations normally have widespread support, which means ministers are usually happy to say they are in favour. Boris Johnson\u2019s attitude towards the rules is continuing in his usual manner, if this morning\u2019s reports (see 9.24am) that he is to join the Daily Mail as its \u201cerudite new columnist\u201d said to be on a \u201cvery high six-figure sum\u201d are accurate. Until September 2024, Johnson is required under government rules to seek advice from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) before taking up any new roles. But this morning, Acoba told the Guardian that it had not received an application from the former prime minister and would be writing to him on the matter. Johnson has previously faced censure from Acoba for failing to seek advice from the committee before joining the Telegraph, then on a salary of \u00a3275,000, after he resigned as Theresa May\u2019s foreign secretary. New rules introduced after work carried out during Johnson\u2019s premiership mean Acoba is consulted as part of the propriety checks on those nominated for honours and peerages, to examine if those in line for gongs have studiously sought Acoba\u2019s advice in line with the rules. These new rules don\u2019t apply, however, to those who made the nominations in the first place. According to the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford, Boris Johnson is urging his supporters not to vote against the privileges committee report into his conduct. Yes, that is the same report that Johnson denounced yesterday as \u201ca load of complete tripe\u201d and part of a \u201cprotracted political assassination\u201d. A source in the Johnson camp has confirmed that Swinford\u2019s tweet is correct, arguing that the vote has \u201cno practical effect\u201d anyway. As discussed yesterday, there is better reason for Johnson not wanting a division on the motion on Monday night; his support in the Conservative parliamentary party is now very limited, and a division might expose just how diminished the Johnsonite faction has become. Only a handful or so of Tory MPs have publicly said they want to vote against the report. When Johnson last led a parliamentary rebellion, over the Windsor framework, only 21 other Tories voted with him. Perhaps there are a few more who might back him this time. But they would be defending a politician unpopular with the public at large, and there is a real risk that, if there were a division, Johnson could end up with fewer Tories voting against disciplinary action against him than the 32 who voted against the ex-SNP MP Margaret Ferrier being suspended. Having less support among Conservatives than a Scottish nationalist would not be a good look. Also, the government whips will be delighted if there is no division. Perhaps Johnson wants to repair relations with No 10 a bit. The Johnson source is wrong to say the motion will have no practical effect. If passed, it will result in Johnson not being entitled to the normal pass issued to an ex-MP giving them access to the parliamentary estate. But Johnson had not been spending much time in parliament anyway. He is not being banned from the estate; he can always come in as a guest of someone. With the Daily Mail set to announce him as a columnist (see 9.24am), perhaps he might even apply for a press pass. I\u2019m sure we could find a desk for him in the gallery. Yesterday Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, said he backed the privileges committee report into Boris Johnson. But that is not enough for the SNP. Mhairi Black, its deputy leader at Westminster, says Ross should whip all Scottish Tory MPs to vote to approve the report. In a statement she says: Douglas Ross must finally grow a backbone and whip his MPs to vote for tough sanctions against his disgraced former leader Boris Johnson. Drivers at two train operators will take industrial action in disputes separate to the ongoing national row over pay, PA Media reports. PA says: Members of Aslef at Avanti West Coast will strike on 2 July, while drivers employed by London North Eastern Railway (LNER) will refuse to work overtime from July 1 until further notice. Aslef said the dispute with Avanti West Coast is over sick pay changes, which the company is accused of trying to \u201cforce through without agreement\u201d. LNER is accused of failing to adhere to \u201cagreed procedures\u201d. Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: \u201cIt is deeply regrettable that Aslef members have been forced to take this action but our members will not stand by and allow our agreed terms and conditions to be violated by the train operating companies. \u201cWe have been coming to the table to try to resolve these disputes for many months but unless the operators honour the agreements in place with our members, we will be forced to continue taking action.\u201d Sir Jake Berry, the Conservative party chair when Liz Truss was prime minister and a Boris Johnson supporter, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning that he would \u201ccertainly\u201d be voting against the privileges committee report on Monday. Explaining why, he said: I think both the conclusions and, to some extent, the way the committee was made up in terms of this report are wrong. Berry also said he was concerned about the way the committee was trying to close down criticism of its decisions. He said: For the first time in my parliamentary career, I\u2019m afraid to talk about a report or the findings of a committee of parliament, because they have threatened MPs that if they do so, they themselves will be subject to the sorts of sanctions. It\u2019s an attack on free speech. It\u2019s an absolute disgrace and it rather begs the question that if the committee is so certain and so happy with their findings, why are they trying to stop any debate on this, to gag MPs and prevent them talking about it. Berry was referring to a passage in the committee\u2019s report yesterday saying it would be publishing a follow-up report dealing with MPs, and others, who have sought to undermine the inquiry into Johnson. It said it was concerned about \u201ca sustained attempt, seemingly coordinated, to undermine the committee\u2019s credibility and, more worryingly, that of those members serving on it\u201d. This has led to Berry, and other Johnsonites, thinking or saying that they are at risk of being sanctioned for expressing any criticism of the committee\u2019s report. The committee itself has not said what criticism is, and is not, legitimate. But it is not hard to work out roughly what it will say when it publishes its follow-up report. MPs are always free to criticise the findings of committees, including disciplinary committees like the privileges ones. But what it problematic is to impute bad faith. In other words, it is okay to say the committee got it wrong; but to say it got it wrong because it is biased or a kangaroo court etc, could take an MP into contempt of parliament territory. Much more serious were the threats directed at MPs serving on the committee. At one point Conservative Post, an obscure Tory website linked to the pro-Johnsonite Conservative Democratic Organisation, was urging its readers to write to the Tory members of the privileges committee telling them to stand down from the inquiry. There was an implicit hint they were at risk of deselection if they didn\u2019t. Trying to intimidate members of a Commons committee carrying out an inquiry definitely counts as a contempt of parliament, and it is this sort of conduct that the follow-up report is likely to deprecate strongly. This is from Jonathan Yerushalmy, who has been looking at how the papers have been covering the privileges committee report into Boris Johnson. In his Today programme interview Damian Green, the Tory former first secretary of state, also suggested that Boris Johnson should not be allowed to stand as a candidate for the party again. Asked if he would be in favour of that, Green replied: I think it will be quite difficult \u2026 I think if he had been more temperate in his response [to the privileges committee report], it would be easier for him to have a way back into active politics. But he\u2019s chosen to use phrases like \u2018kangaroo court\u2019\u201d and \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, and described the report as deranged, and that inevitably puts into question the integrity of people who have great integrity, the people who sit on the committee. This is also contention because Johnson\u2019s supporters would react with fury if Rishi Sunak were to declare that Johnson could not be a candidate again. In the Mail on Sunday at the weekend Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary and prominent Johnson cheerleader, wrote: I would most strongly warn Conservative party managers against any attempt to block Boris if he seeks the party nomination in another seat. Any attempt to do so would shatter our fragile party unity and plunge the Conservatives into civil war. Sunak probably has no intention of allowing Johnson to stand as a candidate again at or before the general election, but he is unlikely to say this publicly, at least in the near future. It is one of those questions that can be dismissed as hypothetical. Good morning. Boris Johnson is out of parliament, but Conservative party attempts to consign him to history don\u2019t seem to be working out too well and this morning Politico reports that he is indeed the mystery \u201cerudite\u201d columnist who will start writing for the Daily Mail tomorrow. This is not good news for Rishi Sunak. The Mail is the most powerful voice in the Tory media ecosystem, and Johnson is someone whose best hopes of a political comeback depend on Sunak failing. When he was writing a weekly Daily Telegraph column before becoming PM, Johnson was paid \u00a3275,000 a year. Being at No 10 for three years has increased his earnings power considerably, and according to Politico he is being paid a \u201cvery high six-figure sum\u201d for the Mail gig. At least someone did well out of the Johnson premiership. The Conservative party is now preoccupied by the debate on the Johnson privileges committee report on Monday, and the issue of how MPs will vote on the motion to approve its conclusions and recommendations. Tory MPs will be on a one-line whip, which means attendance is voluntary, and it is assumed that most of them will stay away, and let it get approved on opposition votes. Yesterday No 10 refused to say whether Sunak would be in the Commons on Monday, and it is widely assumed that he will discover a pressing engagement in his diary that makes him unable to attend. But this morning Damian Green, a former first secretary of state, told the Today programme that Sunak, and other Tory MPs, should vote in favour of the report instead of abstaining, because it was important to support the privileges committee process. He said: At the moment I intend to vote for it because I think it\u2019s important that parliament respects its own systems. We have set up this committee, asked them to do this very serious report, they\u2019ve come up with what is clearly a fairly damning set of conclusions, and I think if we, as parliament, run away from that, then it calls into question whether we should carry on having this kind of self regulation or whether it shouldn\u2019t all be outsourced to other people. And that would be a very serious step. Asked if that meant it was important for Sunak to vote for the report, Green said that every MP would have to make up their own mind and he conceded that the PM was the \u201cbusiest\u201d of all MPs. But he also said: I think, personally, it\u2019s such an important act that deliberately abstaining is not really rising to the importance of the occasion. Clearly, it is very, very unusual, if not unique, to have this kind of report on a former prime minister. As Peter Walker and Sammy Gecsoyler report, Johnson\u2019s supporters are threatening to try to deselect Tories who do follow Green\u2019s advice and back the report. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Prof Sir Michael Marmot and Prof Clare Bambra, who are both public health experts, give evidence to the Covid inquiry. At 2pm Katharine Hammond former director of the civil contingencies secretariat at the Cabinet Office, will give evidence. 11.30pm: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 12pm: Plaid Cymru holds a press conference to announce where Rhun ap Iorwerth is due to be confirmed as its new leader.

Though he officially entered politics only in 1994, his cultural hegemony began long before. From the early 80s, Berlusconi ruled Italy by means of entertainment, managing political life the same way he did his media conglomerates, translating Reaganite hedonism into Italian. His private TV channels changed the tastes of Italian audiences by bringing the action-filled dreams of American capitalism into their living rooms. The fuel that propelled the early days of Berlusconi\u2019s Mediaset empire was cinema, mostly American cinema. The budget for original content was limited, so pay TV filled programming schedules with films. Films that, back then, one could not see on other channels. For more than two decades, Mediaset successfully challenged the state television monopoly, thereby paving the way for the privatisation of everyday life. With the expediency of a pirate, he steered the nation away from the cinema of Fellini and Antonioni, towards the inexorable Americanisation of mass culture. Berlusconi went on to bring the colours and intoxicating freedom of consumer choice to wider Italian TV culture. Previously Italians could only choose from three public TV channels. RAI, the state broadcaster, hired the likes of Umberto Eco and avant garde composer Luciano Berio, while Berlusconi pied-pipered viewers with scantily clad women, quizshows and generous amounts of advertising. In 1981 Mediaset (then still called Fininvest) acquired the CBS soap opera Dallas and turned it into an audience favourite. Another golden acquisition was that of the TV host Mike Bongiorno, who Berlusconi bought from RAI in 1979. Born in the US to parents of Italian descent, Bongiorno became famous in the early days of Italian television for adapting popular American formats such as The $64,000 Question, Jeopardy and, after he started working for Berlusconi, The Wheel of Fortune. Crucial to Berlusconi\u2019s mass-media ascendancy was the figure of Antonio Ricci, a TV writer and showrunner who, in the words of Variety, \u201cwith his penchant for comedy and variety, changed the face of Italian television\u201d. State television programming up to then had appealed to a wide, inter-generational audience, Ricci\u2019s shows attracted younger spectators. His series \u2013 such as Drive In, Lupo Solitario and Striscia la Notizia \u2013 had a new rhythm: catchier, funnier and flashier, allowing for more commercial breaks whose tones and aesthetics seamlessly blended into his programmes. A post-ideological Italy enchanted by wealth, notoriety and status-seeking ambitions was immortalised in and moulded by Mediaset\u2019s programmes. It might not have been a pretty sight, but it was a very popular one. Anticipating the Netflix model, Berlusconi then started producing films to fill his own TV channels with. In the early 90s he entered a partnership with Vittorio Cecchi Gori and went on to produce films by Lucio Fulci, Bernardo Bertolucci, Ettore Scola, Giuseppe Tornatore and Franco Zeffirelli. Faced with the very concrete risk of ending up in jail due to his not-always-transparent business conduct, Berlusconi entered politics to seek parliamentary immunity. It worked. And his previous experience in entertainment proved vital: he surfed the rotten waters of Italian politics and brought neo-fascists out of the sewers and into parliament for the first time since the second world war. Now these same neo-fascists are ruling the country after being democratically elected. Berlusconi\u2019s last show was his own state funeral which Italians were able to watch, needless to say, on television."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a63f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/15/tornadoes-perryton-north-texas-one-dead-75-injured", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Three people killed and one missing after tornadoes strike Texas town", "lead": "Homes in Perryton, 110 miles north of Amarillo, reduced to rubble and power was cut in the aftermath of the storm", "author": "Guardian staff and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 12:14:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111307", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d16e73f1fbc6ddc00ca699bcf1ba888c8d042019/0_108_2686_1612/500.jpg", "body": "Search and rescue crews will resume searching on Friday for at least one person missing in the north Texas town of Perryton after it was struck by one or more tornados that killed three people and sent up to 100 more to the hospital on Thursday evening, some in critical condition.

Perryton fire chief Paul Dutcher told ABC News that at least one person was killed in a mobile home park that took a \u201cdirect hit\u201d from a tornado. Local KVII-TV reported that at least 30 trailers had been damaged or destroyed in Perryton and that firefighters were still rescuing victims at 6pm local time.

As the sun rose on Friday, a car could be seen upside down inside the torn remains of a home and at least 200 structures were damaged, ABC\u2019s Good Morning America reported, including some homes reduced to a heap of sticks and stones. First responders from surrounding areas and from Oklahoma descended on the town late on Thursday, which is home to more than 8,000 people and about 115 miles northeast of Amarillo, just south of the Oklahoma line. \u201cOur crews are arriving on site and are assisting in removing lines from cars and across the roads,\u201d Xcel Energy said in a statement.

Patients had minor to major trauma, ranging from \u201chead injuries to collapsed lungs, lacerations, broken bones,\u201d she said. By evening, the weather front was moving south-east across Oklahoma. The weather service said a second round of storms would continue to move through that state and parts of Texas through the evening while the risk of severe weather, including tornados, remained for the metropolitan Oklahoma City area and more severe weather is expected across the south over the weekend. It was the second day in a row that powerful storms struck the US. On Wednesday, strong winds toppled trees, damaged buildings and blew cars off a highway from the eastern part of Texas to Georgia. Felecia Bowser, at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida, said the widespread storm system raging inland in the region was unprecedented this early in the summer.

All levels of staff and management face an uncertain future until it is decided who is to own United and what their policies will be. Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, a Qatari banker, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos\u2019s owner, are the only two publicly declared prospective purchasers. Sheikh Jassim wishes to buy United outright, whereas Ratcliffe\u2019s intent is to acquire a little over a 50% controlling interest. On Thursday a document at Companies House emerged which showed Sheikh Jassim\u2019s vehicle for becoming the proprietor, Nine Two Holdings, had been registered in the UK. This is in preparation for a potential takeover. On the same day Reuters reported that United were negotiating granting exclusivity to Sheikh Jassim regarding a sale. That was interpreted in some quarters as an attempt to bring a new bid from Ratcliffe. It is understood neither Sheikh Jassim nor Ratcliffe is clear on how the process will develop from here.

It is expecting even more this summer after a star turn in David Attenborough\u2019s documentary series Wild Isles that showed two red deer stags locked in a dramatic battle for a harem of females. Some Irish environmentalists, however, say the park in the heart of County Kerry is also home to a much darker phenomenon: a slow-motion ecological calamity. Rhododendron, sika deer and other invasive alien species are asphyxiating the ecosystem, creating \u201cghost forests\u201d, they say. \u201cKillarney national park is an ecological disaster zone,\u201d said Eoghan Daltun, a rewilding activist and author who owns a nearby farm. \u201cYou have zero natural regeneration of trees. It contains what is by far Ireland\u2019s most important remaining piece of indigenous woodland and it\u2019s being allowed to just essentially die off.\u201d That may sound alarmist \u2013 but other activists as well as scientists and official reports agree there is a problem. \u201cThe great rhododendron disaster has taken place while Killarney is in the hands of the Irish nation,\u201d Daniel Kelly, emeritus professor in botany at Trinity College Dublin, told the Irish Times in 2019. The National Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages the park, published an independent review last year that noted \u201cimpressive improvements\u201d but also warned of an \u201calarming\u201d situation in the western woodlands. The biggest threat is Rhododendron ponticum, a tall, hardy shrub introduced from the Mediterranean in the 19th century. In Irish and British soil it spreads rapidly, blocks the sun, smothers other plants and kills oaks. It is almost impossible to eradicate. The dire warnings about Killarney reinforce wider concerns about Ireland\u2019s environmental record despite its green image. In the 1980s, more than 500 rivers and lakes had pristine water, now there are just 20, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres) of wetlands have been lost in the past two decades. The European Commission has brought Ireland to the European court of justice for inadequate prevention and management of invasive alien species, among other charges. Yet to hike through Killarney national park is glorious. Oaks soar, trout dart in streams. And if you are with \u00c9amonn Meskell, the experience is reassuring. He is the park\u2019s divisional manager and says his staff and contractors are prevailing. \u201cWe\u2019ve just turned the corner with rhododendron,\u201d he said during a tour last week. \u201cWe are the leaders in this now. We know how to kill it. We\u2019ve perfected our methods.\u201d In the first phase, workers with chainsaws topple the dense shrubs, drill into stumps and spray the controversial herbicide glyphosate. \u201cThe rhododendron was wall to wall here,\u201d said Meskell, in a part of the park called Reen. \u201cWe cleared a massive amount in 2007, it was like a war zone. Now look, stump,\u201d he said, pointing at a wizened stump. \u201cStump,\u201d pointing at another. \u201cStump, stump, stump.\u201d The crucial part is follow-up because almost inevitably some rhododendron will survive and within a few years bloom again, with each flower spreading up to 7,000 seeds, a task to rival that of Sisyphus. \u201cWith rhododendron there is no endgame, it\u2019s a labour-intensive effort to keep it under control,\u201d said Tim Cahalane, a conservation ranger. The strategy to keep cleared areas clear is to divide the park into 53 zones, monitor them with the help of a phone app and deploy contractors and volunteers as needed. As evidence of success, Meskell pointed out seedlings of oak, beech, birch and other trees in Reen, Cloghereen, Blue Pool and other parts of the park. \u201cIt\u2019s working. The woodland floor is coming back.\u201d For some critics of the National Parks and Wildlife Service this is a facade, concealing ruin. Since 2013, Groundwork, a local environmental group, has produced surveys with geo-tagged photographs showing reinfestation in woods that had previously been cleared. \u201cThe most valuable areas of the park have been allowed to regress; now there is no single woodland in the park that is under control,\u201d said Una Halpin, a veteran member. \u201cThe habitat is being allowed to deteriorate.\u201d Environmentalists want a severe cull of sika deer, whose grazing damages the forest floor and facilitates the spread of rhododendron, and greater focus on ancient woodland. Personal dynamics complicate the science. From 1981 to 2009, Groundwork volunteers cleared rhododendron \u2013 and kept it clear \u2013 from about 350 hectares of woodland. But relations with the parks service soured when managers widened the work to other areas, allegedly at the expense of safeguarding the priority woodlands. Amid accusation and counter-accusation, Groundwork stopped doing clearances. Meskell said he lamented the loss of its expertise and passion. \u201cIt\u2019s awful \u2013 here we are with the same objectives.\u201d Paddy Woodworth, an environmentalist and former Irish Times journalist, said park service clearances focused on areas visible to tourists. \u201cThe mature trees look beautiful but if rhododendron returns and the deer graze, the trees will die and there is no generation there to replace them. What you\u2019re looking at are ghost forests.\u201d Meskell rejected the accusations and said time would vindicate his strategy. In the meantime, he has another, more mundane concern: he fears amateur photographers seeking to emulate the Attenborough documentary will get too close to stags during the autumn rutting season. \u201cPeople without the experience coming here chancing their arm \u2013 frightful.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a642", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/16/nottingham-comes-together-to-mark-a-darkest-day", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018This city will not forget\u2019: Nottingham comes together to mark a \u2018darkest day\u2019", "lead": "Thousands attended a vigil in Old Market Square where families of attack victims addressed the crowd", "author": "Jessica Murray Midlands correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:58:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111363", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/32b9b374c2e3da397249c6355effddf626bfcd41/0_233_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "When the residents of Nottingham woke up on Tuesday morning to find police cordons scattered across the city, no one could have anticipated what had happened in the early hours. Then the horror gradually emerged \u2013 three people had been stabbed to death in the street and three others injured when a van mounted the pavement and mowed them down. As the front page of the Nottingham Post proclaimed on Wednesday, it would be remembered as one of the city\u2019s \u201cdarkest days\u201d. But the thousands of residents who packed Old Market Square on Thursday evening showed the true spirit of the city, with people from all walks of life coming to lay flowers and support the grieving families. \u201cThis is quite an extraordinary sight, but this is what this city does, it comes together,\u201d Bishop Paul Williams, from the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, told the crowd. Turning to the victims\u2019 families, he said: \u201cNottingham is not about to simply move on, and in one sense, we never will. We will not forget you, this city will not forget you.\u201d Two of the three killed, university students Barnaby Webber and Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar, had only lived in the city for a few months, but their parents attested to how much they had adored their new home. \u201cNottingham, he really loved you. He really, really loved you. We couldn\u2019t bloody get him home half the time,\u201d Emma Webber, Barnaby\u2019s mother, told the crowd. \u201cWhen he was accepted on his place to study here in only August of last year, he was so bloody chuffed.\u201d Webber, a history student and cricketer, was stabbed to death alongside medical student and star hockey player O\u2019Malley-Kumar as they were walking home from a night out, just minutes away from their university accommodation. \u201cShe did love Nottingham. When I asked her to come home last week she said she needed a few more \u2018sessions\u2019. This is one brilliant university town,\u201d said Grace\u2019s father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar. \u201cShe would have gone on to be a junior doctor serving you and your lovely city at the hospital, and that\u2019s been taken away from us.\u201d The message from all the speakers, at the vigil in the town centre and another at the University of Nottingham the day before, was clear \u2013 the actions of an individual would not be allowed to overshadow the city. Shujahat Aslam, chair of the Nottingham council of mosques, said: \u201cIt hurts as a parent whose kids go to university as well that we weren\u2019t able to look after their kids as our kids are looked after. That hurts so much. \u201cBut we have shown the world that Nottingham is truly one Nottingham, we come together as one community, caring, compassionate, hurt, but together.\u201d There were plenty of red Nottingham Forest football shirts in the vigil crowd, paying homage to school caretaker Ian Coates, who was killed on his way to work. A chorus of \u201cYou Reds\u201d erupted after his children paid tribute to their father. Ross Middleton, the head teacher at Huntingdon academy, where Coates worked as site manager, described how he \u201calways put the children first\u201d, whether it was through creating his \u201cshowstopping\u201d Christmas displays or helping year 3 with their sewing. On Friday, the sea of flowers, balloons, football shirts and cricket balls on the council house steps was growing, with many wiping away tears as they paid respects. Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham South, said the week had shown \u201cthe very best of Nottingham coming together\u201d. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge outpouring of love over the past few days across the whole city, and I think that\u2019s what exemplifies Nottingham.

The United Nations child rights committee found this week that the Peruvian authorities had violated the rights to health and life of the girl, known by the pseudonym Camila, by failing to provide her with information and access to legal and safe abortion. The Indigenous girl, from Apur\u00edmac, in the Peruvian highlands, had been sexually abused by her father since she was nine. \u201cI am appalled by the way in which a 13-year-old victim of rape and incest has been treated by national authorities,\u201d said Ann Skelton, chair of the UN committee. \u201cFar from being protected, given her extreme vulnerability, she was further re-victimised and harassed by health, police and judicial authorities. She was, in effect, turned from victim to offender,\u201d Skelton added. Abortion is a criminal offence in Peru except if there is a threat to the woman\u2019s life or a severe and permanent risk to her health. However, when Camila became pregnant in 2017 and was taken to a hospital in Abancay, she was not informed of her right to have a therapeutic abortion, despite repeatedly stating she did not want to have her father\u2019s child or be pregnant. When Camila and her mother requested a legal termination of the pregnancy, they received no response from either the prosecutor\u2019s office or the health authorities. Therapeutic abortion has been permitted in Peru since 1924. Camila had a miscarriage and was then charged and convicted of self-abortion based on no evidence other than her repeated statements that she did not wish to carry on with the pregnancy. \u201cShe was re-victimised in the health service by denying her an abortion,\u201d said Rossina Guerrero, the programme director at Promsex, the organisation that brought Camila\u2019s case before the UN committee in 2020. It claimed that her rights under the UN convention on the rights of the child had been violated. \u201cMoreover, nurses went with police officers to [Camila\u2019s] house to oblige her to go to a checkup when she had suffered a miscarriage. \u201cThe same prosecutor who was investigating her father for raping her then accused her of intentionally aborting and sought her prosecution. This only added to the severe impact on her mental health.\u201d The UN committee found that Camila was a victim of \u201cdiscrimination based on her age, gender, ethnic origin and social status\u201d given that her \u201crequest for an abortion was repeatedly ignored and her home and school were frequently invaded\u201d. It added that her \u201clack of access to safe abortion constituted differential treatment based on her gender, denying her access to a service essential to her health and punishing her for not complying with gender stereotypes about her reproductive role\u201d. It requested that Peru decriminalise abortion in all cases of child pregnancy and ensure access to safe abortion services and post-abortion care for pregnant girls. It is the third time the UN committee has found Peru violated the rights of adolescent girls. In one case, a 13-year-old, known as LC, was left paraplegic after trying to kill herself as a result of being made pregnant by her abuser. In the second case, 17-year-old KL was denied an abortion despite having an anencephalic foetus. The Peruvian ombudsman\u2019s office said women\u2019s emergency centres dealt with 2,388 rape cases involving girls and adolescents between January and April, or about 20 cases a day. Childbearing among girls aged between 10 and 14 has steadily risen in recent years. There was a 14% increase between 2021 and 2022, according to the UN Population Fund\u2019s map of adolescent pregnancy and motherhood in Peru."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a644", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/16/muse-review-sublimely-ridiculous-rocknroll-camp", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Muse review \u2013 sublimely ridiculous rock\u2019n\u2019roll camp", "lead": "With pyrotechnics that might tire a pyromaniac and a giant blow-up Satan the Devonian stadium-fillers have lost none of their thrilling pomp", "author": "Matt Mills", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:48:42", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111401", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3d022444fa9fa77c40e7eba67fee23da44730818/0_1636_6694_4016/500.jpg", "body": "Halfway through Muse\u2019s set, probably the daftest thing that Groupama Stadium has ever seen happens. Frontman Matt Bellamy is wearing shimmering silver while perched at a light-up piano and playing booming horror cliche Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach. Then his band break into You Make Me Feel Like It\u2019s Halloween, replete with a three-storey-tall masked, hooded face behind them, the video screen inside it alternating between Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger and other scary movie villains. It\u2019s the most high-budget display of rock\u2019n\u2019roll camp \u2013 yet the night will get madder from here. Outside this near-60,000 crowd, Muse aren\u2019t necessarily the coolest band in the world any more. It was as early as 2007 that the Devon trio ascended to this grandiose level: after megahits from Supermassive Black Hole to Starlight meshed pop-rock drama with calls for revolution just vague enough that both the left and right could rally behind them, they became the first band to sell out the new Wembley Stadium. Since then though, hit-and-miss albums such as last year\u2019s Will of the People have dented what was previously a bulletproof reputation for top-notch anthem-making. Fortunately, from 2007 to 2023, one thing remains consistent: Muse gigs revel in the sublimely ridiculous. Following You Make Me Feel Like It\u2019s Halloween\u2019s spooky pomp, Bellamy introduces Uprising by playing its synth melody on a Nintendo Power Glove attached to a suit coated in LEDs. We Are Fucking Fucked has its juvenile title complemented by the kind of production a 10-year-old on a sugar rush would mastermind: fire spews from the stage so frequently that it would overstimulate a pyromaniac. Then, finally, the encore of Kill Or Be Killed and Knights of Cydonia is backed by a blow-up bust of Satan so massive that its arms extend beyond the stadium stage. Sixteen years deep into filling football fields, Muse understand the assignment more than almost every other rock band. More is more and, even after feeding Lyon two hours of overblown theatre, they achieve the meteoric feat of making a 25-song extravaganza feel too short. \u2022 Muse\u2019s European tour returns to the UK at John Smith\u2019s Stadium, Huddersfield on 20 June."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a645", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/16/greece-shipwreck-people-smuggling-suspects-arrested-as-search-continues", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greece shipwreck: hopes of finding survivors fade on final day of search", "lead": "Nine suspects expected to face court as search enters third day and initial response to disaster is criticised", "author": "Helena Smith in Kalamata and Jon Henley", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:39:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111420", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2fca26166d01e0a95098b4a8012ce9dd8e763ae6/0_125_5088_3053/500.jpg", "body": "Rescuers have launched the third and final day of their search for survivors of one of the Mediterranean\u2019s worst boat disasters, as authorities detained nine suspected people-smugglers and criticism of Greece\u2019s initial response mounted. The Greek coastguard said on Friday a helicopter, a frigate and three smaller vessels were searching waters 50 miles (80 km) from the southern town of Pylos where the fishing boat, reportedly carrying between 400 and 750 people, sank on Wednesday. Greek authorities have confirmed 78 deaths and said 104 survivors \u2013 mostly from Syria, Egypt and Pakistan \u2013 have been brought ashore, but police believe as many as 500 are missing, with witnesses saying up to 100 children were in the ship\u2019s hold. Most of the survivors were being moved to shelters near Athens from a warehouse at the southern port of Kalamata. No more had been found since Wednesday and officials said the search would be halted later on Friday. \u201cHopes of finding survivors are fading each minute after this tragic sinking but the search must continue,\u201d said Stella Nanou of the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR. She said broadcast images and survivor accounts suggested \u201chundreds were aboard\u201d. The UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, on Friday called the disaster \u201ca horrific tragedy\u201d, adding that the loss of life underlined the need to bring people-smugglers to justice and calling on states to open up more regular migration channels. Authorities were holding nine of the survivors, all men of Egyptian descent, ranging in age from 20 to 40, on allegations of people-smuggling and participating in a criminal enterprise. Arrested on Thursday night, they are suspected of masterminding the illegal voyage to Italy from Tobruk in Libya, after first setting out from Egypt with the fishing trawler. \u201cThey are in custody and will appear before a local magistrate,\u201d Nikos Alexiou, the Hellenic coastguard spokesperson, told the Guardian. A public prosecutor is likely to press several charges against the group including mass murder. There were conflicting reports about whether the ship\u2019s captain was among those arrested, with some local media saying he had died when the vessel went down. Greek authorities were criticised for not acting earlier, despite a coastguard vessel escorting the boat for hours. Officials said people on the boat repeatedly refused assistance and insisted on continuing to Italy, but legal experts said that was no excuse. The Greek coastguard said it was notified of the boat\u2019s presence late on Tuesday morning and observed by helicopter that it was \u201csailing on a steady course\u201d at 6pm. A little later, someone on the boat was reached by satellite phone. The person said that the passengers needed food and water, but wanted to continue to Italy. \u201cIt was a fishing boat packed with people who refused our assistance because they wanted to go to Italy,\u201d Alexiou told Skai TV. \u201cWe stayed beside it in case it needed our assistance, which they had refused.\u201d Merchant ships delivered supplies and observed the vessel until early on Wednesday morning, when the satellite phone user reported a problem with the engine. About 40 minutes later, according to a coastguard statement, the boat began to rock violently and sank. Coastguard experts believe it may have run out of fuel or had engine trouble and that passengers moving inside caused it to list and capsize. Greece\u2019s caretaker minister for civil protection, Evangelos Tournas, said the coastguard could not intervene in international waters with a vessel refusing assistance. \u201cAn intervention by the coastguard could have placed an overloaded vessel in danger, which could capsize as a result,\u201d he said. However, Prof Erik R\u00f8s\u00e6g of the University of Oslo\u2019s Institute of Private Law said maritime law would have required Greek authorities to attempt a rescue if the boat was unsafe, regardless of whether those onboard requested it. Greek authorities \u201chad a duty to start rescue procedures\u201d given the condition of the trawler, R\u00f8s\u00e6g told Associated Press, adding that a captain\u2019s refusal of assistance could be overruled if deemed unreasonable \u2013 which he said this appeared to be. An independent refugee activist, Nawal Soufi, said in a Facebook post that she had been in touch with the boat throughout Tuesday and in the last call, \u201cthe man I was talking to expressly told me: \u2018I feel that this will be our last night alive.\u2019\u201d Aerial pictures released by Greek authorities of the boat hours before it sank showed dozens of people on the boat\u2019s upper and lower decks looking up, some with arms outstretched. Under its recent conservative government, Greece has taken a far harder stance on migration, building walled camps and boosting border controls. The country is currently governed by a caretaker administration pending an election on 25 June. Human rights groups say an EU crackdown on smuggling has forced people to take longer, more dangerous routes. Eftychia Georgiadi of the International Rescue Committee charity said the bloc had failed to offer more safe pathways to migration. That \u201ceffectively slams the door on people seeking protection\u201d, Georgiadi said. \u201cNobody embarks on these treacherous journeys unless they feel they have no other option,\u201d she added. On Thursday evening, thousands of protesters rallied in Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki, demanding EU migration policies be eased to prevent another tragedy. A group of protesters in the capital threw petrol bombs at police. Alexis Tsipras, who was prime minister from 2015-2019 at the peak of Europe\u2019s migration crisis, said on Thursday: \u201cThe immigration policy that Europe has been following for years \u2026 turns the Mediterranean, our seas, into watery graves.\u201d Tsipras, now an opposition leader, said: \u201cWhat sort of protocol does not call for the rescue \u2026 of an overloaded boat about to sink?\u201d Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a646", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/16/reading-facing-points-deduction-failing-to-pay-players-wages-efl-charges", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Reading face new points deduction after failing to pay players\u2019 wages three times", "lead": "Reading face another damaging points deduction after failing to pay players\u2019 wages on time on three occasions last season", "author": "Ben Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:34:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111438", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9bc74f1152e62da8eae2328c1dd6c49ce21f768f/0_365_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Reading face another damaging points deduction after failing to pay players\u2019 wages on time on three occasions last season.

Or at least it used to. It turns out the traditional summer ritual is having somewhat of a glow-up, with John Lewis calling 2023 the summer of the \u201cboujee BBQ\u201d. Gone are the flimsy aluminium instants, in their place \u201caesthetically pleasing outdoor dining setups.\u201d The high street giant is reporting strong sales of a \u00a3499 hybrid gas and charcoal barbecue, while for those with a balcony rather than garden, searches for electric barbecues have reportedly risen 267%. Even cult streetwear company Supreme had hypebeasts queuing around the block not for oversized hoodies or sneakers, but for a table-top charcoal grill created in partnership with the North American outdoor brand Coleman. Outdoor kitchens \u2013 a feature once reserved for A-listers\u2019 sprawling estates \u2013 have become one of TikTok\u2019s most searched-for terms, with hundreds of thousands of videos featuring tours of integrated charcoal grills and tips on building your own. However, this barbecue hype isn\u2019t limited to just the actual physical unit. John Lewis say customers are also \u201cinvesting in added extras that will add style to their al fresco dining.\u201d Everything from smart denim aprons (gone are the days of \u201cLicense to Grill\u201d jokes) to hot sauces in Instagrammable glass jars are trending. Armida Ascano, head futurist at the forecasting agency Trend Hunter, says this penchant for aesthetically pleasing barbecues is an extension of the pretty picnic trend that kickstarted during the pandemic. \u201cDuring lockdown it required much more creativity if you wanted something that felt as special as a fancy dining experience,\u201d says Ascano. \u201cIt was a perfect storm for outdoor DIY dining. It was one of many things people started doing out of necessity during the pandemic that we\u2019re now doing for fun.\u201d Just like the picnic trend led to cult wicker baskets and gingham blankets, the \u201cboujee BBQ\u201d trend is inciting consumers\u2019 obsession with certain brands. With TikTokers documenting everything from their trip to the farmer\u2019s market to \u201ctablescaping\u201d (AKA laying the table) brands are realising that how a barbecue looks is becoming just as important as how quickly the charcoal heats up. As a result, Weber\u2019s slick minimalist Go Anywhere barbecue and Heston Blumenthal\u2019s bright orange portable number are proving popular on social media. Elsewhere, for many millennials it\u2019s The Big Green Egg \u2013 a ceramic barbecue that both smokes and grills \u2013 that has become a wishlist item. Favoured by Michelin star chefs and Meghan Markle (she was pictured cooking sea bass and courgettes on hers), in further proof of its popularity it has recently been duped by Aldi. The German retail chain\u2019s version costs \u00a3399 compared to \u00a31,375 and, unsurprisingly, sells out in hours whenever it is restocked. Similar to how gorpcore, the trend of wearing outdoorsy gear in an urban environment, has become the norm, functional cooking and food prep gear commonly found around a rural campfire are quickly beginning to crop up on city balconies and in your local park. The 200-year old British brand Falcon has witnessed something of a recent renaissance, with Gen Z snapping up its blue rimmed enamelware plates, while Toast \u2013 a fashion brand best known for its soft fabrics and roomy dresses \u2013 has teamed up knife company Katto to create a \u201chand-forged\u201d barbecue tool set. Yeti, a brand that specialises in ice chests for outdoor explorers, says its biggest seller in the UK is its \u00a3200 Roadie cool box. Available in a range of pastel shades including millennial pink, reviews rave about its ability to keep bottles of ros\u00e9 icy. With soaring temperatures predicted for most of the UK this weekend, the \u201cboujee BBQ\u201d trend is only just heating up. You have been warned.

His death, at the age of 86, raises questions over the fate of an empire that was closely entwined with a political career that spanned almost three decades. Berlusconi had an estimated fortune of $7.4bn (\u00a35.8bn) as of April 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. But he left no indication, at least not publicly, of who would take over his empire after his death. Still, it is believed he wanted to avoid the kind of hereditary dispute that has befallen other super-rich Italian families, such as the Agnellis, the founders of Fiat, and so it is expected his wealth will be divided equally between his offspring. Berlusconi had two children \u2013 Marina and Pier Silvio \u2013 with his first wife, Carla Elvira Dall\u2019Oglio, and three \u2013 Barbara, Eleonora and Luigi \u2013 with his second wife, Veronica Lario. \u201cThere are those who believe they want to liquidate the assets, take the cash and run,\u201d said Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a consultancy in Rome. \u201cAnd those who think the opposite. One thing for sure is that they will need time to sit down and consider their options.\u201d Marina, who chairs Fininvest, the family holding company, and the publisher Mondadori, is poised to be the one calling the shots. Pier Silvio is deputy chairman of the TV company, Mediaset, while the three younger siblings hold stakes in Fininvest but do not have major roles in their father\u2019s businesses. Berlusconi\u2019s vast wealth includes the AC Monza football club, properties, yachts and artworks, but the main asset is Mediaset, Italy\u2019s largest commercial broadcaster and vehicle for his domination of the national debate. His heirs will be keen to shield the company from a hostile takeover, akin to that attempted by Vivendi in France in 2016, and so maintaining good relations with Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government, of which Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party is a junior member, will be crucial. \u201cThere will be tit for tat with Meloni,\u201d said Galietti. \u201cThe Berlusconi family will throw a [financial] lifeline to an already dead political party, and in return Meloni will have to shield Mediaset from hostile attacks.\u201d The siblings will also be keen to ensure Forza Italia remains compact, and in government, for their business interests to be safeguarded. \u201cThey did not agree with their father when he collapsed the government of Mario Draghi last year,\u201d said Lorenzo Castellani, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. \u201cFor the businesses, they have always wanted to be in government, and this government in particular. A good rapport with Meloni can offer guarantees for whichever path they take.\u201d With Mediaset, it could be that the family will choose to sell it within the next few years if deemed to be the more profitable route. \u201cIn that scenario, there could be friction with the government as we know that Mediaset is favourable towards this government,\u201d added Castellani. A source close to Berlusconi who saw him 10 days before he died, when he tied up his will, said \u201ceveryone had been taken care off\u201d, including Berlusconi\u2019s ex-wives. Another key protagonist is Marta Fascina, the 33-year-old partner of Berlusconi and a Forza Italia deputy. It is thought that his offspring agreed to Fascina being left money in his will in exchange for him not marrying her (the pair held a \u201csymbolic\u201d marriage last year). \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have wanted a messy divorce like the one with Veronica Lario,\u201d said Castellani. However, in an indication of positive relations, Martina and Fascina held hands at Berlusconi\u2019s funeral on Wednesday. \u201cFascina is a grieving quasi-widow who, in public, the family is holding up \u2013 she hasn\u2019t been dropped,\u201d said Galietti. \u201cBut I doubt her clout will be the same as we move forward.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a649", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/elemental-reimagine-wildfire-review-terrifying-extreme-weather-and-how-to-stop-it", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Elemental: Reimagine Wildfire review \u2013 a deep dive into California\u2019s destructive blazes", "lead": "As well as footage of destructive blazes tearing through California, this documentary offers careful analysis of how to prevent them", "author": "Phuong Le", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:26:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111492", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/de0be097da2955ddf695c244a7bd55ea5abb25ba/0_150_2246_1348/500.jpg", "body": "As the intense Canadian wildfires continue to make headlines, engulfing New York City in toxic orange smog, this timely and informative documentary seeks to change the way we think about these increasingly hazardous ecological events. Featuring footage from recent natural disasters, including the historic 2018 Camp fire in northern California, the opening places viewers in the heart of the inferno. Bright red flames lick through every inch of the ground, leaving behind a trail of burning wreckage, and waves of smoke turn the morning sky pitch-black. The sight is terrifying, almost surreal, yet Elemental also aims to debunk outdated myths about wildfires, regularly regurgitated by mainstream media and even forest management departments. An eclectic cohort of experts, who include academics, fire deputies and environmental volunteers, break down long-held misconceptions in a systematic and easy-to-understand fashion. For instance, for decades, logging new plantations has been a favoured method of fire prevention. In reality, however, maintaining old natural forests proves more effective at slowing down the spread of a wildfire as well as shielding populated areas from firestorms. Among the expert voices are those of the Indigenous Yurok tribe, who had adhered to these methods for generations before colonialism altered how fire was perceived. Far from an unruly monster, the use of fire to regulate the growth of a forest can, in fact, foster greater biodiversity. Impressive in terms of analysis, Elemental is slightly hampered by the narration from David Oyelowo, whose sonorous vocal timbre occasionally dampens the urgency of the issues at hand. A popular trend among nature docs, recorded voiceovers from high-profile actors can be a way to attract more attention. In this case, however, it might have been sufficient to let the subject speak for itself. \u2022 Elemental: Reimagine Wildfire is released on 13 June on digital platforms"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a64a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/16/nottingham-van-attack-two-victims-stable-third-discharged-hospital", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Two victims of Nottingham van attack in stable condition and third out of hospital", "lead": "Update on victims\u2019 condition comes as police name man suspected of killing three people in rampage", "author": "Jessica Murray Midlands correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:21:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111511", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/94e622d63154e79f1913acaa5a2b94beadb15fa5/0_183_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "Two of the people who were hit by a van in the Nottingham attacks are in a stable condition, while a third has been discharged from hospital. Nottinghamshire University hospitals NHS trust confirmed the condition of the three patients on Friday, after it was reported earlier in the week that one of the victims was in a critical condition. All three were taken to hospital after being struck by a van that mounted the pavement in the early hours of Tuesday morning during a spate of attacks across the city. It emerged on Thursday that the suspect in the attacks, which left three people dead, is a former University of Nottingham student named Valdo Amiss\u00e3o Mendes Calocane. He is being held on suspicion of murder after a rampage during which Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber, both University of Nottingham students, along with school caretaker Ian Coates, were killed in the street. Nottinghamshire police said detectives had been granted a further 36 hours to question the suspect until Friday. Thousands attended a vigil in Nottingham city centre on Thursday evening, during which the families of the victims made emotional tributes to their loved ones. Emma Webber, the mother of 19-year-old Barnaby, asked the crowd to \u201chold no hate that relates to any colour, sex or religion\u201d and said the culprit would \u201creceive the retribution that he deserves\u201d.

The university said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the news.

There are people so idiosyncratic that it is hard to imagine them existing in a more conventional profession. And there are people who stay so long in the job that it becomes impossible to imagine the place without them. Jeremy Alexander, who died of cancer aged 81 on Thursday, embodied all that in a single individual. For anyone who has ever worked on the Guardian sports desk there is not just sadness but disbelief. It is the end of an era that lasted 57 years. Repeat, 57. He worked for the department from 1966 until his final illness in March. It may even have been his first illness; he claimed never to have taken a day off sick, and his facts tended to be reliable. He was not wholly anonymous. Longstanding Guardian readers may remember Jeremy\u2019s elegant and lovingly crafted football reports, usually from the nether reaches of league football. But that was a fraction of his contribution. His original speciality was to act as the \u201cstone sub\u201d, spending his evenings in the bowels of the building, trying to ensure the hot metal type had the right words in the right order, which the old Grauniad was infamous for not doing. When new technology arrived in the 1980s, simplifying the production process, this job mutated into the \u201crevise sub\u201d, still the last line of defence against libel, bad grammar, infelicity and simple mistakes. Calling him hawk-eyed does him scant justice. One is tempted to call him The Man Who Stopped a Million Errors, a phrase Jeremy would have amended on grounds of exaggeration. But there must have been hundreds of thousands. And he did it all with immense charm. Even the grumpiest old printer melted before a Jeremy request. And the correspondents were familiar with the late night phone call. As Mike Selvey recalled: \u201cHe\u2019d say \u2018Mike, it\u2019s Jeremy. Lovely piece. But I was just wondering whether it would be better if \u2026\u2019 And he was always right.\u201d He grew up in Surrey, comfortably if not grandly, and won a scholarship to Shrewsbury school, which he loved: he became captain of athletics and made the first XI at both football and cricket. The 1961 Wisden says JG Alexander was fourth in the averages with fewer outs than not outs. The avoidance of error, already. At Oxford, he did maths, which might be another hint of his passion for accuracy. Actually, he got a fourth-class degree, now abolished, and regarded by some as far more stylish than a first. He must have had better things to do. Still, he was offered a job teaching at Rugby school and was about to accept when a letter to the Field magazine suddenly bore fruit and offered him a place as a subeditor. \u201cHe was a grammatical stickler even then,\u201d recalled his colleague Gill McGregor, who became a lifelong friend. A couple of years later he began moonlighting on the Guardian; his first football report \u201cby a special correspondent\u201d was a cracker \u2013 Leicester 5 West Ham 4 in August 1966, four of the Wembley heroes on display, only a month after the World Cup. Thus began more than 51 years of Guardian football reporting, culminating in a visit to Lincoln\u2019s Sincil Bank, the only league venue he had never ticked off. One early piece in the paper was about a Blackpool win at Millwall, achieved \u201cfirmly but not rudely\u201d which summed up Jeremy\u2019s approach to life. For two decades he combined the Field, with its emphasis on country pursuits, some of them bloody, and the leftie fastness of the Guardian. He enjoyed the combination of this journalistic odd couple. The differing politics simply did not interest him. But when a point of principle arose he was intransigent. Mike Averis, the long-serving sports editor, saw him as a star turn and wanted him to be as ever-present as possible. Jeremy was willing to become a full-time staffer. But the paper then ran a closed shop, and both management and the National Union of Journalists insisted everyone became a member. Not Jeremy. He thought it was wrong to be forced. And eventually he won: for an equivalent annual donation to charity he was given exemption. Another sticking point was a refusal to countenance the word \u201cI\u201d in print. It is something that journalists should always spread thinly, like gentleman\u2019s relish. For him it was taboo. Even his retrospective on completing the full set of league clubs avoided it. That was in 2018 when he still had another five years of removing I from other people\u2019s copy. It was all of a piece with his general attitude. Asked if he would like a party when his stint reached 50 years, he insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t want a fuss.\u201d Avoiding fuss was what made him gravitate to the lower divisions. Other habits annoyed his friends more. He refused to have a mobile phone; in extremis he would borrow one, from a stranger if need be. He did not own a computer, had no personal email. In the office, he could be reached on his Guardian email on which, once he had officially retired and started doing shifts again, he had to be called jeremy.alexander.casual@... Casual? Jeremy? He was single as well as singular, but had a huge circle of friends, male and female, some of whom camped in his small central London flat for months on end. He ran through Hyde Park regularly, and appeared to age hardly at all. Indeed, he had run a marathon \u2013 a qualifying event for the European championships \u2013 in 1974, when almost no one ran marathons. (The Guardian took a report from him, self-deprecating as ever but surprisingly full of the forbidden I.) He also enjoyed opera, theatre and concerts. He almost never saw films. On TV he only watched sport. And his ignorance of popular culture was near total. \u201cHe would have heard of the Beatles, I think,\u201d said his brother Rod, \u201cbut would have struggled to identify them.\u201d Yet he was otherwise erudite. Once a burglar climbed through his window during the night to be greeted with a very Jeremyish \u201cCan I help you?\u201d The uninvited guest looked round at the groaning bookcases and general lack of grandeur, said: \u201cSorry, wrong house,\u201d and left. Grace under pressure is one of the great human virtues. He showed it then, just as he did night after night, decade after decade, confronted by a tight deadline and the work of more fallible journalists. We will miss him terribly."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a64c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/16/tasteful-aroma-should-restaurants-ban-diners-from-wearing-strong-perfumes", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tasteful aroma: should restaurants ban diners from wearing strong perfumes?

Heavy fragrances, the restaurant suggests, could mask the \u201crefreshing\u201d ambient scent of vinegar, and of the fish itself. So should the approach of the \u00a3420-per-person restaurant be adopted more widely? Is perfume on a dinner date, while making you smell better, likely to make your food and drink taste worse? \u201cSmell is about the most important part of tasting,\u201d said Prof Barry Smith, the director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of London\u2019s School of Advanced Study. \u201cAll you get from the tongue are salt, sweet, sour, savoury. All the other flavours are from the nose.\u201d However, Smith pointed out that smell has two components: odours that are breathed in from the environment and those coming from the mouth out through the nose during exhalation. \u201cCan environmental odours interfere with odours in your mouth? It\u2019s not obvious that it does,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWhen you\u2019re tasting or swallowing you\u2019re breathing out, and we can\u2019t breathe out and in at the same time.\u201d Nevertheless, research and everyday experience support the view that ambient smells are important for the broader dining experience. \u201cThose ambient scents definitely can affect the taste of the food and mood,\u201d said Prof Charles Spence, a psychologist at the University of Oxford. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit ambiguous, when you smell something, what your brain is going to attach it to. Is it the waiter, is it the restaurant, is it the food?\u201d The wrong smell in the wrong context can produce an unpleasant sensory dissonance. Smith described a recent negative experience of a lunchtime meal in a London square that has introduced the use of seaweed compost in its flowerbeds. \u201cThe smell of rotting seaweed was so off-putting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very unpleasant to be reminded of something rotting while eating a sandwich.\u201d More recently, chefs have been trying to proactively introduce ambient odours and Spence has considered this quest in a scientific review, noting that ambient scents could \u201chelp set the context for a particular dish, and/or to assist with the storytelling that surrounds a specific element within an experiential meal\u201d. Ambient scents have also been introduced in restaurants with the aim of inducing \u201ca specific mood and/or to trigger nostalgia in the minds of diners\u201d, the paper states. If you\u2019re going to ignore the ban, Spence suggested, it might be best to go for something that would blend into the culinary setting. \u201cWhy not go for a gourmet perfume \u2013 black pepper or strawberry? That might be less of a clash than a very synthetic or soapy, non-gourmand scent.\u201d Personal fragrances, research has shown, also increase the threshold at which people are able to detect other odours \u2013 a reassuring finding, perhaps, given that this is partly the point. Prof Carl Philpott, the head of rhinology and ENT research at Norwich Medical School, investigated the issue after noticing that participants\u2019 perfumes and aftershaves were affecting the results of their experiments on olfaction. In one experiment, volunteers were asked to wear face masks doused in Lynx or Impulse body sprays for a few minutes before doing a smell test. Afterwards, they were less able to detect other fragrances. \u201cIt made enough of a difference for us to recommend that people should not wear perfume or aftershave for smell tests,\u201d he said. This suggests that subtle environmental odours might be more easily disrupted by perfumes. \u201cThe smell of really fresh sushi fish is very delicate and gorgeous, but subtle, so could easily be overpowered,\u201d said Smith. Stronger perfumes might be OK, he said, in a restaurant serving bold flavours, such as Indian or Thai cuisine, he added. The no-perfume approach does not come without costs. Wearing perfume can make a person both appear more attractive to others and feel more confident internally. \u201cYou\u2019re likely to make your diners anxious if they\u2019re not allowed to wear any scent,\u201d said Smith. \u201cA modest amount of perfume seems reasonable.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a64d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/16/rhun-ap-iorwerth-appointed-as-leader-of-plaid-cymru", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": " Rhun ap Iorwerth appointed as leader of Plaid Cymru", "lead": "Former deputy leader, the only candidate, takes over at top of scandal-hit Welsh pro-independence party", "author": "Steven Morris", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:09:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111569", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4968a01cb9a34ecc24ab988dfa63c3a88d75a907/0_178_2304_1382/500.jpg", "body": "Rhun ap Iorwerth has been announced as the new leader of Plaid Cymru and faces the tough job of getting the party back on track after a misogyny and harassment scandal.

The two men in it, French visitors to Henry VIII\u2019s London named Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve, found time to pose for the king\u2019s painter Holbein. But the artist lets his own obsession with mortality rip through the scene in the form of a vast optically distorted human skull. Its empty eye sockets mock the men and the objects of culture and curiosity that surround them: lute and globe, mathematical instruments and Turkish rug, all will be ruined by time. It\u2019s clear from his other works that Holbein is infecting this uneasy picture with his own anxieties rather than just obeying the clients\u2019 instructions. His dead Christ and series of prints The Dance of Death reveal a personal horror at life\u2019s brevity. He worked in London simply as a mesmerising portraitist yet here his larger, darker vision melts reality with its despair. \u2022 National Gallery, London.

I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all I can think about. Because there\u2019s the heat \u2013 the external stuff, coming from the sun, rising from the pavements, radiating from baked houses, the unmoving inescapable hot air wrapped round you with no relief \u2013 and then there\u2019s the internal fire of hatred boiling my blood about how much I loathe this weather, about how ill-designed London is for coping with it, about how much I miss my cardigans, about how impossible it is to imagine ever being cool or comfortable again. And above all about the fathomless stupidity of us all \u2013 but mainly governments and big fellers like that who are the only ones who really have the power, who have ever had the power to change things on the scale necessary \u2013 in continuing all the fathomlessly stupid practices that are making a burning, boiling, cardiganless planet an unavoidable reality. Oh God, this heat, inside and out \u2013 I cannot bear it. Tuesday A little of my rage lifts when I press, at last, \u201cSend\u201d on the first draft of my latest book, which is a sequel to an earlier one, Bookworm, because I would never like to be accused of a surfeit of imagination. Off it goes to my agents and I can revel in the sweet, sweet relief of a long, long task completed. I love this part. It\u2019s just a shame that it lasts literally 20 minutes. I timed it last time I handed in a manuscript. That\u2019s what I get for between 18 months and two years of labour \u2013 20 minutes. Twenty minutes of feeling light, unbound, uncrushed and free before the dread anticipation of others\u2019 opinions, of facing up to the mistakes you must have made (factual! Tonal! Ineffable! All points in between!), of rewriting the unutterable bastard of a thing start creeping in. Twenty minutes. I spent it facedown on my keyboard. It\u2019s barely long enough to dent your forehead. Wednesday Hurrah for Nadine Dorries, lone crusader after truth! The former cabinet minister is planning to hang on to her seat until she can find out who \u2013 but who, who?! \u2013 is behind her failure to be awarded the peerage promised to her by serial liar and breaker of promises Boris Johnson. It\u2019s Rishi Sunak, she reckons, because she is a poor girl from Liverpool, or because he didn\u2019t want a byelection, or because she\u2019s taller than him or something \u2013 the important thing is that it certainly isn\u2019t, because nothing is, Boris\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the resignation honours list written by Brian Rix, with the sitting MP for Mid Bedfordshire \u2013 our hearts go out to constituents even more fully than usual \u2013 played by Veruca Salt. Dorries could have settled for the peerage given by convention to every cabinet member in the dissolution honours list next year but she wants it NOW, Daddy. Because otherwise she has to rely on Sunak to do the right thing rather than the known colossus of rectitude Boris. So she clings mutinously on to a job she had made clear to her electorate she will drop behind her without a second glance the minute a space on the red benches is made available, and everything is as mean and vulgar and stinking of cess as \u2013 assuming you are not a member of the rat king that is our current governing party, tails tangled til you die \u2013 one could possibly hope. Thursday According to various spikes in Google search terms, expectant mothers and new parents are suffering a crisis of confidence in their abilities to rear the little buggers since and because of the pandemic. The lack of socialising, community support and informal advice, it is thought, has left them feeling isolated and unsure of themselves. Oh, my poor dears. I feel for you so deeply. New parenthood is a terrible time even at the best of times, and these are not they. But \u2013 if I may \u2013 try not to worry. In fact, let what feels like isolation from those who know better free you instead. Because here\u2019s the thing all parents come to understand in the end: you, and you alone, are the boss of your baby. You know him or her best. Only you sit at the centre of the web of sleeps, feeds, changes, moods, temperatures and feel every vibration in it. Anything you do is likely to sit firmly in the category of \u201cright things\u201d. Other people\u2019s advice can be helpful, but more often than not it is confusing and contradictory. And, if offered in the wrong spirit, infuriating and the cause of arguments you then have to waste several precious naptimes undoing over the phone. Try to think of yourself as Lord God King Right, master-mistress of all things infant that you survey \u2013 willing to entertain graciously the occasional thought from a subject but ultimately undistracted from your vision \u2013 instead of alone and adrift. You will get through this, I promise you. Friday Today is the day I take Mum on the train from Catford to Waterloo to meet Ben, my brother-in-law, who will travel with her on another train to Devon so she can stay with him and my sister for a few days. I meet her at the front door where she has been waiting, with the house packed into two small bags, for \u2013 at a conservative estimate \u2013 the last 36 hours. I try to pick up a bag. She slaps my hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t! I\u2019ll not be balanced if you take one!\u201d A number of responses spring to mind but years of training means they are in no danger of utterance. She marches to the station. I follow behind, panting like a decrepit dog. I was 42 seconds late; we\u2019ve time to make up so that she can arrive the full 40 minutes early for a 20-minute journey to Waterloo East. At Waterloo East we must cross to Waterloo. She buys food for the journey. \u201cYour father would have made sandwiches, but he\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cI bought shares in M&amp;S ready meals before the body was cold.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got one of Auntie Jessie\u2019s towels in my bag,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we can buy ones with mayonnaise if we want.\u201d She buys a BLT for Ben. \u201cWhat are you having?\u201d I say. \u201cNothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI ate yesterday.\u201d Ben arrives and I see them both safely on to the train. \u201cI\u2019ve got you a BLT,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd crisps, but they\u2019re from the Co-op.

His talent, dedication, and passion for the sport has inspired us all.\u201d Another rider, Magnus Sheffield, also left the road on the same descent on Thursday. The American sustained a concussion and bruises and was treated at a local hospital, organisers said. The stage route was criticised by the world champion, Remco Evenepoel, on Thursday evening. \u201cWhile a summit finish would have been perfectly possible, it wasn\u2019t a good decision to let us finish down this dangerous descent,\u201d Evenepoel tweeted. \u201cAs riders, we should also think about the risks we take going down a mountain.\u201d M\u00e4der placed fifth in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in 2021, winning the white jersey for the best young rider, and was also fifth in the Paris-Nice stage race in March.

The modern formula? Make it different, but not too different. Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s Cinderella, reimagined in-the-round for English National Ballet in 2019, adds narrative interventions and unconventional steps but the sweetly romantic result upends no one\u2019s expectations of an enjoyably untaxing night at the ballet. To his credit, Wheeldon has thought a lot about the source material, adding backstories for Cinderella (Erina Takahashi) and the prince (Francesco Gabriele Frola). At her mother\u2019s graveside young Cinders dances playful steps underpinned with melancholy. The couple meet before the ball, the Prince disguised as a non-royal (a touch of Giselle there), a device meant to give depth to their relationship, yet despite the midnight curfew it comes without real drama or jeopardy. There are no \u201cugly\u201d sisters here (although one wears glasses, and there\u2019s a running joke about the other\u2019s BO), and most boldly Wheeldon does away with pumpkins and fairy godmothers, this story instead controlled by the Fates, four men lifting and swooping Cinderella, nudging her towards her destiny. The magic is found in nature, the spirits of the seasons suddenly filling the stage \u2013 autumn\u2019s the best, the dancers as swirling tumbling leaves, swooshing in the wind. There are bursts of colour, ballet tights fading orange into yellow (shout out to the costume dyeing team). Room-filling visuals are by designer Julian Crouch and projection designer Daniel Brodie, and what\u2019s fabulous are the silks of puppeteer Basil Twist: long drapes that, with the pull of a cord, can balloon into an enormous tree; the train of a dress turning into a carriage. At the ball, scores of dancers criss-cross the vast round dancefloor, they glide past the eye, waltzing to Prokofiev (played live, although the orchestra is mostly hidden). Size matters in a venue such as the Albert Hall but sometimes one dancer alone is most powerful, and the principals pull focus: Takahashi with her finely tuned grace; Frola making a sensitive Prince but exuding quiet confidence as a dancer; his high-kicking sidekick Ken Saruhashi gleaming with bright energy. Plus an amusing turn from Sarah Kundi\u2019s tipsy stepmother. It\u2019s well danced, perfectly lovely, very different \u2013 yet in terms of ballet\u2019s conventions, no different at all.

It\u2019s much swankier than Miznon, his pitta restaurant in Soho and Notting Hill, but his chaotic spirit has not been quashed. You may recall from my visit to Miznon last year that Shani leans towards purple prose when writing menus; his dishes read like the late Mark E Smith from The Fall performing beat poetry. \u201cSix spicy instruments that will swirl your soul,\u201d shouts the menu, describing what transpires to be a mixed plate of runny, oily, meze-type dipping things hewn out of roast red peppers, chopped green pepper and spins on matbucha, some of them hot with aleppo pepper. I\u2019d love to tell you the nitty gritty of what was on that delightful plate, but, like much at Lilienblum (and at Miznon, for that matter), you have to order and hope for the best. Indeed, the bright, helpful servers are trained to translate, which must be exhausting, but then the flurry of terms in a noisy room just adds to the dishes\u2019 mystery. The \u201cSix Spicy Instruments\u201d did not come with bread, so I ordered some called \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad idea to order this but there will be no regrets\u201d, which revealed itself to be two pieces of crunchy, firm focaccia topped with a generous quenelle of cream cheese and covered in honey and pouring cream. It was richer than any dessert, completely irresistible and useless for the task of dipping in meze (unless, that is, you happen to be wearing spongeable coveralls). Nothing at Lilienblum is straightforward, but what saves it from being annoying is the cooking \u2013 both Shani\u2019s vision and head chef Oren King\u2019s skill and judicious use of flavour. King has previously worked at the likes of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Roka and Hide, and that level of opulence and attention to detail is here in the extremely good and spicy mesabaha of lima beans and hard-boiled egg, and in the vast terrine of aubergine \u201cmelanzana\u201d, which leaves the stuff I\u2019ve eaten at a thousand Italian restaurants looking awkward. King is running a sort of elegant, earthy, Ottolenghi mashup of Honey &amp; Co and The Palomar, with a menu and vision by Shani, who writes dish descriptions like someone shouting their sitcom ideas at you from the back of a dance tent. Somehow, it all works. Somewhere during my first visit to Lilienblum, just as happened when I went to Miznon, I was already tucking it up my sleeve as somewhere to direct people to for the straightforward reason that the food tastes very good. There\u2019s a cocktail list with Eyal martinis at \u00a312 a pop; the house white is a viognier at \u00a335 a bottle, and there is sparkling Israeli pet nat for \u00a365. This is a capacious place suitable for groups needing somewhere civilised to hang out around the bunfight of weekend Old Street/Shoreditch, but here it\u2019s the food that brings the mayhem. We had the hamachi sashimi, billed on the menu as, \u201cI trained for years to cut sashimi like this\u201d, and which came in a rather subtle, ponzu-style dressing. From the cheaper end of the menu, we ordered the minute steak tahini, which was a pile of meat dripping in hulled sesame with more chopped tomatoes. It was tasty, albeit rather cheap-and-cheerful feeling for a relatively affordable \u00a322; after that, the likes of lamb chops with salat aravi leap up to \u00a348, but that\u2019s par for the course when eating in nice places these days. Desserts, however, are a very reasonable \u00a38, and completely worth saving room for. A honking great piece of lemony pistachio cake with a delightful, damp, raspberry-embossed bottom came with lots of fresh cream and more fresh raspberries. It was clearly homemade that day, and for that I was very grateful. Same, too, for the naked chocolate cake;, a thick, exuberantly rich, flourless rib-sticker that comes with more fresh cream garnished with strawberries. The chocolate mousse is accompanied by fresh, warm, salted butter cookies that are almost unbearably good. Chef sent apologies that his Basque cheesecake hadn\u2019t quite set and wasn\u2019t available that night, and I\u2019ve since thought about that cheesecake a lot. In a restaurant landscape increasingly filled with dessert lists that translate as \u201ceat up and get out\u201d, there is a definite reach here to make puddings as important as the \u201chummus just the way we like it\u201d or the \u201cabundance of salad brightened with chardonnay and EVOO\u201d.

The headline: its people are starving. Communist North Korea is destitute, even as capitalist South Korea is one of Asia\u2019s most prosperous nations. It starved in the 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, and was rescued by China. But the government closed the border during Covid and it has barely reopened, hampering the import of Chinese foodstuff. UN experts reckon that North Korea can this year feed barely three-quarters of its 26 million people at survival level. The BBC has spoken to people who have witnessed neighbours dying of starvation in their homes and on the streets. More than half a million perished in the 1990s famine. This could be repeated. What should Britons do about this, beyond offering distant sympathy? Hazel Smith, Korea expert at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, regularly points out that when a country is so set on xenophobic \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d and spends wildly on defence, it suffers massive economic distortions. Food shortage is \u201cbaked into the \u2026 system\u201d. China\u2019s exports to North Korea were reportedly down 81% in 2020. Shops are empty of Chinese food and beggars are everywhere. That the Pyongyang regime should have sought self-sufficiency may have been wrong-headed but was not in itself stupid. As Smith told the BBC this week, what was disastrous was the tightening of UN sanctions in 2017. They extended a ban on nuclear and military materials so that it no longer differentiated between civilian and military needs. In particular, a stop was imposed on oil-based products, including everything needed for agriculture. This includes the inputs for producing fertilisers, pesticides and plastic sheeting. A year\u2019s fuel consumption in the North is now down to the equivalent to one day\u2019s consumption in the South. Food production since 2019 has plummeted, while the collapse in exports has severely limited North Korea\u2019s ability to buy food on world markets. Perhaps sanctions enthusiasts will say this is proof that \u201csanctions are working\u201d. If a nation tolerates a viciously authoritarian leader who is a menace to neighbouring countries, they get what they deserve. Every time the North Korean leader, Kim Jongun, tests another missile, he deserves another sanction. That should teach him. A former imperial power such as Britain, self-appointed moral policeman to the world, cannot just do nothing. It can still punch above its weight. It can lead the west in demanding sanctions. But sanctions hurting is not sanctions working. They were first imposed on North Korea after the 1950s war. They were strengthened in the 1980s, and tightened when North Korea left the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 2003. They were further tightened after successive weapons tests by Pyongyang in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2017. I can find no shred of evidence that they have resulted in the slightest restraint on the Pyongyang regime, rather reinforcing its siege mentality and making it ever more reckless. This has served no one\u2019s interest \u2013 not the west\u2019s or Korea\u2019s Asian neighbours. Sanctions against North Korea have done exactly what they have done to countless regimes in recent decades, from Cuba to Myanmar and Venezuela to Afghanistan. They have entrenched existing elites in power, making them ever more paranoid in their behaviour. They weaken a country\u2019s tolerance of dissent and reduce the likelihood of any change. Enthusiasts always say they take time. They have had time. These sanctions have failed for half a century. Above all, their sheer crudity, enforced year after year, hurts and disempowers the poor and the innocent in the victim country. In the case of energy sanctions against Russia, they also hurt the poor of the imposing countries. They have become just another manifestation of the outbreak of global protectionism. We can assume that British taxpayers will now be asked to send food aid to Korea, to relieve a famine their governments have spent six years contributing towards. They will be right to do so. But our foreign policy has forgotten the maxim that if you cannot do good, at least do no harm. Sanctions do no good, but they are certainly doing harm.

Lads yell to mates across the road, girls tug at miniskirts to just-about cover their bums. It\u2019s a familiar booze-fuelled blur. At a club night inside Glasgow\u2019s Centre for Contemporary Arts (CCA) however, there\u2019s no alcohol to be found. Not because there isn\u2019t a bar, but because the punters have boycotted it in solidarity with staff in the midst of an employment dispute. The water-only policy doesn\u2019t dampen spirits. On stage, one woman performs a fusion of classical Indian dance and burlesque, a man adorned with flowers is attached to ropes the audience can pull and control, and a pair of trans performers (appear to) inject each other with oestrogen on stage. This is Buzzcut festival, on the edges of live art, dance and queer club culture. Something organiser Karl Taylor calls \u201ca scramble of ideas\u201d. Earlier that day, the festival was at arts space Tramway, full of puzzling haircuts and welcoming vibe. There were people in harnesses clipping themselves to a complicated web of ropes and carabiners, and two naked women moving on the floor like squelchy sea creatures. Just some of the content warnings: nudity, sexually explicit language, violence, body fluids, scarification, loud noises, strobing lights, toxic masculinity, cultural appropriation, abuse, infantilism, addiction, pregnancy, birth and death. It sounds terrifying. But in conversation, the enthusiastic artists repeatedly talk about community, creativity and care. Buzzcut is just one facet of Glasgow\u2019s lively live art and performance landscape. Glasgow has its long-established dance scene \u2013 Scottish Ballet was founded in 1969, now also based at Tramway \u2013 but elsewhere, in what\u2019s sometimes called expanded dance, movement meets sculpture, sound, visual art, theatre, to pull at the edges of genre, performance and human experience. Glasgow has a history with experimental performance, hosting for many years the National Review of Live Art (NRLA). It was also home to legendary club the Arches, where artists used the various nooks and crannies of the building to perform, and where you might find \u201ca 12-hour durational work in a corridor\u201d, remembers artist Ashanti Harris. The NRLA ended in 2010 and the Arches closed in 2015. The ecology has changed, but plenty of folk are maintaining the legacy. Like most things in the arts, it\u2019s precarious, but fuelled by passion. \u201cIt always feels like we\u2019re chasing our tail, rebuilding, to keep the scene alive,\u201d says Taylor. As well as Buzzcut, radical artists get a platform at the biennial festivals Take Me Somewhere and Dance International Glasgow, at activist arts organisation Arika, or queer clubs like Bonjour, \u201cmoving between fashion, performance and dance,\u201d says Taylor. Many belong to artist-led organisation The Work Room. The critical mass of Glasgow\u2019s art school, conservatoire and three universities is part of the reason the scene is so buzzing, alongside its thriving music, theatre and club culture. \u201cThere\u2019s an attitude here of collectivity in comparison with other places I\u2019ve worked,\u201d says Harris, who trained as a sculptor but now works with dance. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got the same mission and helps to make things happen. Glasgow has always been very do-it-yourself, it\u2019s a very community attitude.\u201d Harris\u2019s work is strong on community. She\u2019s currently working on a \u201ccollective performance\u201d piece about Caribbean carnival, involving everyone in the audience. She co-founded Glasgow Open Dance School (GODS) with the idea that anyone can be a dancer, and with choreographer Mele Broomes she founded Project X, celebrating dance from the African-Caribbean diaspora. Lots of people bring up the city\u2019s DIY spirit. Taylor talks about an early Buzzcut held in a community centre in Govan. They had no furniture, so they went to a charity shop across the road and asked to borrow everything. \u201cThey said yeah, totally fine, and we made the festival their showroom for a week. The audience were buying the chairs,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s a generosity in Glasgow, a friendliness,\u201d says movement artist Claricia Parinussa. \u201cThere are a lot of artists but the scene is small so there\u2019s a lot of collaboration. There\u2019s a freshness about things, not necessarily sticking to ideas of what \u2018should\u2019 be.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve felt the audience being willing to lean into whatever\u2019s happening, not standing in judgment,\u201d says Stephen Greer, an academic who is writing a history of live art in Scotland. For Swedish artist Louise Ahl, having lived in Devon, Berlin and Leeds, in Glasgow \u201cpeople seemed to really connect with what I was doing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a shared humour \u2013 I would say I have quite a twisted, dark sense of humour. They found my work funny.\u201d Ahl uses movement and voice and experiments with form. Her latest piece is a solo opera, with a scent designer making different smells for each act. \u201cThe reception I usually get with my work is either people absolutely love it and think it\u2019s the most amazing, mind-bending thing, or they just find it completely tedious,\u201d she laughs. On a practical level, says Ahl, it\u2019s cheaper to live here than Edinburgh (or London), which is useful when much of this work is being made on a shoestring. \u201cI try not to romanticise that, because I think live art as a scene has a real problem in its attachment to having no money,\u201d says Greer. \u201cOn the one hand it\u2019s led to extraordinary things, but then it has made it harder to talk about exploitation and self-exploitation.\u201d In other words, working for nothing. That\u2019s something producers are now trying to address. Buzzcut festival took a break for six years (Covid meant that was longer than planned) and decided to come back with fewer artists but pay them more. \u201c[In the early days] it was huge and sprawling and full of all kinds of crazy wild energy \u2026 and that is wonderful and intoxicating but also makes it really hard to practise care to your artists and your audiences,\u201d says Taylor. Everyone\u2019s feeling the financial squeeze, \u201cartists are feeling burnt out,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cBut I do feel positive,\u201d says Parinussa. \u201cThe energy here is always full of potential. Every single day something new is happening.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a657", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/16/ben-schwartz-and-friends-comedy-sonic-hedgehog", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guide #91: Ben Schwartz is bringing his improv show to the UK \u2013 and he wants your stories", "lead": "In this week\u2019s newsletter: The Parks and Rec star and voice of Sonic tells us about taking the audience-powered Ben Schwartz &amp; Friends to London", "author": "Hannah J Davies and Rich Pelley", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:45:42", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111756", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/abbbe238521b64def725b9b386832a4e245065d9/0_103_7360_4415/500.jpg", "body": "Something a little different this week \u2013 a Q&amp;A between frequent Guardian culture contributor Rich Pelley and Ben Schwartz of Parks and Recreation fame, who is currently on tour and touches down in the UK in July. Read on for the secrets to quick-witted comedy success, as well as our usual cultural recommendations below. \u2013 Hannah You\u2019ll know Ben Schwartz as Jean-Ralphio Saperstein from Parks and Recreation, Space Force, and as the voice of Sonic in the two Sonic the Hedgehog movies. But you should like him best for his true passion \u2013 longform improv, where he invents hour-long stories based entirely on the suggestions of his audiences. His latest improv show, Ben Schwartz &amp; Friends, is coming to London this July, where he will be joined on stage by friends, to improvise an entire evening of entertainment. We caught up with him to find out just how it all works. Hi, Ben! Could you make the show all about me if I tell you a story in advance \u2026? No. That\u2019s not how it works. The show is made up on the spot, so even the idea of us conversing beforehand wouldn\u2019t make any sense. We interview audience members, listen to their story, and then make up an entire show off of that. What I\u2019ve learned the most is that the best stories are from the people that aren\u2019t trying to be funny. They\u2019re just telling us real things from their lives, and we get to connect with them. How are you anticipating British audiences might differ from US ones? I guess I just won\u2019t be doing 1,000 weirdly specific Los Angeles references. I\u2019m very excited to find out because this is the first time I\u2019ve taken my improv out of the US or Canada. My \u201cworld\u201d tour is in fact one city \u2013 London. I filmed a movie with Sam Rockwell called Blue Iguana in the UK, but I haven\u2019t done a ton of stuff there. Anytime I get to go for work, it\u2019s heaven. What happens if you\u2019re doing an improv scene but can\u2019t think of anything? If we were doing improv, I would save you. Whenever I see someone may be a bit lost, I\u2019ll jump in and push the scene along. If I said: \u201cRemember that awful thing you did?\u201d and they go: \u201cUhh \u2026\u201d I\u2019ll try to make one up. I\u2019ll say: \u201cRemember when you stole candy from a baby? It was literally yesterday!\u201d and then the scene can move on from there. Isn\u2019t part of the fun \u2013 like in Middleditch and Schwartz [his Netflix series with Thomas Middleditch, pictured below] \u2013 trying to stitch the other person up? When you\u2019ve played with someone for a long time, I love pushing that just to mess with people \u2013 but only if it furthers the show. There\u2019s a guy I do improv with a lot called Drew Tarver. There was a show that involved us all singing the theme tune to Friends \u2013 I\u2019ll Be There For You by The Rembrandts \u2013 but it was clear that he didn\u2019t know the words. The shows are an hour long. We were wrapping it up, and it turned into this big thing where the only way someone\u2019s life could be saved was if Drew Tarver could sing a word-perfect version of the theme to Friends, and he was pushed to the middle of the stage. It was such a funny moment because he was really trying to remember the words. Talking of Friends, can you tell us the friends who will be featuring in Ben Schwartz and Friends in London? I\u2019m only bringing two because it\u2019s quite expensive to fly. So it will be two people who I regularly do improve with in the States, and hopefully another American improv comic who happens to be over in the UK when we\u2019re there. If you could pick any British actor to be one of your friends, who would you choose? I love Stath Lets Flats, so Jamie Demetriou. You did the voice of Sonic. Has this lead to any weird fanboy stuff? I\u2019ve been invited to conventions, but I haven\u2019t done one yet. Every so often, people will come up and want an autograph. I used to get recognised as Jean-Ralphio from Parks and Rec the most: people would come up, quote lines, and ask me do to sign stuff. When Sonic came out, all of a sudden that was the thing people wanted me to sign the most. So the thing that you can\u2019t see my face in, is now the thing I\u2019m most famous for. They changed the appearance of Sonic at the last minute. If you could change anything about yourself, what would you change? I get injured easier and I gain weight easier now than I have in my entire life. I would love if I still had the metabolism of when I was younger and didn\u2019t get tired so quickly. Just give me an injury-free, young body \u2013 which is not saying much because I was a bag of bones back then as well. What would have happened if they had cast you as Paddington? Oh my God, it would be a dream. But I don\u2019t think my voice is calm enough for Paddington. My voice would be a Paddington who had drunk too much coffee, was in a bad mood, and was also Jewish.

Drinking too much, not sleeping and sinking into depression, Bharatt thought it best his only child go and live with her aunts. \u201cI begged she to go,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was 15. That child she said: \u2018I ain\u2019t leaving.\u2019 My wife had been six years ill, so it had been hard, but Andrea used that as motivation. \u201cIt was me had to stop being the delinquent. My own mother died when I was nine and I didn\u2019t know parenting. But I went into Andrea\u2019s school and they said: \u2018Go home, there is nothing wrong with this one.\u2019 She was getting trophies and certificates.\u201d Andrea\u2019s room in the bright, one-storey house in Arima, Trinidad, is full of her treasures: a yellow toy truck she adored as a toddler, school certificates and her framed BSc degree from the University of the West Indies. On one wall, Bharatt has hung a large poster that was used at one of the vigils for Andrea and dozens of other missing or murdered young women in the small Caribbean twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. Andrea was abducted, aged 20, after catching a taxi home from Arima magistrates court where she was a clerk, on 29 January 2021. The driver, Joel Balcon, then 36, had more than 70 outstanding criminal charges against him, from rape to robbery. He had connections to at least one other missing woman, but was out on the streets as a result of, depending whose opinion you get in Trinidad, inefficiency or blatant corruption in the justice system. As it got dark, her dad repeatedly rang her phone. Eventually, a man answered and threatened to send him the ear of \u201cyour pretty daughter\u201d. \u201cI knew that was it,\u201d said Bharatt. \u201cThe way that fella sounded. I knew.\u201d Balcon is alleged to have involved two friends in the rape and murder of Andrea. Her body was found eight days after she disappeared, dumped in a ravine at Aripo Heights. \u201cAndrea was little piece,\u201d said Bharatt, 56. \u201cEvery morning she would come for a hug and put her head under my armpit. They were three big men. What they did to my child, how could a normal thinking person \u2026 \u201d He tails off, picking up a large switchblade and turning it over. \u201cI gave she this knife, but because the court where she worked take it off her, she left it at home. She didn\u2019t feel afraid. You never think these things will reach your door \u201cWas I worried about her? All the time. Today Trinidad is stinking. Sorry to say. There are demons out there. It used to be very, very rare you heard somebody killed, it would be big news.\u201d Bharatt has abandoned counselling after the therapist wept copiously at his story, but lives in fear of the crime that riddles his town. His TV displays views from his home CCTV system. Balcon and his alleged accomplice Andrew Morris, both died of \u201cblunt force\u201d injuries apparently suffered in police custody during the search for Andrea. A third man, Negus George, is awaiting trial. A Police Complaints Authority investigation was launched into the alleged beatings of the men but Bharatt is no longer interested in any of this. \u201cNone of this is justice. God will do that. \u201cWe need change. Trinidad has so much, everybody should be comfortable and happy without any problems. We need to fix it.\u201d On 29 January 2022, the body of 21-year-old Keithisha Cudjoe was also found in Aripo canyon. She had been missing for five days. Human remains in the ravine discovered in 2021 have not been identified. In April 2022, another, as yet unidentified woman\u2019s body wrapped in plastic was found in a ravine 20 miles away. In early April 2023, the body of Aneesa Vicky Ali, 33, who lived close to Aripo was found dumped in woodland. No charges have been brought. In April this year, three women died in separate shootings in Arima. Elizabeth Watson, 36, and Kernella Saunders, 35, were both killed by stray bullets fired into houses and Candace Grifffith, 41, at a birthday party. None were the intended victims. *** Ashanti Riley, 18 Candice Riley went to the vigil for Andrea Bharatt two months after her own daughter died. \u201cIt was like losing Ashanti all over again,\u201d Riley says. The 29 November 2020 was a Sunday. There was a birthday party at a cousin\u2019s house and 18-year-old Ashanti Riley walked the two minutes from home to the corner of Sunshine Avenue in San Juan to catch a taxi. Most Trinidadian housing areas are not on bus routes, so people rely on private hire, \u201cPH\u201d, taxis to get about. PH taxis are unlicensed and unpoliced. Ashanti wasn\u2019t often out on her own, but her older sister, Aaliyah, was at a sleepover and Candice was tired after a day of housework and cooking. She was missed very quickly. \u201cAshanti is not a person to let her phone get out of charge. She carried her charger. When her phone was going to voicemail I started to worry,\u201d says Riley. \u201cI think I knew then, but we wanted to be positive. We went to the police station and they were saying: \u2018She\u2019s a teenager. She is going by some man.\u2019 They didn\u2019t take me seriously. To me, the police didn\u2019t do much. They didn\u2019t do much at all. We went to the lady who has a shop on the corner with a camera [CCTV] to see Ashanti got in the PH. We putting out social media. We did leaflets with numbers on but we just had men sending us pictures of their private parts, sexual calls. \u201cFrom the Tuesday, police started questioning the taxi driver. We had just moved to the area and school was online for Covid, so neighbours didn\u2019t know I had young girls at home. So they didn\u2019t warn us about the character of the taxi driver. \u201cAfter, I had people come to my door to say: \u2018That man raped my daughter.\u2019 One father say that when his face [was shown] on TV his daughter say: \u2018Daddy, that is the man who raped me.\u2019 Before, she had not told. She didn\u2019t want the shame. \u201cWhat chance do our girls have? It\u2019s normal to get a taxi. \u201cI\u2019m very angry. They say time will ease, but it doesn\u2019t ease. I want to know why. Why he did what he did.\u201d There is no trial date set for Luciano Quash, 34, the man accused of murdering Ashanti. \u201cThe justice system doesn\u2019t give justice,\u201d says Riley. \u201cThe waiting period is just so long to see him in a court. How long can it take? Five years? Ten years? \u201cI don\u2019t know what drives these men, they see a young woman and they are so aggressive outside. In my time, it was so different, men were different. Men would soot [catcall] you. If you said no they would turn to the next girl. Now, they take it out on you, they are driven to destroy the young woman\u2019s self-esteem or take what they want. It\u2019s hard outside. \u201cSo many girls going missing. So many. Now, I celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday in a graveyard. You bring children into this life to bury you, not to bury them.\u201d Luciano Quash has since been charged with two further counts of rape against minors. *** Sharday Emmanuel, 20 The Emmanuels are a close family. Junior and Marilyn Emmanuel believe they know who killed Sharday, their daughter, who vanished in June 2018, just before her 21st birthday. No one has been charged. They now believe she had been in an abusive relationship. The day she disappeared, she left a voicemail on her friend\u2019s phone telling her she was going first to the mall and then on to meet her boyfriend to finish with him. \u201cOn CCTV, she left the mall but that was the last. We sat out on the front porch waiting and waiting, till dark. The police didn\u2019t take us seriously. One officer said leave her for a few days and when she comes home bring her in and we will talk to her,\u201d says her father. \u201cAfter, strangers were coming to me who knew [her boyfriend], telling me stories, bad things about him. After, after, after,\u201d says Junior. In 2019, Junior spotted a newspaper report that a decomposed body had been found in a deserted oil field road near the southern town of Santa Flora. He begged police to let him view the remains and believes he recognised the tie-dye fabric of Sharday\u2019s long skirt. But four years on, the Emmanuels are still waiting. \u201cI saw the material and I took out my phone and showed the officers a photo of Sharday in that skirt. They look at one another. They say they need DNA. They took DNA. But there are hundreds of cases in front of Sharday,\u201d he says. \u201cEven so, I have no faith in the lab in Trinidad, they refuse to do proper DNA testing. I would pay to send this to the US, but they refuse even to let us do it ourselves. To them she is still a missing person, not a homicide. \u201cI know my daughter is in a freezer at a forensics lab,\u201d he says. Marilyn accepts her daughter is dead. \u201cI know she is not alive. She is not here \u2013 but not knowing where, we need to know,\u201d she says. \u201cHe get away scot free for that. We have to face that each day. I\u2019m getting stronger, but for a long time I could nah sleep, I could nah function. Counselling and therapy have helped me get things out a little. \u201cWe deal with it in our own way. In Trinidad, if you don\u2019t have a gun you can get a gun, but Sharday would be furious that anyone would do something like that over she. \u201cSharday was quiet and reserved, a very kind person. She started working in a private nursing home and she liked it. She would come home and tell you all about her patients. I love to cook and she love her belly, she could be asleep and smell food and wake up hungry.\u201d She smiles, briefly. Another murder victim also discovered in the Santa Flores oilfields, in December 2017, was confirmed after five months by forensic services to be Anita Mohammed, a mother of two. *** Teri Gomez, 17 When Teri Gomez, 17, disappeared in January 2008, she left behind her daughter, Jada, whose father was Joel Balcon. In 2021, Balcon allegedly died of a beating in police custody while being questioned about Andrea Bharatt\u2019s murder. Toni Walker believes Balcon killed Teri, her younger sister, two months before he was due in court over an attack that had put Teri in hospital. \u201cI never liked him,\u201d says Walker. \u201cShe met him at school. He was far older than her but sharks prey on weaker households, and we had no father. \u201cHe used to beat her. For some women like my sister there is that wanting to be loved and afraid to be alone. That is a bad, dangerous thing,\u201d says Walker. \u201cWhen Teri got she belly my mother cried, it was the same age she got pregnant, so she blamed herself. \u201cIn Trinidad, people use you being a single mother to bash you. Teri couldn\u2019t go to school no more. She was in a lower level school so they don\u2019t care. Girl gets pregnant, she has to leave.\u201d Teri had dropped Jada off with Balcon\u2019s relatives for a visit and told her mother she was going out to buy fried chicken. She never came back. \u201cWhen mummy went to report her missing they jump to conclusions, they say she\u2019s gone by a man,\u201d says Walker. \u201cNobody looked at the cameras at KFC. I see on TV the passion people have for their jobs in police. But that effort don\u2019t happen for people who live in Trinidad. \u201cI never thought she dead. I had hope until Andrea. That rooted up all the other stories and they found other bones in his dumping ground. We gave the police DNA but we\u2019ve heard nothing. The fuss die down and nobody cares again. \u201cIt\u2019s a for ever pain, an unfathomable pain. Every time I see another girl go missing, it depletes me. I would be glad to bury my sister, just to lay her to rest. \u201cTeri was a real nice person who people could take advantage of. Anything she had, she would give you. I remember my friend\u2019s father had no stove. Teri used her first pay and bought him one. I couldn\u2019t believe that. \u201cWe have to guard Trinidadian children from these sharks out there. We have to break generational curses of violence and better protect our girls and our boys.\u201d Between 2007 and 2017, Joel Balcon was charged with more than 70 crimes, including counts of rape, kidnapping, false imprisonment, larceny, and robbery with aggravation. He was granted bail in every instance, and discharged in more than 30 cases when police and witnesses failed to show up in court. *** Shannon Banfield, 20 Bank clerk Shannon Banfield, 20, loved art and her cat and macaw. After her murder, her grandmother rehomed the parrot, no one could bear it calling for \u201cShannon\u201d all day long. She also played the piano and had an active role in her church in the Trinidadian capital, Port of Spain. \u201cShe took part in everything at school \u2013 the teachers loved her,\u201d says Sherry Ann Lopez, Shannon\u2019s mother. \u201cSomething bad happening was not even a thought when I was Shannon\u2019s age. Now, you can\u2019t keep up with how many are missing. We were free and comfortable and there was not even a thought about staying safe. For Shannon, well that same year there had been a lot of kidnappings and abductions and I had started to get scared about where she was going, where she was being picked up,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cShe found it overprotective but she understood. \u201cI married at 18, had her at 19. My husband emigrated and didn\u2019t look back, so we were close.\u201d \u201cOn the Sunday, she came home from church and laid down on the bed. Her shoes were covered in mud, so I said \u2018throw them in the bin\u2019. The next day, she was going to buy new ones after work. On the Monday, I had dropped her to the bank. She got out and I said: \u2018I love you my baby.\u2019 That was the last time I saw her. \u201cShe had called me to say she\u2019d bought the shoes and wanted to go to this store to buy a swizzle stick she had seen to beat eggs. The CCTV shows her going in but not coming out.\u201d The investigation into Shannon\u2019s disappearance was slow, says Lopez. Police presumed she had gone off with a man. The family searched the streets and hospitals before a body was found in a storage unit inside the shop three days later, on 8 December 2016. Shannon had been raped and strangled. \u201cI still haven\u2019t faced what actually happened \u2013 she was on CCTV going in, she was looking for this item and she went into the storeroom, that\u2019s all I know. \u201cThere is no grieving with homicide, I just sat on my bed rocking, I wanted to die. I stopped praying; when the pastor came by I nearly cussed him. My son was just 12 but he was my comfort.\u201d Lopez says she herself fell victim to violence when her policeman boyfriend beat her so badly she ended up in hospital weeks after her daughter\u2019s death. In December 2016, Dale Seecharan, a shop employee, was charged with Shannon\u2019s murder, but no trial date has been set. The policeman who allegedly beat Lopez has not been charged. On 8 May 2023, the body of Gabrielle Raphael, 24, was found dumped in the park close to Shannon\u2019s former place of work in Port of Spain. Recently, murdered women in the small city of 37,000 people include Camille Hernandez, found in a car park in 2020. An unidentified woman\u2019s body was found in June 2021 and Raffina Khan, 61, was stabbed in 2022."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a659", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/16/the-caribbean-island-of-trinidad-grapples-with-a-national-crisis-of-violence", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Caribbean island of Trinidad grapples with a \u2018national crisis\u2019 of violence", "lead": "Killings of women and girls in Trinidad and Tobago have reached an all-time high, while police and politicians are failing to tackle rising crime rates", "author": "Tracy McVeigh in Port of Spain", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:36:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111792", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3a475d28d7f9fa3ae450daf8a87d74b22982e0ab/0_2_2990_1794/500.jpg", "body": "The hurricane season is under way in the Caribbean, but the tropical storms that batter much of the region miss the island of Trinidad, which is protected by its northern mountain range. It is one of the reasons that the grateful inhabitants \u2013 who love their food, their vibrant carnival and beautiful beaches \u2013 like to say \u201cGod is a Trini\u201d. The birthplace of calypso, steel pan and soca music \u2013 a fusion of the African and Indian culture of these descendants of slaves and indentured labourers respectively \u2013 the tiny nation\u2019s musical influence is global. But as of last month, the murder toll across the twin island state of Trinidad and Tobago was on track to overtake last year\u2019s all-time high. As rates rise, more women are being killed than at any point in history. As of May, this year\u2019s death toll was at 280, already overtaking the same period of 2022 \u2013 a year which saw 614 violent deaths. The Caribbean nation, with a population of about 1.5 million, now has the sixth-highest crime rate in the world. Trinidad and Tobago was once the richest state in the Caribbean, but over the past two decades it has been dragged down by mismanagement of oil wealth, corruption, the drug trade and an explosion in gun crime and violence. Photos of missing women appear on social media with regularity. Headlines of shootings are weekly. For women, it is a \u201cnational crisis\u201d says Dr Gabrielle Hosein, a writer and lecturer at the Institute for Gender and Development Studies at the University of the West Indies. \u201cThe Caribbean has a significant feminist movement that is extremely vibrant, full of women who are articulate, analytical and progressive,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have been pushing for a national prevention strategy for violence against women for a long time.\u201d She believes a key problem is violence in homes. \u201cOne in five women in Trinidad and Tobago report non-partner sexual violence, one in 10 report sexual abuse as a child. Violence is so endemic that its reduction and prevention should be treated as a national emergency. The figures of child sexual abuse and incest are very, very high. By the time we get to femicide, no wonder it is also high. \u201cViolence in the family is one of the major drivers for violence that happens to women later in their lives. Whether its sexual harassment at work or on the street or intimate-partner violence, the violence becomes more and more lethal.\u201d Hosein says any efforts by the state to intervene in domestic violence or child abuse are seen as a threat to the ideology of the traditional family by predominantly Christian and male-dominated groups. \u201cSo the state is ambivalent and just not responding,\u201d she says. According to a paper published in the International Feminist Journal of Politics in 2021 \u2013 the year the murders of two young women, Andrea Bharatt and Ashanti Riley, gripped public attention in Trinidad \u2013 too many young men in Trinidad are \u201cbreaking bad\u201d. The researchers linked \u201ca lineage of violent male figures in poor neighbourhoods who were already bad\u201d to leading increasing numbers of young men into gangs \u201cwhich has mediated the pattern of new violence \u2013 the homicide boom \u2013 in Trinidad\u201d. This year\u2019s report on illicit weapons in the region states: \u201cThe proliferation of firearms in the Caribbean region is arguably a catalyst for a more violent and, in turn, increasingly dangerous environment for women.\u201d Hosein says: \u201cUnless we provide the necessary support for men and boys to rethink masculinity and to put policies in place \u2013 in education, in housing \u2013 to empower women, then the threat against women endures for their whole lives. \u201cWhen women die the questions are: \u2018Why did she stay with him?\u2019 or \u2018Why did she go out alone?\u2019 The question is never about why men are violent, or why they are acting with impunity or why the state is not challenging that. Acceptance of male violence is the norm.\u201d In 2021 and 2022, Covid cancelled carnival. Campaigners believe that a less-distracted population was the reason the murders of Riley and Bharatt gained such attention. In a response to their deaths, Phillip Alexander, a social activist and founder of the Progressive Empowerment Party, started the Candlelight Movement. Together with lawyer and radio host Kandace Bharath-Nahous, herself a survivor of an abusive relationship, he collected more than 128,000 signatures \u2013 almost one-tenth of the population and the largest ever public petition in the country \u2013 calling for action to end violence against women. However, nothing has been done, says Alexander. Carnival is taken seriously in Trinidad and Tobago. The steelbands, singers and costume designers warm up for months leading up to the annual party, which dates back to the 18th century in these, the Caribbean\u2019s most southerly islands. But Alexander believes the new \u201chypersexuality\u201d encouraged by commercial interests is part of the problem. \u201cCarnival is a two-day lapdance that distracts our population,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout it there was a groundswell of outrage \u2013 people want a better country. Only the criminals and the corrupt want the massive narco- and people-trafficking pipeline through Trinidad and Tobago, which rivals the national economy. Few countries in the world are as blessed with natural resources and culture, yet criminality is rife. Rape is normalised.\u201d He says no costumery can cover the failings of politicians and police to tackle the murder rates, of which women consistently make up about 10%. As the rates rise, more women are dying. In March, the police commissioner, Erla Harewood-Christopher, said \u201can evil had spread over the land\u201d and that reducing murder rates was \u201ca bit beyond\u201d the force\u2019s capabilities. An initial government response to the uproar over the murders of Riley and Bharatt was to announce that the use of pepper spray by women would be legalised. Later, the attorney general, Faris Al-Rawi, said permits would be needed. There have been no attempts to legislate or control the illegal \u201cPH\u201d (private hire) taxi drivers, who are widely regarded as a risk to the safety of women and girls in a country where public transport is limited and expensive imported cars are beyond the means of many. \u201cThe PH drivers are a major problem, that could be easily resolved with political will,\u201d says Bharath-Nahous. \u201cSo many girls are being taken away and never coming back. For women to feel they can\u2019t go to their own yard or to the mall without parents dropping them off is heartbreaking. The government does everything in terms of stacking things against an honest citizen.\u201d Bharath-Nahous says stories abound of rape victims being turned away by police \u2013 she describes one woman who had been abducted and raped who was dismissed by local officers as having had a fling; another who ran naked and bloody into a police station and was sent home to put clothes on. \u201cSexualisation is taught early, little boys think it\u2019s normal to gyrate on little girls,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is so much aggression if women don\u2019t do what men want them to do.\u201d When questioned about femicide in April 2022, the prime minister, Keith Rowley, appeared to shrug off the issue with a dismissive: \u201cWe are a violent society.\u201d That assessment is shared by Claire Guy-Alleyne, the police superintendent in charge of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s special victim unit, although she aims to tackle the problem. Set up by the former police commissioner Gary Griffith in 2020, the unit is dedicated to domestic and gender-based violence and child protection. Guy-Alleyne works with 250 officers who are carefully vetted and specially trained. \u201cIt\u2019s not a job for the fainthearted,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a mindset inside the police that needs to be changed. \u201cAndrea Bharratt was a case that really ignited media attention and the police worked hard to find her. But every time a girl gets killed there is a lot of attention then it all dies away to nothing.\u201d Guy-Alleyne says there is no one face of a domestic violence victim. \u201cIn poor areas, a woman has nowhere to go with her children if she wants to leave. In a rich area, where a woman has her air conditioning, a nice apartment, maybe a maid, but doesn\u2019t have a dollar in her bank account, she still cannot leave,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are still not accustomed to being taken seriously. There is little trust in police. Rape is not reported. They go home, bathe and try to see if they can live with it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen young girls go missing, people say, \u2018oh they\u2019ve gone to meet a man\u2019. They need to stop saying that, because that missing girl might end up dead. \u201cWe are seeing change. It may be small, but we have women coming forward to say, \u2018I have been in this abusive relationship for 20 years and because of the way your officers spoke to me, I am going to be able to do something about it.\u2019\u201d Across the Caribbean, Jamaica, Barbados, St Vincent and St Lucia all had high murder rates in 2022. The region suffers almost three times the global average in terms of violent deaths.

The disputes at each operator are separate to the wider national pay dispute. More strike dates across 16 train companies in England are likely to be announced soon after ballots this week reaffirmed the union\u2019s mandate for action, with overwhelming votes in favour. The strike at Avanti on 2 July is over changes to sick pay, while the union said LNER was attempting to break agreed procedures. Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said: \u201cIt is deeply regrettable that Aslef members have been forced to take this action but our members will not stand by and allow our agreed terms and conditions to be violated by the train operating companies. \u2018We have been coming to the table to try to resolve these disputes for many months, but unless the operators honour the agreements in place with our members, we will be forced to continue taking action. The companies know how to avoid this action \u2013 it\u2019s by honouring their agreements and negotiating fairly with our members. \u201cAs the recent ballot results showed, Aslef members at these companies want to continue taking action to hold their employers to account and the whole union will stand with them.\u201d The overtime ban could potentially prove more disruptive than a strike. A similar ban at TransPennine Express (TPE) was described by the operator as a significant factor in its high rate of cancellations, before the service was taken under public control last month. In rare good news for passengers, on Thursday Aslef announced it was withdrawing its overtime ban at TPE, allowing drivers to work rest days for the first time in more than a year."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a65b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/16/selling-yourself-students-personal-statement", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Selling yourself is a minefield for all of us \u2013 not just students.

Good writers have always known that distilling one\u2019s thoughts into a limited space takes effort and skill. (Bad writers sprinkle around lots of footnotes and pretend they\u2019re not included in the word count.) So it must be immensely frustrating to whittle your life story and all your aspirations into about 600 words, only to find that the recipient has merely skim-read them. That\u2019s the experience of students writing a UK university application personal statement \u2013 limited to 4,000 characters \u2013 which harassed admissions staff now only spend about two minutes reading. I sympathise with the students, who are obliged to waffle on about all the hobbies they\u2019re expected to be beavering away at while simultaneously studying for A-levels and probably holding down a part-time job. But perhaps universities are teaching them a valuable, if brutal lesson. Two minutes\u2019 attention from a time-pressed stranger is a luxury that they will seldom enjoy in adulthood. It\u2019s also more than enough time to read 600 words. So, if they can\u2019t sell themselves in a short essay, how are they ever going to get anyone to open their emails, read their Tinder profiles, or pay attention to their strongly worded complaint to the British Airways customer services team? At what age is it appropriate to learn that everyone else is just too busy to listen to you selling yourself? Increasingly, in an age of intense competition and instant communication, life is all about nailing the elevator pitch. Once they graduate, these poor students may be expected to \u201cform a connection\u201d with potential landlords by sending a letter spelling out all the ways in which they\u2019d be the perfect tenants (top tip: boil it down to \u201cI\u2019m minted\u201d). At job interviews, they\u2019ll be asked to \u201ctalk about a time when [they] demonstrated effective communication skills\u201d, and to do it in the most formulaic form of uncommunication ever devised by an HR department. Or perhaps they\u2019ll write a book \u2013 70,000 words of nuance, drama and research \u2013 and have to pitch it to a literary agent who has a hundred other pitches in her inbox. \u201cIt\u2019s Joe Wicks meets Richard Osman,\u201d they\u2019ll say. A small part of them will die inside. It\u2019s important they also realise, though, that it is necessary and sometimes revolutionary to be able to grab someone\u2019s attention and engage with them on a subject that matters. And that sometimes the best ways of doing that are the most succinct. \u201cFor sale: baby shoes, never worn.\u201d was apparently written to win a bet, but the most successful tales of recent times are shorter still: \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d; \u201cTake Back Control\u201d; \u201cStop the Boats\u201d; \u201cYes We Can\u201d. The side that wins any debate is the one that tells the best story, and usually the one that tells it briefly. When advertising copywriters do this, they understand that you must sell the sizzle, not the sausage. They describe solutions, not products, by showing the customer an image of what their life will look like when all their problems are solved. In other words, what successful pithy writing needs is empathy: the ability to put yourself in the shoes of the person reading it. \u201cGood breeding consists in concealing how much we think of ourselves and how little we think of the other person,\u201d Twain also wrote.

The Allahabad high court was acting on a public interest petition filed by Sudhir Kumar, an activist, who said he had learned from media reports that the documentary Who Lit the Fuse? portrayed India\u2019s 172-million Muslims as living in fear of the Narendra Modi government. He also alleged that it showed state agencies acting against the interests of Muslims. On this basis, Kumar argued, the documentary should not be broadcast as it would disrupt social harmony. \u201cConsidering the evil consequences that are likely to occur on the broadcast of the film \u2026 we are of the view that the broadcast be deferred pending consideration of the cause in the present petition,\u201d the court said in its ruling. The judges also said the government should ensure the documentary was not shown until it had acquired the \u201crequisite certification\u201d. The ruling has dismayed free speech activists who have accused the government of systematically shrinking the space for dissent. The supreme court lawyer Colin Gonsalves said that unlike films \u2013 which need to be certified before they could be publicly screened \u2013 documentaries did not need any prior approval. Further, he said the supreme court had clarified numerous times that the right to free speech included the right to express opinions critical of the government. \u201cThe court has said Indians have the right to hear such hostile opinions and the government has to tolerate things it might find hateful\u201d, he said. Gonsalves said the Allahabad court\u2019s pre-emptive ban was illegal. \u201cThe state can only restrict a broadcast if it might affect the security of the nation or disrupt good relations with neighbouring countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state can only ban a documentary once it has been screened. If it\u2019s screened and causes riots, let\u2019s say, then it can be banned but not pre-emptively like this, purely on the basis of speculation.\u201d This latest ruling is part of an ongoing debate within India about freedom of speech. Earlier this week, the former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in an interview that the government had threatened to shut down the company and raid the homes of its employees over posts critical of the government\u2019s handling of the 2021 farmer protests. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the deputy minister for information technology, accused Dorsey of speaking an\u201coutright lie\u201d. In January, the government prevented the broadcast of a BBC documentary that looked critically at Modi\u2019s role in riots in Gujarat in 2002. The government was so incensed at the poor light in which Modi was portrayed that it invoked emergency laws to ban links and clips of the documentary from being shared online. Free speech activists contend that government supporters are making strenuous efforts to flag any forthcoming media content that they dislike, not only domestically but also from foreign channels or platforms. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing so many cases where government supporters file mischievous complaints with the police over perceived insults to the government or the \u2018country\u2019 that it is almost a free-for-all out there,\u201d said Geeta Sheshu, the co-editor of Free Speech Collective."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a65d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/16/tesco-boss-food-inflation-has-probably-peaked-but-prices-will-stay-high", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tesco boss: food inflation has probably peaked but prices will stay high", "lead": "Ken Murphy says higher costs of grocery imports because of Brexit are partly to blame for rising prices", "author": "Sarah Butler", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:08:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111868", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/038e39e0ed98ef80132e988606e6bcdd19d780f1/27_398_3934_2361/500.jpg", "body": "The chief executive of Tesco has said food inflation has probably peaked but warns that prices are likely to stay high. Ken Murphy, the head of the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, said the price of milk, bread, cooking oil and some vegetables such as broccoli had come down this month but inflation continued in other essentials, including rice and potatoes, as aweather issues and locked-in increases in the price of labour and energy continued to bite. He urged the government to ease Brexit rules, which were driving up the cost of importing groceries. A peak in annual food price inflation \u2013 currently at 19%, according to the latest Office for National Statistics data \u2013 would not mean that prices overall would start to come down, just that they would be rising more slowly. Murphy called on the government to help tackle inflation by easing regulations linked to Brexit, which he said had made a \u201cmeaningful impact\u201d on the cost of importing groceries into the UK from the EU and from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He also said the government should consider easing business rates, which he said cost Tesco \u00a3700m last year and had doubled in the past 10 years while grocery sales were \u201clargely flat\u201d. Murphy said: \u201cWe would really welcome help in a number of different areas in ways that could help reduce the cost to serve [customers].\u201d He said price rises would continue to ease in the second half of this year but it was difficult to determine how long high levels of inflation would remain as costs were partly dependent on commodities and the cost of energy, on which long-term contracts continued to suggest prices would remain high. \u201cWe hope we will start to see an easing of aspects of inflation that will help to moderate [it]. It is unlikely prices will return to where they were but wages are higher than they were and what\u2019s important is the purchasing power of families,\u201d Murphy said. However, he said most shoppers were not experiencing the high levels of food inflation outlined in government statistics \u2013 19% in April \u2013 as they were switching to cheaper own-label goods from big brands, from fresh to frozen and buying treats from the supermarket to celebrate occasions, or to enjoy the recent spell of warm weather, rather than dining out. People are also buying less \u2013 with the number of items bought in Tesco shops down despite a 9% rise in UK sales in the three months to 27 May, with non-food particularly hit until the sunny weather arrived. Murphy added that a near 10% rise in sales at Tesco\u2019s large supermarkets was also linked to shoppers buying more in bulk and batch cooking two or three meals at once to save money. The group also did well online \u2013 with sales up 8.2% \u2013 as Tesco said it was winning share from premium supermarkets such as Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer and the online retailer Ocado. Murphy said he did not believe a price cap on grocery essentials, an idea floated by the government last month and implemented in some countries including France, was needed in the UK and denied that Tesco had been artificially holding up prices pointing to falling profit margins for the chain. \u201cMarket forces mean that UK grocery retailers are consistently having to be the sharpest possible in terms of value,\u201d he said. He said consumers were shopping around more to save money, so Tesco \u201calmost has to win every mission\u201d from consumers \u2013 with discounters opening more stores and taking share. Total sales for the group rose 8.2%, as Murphy said the group had experienced challenging trading conditions in Hungary, where it operates a number of stores, after government support was scaled back. However, strong trade at its Booker wholesale group had experienced a bounceback in custom from cafes and restaurants. Commenting at the group\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Friday on the exit of the Tesco chair, John Allan, after the Guardian revealed allegations of inappropriate behaviour, Murphy said the retailer\u2019s board had \u201cacted in the best interest of Tesco and [staff]\u201d in agreeing to his departure. \u201cIt was a difficult decision but coincides with the fact that a search for a new chairman was already well under way,\u201d he said, adding that a permanent replacement for Allan would be announced \u201cin due course\u201d. The Guardian reported last month that Allan allegedly touched the bottom of a senior member of Tesco staff in June 2022, at the company\u2019s AGM. At the time his departure from Tesco was announced, Allan said: \u201cIt is with regret that I am having to prematurely stand down from my position as chair of Tesco plc following the anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations made against me, as reported by the Guardian. \u201cThese allegations are utterly baseless, as the internal procedures undertaken by Tesco prove. Tesco undertook an \u2018extensive internal review\u2019 which included inviting Tesco employees and ex-employees to come forward on an anonymous basis if they had concerns about my conduct. \u201cTesco also conducted outreach to those who attended the meeting where the incident allegedly happened, and video footage of the meeting has also been reviewed. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing at that time or at any stage of my chairmanship at Tesco and I remain determined to prove my innocence.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a65e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/16/atlanta-cop-city-activists-push-referendum", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Activists push for referendum to put \u2018Cop City\u2019 on ballot in Atlanta", "lead": "Effort requires organizers to collect about 70,000 signatures from Atlanta registered voters in 60 days", "author": "Timothy Pratt in Atlanta", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:00:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111886", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cabbd3129addf41e8f7522f5f368f13c0129af26/20_0_5737_3445/500.jpg", "body": "A broad coalition of groups in Atlanta has launched a referendum to give voters a chance to say whether they want the controversial police and fire department training center known as \u201cCop City\u201d built in a forest southeast of the city. The effort requires organizers to collect about 70,000 signatures from Atlanta registered voters in 60 days. Then the question of the city canceling its agreement with the Atlanta Police Foundation to build the $90m center can be added to municipal election ballots in November. The push comes after an estimated thousand people who showed up at City Hall on 5 June proved insufficient to stop Atlanta\u2019s city council from approving some $67m for Cop City. Meanwhile, machines have already begun clear-cutting trees on the project\u2019s 171-acre footprint in South River Forest. The referendum faces what one organizer called \u201can atmosphere of repression\u201d \u2013 including two activists being charged with felonies last week while putting up fliers, bringing total arrests since December to 50. The largest group of arrests, on 5 March in a public park in the forest near where the project is planned, was followed by local government closing the park, effectively shutting off tree-sitting protests by \u201cforest defenders\u201d that had gone on for more than a year. \u201cWe\u2019re at the stage where they\u2019ve pushed people out of the forest, they\u2019ve arrested people \u2026 they\u2019ve fenced off the forest, they\u2019ve even begun clear-cutting,\u201d said Kamau Franklin, founder of local group Community Movement Builders. \u201cWe\u2019re at the stage where the most direct, legal mechanism to stop this project is by referendum.\u201d Cop City came to global attention after police shot dead Manuel Paez Ter\u00e1n, an environmental protester, in a January raid on the forest \u2013 the first incident of its kind in US history. The state says Paez Ter\u00e1n shot first and a special prosecutor is evaluating the case. Meanwhile, the movement opposing the project has drawn a wide range of people locally, nationally and internationally who oppose police militarization, urban forest destruction amid climate change and environmental racism. Most residents in neighborhoods surrounding the forest are Black. Most of the organizations driving the referendum are also Black-led, including the regional chapter of Working Families Power, Black Voters Matter and the NAACP. Officials from Georgia governor Brian Kemp down to the mayor have consistently referred to opposition against the center as the work of white \u201coutsiders\u201d. \u201cThat narrative is false,\u201d said Britney Whaley, regional director of Working Families Power. \u201cThis has been national, but it\u2019s also been community-grown for a few years now.\u201d Ashley Dixon, an Atlanta-area organizer, has led canvassing efforts to inform neighborhoods around South River Forest about the center for nearly a year. Her team has spoken to more than a thousand people. About 80% opposed the project once they knew about it, she said. The only academic poll on the issue to date, from Atlanta\u2019s Emory University, showed slightly more Black respondents opposed the project than supported it, with the opposite being true for whites. Atlanta\u2019s population is 48% Black. The idea for the referendum came from one that succeeded in stopping a spaceport from being built in coastal Georgia, said Will Harlan, founder of Forest Keeper, a national forest conservation organization. \u201cTo me, Cop City is the most important issue in conservation in the south-east,\u201d Harlan said. \u201cA referendum is the smartest, most democratic solution \u2026 [and] a way to find resolution and closure.\u201d Although the 2022 spaceport referendum affected a county of only 55,000 people, similarities between the two controversies point to the role voters can play when other efforts fall short. In that case, local officials \u201cdug their heels in\u201d and stopped responding to press requests or providing transparent information to the public, said Megan Desrosiers, who led the referendum. In the case of Cop City, the Atlanta Police Foundation has stopped answering press requests for at least a year, and the city of Atlanta was recently discovered to be understating the project\u2019s cost to taxpayers by around $36m. The project is planned on land the city owns that is located in neighboring Dekalb county. Because of Atlanta\u2019s ownership, only Atlanta voters can participate in the referendum. Although the city\u2019s voters haven\u2019t seen an effort like this before, California has a long record of asking voters to decide on environmental issues, said Keith Mako Woodhouse, author of The Ecocentrists: A History of Radical Environmentalism. Over time, industry and political opponents have wielded tactics ranging from creating competing propositions to airing ad campaigns to discredit environmentalists, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be scary counter-arguments. It\u2019s a matter of coming up with clear messaging\u201d to be successful, he added. Organizers of the Cop City referendum pointed to the state\u2019s heavy-handed approach to protesters as a primary concern. There have been 42 domestic terrorism charges to date. A bail and legal defense fund\u2019s members were also arrested and the state added fundraising to its criminal description of the training center\u2019s opposition. In that context, it took about a dozen attempts at finding a legally-required fiscal sponsor for the referendum, which may need as much as $3.5m to reach success, said spokesperson Paul Glaze. Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter \u2013 one of two organizations that agreed to take the sponsorship role \u2013 said the recent Atlanta Solidarity Fund arrests were done \u201cto send a message, in hopes it would have a chilling effect. We\u2019re not naive about what the threats are \u2013 but we believe our community cares about this issue.\u201d Getting into Atlanta\u2019s communities will take a massive campaign, said Mary Hooks, national field secretary for Movement for Black Lives and part of the team overseeing the signature gathering. Hooks hopes to get canvassers into at least 200 of the city\u2019s 243 neighborhoods, and said more than 3,000 volunteers had already signed up. \u201cThis is an opportunity to protect direct democracy \u2026 when so many people are being left out,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a65f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/16/boyd-holbrook-interview-indiana-jones", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boyd Holbrook: \u2018You know what I\u2019m striving for?

That film was Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the premiere took place at the Cannes film festival and, despite patchy reviews, it was met with a five-minute standing ovation in the room. As we talk, Holbrook is visibly still attempting to process the whole thing. \u201cThe level of stimuli was comical,\u201d he drawls. \u201cIt was out of sight, man. An ovation like that has a real life of its own. It goes from, you know, pure love and admiration to, \u2018OK \u2026 are you gonna stop? OK, no keep going,\u2019 to \u2018This is a bit awkward, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 to \u2018Oh, this is great. This is a moment.\u2019\u201d If you\u2019ve seen any footage from the premiere, it will undoubtedly have been the moment where Harrison Ford, having just been awarded an honorary Palme d\u2019Or by festival director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, gazes around at the room with tears in his eyes. For a monument like Ford, who has spent much of his 80 years gruffly rejecting any form of sentimentality, to be so visibly moved hits like a jackhammer. \u201cIt\u2019s been really fascinating to watch Harrison go through all of this,\u201d Holbrook marvels, simultaneously fiddling with a vape pen and a cocktail stick over Zoom, from one of the anonymously dingy backrooms that the festival usually tries to conceal from the public. \u201cIt\u2019s really touching. When you try and get your head around the perspective of what\u2019s happening in real time? Wow.\u201d Holbrook\u2019s own role in The Dial of Destiny isn\u2019t a particularly big one \u2013 he plays a henchman to Mads Mikkelsen\u2019s Nazi villain, and the bulk of his screentime is taken up with scenes of him either shooting people or desperately wanting to shoot people \u2013 but it is memorable. A lot of the film\u2019s publicity material, for instance, involves a sequence where Indiana Jones rides a horse through the New York City subway system, chased by Holbrook. It probably isn\u2019t a spoiler to reveal that Holbrook\u2019s primary motivation in the scene is a desire to shoot Jones. Although the part isn\u2019t the biggest, it clearly wasn\u2019t one that Holbrook was going to turn down. Now 41 years old, his career is exploding in all sorts of directions at once. After playing the meaty role of DEA agent Steve Murphy in the Netflix series Narcos, he recently took another step up the ladder as the Corinthian, a walking nightmare with teeth for eyes, in the adaptation of Neil Gaiman\u2019s The Sandman. On paper, he is far beyond minor henchman roles. But of course he said yes to Indy. Not only is this the sort of thing he can do very comfortably in his sleep \u2013 very few actors working today can play Creepy Violent Second Banana with his level of visceral relish \u2013 but also this is an Indiana Jones film. For him, just as for an entire generation of adults around the world, the first three Indiana Jones movies are essentially imprinted on his core DNA. \u201cOne of my first memories is actually watching those movies with my sister and my dad in my living room,\u201d Holbrook says. \u201cThat moment when they jumped out of the plane and landed on the mountain in the raft \u2026 that sense of adventure! And everybody knows Indiana Jones. It\u2019s really, really wild. It\u2019s hard to verbalise.\u201d For some, however, Holbrook is still best known as Donald Pierce, the irredeemable Creepy Violent Second Banana who spent the bulk of 2017\u2019s Logan doing his absolute best to murder Wolverine. Like The Dial of Destiny, Logan was directed by James Mangold. How does it feel, I ask, to be the first person to pop into Mangold\u2019s mind whenever he needs a piece of shit? \u201cWell, he definitely creates characters who don\u2019t think they\u2019re a piece of shit,\u201d he replies testily. \u201cIn the early conversations [for Indiana Jones] we had, he said \u2018I want to offer you this part, but I don\u2019t want to offend you.\u2019 I don\u2019t know whether that was because I\u2019d be playing a Nazi or because the role was small.\u201d Initially Holbrook\u2019s character was written as German, but he pressed Mangold for him to instead be an American who we see trying to learn German. \u201cThat\u2019s because he is such a piece of shit that no one will have him, except for Mads,\u201d he says. \u201cThis guy really just wants to belong to anybody. And it doesn\u2019t get more human than that.\u201d Born in 1981 in Prestonburg, Kentucky, Holbrook grew up with a coalminer father, an estate agent mother and, despite a strong desire to act in movies, no tangible way to enter the industry. One day, shortly after quitting a job loading and unloading planes for UPS, he ran into the actor Michael Shannon at a department store. Like Holbrook, Shannon was another Kentucky resident, and at the time he was enjoying his first real surge of fame. \u201cI just went up to him and said, you know, \u2018How do you become an actor?\u2019 And he blew my mind. He told me to get into theatre, and I realised what a simple thing that would be.\u201d Holbrook\u2019s sister got him a job running lights for a local theatre company, and before long he was scouted by a modelling agency. \u201cShe took a picture and, three months later, I get this random call to come up to New York,\u201d he says. \u201cI had never really left the state of Kentucky more than two or three times in my life, but my cousin was living in New Jersey and I stayed on her couch for three months. I got a job at a coffee shop, and got some modelling money. I tried to suck as much out of it that I knew it was taking from me,\u201d he says of the experience. He used the money to pay for film school, wrote a script, and sent it to Larry Clark (who briefly considered directing it) and Gus Van Sant (who gave him a small speaking part in Milk instead). And now, to bring things full circle, Holbrook has just found himself starring in Jeff Nichols\u2019 soon-to-be released movie The Bikeriders, alongside Michael Shannon. Did he mention their meeting in the department store? \u201cMy friend [actor] Shea Whigham did,\u201d he says. \u201cHe brought me to Michael and said, \u2018Listen, you met this kid like 10 years ago.\u2019 And Michael was like, \u2018We met where? At a department store?\u2019 He obviously had no clue. But, you know, it just goes to show you how far you can go.\u201d I had wanted to talk to Holbrook about his work outside acting, since it seemed to me as if he had a healthy spectrum of interests to stop him from getting carried away in the intangible mania of Hollywood. He sculpts, for example, exhibiting likenesses of Judas Iscariot and Jesus Christ in New York in 2008. He\u2019s a keen photographer. He has a movie script in development. But as I broach the subject, it seems I\u2019ve asked a couple of years too late. These days he just wants \u201cto be good at one thing and do it really well, and not spend my time scattered\u201d, he says. That one thing is acting. Holbrook has spent much of his career playing small roles for wonderful directors. There was Milk, of course. He was in David Fincher\u2019s Gone Girl. Like many people who filmed roles for Terrence Malick\u2019s sprawling freeform 2017 film Song to Song, he was eventually cut out of the final edit. But now he hungers for more. He\u2019s about to star in Justified: City Primeval, the wildly anticipated sequel to the beloved neo-western series, and has signed up to star opposite Samuel L Jackson in a movie called Last Meals. In the first, he plays a sleazy villain straight out of the Holbrook playbook. He describes the second as the sort of role that had previously eluded him \u201cbecause maybe I\u2019ve been a little lower on the totem pole. And the role for Sam is, I think, his best work. He\u2019s about to tell me about another piece of upcoming work, teasingly only that it is with a winkingly emphasised \u201cfilm-maker\u201d, but an offscreen representative lurking in the backroom tells him to stop before he reveals too much. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d he continues, leaning forwards. \u201cI\u2019m excited, man. I want to upgrade. All these small characters are fucking cool, man, but I want to play something bigger. I want to play the lead. You know what I\u2019m striving for? I want to give the perfect performance.\u201d For now, though, a small role in one of the blockbusters of the year will have to do. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is much better than 2008\u2019s dismal The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but doesn\u2019t quite match the perfection of the first three movies. It is very solidly the only thing it could ever be: the fourth best Indiana Jones movie. \u201cFor sure, I\u2019d take that on the chin,\u201d Holbrook slowly replies, slightly hurt, when I explain this to him. But he bounces back fast. \u201cThis movie is perfect,\u201d he announces in the next breath, very much the little boy who grew up watching this stuff and can\u2019t believe he was allowed to join in. And who can blame him? It isn\u2019t the biggest role or the best film, but you\u2019d be excited about it too. And perhaps, newly ambitious after witnessing Harrison Ford soak up a lifetime of adulation in the space of a single evening, he\u2019s excited for the day that this sort of adoration is lavished upon him. Until that day comes, though, there isn\u2019t a creepier second banana in the business. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is in UK cinemas on 30 June."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a660", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/16/patriot-front-far-right-violence", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018More extreme, more violent\u2019: experts\u2019 warning over khaki-clad Patriot Front", "lead": "Their button-up shirts and chinos have prompted mockery but experts say the far-right group is becoming increasingly violent", "author": "Adam Gabbatt in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:00:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111921", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d9c97f38a907a37c721b6909da4ebd47c48b03c6/0_394_8192_4918/500.jpg", "body": "For years, there has been an element of the ridiculous to Patriot Front and their rallies, which can look like a sort of cosplay version of a white nationalist movement. At a Patriot Front demonstration in Washington in May, more than a hundred Patriot Front members marched along the National Mall wearing matching outfits of beige or brown chinos and blue button-up shirts. The ensemble was topped off with the sort of affected accessorizing that parents subject children to at weddings: each man was required to wear sand-colored suspenders, with matching hats and sewn-on arm patches. In their hands, the Patriot Front members carried shields that were a derivative version of Captain America\u2019s defense system, and they had tight white fabric wrapped around their faces. The goal of their activity \u2013 Patriot Front aims to create a white ethno-state, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2013 is serious, but they found themselves ripe for ridicule. \u201cYou wear Walmart khakis!\u201d one bystander heckled. \u201cYou are sloppy! You are not even matching! You all have different types of pants on! Cargo pants are out! Reclaim your virginity!\u201d In the years following Patriot Front\u2019s 2017 inception, however, they have slowly grown in influence and threat, experts say. In 2023, those who monitor hate groups say Patriot Front is increasingly moving towards public displays and violence. \u201cIf you asked me about Patriot Front in 2017 or 2018, I\u2019d say they\u2019re looking for attention. They\u2019re putting up some stickers, and doing some banner drops here and there, and it\u2019s all about just getting in the news. But now it\u2019s gone well beyond that,\u201d said Stephen Piggott, a researcher at Western States Center who focuses on white nationalist, paramilitary and anti-democracy groups. \u201cI think the group is morphing from a solely propaganda-based outfit to a much more violent one, based on what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years. They\u2019re trending to much more violence, more in-person direct actions, versus putting up stickers under the cover of night.\u201d Patriot Front formed in 2017, having splintered from the white nationalist group Vanguard America in the wake of the deadly Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Led by Thomas Rousseau, Patriot Front initially focused on clandestine propaganda efforts: dropping racist literature in neighborhoods and posting stickers in public places. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Patriot Front was responsible for the vast majority of \u201chateful propaganda\u201d in the US in 2019, 2020 and 2021. In the past couple of years, the group has begun to venture more into the daylight, and held more rallies and demonstrations. The leadership has stayed the same, under Thomas Rousseau, a Texas-based extremist. But Patriot Front has changed. \u201cI think it\u2019s indicative of the movement. The white nationalist movement more broadly is getting more extreme, more hardcore, more violent,\u201d Piggott said. That violence has been seen across the US. In May, Joe Biden described white supremacy as \u201cthe most dangerous terrorist threat\u201d to the country. This week, a University of Chicago poll found that 12 million American adults, or 4.4% of the adult population, believe violence is justified to restore Donald Trump to the White House. Antisemitic incidents, meanwhile, rose in the US in 2022; there was an increase in anti-Asian American hate crimes over the past two years; and a recent FBI report found that hate crimes as a whole rose by nearly 12% from 2020 to 2021. \u201cThere\u2019s a backlash to gains made by marginalized communities: I think marginalized communities are more represented, and have become more a political force as well. The white nationalist movement also sees what\u2019s going on in terms of demographics, and are not happy with the diminishing white majority of the country,\u201d Piggott said. \u201cAnd then also really since the election of Donald Trump, we\u2019ve seen white nationalist discourse being much more mainstream. That\u2019s provided a bump for these groups in terms of they\u2019re very happy to see when elected officials and others are kind of speaking their language, using their rhetoric. \u201cI think it\u2019s almost like a green light for them to conduct the activities that they\u2019re engaged in.\u201d For Patriot Front, those activities have meant scenes like those in June last year in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. Police arrested 31 members of the group after they were found packed into the back of a rental truck with riot gear. The men, who an eyewitness told police \u201clooked like a little army\u201d, were charged with conspiracy to riot. A month later Charles Murrell, a Black artist, was attacked during a Patriot Front march in Boston, Massachusetts. The group has since held marches in Indianapolis and a rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This year, a group of about 25 Patriot Front members protested against a drag brunch in Nashville and conducted their Washington march. \u201cPatriot Front worries me a lot more than other groups because of the amount of public activism that they commit to,\u201d said Jeff Tischauser, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project. \u201cAny time you get these volatile, unhinged people coming into close contact with the public, situations can escalate. That\u2019s what I worry about, because they\u2019re in public space more than any other group. \u201cAnd you\u2019re gonna have courageous people like Charles Murrell stand up and say, \u2018We don\u2019t want you here.\u2019 That\u2019s going to be a combustible situation with the people that they have within the organization.\u201d There has been a rise in white nationalism and far-right politics in countries around the world in recent years. In Germany, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany has surged in recent polling, while last year Giorgia Meloni, whose radical-right Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, was elected prime minister of Italy. In the US, though, there is an extra threat. About four in 10 adult Americans live in a household with a firearm, and mass shootings are commonplace. A year on from Patriot Front\u2019s march in Coeur d\u2019Alene, the targeting of LGBTQ communities is a continuing risk, Tischauser said. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about Pride Month. We\u2019re worried about teachers. There are groups that are out in public, that are showing up at LGBTQ-inclusive events, harassing and intimidating participants, which include children,\u201d Tischauser said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m worried about the high concentration of guns that we have in this country, and this contentious movement that\u2019s becoming more hostile and more aggressive, it seems, by the day. And Patriot Front is right in the middle of that.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a661", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/16/george-washington-university-professor-antisemitism-palestine-dc", "primaryCategory": "education", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Inside the war tearing psychoanalysis apart: \u2018The most hatred I have ever witnessed\u2019", "lead": "A professor was accused of antisemitism.

Sheehi has never made a secret of her political commitments. Her influences include Che Guevara and the psychiatrist and anti-colonialist Frantz Fanon, and she sometimes sports a black-and-white keffiyeh, the checkered scarf associated with Palestinian resistance. Yet neither Sheehi nor her most caustic critics probably could have predicted the chain of events that followed a graduate psychology class she taught in October at George Washington University, in Washington DC. The course was normally held in person, but that day unusual, nearly gale-force winds were blowing near her home, so Sheehi decided to do class virtually. She was unaware that some Jewish students were distraught about a recent extracurricular event she had organized, where a Palestinian law professor had sharply chastised Israel, and had been waiting to raise their concerns. In a heated, tearful conversation, the students accused the law professor, and by implication Sheehi, of antisemitism; Sheehi rejected the accusation and suggested that the students were the ones suffering from unexamined racism. The saga that began in that one-and-a-half-hour seminar has torn the insular world of psychoanalysis into bitter factions; sparked legal petitions, counter-petitions, investigations, ethics complaints, disinvitations, resignations, death threats and accusations of libel; and led the president of the United States\u2019 preeminent psychoanalytic association to step down, in April, in what he calls a \u201chuman sacrifice\u201d. At every step, psychoanalysis \u2013 the intense school of clinical psychology, founded by Sigmund Freud, that studies our unconscious urges and conflicts \u2013 seems to have failed its practitioners. The two main camps accuse each other of bigotry, stifling free expression, condoning violence and betraying the creeds of their profession. Each side views itself as psychoanalysis\u2019s moral conscience: a superego battling an ugly id. \u201cThe lines have been drawn,\u201d Sheehi said from her home, whose location she asked to keep private because of threats she says she has received since the controversy began. \u201cI don\u2019t think people really get what the fallout has been.\u201d From an argument about Israel and Palestine, the Sheehi case has become a larger debate about psychology itself. Are psychoanalysts neutral interlocutors, healing one mind at a time, or activists, diagnosing society\u2019s pathologies and fighting injustice? Can someone be a nuanced and empathetic clinician, and also take to Twitter to issue thundering political judgments? The trouble has rippled outward, in open letters and listserv skirmishes and furtive back-channel emails. There are murmurs of purges, schisms, vanguards, coups. Analysts and therapists from a number of countries have weighed in, weaponizing the vocabularies of Freud, Jung and Lacan against each other. Some worried insiders get the sense that psychoanalysis is analyzing itself \u2013 and not very well. \u201cThere is nothing about this that feels like healing, or meets any of the ideals of our own work,\u201d one practitioner told me; a \u201ccollective regression\u201d has seized the profession, with respected mental health professionals \u201cbecoming babies\u201d. *** Psychoanalysis was popularized in the US by Jewish refugees from Nazi-era Europe, and its practitioners today are often older, white and Jewish \u2013 a demographic that tends to be liberal on most issues except Israel. If that is the archetype, then Sheehi breaks the mold: she is 38, Arab and queer; a professional biography says she \u201cworks on race and white supremacy, decolonial struggles [and] power configurations in class and gender\u201d, and practices \u201cfrom a trans-inclusive feminist and liberation theory model\u201d. In an interview last year, she put it more bluntly: \u201cJoin the motherfucking struggle.\u201d Sheehi doesn\u2019t spend patient sessions \u201ctalking constantly about capitalism\u201d, she told me. \u201cWhat is pertinent is that it\u2019s always a backdrop. It drives suffering.\u201d Sheehi, whose childhood and early adulthood in Lebanon was punctuated by destructive Israeli military operations, has described herself as both traumatized and resentful of the way her trauma might become fodder for \u201cracist fantasies\u201d that perceive her as a victim. Last year, she and her husband, Stephen Sheehi, a professor of Arabic and Middle East studies at the College of William &amp; Mary, published Psychoanalysis Under Occupation: Practicing Resistance in Palestine, a study examining clinical psychology in the context of Israeli occupation. Psychoanalysis, historically, was deeply influential on the fields of psychology and psychiatry, though its clout waned in the late 20th century as more accessible treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, came into favor. In the last few years, however, there has been a revival of interest: the New York Times recently speculated that analysis is enjoying a \u201cmoment\u201d, and a leftwing magazine of analytic ideas, Parapraxis, launched last year. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a new wave in psychoanalysis, with more radical politics, including on Israel,\u201d a practitioner told me \u2013 one of several, of the dozen I interviewed, who insisted on anonymity because of the acrimony aroused by the Sheehi controversy. \u201cThat shift has been in the air for a while, and there\u2019s a feeling that the shift is happening faster than some people are comfortable with.\u201d The tidal change might be said to mirror similar revolutions in the media and progressive non-profit sectors in recent years: a sometimes rapid march through the institutions by younger professionals eager to diversify predominantly white industries and call into question what they view as hoary notions about objectivity. A new model of psychoanalysis has arisen, another psychoanalyst said, focused less on sifting the individual unconscious and \u201cmore on the notion that because of the society we live in we\u2019re constantly influenced by various forms of systemic racism, and that the goal of analysis is a calling-out of prejudices and almost a kind of re-education\u201d. In 2020 the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsA) established the Holmes Commission, an investigation into racism in its field. GW\u2019s department of clinical psychology hired Sheehi in 2014 as an instructor for required courses intended to teach trainee psychologists greater sensitivity to racial, sexual, and other identities. Sheehi also became known as a vocal member of the American Psychological Association\u2019s analysis division, Division 39 (which is distinct from APsA). She resigned from its listserv several years ago, following fighting with members she feels were bigoted, but was popular enough that in 2021 she was elected Division 39\u2019s president for 2023. \u201cI have been collegial my whole life,\u201d Sheehi told me. \u201cThat\u2019s how I was able to be elected as president of a very large division. It\u2019s not like I walk into a room and punch somebody in the face, which is how they make it seem.\u201d In September, at GW, Sheehi helped organize a \u201cbrown-bag lunch\u201d with Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a Palestinian law professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, on the topic \u201cGlobal Mental Health \u2018Expertise\u2019, \u2018Therapeutic\u2019 Military Occupation and Its Deadly Exchange\u201d. Shalhoub-Kevorkian\u2019s talk argued that Israel uses global mental- health programs as a \u201ccunning\u201d way to prop up its military occupation, and called for psychologists to beware of co-optation by state projects. The talk was held on a Friday. Thirty or 40 people attended, in Shalhoub-Kevorkian\u2019s recollection, and others watched by livestream. She was surprised that the talk was recalled as controversial. The students \u201cwere very engaged\u201d, she told me. \u201cIt was very pleasant. The questions were very good.\u201d She noted that she has lectured on similar topics at the Hebrew University, often to students who are Israeli soldiers, and has rarely encountered the same blowback. \u201cI think that American academia is becoming too neurotic.\u201d Yet some Jewish students felt unsettled, according to a legal complaint later filed by the pro-Israel group StandWithUs, and decided to raise the topic in Sheehi\u2019s class the following Monday. According to the complaint, they said that Shalhoub-Kevorkian\u2019s talk had been a \u201ctwo-hour diatribe\u201d against Israel that \u201cfelt like [an] excuse to bash Jews\u201d and left students feeling \u201cvulnerable and unsafe\u201d. A student said that the talk \u201cseemed to have little to do with being a stronger clinician\u201d. (The complaint also alleged that Sheehi, earlier in the semester, had told a Jewish Israeli student: \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault you were born in Israel,\u201d implying her nationality to be shameful; Sheehi told me: \u201cThat is not something I would ever say,\u201d and called the complaint a \u201cfarce\u201d.) The class was tense. According to both the legal complaint and Sheehi\u2019s account, she responded by arguing that anti-Zionism is not synonymous with antisemitism, and framing the discussion as an opportunity to reconsider assumptions and learn from each other. The students argued that Sheehi was minimizing the threats faced by Jewish Israelis and denying Jews the right to define their identity in a way that other groups are granted. \u201cI go out of my way to never \u2018shut down\u2019 disruptive or uncomfortable topics,\u201d Sheehi wrote in the leftwing magazine CounterPunch. In her account, the students \u201ccategorically refused to engage in genuine discussion\u201d; they implied that Shalhoub-Kevorkian was a \u201cterrorist\u201d who \u201cadvocated violence against Jews\u201d and argued that the brown-bag lunch was akin to GW hosting \u201ca talk that would discuss how black men commit crimes\u201d. Shalhoub-Kevorkian, Sheehi recalled one student saying, \u201cwould readily dance on the grave of my seven-year-old niece\u201d. Sheehi disputes that she ever denied that antisemitism is a real phenomenon and says that she will be vindicated if a clandestine recording she believes one of the students took is made public. (She has also noted that the lunch event was optional, and held in a different building so that students wouldn\u2019t feel obliged to attend.) The situation deteriorated: the students complained to the psychology department; StandWithUs filed a complaint with the US Department of Education alleging that Jewish students at GW were being harassed; the university opened an administrative inquiry and hired a law firm to conduct an outside investigation; and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) announced that it would represent Sheehi, accusing GW of enabling a \u201chostile environment\u201d for Arabs and Muslims and \u201csetting a chilling precedent regarding academic freedom\u201d. As news of Sheehi\u2019s situation reverberated through the psychoanalysis world, quite a few colleagues, including many who are Jewish, leaped to defend her. The GW case, they believe, is a cynical attempt to clamp down on legitimate criticism of Zionism. As an organization, StandWithUs seems like an ideological \u201cambulance-chaser\u201d, a Jewish psychologist told me; another person views the group as a \u201cproto-fascist\u201d surrogate for Israel\u2019s increasingly far-right government. (StandWithUs disputes these characterizations. StandWithUs \u201cis a nonpartisan educational organization\u201d that fights \u201cmisinformation and hate\u201d, its co-founder and CEO, the former family therapist Roz Rothstein, said through a representative. \u201cWhile we often partner with like-minded groups on educational initiatives, we operate entirely independently of any other entity, governmental or otherwise.\u201d) \u201cThe playbook is pretty consistent,\u201d Dylan Saba, an attorney with the non-profit Palestine Legal, which recently filed a complaint alleging that GW discriminates against Palestinians, told me. (Sheehi is represented by the ADC, a different organization.) \u201cAttacking critics of Israel on the substance doesn\u2019t quite work in the way that it maybe once did, so the move from these organizations has been to try and silence that criticism altogether.\u201d He added that accusations of antisemitism may be particularly damaging to untenured professors, such as Sheehi, or students entering the job market. GW\u2019s investigators later cleared the university, and Sheehi, of wrongdoing. (The complaint with the Department of Education is still pending.) But the psychoanalytic world was already roiling with scandal. People sympathetic to Sheehi, alarmed to hear that she\u2019d been getting hate-mail and threats of violence, accused their colleagues of failing to stick up for her. A listserv hurricane gathered. Soon a deluge of messages was pouring in. Roula Hajjar, a therapist in training in New York, believes the controversy proved so inflammatory because the psychoanalytic field is Zionist to an unusual extent. When discussing other issues, such as anti-black racism, \u201cthe window is widening\u201d, she said. \u201cWhen you say \u2018Palestine,\u2019 the appetite plummets right to zero.\u201d But others had reservations, particularly when old posts from Sheehi\u2019s private Twitter page, BlackFlagHag, circulated. In her tweets \u2013 which Sheehi says were decontextualized expressions of anger about Palestinian and Lebanese suffering \u2013 she called Israeli soldiers \u201cgenocidal fucks\u201d; urged Palestinians to \u201cthrow rocks\u201d; retweeted a picture of a Molotov cocktail; wrote, \u201cIsraelis are so fucking racist\u201d and \u201cFUCK ZIONISM, ZIONISTS, AND SETTLER COLONIALISM\u201d; and urged those who disagreed to \u201cFucking learn something\u201d. On the page, later deleted, Sheehi seemed to suggest that some humans are beyond redemption: \u201cIf you \u2026 STILL entertain for even a split second that Hamas is the terrorist entity, there is literally zero hope for you, your soul, or your general existence as an ethical human being in this world.\u201d People began taking sides. *** Although the United States\u2019 two most important psychoanalytic professional organizations, Division 39 and APsA, are hardly unaccustomed to debate \u2013 the question of how to treat children who identify as transgender has been particularly divisive \u2013 the Sheehi case punctured some final gossamer of collegiality. The resulting listserv correspondence, when printed, forms a heavy sheaf of paper; the messages, all trailed by professional signatures, depict an unhappy marriage collapsing into despair and rage. \u201c[O]ur division is being ripped apart, while its president-elect\u201d \u2013 Sheehi \u2013 \u201cwatches passively to the bloodshed,\u201d Michael Singer, a psychologist in New York, wrote. \u201cThis is turning out to be a pathetic end to a once-vibrant organization. Dr Sheehi, we owe you our final breath as the life drips out of Division 39.\u201d The debate has hinged on competing understandings of identity and victimhood, but also on something more amorphous than Israel and Palestine: that generational division between a new guard that sees resistance to reform as born of structural, and often unconscious, bigotry and an old guard fighting what it sees as a radical activist vanguard. Sheehi disputes aspects of this framing. \u201cThere\u2019s a way in which this generational argument is made as an escape hatch, and a rallying cry. If you say to people, in a profession that feels it\u2019s dying, that new folks are trying to come in and dismantle everything, it activates \u2026 annihilation anxiety.\u201d Jon Mills, a Canadian psychoanalyst who has vehemently criticized Sheehi, told me by video call from rural Ontario that he sees himself as combating an unchecked leftward drift in psychology. \u201cParanoid and schizoid\u201d mentalities have gripped his profession, he said, with a cadre of authoritarians exploiting the vacuum to \u201ccastrate\u201d the leaderships of psychological organizations. In February, a moderator banned Mills from the Division 39 listserv on the grounds that his posts defamed Sheehi. (Mills disputes that characterization, and shared with me a 1,500-word letter he wrote in protest, with an appendix of evidence organized in the style of court exhibits.) It did little to quell the conflict. Thomas Greenspon, a retired therapist in Minneapolis, tried to play diplomat: \u201cDiv 39, as a gathering place for psychoanalytic thought, may be one of the few places where progress might be made on new approaches to this struggle. What threatens such progress is calling each other names and asserting diagnoses.\u201d \u201cClearly, this is a political battle,\u201d Singer replied, \u201cnot a psychoanalytic battle.\u201d One side attacks the other \u201cas reactionary and elitist, while simultaneously claiming a kind of warped victimhood for themselves as the misunderstood vanguard of the enlightened future. [...] One would think [Sheehi] would have had the decency to call off her attack dogs when she saw them devouring the Division.\u201d Carter J Carter, an outspoken supporter of Sheehi\u2019s, wrote: \u201c\u2018Dogs,\u2019 dude?\u201d \u201cWow! Are you for real, dude?\u201d Karim Dajani, a psychologist in San Francisco, wrote, also in reply to Singer. \u201cThis is a psychoanalytic forum not a forum for your racist diatribes.\u201d \u201cHow dare you call us attack dogs, Michael,\u201d Kritika Dwivedi, a therapist in Denver, wrote. \u201cWould you type the same vitriolic, disgusting and racist sentiments if you knew your patients could read this?\u201d Singer used the term again. Carter wrote: \u201cSo we\u2019re doubling down on the \u2018dogs\u2019 thing huh?\u201d A therapist in New York, Alaa Hijazi, wrote: \u201cI can say with confidence that the most hatred that I have ever personally or directly witnessed has been on this listserv.\u201d Alan Hack, also in New York, agreed that the term \u201cattack dog\u201d was inflammatory but asked why anti-Zionists were describing Israel as \u201csettler-colonialist\u201d when some Jews had objected. \u201cPlease do not invalidate my claim to how sad and triggering this is to me.\u201d Referring to a characterization of Mills as a \u201cbomb-thrower\u201d, Molly Merson, a Bay Area therapist, accused Mills, Singer and their allies of wreaking psychic violence, splattering the listserv with \u201cfragments of blood and bone and body parts. The \u2018bomb dropper\u2019 can silently slip out the back, soaking in the pleasure of the blood they have spilled.\u201d Singer says he was irritated at the other side for lobbying accusations of racism that left \u201cvery little room for disagreement\u201d. To \u201cuse that as your tactic doesn\u2019t really promote the kind of conversation that psychoanalysis is known for, which is a self-aware, introspective, mulling-over\u201d, he told me. Psychoanalysis has slipped into irrelevance, he said. \u201cI\u2019m very reluctant to have us make our re-entry to the world stage as this kind of virulent political action committee.\u201d But the old guard is also political, and has its own form of identity politics, Carter J Carter argued when I reached him at his farm in Massachusetts. A group \u201cof us [have] been bringing a critique to our field that is more critical of white supremacy, of capitalism, of the ways in which our profession conducts itself\u201d, he said. Their opponents think that \u201cif they can just establish that we\u2019re the \u2018real bigots,\u2019 we\u2019re just gonna go back under the rock that we came from\u201d. *** Soon the controversy\u2019s center of gravity began to shift from Division 39, where Sheehi had been elected president, to APsA. Unlike Division 39, which is functionally open to anyone with an interest in psychoanalysis, APsA has historically been more exclusionary: the organization only began admitting non-psychiatrists in 1988, after a legal battle, and gay analysts in 1991. In recent years, the new guard had gained a significant foothold in APsA\u2019s program committee, which organizes panels and conferences for the association. Observers were impressed by the committee\u2019s programming and its commitment to diversity, though \u201cthere were issues with the way that they ran things,\u201d someone familiar told me. \u201cIt was somewhat despotic.\u201d In February, APsA\u2019s program committee decided to invite Sheehi, who was also a member of the committee, to speak at a panel on \u201cPsychotherapy Under Wartime Conditions\u201d this June. The invitation was overruled by Kerry Sulkowicz, APsA\u2019s president, and the organization\u2019s executive committee. \u201cWe were told that we were prohibited from inviting her,\u201d a former member of the program committee, Avgi Saketopoulou, told me, speaking crisply in a faint Greek accent. \u201cNow, you have to understand that this is unprecedented \u2026 an extreme measure.\u201d In a letter to members, Sulkowicz argued that the invitation was \u201cnot in the best interests of APsA at this time\u201d, and said some members \u201cfelt uncomfortable with having a presenter who has been on record as making what some believe are statements that may constitute hate speech\u201d. Sheehi resigned from APsA: it is \u201cnot hate speech to advocate for the rights of an oppressed and colonized people\u201d, she wrote in a reply-all email, nor \u201cto call an apartheid state what it is.\u201d APsA is a \u201cwhite supremacist institution\u201d whose \u201cfalse and defamatory categorization [stokes] actual hate speech against me, threats of forced deportation, rape and bodily harm to me and my family\u201d. She added, with the phrase bolded and underlined: \u201cI will not be complicit in this violence.\u201d The executive committee, led by Sulkowicz and Dan Prezant, APsA\u2019s president-elect, refused to bend. They also disbanded the program committee, which they characterized as secretive and nepotistic. The former program committee responded with a letter casting its disbanding as a \u201csudden and reactionary\u201d purge by forces \u201cworking, knowingly or not, to preserve the reign of whiteness within psychoanalysis\u201d. Many of the committee\u2019s members had already quit in protest, and people began calling for Sulkowicz\u2019s resignation as president. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee also sent a letter demanding APsA preserve any records related to Sheehi\u2019s disinvitation as \u201crelevant to upcoming litigation\u201d. In late March, after GW\u2019s investigation had exonerated Sheehi, APsA\u2019s executive committee retreated: it contacted Sheehi to offer what she and her allies view as a \u201cfaux apology\u201d, and said that she could do the panel after all. She pointedly declined. In early April, Sulkowicz stepped down. His resignation letter argued that an \u201cilliberal, extreme left\u201d had seized control of APsA \u2013 putschists who chill debate \u201cwith reflexive accusations of unconscious or systemic bias at the first hint of questioning\u201d and \u201cseem to want to transform APsA from a professional organization into a primarily political\u201d one. He also suggested a patricidal impulse, with the new guard requiring \u201ca scapegoat, ideally a white male representing authority and privilege\u201d. Sulkowicz struck a slightly different tone when I caught him by telephone in Vancouver, where he was attending a Ted Talk conference. An analytically-trained business consultant, Sulkowicz is one of psychoanalysis\u2019s more visible personalities. (He is also the father of Emma Sulkowicz, the former activist and artist known as \u201cmattress girl\u201d for her public protest against Columbia University\u2019s handling of a rape allegation she made against a fellow student.) \u201cIt felt like resigning was the right thing to do, just to try to give them a sense that they had won and there\u2019s a bit of human sacrifice involved,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it really hasn\u2019t helped that much. I mean, it\u2019s helped me \u2013 I\u2019m hugely relieved to be out of that role.\u201d *** During Division 39\u2019s spring conference, in Manhattan in late April, a truck paid for by Alums for Campus Fairness, a pro-Israel group, circled the venue with an electronic billboard with giant portraits of Lara and Stephen Sheehi and the question: \u201cWHY IS THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION HOSTING ANTISEMITES?\u201d Inside, the conference proceeded unperturbed. Sheehi gave a well-received presidential address; her husband was a keynote speaker. People there described the conference as energetic, diverse, and, because Sheehi\u2019s supporters came and critics stayed home, wholly dominated by the new guard. Sheehi is by most accounts a commendable teacher and clinician, though \u201can activist, first and foremost\u201d, a psychoanalyst told me. And \u201cwhile I\u2019m sure this has been horrible for Lara, I think that there\u2019s a way that the scandal and the form that it has taken has served some purpose aligned with her politics. It feels both like she\u2019s the victim of something, and that she\u2019s playing out a narrative that she has some agency in.\u201d Sheehi rejects the activist-clinician distinction. Psychologists must move past the idea \u201cthat the material world doesn\u2019t exist in intimate relationship with psyches and with people suffering\u201d, she insists. \u201cAnd I think that there are a lot more people unwilling to bend that reality any more.\u201d No one seems sure what will happen next. There is talk of forming a new, social-justice-oriented psychoanalytic organization \u2013 to be built from a clean slate and unapologetic in its activist stance. There are also rumors that the old guard might start its own. Michael Singer suspects the controversy will \u201cdie away at this point, because I think Dr Sheehi and her supporters have sort of won the day\u201d. Sheehi, already president of Division 39, was recently nominated to be president of its parent organization, the APA, which has 146,000 members and is America\u2019s most important and powerful psychology organization. She withdrew from consideration, she told me, for fear of further harassment. She has been teaching her latest course remotely, due to security concerns, and says that pro-Israel protesters have been tracking her location. Almost everyone I interviewed despaired at their profession\u2019s inability to cope with the kind of conflict that mental health professionals are charged with alleviating. The saga feels like a surrender \u201cto the kind of rhetoric and brokenness that\u2019s represented all around us, in the world, that we\u2019re supposedly trying to help people fix,\u201d an analyst I spoke to said. Another analyst argued that clinicians are entitled to opinions \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for someone to have to be a clinical psychologist 24/7, in all contexts\u201d \u2013 but added, \u201cPersonally, I would die before any of my patients had direct access to my political views.\u201d I asked the analyst to diagnose their industry. Laughter that sounded like sobbing came from the telephone. \u201cInstinctively, I want to say psychotic?\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a662", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/16/trump-rivals-struggle-classified-documents-indictment", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Trump rivals struggle for attention after classified documents indictment", "lead": "Trump\u2019s latest indictment has again forced the Republican field to defend the ex-president while running against him", "author": "Hugo Lowell in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:00:42", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111962", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fc48141a90294ba39b20594c32e4be263c17bde6/0_294_3732_2239/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump is contending with grave criminal charges for violating the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice but the immediate political damage has, jarringly, been felt most acutely not by the defendant but his other rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. The indictment of a presidential candidate once upon a time would have been a major vulnerability in a Republican primary contest. Damaging details about the illegal activity might have been seized upon as examples of unfitness for office and the legal battle seen as a distraction. Maddeningly for Trump\u2019s rivals, the biggest winner politically \u2013 so far at least \u2013 of the indictment against Trump in the Mar-a-Lago documents case appears to be Trump himself, who has been the singular focus of news coverage and embraced as a martyr by much of the wider Republican party. Advisers for other campaigns have privately complained that Trump has sucked up so much oxygen that their candidates cannot get attention unless they agree to discuss Trump and his chances of beating them as though they were any other political commentator. The complaint has become so widely discussed that some Trump aides have heard about it and developed their own test: whether they could remember what any other candidate had done or said that day. The day of Trump\u2019s arraignment, a person familiar with the matter said, they could not. But what has been even more perilous for Trump\u2019s rivals has been that when they have been booked to appear on cable news shows, according to their advisers, they have to remember to be careful to give answers that they are certain will not alienate Trump\u2019s base. The careful dance of having to talk about Trump to get coverage, but also defend Trump while running against him, was on clear display after the former president was arraigned on Tuesday in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case in Florida. The rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis, Trump\u2019s closest rival in the 2024 presidential race, criticized the ex-president but only subtly, and his wider comments on the case seemed to be a general condemnation of a perceived \u201cweaponization\u201d of the justice department. Trump\u2019s former vice-president, Mike Pence, stayed in the middle after the charges in the indictment became public. He called Trump\u2019s actions about hoarding national defense information \u2013 including US nuclear secrets \u2013 indefensible but went no further in his criticism. The South Carolina senator Tim Scott and Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley gave mixed answers, initially condemning the justice department for charging Trump before later acknowledging that the evidence in the indictment was deeply problematic. The lukewarm and uncertain responses opened the path for Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy entrepreneur also in the Republican race, to get some attention for himself by coming out in support of Trump but in terms of whether Trump should be pardoned if he were to be convicted. His tweet about potentially pardoning Trump summed up the moment: none of the other candidates could give a definitive answer to that, either. The fallout from the first and second indictments has so boosted Trump\u2019s popularity among primary voters and challenged every other Republican candidate in the 2024 race that Trump\u2019s advisers believe it could help carry him to the Republican nomination. Before the indictment in the documents case arrived, Trump\u2019s advisers were hoping that Republican primary voters might dismiss it as a partisan effort, as Trump has repeatedly claimed, giving him a polling and fundraising boost, people close to the campaign said. The boost for Trump turned out to be larger than they expected. In a poll of Republican primary voters conducted by Morning Consult, Trump increased his lead over DeSantis by 4% after the indictment. Trump polled at 59% compared with DeSantis at 19%. The Trump campaign also said that it had raised more than $7m, including $2.2m at a donor event at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, in donations in the days since the indictment, more than it raised after Trump was charged in New York though the figures have not been verified. But more ominously for the Republican field, the indictment news cycle may carry Trump all the way to the nomination given the high probability of further charges stemming from criminal investigations over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The Mar-a-Lago documents case was his second indictment in two months, and Trump could be indicted for a third time in Georgia by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, who has been scrutinizing Trump\u2019s election interference in the state. Charging decisions in the Georgia case are expected to be announced starting in August, the Guardian has previously reported based on Willis\u2019s instructions to staff to work remotely in that period \u2013 just weeks before the first Republican presidential debate, scheduled for 23 August."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a663", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/16/the-crops-you-can-sow-over-and-over-to-eat-well-all-summer", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The crops you can sow over and over to eat well all summer", "lead": "Successional sowing can keep your vegetable plot productive for longer \u2013 and avoid a glut of crops", "author": "Claire Ratinon", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:00:42", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.111981", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e36fc65a00ba90962bcdc4590d8c38402b40f1be/0_0_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "The sound of the veg patch in June is riotous. There are marmalade hoverflies, buff-tailed bumblebees and cabbage white butterflies flitting by, eyeing up the (netted) brassica bed. After a sluggish start to the season, it finally feels as though the garden is kicking into gear. While there are many plants that you sow once a year (tomatoes, chillies, winter squash and aubergine, to name a few) and nurture until they\u2019re ready to be picked, there are a number of crops that you can \u2013 and should \u2013 sow more often than that. Taking a successional approach to growing \u2013 a few seeds sown every month or so \u2013 ensures that you have a regular yield of ready-to-eat crops instead of all of your harvests arriving at the same time. This week, I\u2019ll be sowing another round of lettuces (cooler than the greenhouse as lettuce germination can be spotty in warm conditions), so when those I planted in spring inevitably bolt, I\u2019ll have replacements. Lettuce is an ideal crop to have extras of, as they can be tucked into any empty spot where a plant hasn\u2019t thrived or has been razed to the ground by a slug. Beetroots also lend themselves to successional sowing because for most, a steady supply of harvestable roots is better than having a lot ready to be pulled up at once. Being able to harvest little and often is preferable to being overwhelmed with a glut (unless you\u2019ve got the time, energy, skills and room to preserve crops that lend themselves to that process). I\u2019m also going to sow some additional courgette and cucumber seeds so I have young plants ready to take the place of the first succession. If the weather is on my side (depending on when the first frost arrives to kill them off), I\u2019ll be harvesting their fruit as late as October. Another crop I\u2019ve found to be worth re-sowing around now is climbing beans: like courgettes and cucumbers, they can crop well into autumn, but the plants that went into the ground in early May will have run out of steam by then. I don\u2019t bother taking the older plants out of the ground or attempt to unravel them from their support structure as this can be challenging and disruptive. Instead I just put the new plants next to the old ones and let them grow into the tangle of vines, occasionally pruning out the ageing, yellow leaves and being extra diligent when picking as there\u2019ll be even more heart-shaped foliage for the beans to hide behind. I especially like this approach to sowing and growing because it can help us get the most out of a modest growing space. With a little planning, you can have a productive crop in every pot and patch of soil throughout the seasons."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a664", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/16/tips-on-how-to-survive-camping-whatever-the-weather", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gimme shelter: tips on how to survive camping, whatever the weather", "lead": "Festival season\u2019s here, and soon the school holidays, so get the tent out.

David Scotland, the owner of Outdoor World Direct, says: \u201cAvoid taking naps in your tent during the day as this can lead to heatstroke, as one of my friends discovered at Glastonbury!\u201d To combat the heat, Scotland suggests buying a TC/polycotton tent, which is breathable, ideally with UV protection and blackout bedrooms. Combine this with a lightweight summer sleeping bag (1-2 season rating). \u201cAnything higher than this will be uncomfortable.\u201d He also recommends a solar camping fan for hot spells. Max Schmidt, from the tour operator CamperDays, suggests buying a cooling mat to sleep on. \u201cWhen body pressure, weight and motion are applied, a gel inside the mat is activated, which will absorb body heat and reduce body temperature,\u201d he says. \u201cIt provides an instant cooling sensation to ensure a comfortable sleep on a balmy night.\u201d If sleeping on a traditional airbed, Scotland says it will need topping up each night as hot air causes it to deflate. Thomas Drake, the founder of CampStead, advises pitching in a spot that is shaded from the midday sun. \u201cPlan to pitch somewhere where the sun is hitting your tent from early morning to around 11am, then from 3pm onwards,\u201d he says. If this isn\u2019t possible, he suggests using a reflective tent cover. If sleeping with the tent open on hot nights, Drake recommends buying a net attachment: \u201cThese act in a mosquito net fashion, keeping cool air flowing but keeping unwelcome insects out.\u201d Drake\u2019s other must-have is a cool box. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have access to ice, just keeping your food and drink in a cool box will do wonders for keeping things fresh for at least your first couple of nights,\u201d he says. \u201cTo combat the heat even further, apply tinfoil to the roof of the box to reflect the heat.\u201d Becky Masih, of campsites.co.uk, suggests taking frozen bottles of water or milk to use as ice blocks that can be drunk as they melt. If you\u2019re camping at a festival or at a no-frills site, Dan Yates, the founder of Pitchup, suggests leaving a few bottles of water in the sun to warm up. After a couple of hours, they will be ready for a lukewarm DIY shower. \u201cMaintaining a cool and comfortable body temperature is crucial when camping in hot weather,\u201d says Yates. Schmidt has a word of caution. \u201cYou may have heard that hanging up wet towels in tents can keep interiors cool, but this only works if the towels are 100% cotton,\u201d he says. \u201cIn any case, this creates a humid atmosphere that can lead to a buildup of mould.\u201d Best keep those towels for drying off after a cooling swim. Forecast: rain If you\u2019re well prepared, rain doesn\u2019t have to ruin your camping trip. To withstand heavier rain, \u201cLook for a tent with a minimum of 3,000mm hydrostatic head value \u2013 5,000mm is even better \u2013 which should prevent leaks,\u201d says Scotland. You could also consider a carpet and footprint for your tent; some come with these as part of a bundle. \u201cA footprint adds an additional layer of protection from the wet ground and a carpet offers insulation and homeliness to the interior.\u201d Another helpful feature is a porch. \u201cSome tents have a porch or pre-attached awning that provides a covered seating/dining area ideal for wet conditions,\u201d says Scotland. \u201cIn the absence of such features, tarps are inexpensive, offer shelter and can be erected easily, even using walking poles.\u201d Ali Paice, the founder of Bert\u2019s Kitchen Garden campsite, is also a fan of tarps. \u201cGazebos might seem like a good idea, but they\u2019re not designed for exposed places like a camping field,\u201d she says. \u201cTry a tarp instead \u2013 I like Snow Peak\u2019s Amenity Tarp \u2013 which will provide you with the shelter from sun and rain and is designed for the landscape.\u201d Drake suggests pitching under trees if possible, which will provide some protection from the rain. Failing that, \u201cIt is a great help to set up a diagonal, open awning over your tent that will shelter it and direct rainfall away from your pitch area.\u201d Drake\u2019s other top tip is lining backpacks and tent bags with bin liners to prevent a premature soaking. Scotland warns that biting insects love mild, wet conditions. \u201cI recommend keeping your fly sheets zipped and taking insect repellent and bite relief,\u201d he says. If the rain stops before you leave, let your tent dry out on the campsite before packing it away. If not, pitch it back home so you can clean it, air it and make any repairs. \u201cThis prevents mould and bad smells from developing, which ruins the tent,\u201d says Scotland. Forecast: wind Wind is probably the most dangerous weather for campers. \u201cIf the forecast is saying high winds, gale-force winds or severe weather warning, I strongly recommend arranging alternative accommodation or rebooking your trip. Sometimes we just have to accept defeat,\u201d says Scotland. \u201cIf high winds greet you unexpectedly at night, use your car as a windbreak or seek emergency shelter in your vehicle.\u201d However, an ordinarily gusty day can be dealt with. \u201cIf you\u2019re heading to a location that is more exposed to wind, such as those on the coast, look for a tent that has Tension Band System (TBS) II, which offers extra stability,\u201d says Scotland. Drake suggests sleeping in a smaller tent than usual, as bigger ones catch the wind more easily. He also advises setting up your tent with the lowest side facing the main direction of the wind, as this reduces surface area and lowers the chances of it becoming airborne. Try to find a sheltered pitch, and ensure all pegs are hammered down at 45-degree angles as tightly as possible. Peg two guy ropes at the corners. When sleeping, lie with your head or feet in the direction of the wind, to ensure less tent movement throughout the night. Useful equipment includes a tent repair kit, in case of damage from flying debris, and a camping fire guard to protect your stove or campfire. Forecast: cold Camping can be cosy during an unseasonable cold snap \u2013 with a bit of planning. Drake says pitch location is important: \u201cA bordered pitching area will shield your tent from any cold breezes that may sweep through the campsite. It will also be key to keeping your campfire going.\u201d He recommends packing lots of layers, ideally cotton or wool, to maintain heat and avoid sweating. Hand warmers can be used to heat sleeping bags, says Drake: \u201cPlace one at the foot of the bag, one in the middle and one in the neck \u2013 this is the outdoor enthusiast\u2019s answer to an electric blanket!\u201d Yates suggests putting your clothes for the next day inside the bag with you, so they\u2019re warm when you put them on in the morning. A hot-water bottle wouldn\u2019t hurt either, and you could add a (non-electric) blanket on top \u2013 the best are made from sheep\u2019s wool \u2013 or even consider investing in solar- or battery-powered heaters. Finally, Drake says, bring or collect plenty of firewood and kindling to start your campfire and maintain it. As Masih says, \u201cNo camping trip is complete without hot chocolate and marshmallows.\u201d And no one cares about the cold when they\u2019re toasting marshmallows over a fire."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a665", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/16/ben-howard-music-interview-is-it-every-kingdom", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It felt like a falling apart\u2019: Ben Howard on returning to music after two strokes", "lead": "When he suffered two mini-strokes last year, Ben Howard felt like \u2018the world was pouring in\u2019.

Without warning, for an hour, the Brit award-winning singer-songwriter completely lost his ability to speak. \u201cAll my other senses became really heightened,\u201d he says, via video call from the dressing room of the Coliseu do Porto, where he\u2019s playing later. \u201cIt was an overload of information, like the whole world was pouring in at once. I felt really hypersensitive to everything: the light, and the sound of the trees, and the leaves, and the wind \u2026 I was still compos mentis, but I didn\u2019t have the words to explain it. It was over in an hour. And then, a month later, it happened again.\u201d Howard later learned that he had suffered two transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), also known as mini-strokes. He describes them now as \u201ca before-and-after moment\u201d that profoundly shaped his fifth album, Is It?. Working with Nathan Jenkins, AKA the Bullion, a DJ-producer who first won notoriety layering Beach Boys samples over J Dilla-style beats, Howard has created a record where his voice and guitar interact with inventive electronic elements, manipulated vocal samples and atmospheric drum-machine programming, to \u201ccreate the story of that experience\u201d. This new music is a far cry from the earnest folk with which Howard began his career, scoring a Mercury prize nomination with his 2011 double-platinum debut, Every Kingdom. That album was steeped in the influences his parents had schooled him in when he was growing up in Devon \u2013 classic singer-songwriters like Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Neil Young and Van Morrison. His favourite, however, was troubled, mercurial maverick John Martyn. \u201cI\u2019m still in love with his records,\u201d Howard says. \u201cMy whole guitar setup is ripped off John Martyn\u2019s early 70s rig.\u201d Two years later, Howard won best British male and British breakthrough act at the Brits, while his second album, 2014\u2019s I Forget Where We Were, topped the UK charts. Success didn\u2019t make Howard very happy, however. In interviews, he bristled at being mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Ed Sheeran and Paolo Nutini, and developed a reputation for tetchiness. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a hugely positive impact on me, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d he says now. \u201cEvery artist gets put through the same churning machine when it\u2019s at that scale. It was all quite quick and full-on, and it made me quite guarded and suspicious.\u201d Cherishing early childhood memories with his father, Howard says that on this album he is \u201cwriting about life, love and the savouring of it. Richmond Avenue is about wishing childhood would last for ever \u2013 not in a sense of \u2018Time is running out!\u2019, but more, \u2018What beautiful moments we get to experience sometimes\u2019. I\u2019ve written records about apathy and depression and heavy subjects. This is not that, it\u2019s more an outpouring of affection for people and places.\u201d Feeling hemmed in by the expectations of the industry and his fanbase, Howard says that he grew \u201ccreatively restless. I\u2019m always scrambling for new ideas. I have a lot of trouble with what is expected of me, in terms of records. The most difficult thing in creating music is this craving from others for familiarity, a feeling of ownership over you.\u201d Recent albums have seen Howard try to shake loose those expectations. For 2021\u2019s Collections from the Whiteout, he worked with Aaron Dessner of the National, having fallen under the spell of Big Red Machine, Dessner\u2019s starry collaboration with Bon Iver. \u201cI just loved the sound of their records,\u201d Howard says. \u201cI was quite honest about it: I just wanted to make a record like that.\u201d Dessner\u2019s approach, the antithesis of his own in the studio, proved a tonic. \u201cAaron was loose, not fussy. He was really proactive, encouraging me to explore. I\u2019ve overthought previous records, and drawn some of the energy out of them. But with Aaron, I didn\u2019t have to get it right the first time; I could throw things around and see what happened. He\u2019d run drum machines through iPhones!\u201d Still, for all the experimentation of that collaboration, Is It? marks an emphatic paradigm shift for Howard. \u201cThis one was spontaneous, fluid,\u201d he nods, adding that he relished Bullion \u201cpresenting me with directions I wouldn\u2019t have thought of myself, these serendipitous moments when we found each other, creatively.\u201d While Howard and Bullion came from different musical worlds, they found much common ground, bonding over a shared obsession with Martyn and working a sample from Linda Thompson\u2019s first solo album into the song Days of Lantana. \u201cI was enamoured with what we were making, and made a decision not to undermine it early on,\u201d Howard says. \u201cWe did most of the work on this record in 10 days.\u201d While he had already begun work on the album before the mini-strokes, the experience \u201cfed into the writing. Lyrically, it was hard to avoid,\u201d he says. \u201cI wrote these songs to see if my faculties could actually maintain the act of songwriting. There was a fear I wouldn\u2019t be able to write songs any more. I was struggling with memory in the fallout of the TIAs, struggling with words, and I was quite tired. But the songs came, and when they did, it was clear that this experience was preoccupying me constantly.\u201d Is It? is no grim account of a near-death experience. Total Eclipse, a disorientating 90-second interlude matching broken fragments of speech to looped samples and abstract sounds, \u201crecreated the feeling of the experience itself\u201d, he says. \u201cPeople told me they weren\u2019t sure about it, that it made them uncomfortable. And I realised that was the point, and it was OK.\u201d The opening track, however, references the attack with its refrain of \u201cwhistling wind / strange to me\u201d, but its beatific mood and gently wry title, Couldn\u2019t Make It Up, temper any sense of trauma. And But while the spectre of mortality is present on songs such as Days of Lantana (where he sings \u201cdays are numbered\u201d) and Richmond Avenue The powerlessness he felt in the face of the TIAs, he says, fuelled the gently philosophical nature of songs such as Spirit, which is about \u201chow much choice we actually have in the direction of our lives. I just found it incredible that one slight anomaly, a little cell in your brain, can undo this human that you have built over so many years. That it could put you right back to existing in a world that\u2019s simply feelings. If memory is gone, life becomes a very different experience.\u201d While tests to ascertain what caused the attacks proved inconclusive, Howard says his lifestyle is at least a little healthier than before: he\u2019s a non-smoker now. His darkest moment came when he visited the stroke clinic after the second attack and saw \u201cpeople who\u2019d had full strokes, people with complete, permanent loss of speech, a loss of faculties. That was quite terrifying.\u201d His relationship with his own mini-strokes, however, is almost sanguine. Rather than an ordeal, these still-unexplained attacks have been for Howard a learning experience, a chance to reacquaint himself with the fragility of life. \u201cA flood of anxiety came with the first attack \u2013 it felt like a falling apart,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the second time, when I knew what was happening, I was more comfortable. For an hour, I just existed in a world of confusion, light, sound and feelings.\u201d He grins. \u201cMy partner and I had a laugh with it; I tried to read her the text on a cereal box, but all that came out were random words. I was able to sit and wonder about this rogue thing that was happening. It was a brief glimpse into something really strange and surreal.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t know if the attacks and his recovery have changed him hugely. \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps a question to ask the people around me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I feel more positive and I enjoy small things a lot more; just sitting in the park the other day was very nice. I don\u2019t know if I would have spent time doing that before.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI would probably just have been smoking.\u201d Is It? is out now."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a666", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/16/frozen-coffee-cubes-and-hot-wax-10-diy-beauty-treatments-from-the-experts", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Frozen coffee cubes and hot wax: 10 DIY beauty treatments, from the experts", "lead": "Need a little pampering and primping but no time or budget for the salon?

Freeze black coffee into cubes (try Muji silicone round ice cubes tray, \u00a35.95) to reduce facial puffiness and improve circulation. Alternatively, the vitamin B2 in frozen green tea can help maintain collagen levels, hydrate and reduce inflammation, while chamomile tea can calm and ease redness. Rinse the ice under water quickly to take the burn out of it, then roll it with light pressure across the skin under the contours of your cheekbones, around the eye area (to reduce puffiness), along the jawline (to sculpt), across the chin and down the sides of the neck. Repeat on both sides, then splash the face with cold water to remove residue. Next, try intra-oral massage to lift, sculpt and relax the face. Wash your hands and insert a thumb into your mouth on the inside of your cheek \u2013 with your fingers on the outside. Massage your inside cheek and gumline with your thumb, gently pressing from the outside with your index finger and pushing back towards the base of your ears in a sweeping motion. Repeat on both sides, then run your fingers directly down the sides of the neck for added lymphatic drainage. Now apply a mask, or a double layer of moisturiser rich in ceramides (fats that help lock in moisture and protect the skin).\u201d Ease tight shoulders Functional movement therapist Nicholaus Salinas says: \u201cFor the upper trapezius, the muscle which runs along the top of your shoulders, the trigger point you need to release is halfway between the top of your neck and end of your shoulder. Right in the middle there\u2019s a meaty part. Grip that with two or three fingers of your opposite hand (or hold a tennis ball there), then grab your wrist with the other hand and gently pull downwards. Tilt your head towards that shoulder, then turn your face slightly upwards. Breathe into it and hold for 60 to 90 seconds.\u201d Try DIY reflexology Reflexology practitioner Tracey Smith says: \u201cIn reflexology [a touch therapy based on the theory that different points on the feet, lower leg, hands, face or ears correspond with different areas of the body], the neck reflex points are at the base of the big toe on the underside of the foot. It can be worked by rubbing in small circles or straight lines up from the beginning of the ball of the foot towards the narrow part of the big toe (between the two toe joints). If you feel discomfort in the foot, hold and apply pressure to that point until it passes to release the tension.\u201d Wax your legs Beauty therapist Bella Ciccone says: \u201cYour hair needs to be a quarter to a half inch long for the wax to grip. Exfoliate your legs 24-48 hours before to remove dead skin cells and prevent ingrown hairs and avoid sun exposure, tanning beds and self-tanners for at least 24 hours. I recommend a small wax pot, as pre-made wax strips don\u2019t give the same result (Mylee does a wax kit, \u00a336, Amazon, which includes a pot that heats up and keeps wax at an even temperature). Check the wax temperature on a small area of leg, then lightly dust skin with talcum powder to absorb moisture. Use a wooden spatula to apply a thin and even layer of wax in the direction of hair growth on a small section of your leg. After a few seconds, once the wax is tacky, press a waxing strip down firmly in the direction of hair growth, leaving a small section at the end to grip. Hold your skin taut with one hand, then pull off the strip against the direction of hair growth in one swift motion. Work on small sections at a time and don\u2019t wax the same area more than twice, as this can thin the skin. Remove leftover wax with a post-wax or baby oil. Finish with a soothing layer of after-wax lotion or aloe vera gel.\u201d Trim your tresses Hairdresser George Northwood says: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to give longer hair a quick trim \u2013 leave anything shorter or more specialist to the professionals. You\u2019ll need a Japanese carbon comb (they don\u2019t slip through hair), two clips to section hair and cheap hair scissors (a fancy sharp pair is dangerous if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing!). Part your hair naturally, then split it in half, giving yourself pigtails. Pin one side up, combing the other down. Sandwich the hair between your first two fingers, and pull it down straight, leaving a centimetre below your fingers. Rather than cutting straight across, slowly \u2018point cut\u2019 \u2013 taking little upwards, diagonal snips, stopping when your hair feels healthy. Repeat on the other side. Do this in sections if you have thick hair. Take the clips out and comb hair down to check length.\u201d To trim a fringe, either side of your parting, take a little bit of hair in a V-shape (the natural shape of your fringe) that starts about an inch behind where your hairline begins, clipping the rest back. Comb this section and pull it down between your first two fingers and gently point cut into the hair. Work in sections from the middle outwards, so when you\u2019re happy with the first one, take the next section of fringe and leave it ever so slightly longer than the previous one \u2013 repeat with a third outer section if your fringe is thick. At the edges, trim your fringe following the shape of your eyebrows so it blends into your hair \u2013 rather than being too blunt. Comb your hair to check everything is even. Give yourself a pedicure Remove old nail polish, then trim and shape toenails. The best shape is straight across with slightly rounded corners \u2013 too short or pointed can increase the risk of ingrown nails. Bathe the feet in epsom salt for 10 minutes to soften skin, then dry and remove hard skin using a foot rasp or pumice stone. Massage in foot cream and gently push back the cuticles with a cuticle stick. Remove cream from the nails with polish remover before painting them. Look for polishes that offer long-lasting wear and a glossy finish. Start with a base coat, then apply two thin coats of polish, leaving 15 minutes between each coat. Finish with a top coat (I like Seche, \u00a38.95). Use a foot rasp between pedicures for healthy feet and always apply foot cream before bed (I like Margaret Dabbs London Foot Hygiene Cream (\u00a322).\u201d Sort out your brows Founder of Blink Brow Bar Vanita Parti says: \u201cTinting brows evens them out, adds definition and gives them a bit of gloss. Only go one shade darker, to enhance your natural brow colour, and do a patch test 48 hours before. Cleanse skin, then apply a little petroleum jelly where you don\u2019t want the colour to catch. Mix the powder with the developer and take it across your brows \u2013 the wooden sticks are useful for beginners, but someone with experience can use the mascara wand. If you\u2019re a newbie, do one brow and leave it on for two minutes, then take it off so you can gradually build up the colour. Leave tint on for a maximum of five minutes. You might be a bit surprised by the change if it\u2019s your first time; remember though, brows may seem very obvious when you look at them closely in a mirror, but step back and everything looks balanced \u2013 plus, they will fade a little. Once tinted, map your brows. Put a pencil on the outside edge of your nose, facing straight up. Where it hits your brow is where the brow should start. Then keeping the pencil on the edge of your nose, swivel it to your iris \u2013 that\u2019s where the arch of your brow should be, and finally, swivel it to the end of your eye \u2013 that\u2019s where your brow should end. Draw those parameters with an eyebrow pencil and only tweeze the hairs outside that shape; apply aloe vera to calm skin and close pores.\u201d Dye your hair Hairstylist Michael Douglas says: \u201cIf you want to lighten or cover 100% grey hair, permanent dye is best, but semi-permanent is fine for tackling stray greys. Do a patch test to check you aren\u2019t allergic. It\u2019s best to dye unwashed hair, thanks to the \u2018acid mantle\u2019 \u2013 a thin layer of natural oils which protects the scalp. Brush hair thoroughly and wear an old dressing gown and gloves. Usually you\u2019ll need two packs of dye, particularly if you have long or thick hair, but mix both for simultaneous use. Apply petroleum jelly to the ears and under the hairline to protect skin from dye and have a tissue ready to wipe away drops. Start at the back of your head \u2013 you can usually feel the product on your scalp, so it\u2019s easy to tell if you\u2019ve missed a patch. Check pack instructions, but dye is usually left on for 25 minutes for roots and 10 minutes for ends. If you only want to touch up roots, make sure the dye doesn\u2019t overlap with your existing hair colour. A tint brush (available from Amazon) gives a little more precision. Afterwards, use a good shampoo and conditioner (OGX Colour Retention, \u00a33.99 from Superdrug, is great). Keep coloured hair out of the sun and minimise heat styling. Permanent hair dye fades slightly after about eight weeks and will grow out at a rate of around 1.5cm a month. Semi-permanent dye should wash out completely after around 28 washes, or two months.\u201d Treat your eyes Facialist Lauren Hughes says: \u201cFor dark circles, an eye cream containing caffeine is the next best thing to a good night\u2019s sleep as it constricts blood vessels under the skin (try Boots Ingredients Caffeine Eye Cream, \u00a36). A cream applied with a rollerball that\u2019s been kept in the fridge is great for puffy eyes \u2013 sweep it from the inner eye corner to the temple to drain lymph buildup. As a treat, silicone undereye patches can be put over any eye cream and help lock in more moisture, making skin look extra plump (I like Beauty Bay reusable patches, \u00a37.50).\u201d Do an at-home mani Manicurist Georgia Rae says: \u201c\u2018Gently push back cuticles (I like Navy tools, and use a tool called a Doris to do this) and nip away any obvious dead skin, taking care not to cut any living tissue. Use a file with a grit of 240 or higher (the higher the number, the gentler the file) to shape the nails roughly to the length you\u2019re happy with. My favourite shape, which suits most hands, is the \u201csoft square\u201d. Hold your hands with your palms facing you to check they\u2019re all the same length. Then take the file down the sides of the nail to shape them in ever so slightly, by gently gliding the file along the sides of the nails to make them slightly narrower, giving the illusion of a longer nail bed. Gently file along the free edge and over the corners, using strokes in the same direction rather than a sawing motion, stopping and assessing from different angles until you\u2019re happy. Buffing is optional, but it can help with adhesion of nail polish as it removes oils and debris. It also give nails a natural sheen. Use an exfoliating scrub (I like L\u2019Occitane One Minute Hand Scrub, \u00a39) and wipe any excess oils away with nail polish remover. A base coat prevents the polish from staining the natural nail, however, plenty of ranges don\u2019t need a base coat, like Essie Gel Couture.\u201d Alternatively, some base coats are beautiful worn alone like Chanel La Base. With each coat, get as close to the cuticle as possible and do one stroke up the middle of the nail, then a stroke along each side. Use light pressure to glide the brush over the nail as opposed to dragging it to avoid streaks. Apply two coats of colour and leave 5-10 minutes between each coat. Apply a top coat to give nails that plump, juicy look. To tidy up mistakes, dip a small brush, like an old lip brush, into nail polish remover and wipe over. Once the polish is dry, follow up with a moisturiser and a cuticle oil. For gel polish I have one piece of advice: go to a professional. Hair and makup: Sarah Cherry.

Flaming katy thrives in a bright spot, making it an excellent addition to a sunny windowsill or a well-lit corner. How do I keep it alive?

Ensuring water for cooling the plant was a priority, he said, adding that the station could operate safely for \u201csome time\u201d. Gunfire briefly halted Grossi\u2019s convoy as it headed back to Ukrainian-held territory following the visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, but the delegation was in no immediate danger, a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato\u2019s secretary general has revealed.

Promise something that, according to the collective wisdom of financial markets, was about 95% likely to happen anyway. Thus the first of the prime minister\u2019s five new year pledges to the British people was this: \u201cWe will halve inflation this year to ease the cost of living and give people financial security.\u201d Never mind the fact that the Bank of England \u2013 not the government \u2013 sets interest rates to tackle inflation. Sunak\u2019s calculation, one assumes, was that an easy win was on the cards and he could scoop the credit by being the person who had set the target. Less than six months later, the safe bet looks substantially less safe. Inflation was 8.7% in April, confounding the Bank\u2019s forecast that a faster fall would materialise as we passed the anniversary of higher energy costs. The City consensus for May\u2019s reading, which will come next week, is about 8.5%. Andrew Bailey, the governor, has conceded that inflation is \u201ctaking a lot longer\u201d than hoped to come down. An embarrassed Threadneedle Street is reviewing why its models have proved so wonky. The gilts market has taken a look at this mess and understandably decided that interest rates will be higher for longer because inflation in the UK is stickier than elsewhere. A halving of inflation this year is still possible but nobody appears to have a handle on the interplay between wage increases, a tight labour market, the second-round effects of energy costs and, possibly, corporate pricing power. In any case, a halving from what to what? When Sunak made his promise on 4 January, the latest published reading was the November 2022 inflation figure of 10.7%. The number for December was 10.5% and January 2023\u2019s turned out to be 10.1%. Which one did the prime minister mean to be used? Or perhaps he was referencing a quarterly rate, rather than a monthly one, which would have some logic. Or perhaps the vagueness was deliberately cunning. Whatever the truth, the odd half-percentage point may matter to the final reckoning of the \u201cpromise\u201d. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) last month forecast that year-end inflation will be 5.4%. The blurry nature of the pledge is one reason why Sunak should never have made it. The main reason, of course, is that the government should not be seen to compromise the operational independence of the Bank in any way. Parliament sets the target for inflation - 2% \u2013 and the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is accountable for delivering it. That\u2019s how the system works. The script is not meant to involve the prime minister confusing things by airing additional targets. Mervyn King, a former governor of the Bank of England, suggested in an interview with LBC this week that Sunak\u2019s inflation promise was \u201cnot wise\u201d. You bet. It was dumb and improper. Jagjit Chadha, the director of NIESR, went further last month and argued it was \u201ca complete mistake\u201d to set a target. \u201cThe government should not be stepping into that space. In my own view, it has provided a focal point for 5% inflation this year, and contributed to the persistence [of high inflation], by making people plan around that halving,\u201d he said. In the circumstances, Sunak is in no position to grumble if the promise returns to bite him \u2013 and if consumers, mortgage borrowers and businesses vent their anger in his direction. The prime minister set a target that was not in his power to deliver, and he ignored political convention to do so. The numbers may yet align for him as more rate hikes arrive, but the little political stunt will still have been seriously ill-advised."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a66a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/16/first-thing-trump-faces-second-defamation-suit-from-e-jean-carroll", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Trump faces second defamation suit from E Jean Carroll | First Thing", "lead": "The New York writer who last month won a $5m jury verdict against Donald Trump is suing him again, this time for $10m", "author": "Vivian Ho", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 09:47:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112124", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/de2c6893821bc0e347fbdcadaf10ee6209dad421/0_226_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning.

In Miami, Trump faces 37 federal criminal charges over his alleged mishandling classified documents \u2013 including 31 violations of the Espionage Act. In New York, the Manhattan district attorney has charged Trump with covering up hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and in a town hall the day after the $5m verdict, he called Carroll\u2019s account \u201cfake\u201d and labeled her a \u201cwhack job\u201d. Trump is celebrating, however, after a suburban New York prosecutor said yesterday she had closed a multi-year investigation looking into whether Trump or his company misled authorities to reduce taxes on properties they own.

The Ecuadorian, strongly linked to Arsenal back in January, will cost around \u00a380m and is said to have his heart set on a move to Stamford Bridge and an alliance with their new manager, Mauricio Pochettino. The Gunners have been sent back to the drawing board, or perhaps their bank manager\u2019s office, by West Ham after their initial \u00a380m offer for Declan Rice was rebuffed. The Guardian\u2019s Jacob Steinberg reported last night that the Hammers are intent on holding out for a fee of \u00a3100m. In another earth-shattering transfer development, and sticking with those illustrious Premier League London clubs, it\u2019s being reported that Kai Havertz has given the nod to a switch from the over-staffed Chelsea dressing room to Arsenal. The only potential sticking point is that the Blues haven\u2019t agreed to the deal, so the Gunners would need to produce the sufficient readies to convince Todd Boehly and co to sell. Todd\u2019s boys are also known to be in the market for a new goalie and Andr\u00e9 Onana, who was on the losing side for Internazionale in last weekend\u2019s Champions League final, is their top target to replace \u00c9douard Mendy. Manchester United are also keen on Onana as a long-term replacement for shot-stopper extraordinaire David de Gea so a bidding war between the Premier League rivals may even ensue. Why sign one Onana when you can sign two? The Everton midfielder Amadou Onana is also on Chelsea\u2019s radar after a strong first season at Goodison Park. The 21-year-old Belgium international would seem a natural long-term replacement for N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who is off to Saudi Arabia. Staying on Merseyside, Wolfsburg\u2019s Dutch midfielder, Micky van de Ven, has said he fancies a move to Anfield to play under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Kh\u00e9phren Thuram of Nice, Celta Vigo\u2019s Gabri Veiga, Ryan Gravenberch of Bayern Munich and Southampton\u2019s Romeo Lavia are just some of the players on Klopp\u2019s existing summer shopping list.

Currently an assistant coach at treble-winning Manchester City, the 43-year-old was dismissed by Parma after just 14 matches back in 2021, but remains highly thought of. The Italian\u2019s playing career included spells at Juventus, Fiorentina, Sevilla, Olympiacos, Sampdoria and Verona although it began, somewhat incongruously, at West Brom. Following the departure of the manager, Luciano Spalletti, and the arrival of Rudi Garcia as his replacement, it looks likely that Napoli will lose some of their brightest Scudetto-winning talent before next season. The central defender Kim Min-jae is in advanced talks with Bayern Munich over a move to the Bundesliga and transfer tsar Fabrizio Romano says an agreement on personal terms is close before the South Korea international\u2019s release clause becomes active in July.

Easily missed among the boulders and rock pools, a landscape of gnarled black stumps and enormous fallen tree trunks is revealed and submerged twice a day in a bay between Hastings and Rye. Twisted and smoothed by the tides, the soggy wood is strewn with barnacles and peppered with thousands of holes made by piddocks \u2013 burrowing shellfish which have made the logs their home. But this is not just driftwood. These are ancient trees, their stumps still rooted to the spot where they died due to rising sea levels up to 6,500 years ago. The site, at Pett Level in Rye Bay, East Sussex, is one of the UK\u2019s largest sunken forests and would have once formed an extensive area of coastal woodland stretching more than five miles to the east to Rye Harbour and about eight miles to the west, towards Bexhill. Just yards from the witchy burls and branches of the sunken forest, fossilised dinosaur footprints made by iguanodons and ankylosaurus up to 100m years ago can be found in boulders that have fallen from the crumbling cliffs. Today, a tall embankment holds back the sea waters from the acres of reclaimed land that make up Pett Level. But over the millennia, the rising waters that made an island of Britain and a sea out of the river valley that became the Channel, also rose high enough to swamp the forest, killing the trees. Once scarcely studied, the sunken forest is now yielding its secrets to scientists examining how climate breakdown at the end of the last ice age radically altered landscapes and environments as sea levels rose and the climate warmed. Dr Scott Timpany, a paleoecologist at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an expert on sunken forests around Britain, says the ancient wood contained substantial numbers of oak trees at certain points in its history, as well as elm, beech and yew. \u201cThese would have been wet woodlands \u2013 not like a park woodland. This would have been a pretty boggy, wet environment with pools of water on the surface in places. This would likely have been getting wetter as sea levels rose, as glaciers melted, raising the groundwater table. \u201cThe woodland remains we see today are from lots of different periods of time,\u201d he adds. \u201cOn the surface of the intertidal zone at the moment, you\u2019ve got oak trees that date from the late Mesolithic all the way through to oak, elm and ash from the middle bronze age. \u201cAs you go down the beach you\u2019re effectively stepping back in time.\u201d As recently as 1850, historian William Durrant Cooper wrote that the sunken remains of \u201cDymsdale Forest\u201d \u2013 as it was once known \u2013 can only be seen \u201cat low water, during spring tides\u201d. Less than 200 years later, no spring tides are required to see what remains of the woodland. Visitors can wander down to the beach at low tide and poke at the spongy tree trunks, which fell long before Stonehenge or the Giza pyramids were built. As well as the ravages of winter storms, rising sea levels and the interplay of three rivers coming together in Rye, the coast is moulded by longshore drift \u2013 the relentless eastwards flow of shingle, the pebbles that define the beaches of much of Britain\u2019s south coast. This is of particular concern to commercial shipping at Rye Harbour. Large container vessels navigate a narrow channel at the mouth of the River Rother, the opening of which would be rapidly blocked by the flow of shingle if left unchecked. Any buildup would also have serious consequences for the reclaimed land at Pett Level, Romney Marsh and the area immediately around Rye. To address this, a concrete arm protecting the entrance to the harbour traps the shingle, and a fleet of tipper trucks remove up to 80,000 tonnes of the pebbles every year, transporting them five miles west to protect the sea wall at Pett Level, in a perpetual battle between the forces of nature and the Environment Agency. \u201cI would estimate that without this effort, within three years the sea would be punching a hole through the sea wall, and all of Pett Level would become saltmarsh,\u201d says Barry Yates, former manager of Rye Harbour nature reserve. The effects of human activity on longshore drift continue to play a significant role in how the coastline changes, and may be a key reason why the sunken forest has become so exposed in recent decades. The creation of a concrete harbour arm in Hastings in the early 20th century cut off much of the eastward flow of shingle. In turn, this reduced the volume of shingle covering the base of the cliffs between Hastings and Pett Level, thereby exposing the cliffs to the sea and increasing the rate of erosion. Yates says: \u201cThe cliffs are marching inland as they erode, and it\u2019s the base of the cliffs which dictate where the root of the developing shingle ridge starts. Over time, the cliff has been eaten away, so the starting point of the shingle ridge east of the cliffs has moved northwards and that uncovers all of the peat and the old trees that are there.\u201d Maps of the coastline here at different points over the past few centuries clearly show that whole towns, such as Old Winchelsea, have been lost, and how rivers have substantially rerouted themselves. \u201cWe have this sense that everything\u2019s here for ever, but it\u2019s not at all,\u201d says local author Gareth E Rees, whose forthcoming book, Sunken Lands, explores humanity\u2019s long relationship with cataclysmic climate breakdown. \u201cWhen we look at the sunken forest \u2013 at this incredible thing that existed and was powerful, full of life and ancestors and animals and hunters, it disappeared. It\u2019s gone,\u201d says Rees. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to have to let things go. There\u2019s a false security in building more and more dykes and barriers. You can\u2019t keep adding engineering solutions.\u201d Yates agrees. \u201cAlthough we have kept things in place for now by carting shingle up and down, inevitably, the sea and the elements are going to have their way. This bit of coast should be mobile, and the plants and animals have ways of coping with that.\u201d But he says the shifting coastline also serves as a warning. \u201cMost of the ice from the last glaciation has melted, but the last bit that still exists is going to have a huge impact. Most people in the world live at low sea level. We just aren\u2019t awake to that. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is going to take for people to realise what needs to be done.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a66d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/16/british-library-is-getting-into-gaming-digital-storytelling", "primaryCategory": "games", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Check this out: the British Library gets into gaming", "lead": "Digital Storytelling, its new exhibition, shows how interactive technology has changed \u2013 and expanded \u2013 the way we tell stories", "author": "Holly Nielsen", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 09:15:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112180", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dbd8e66e887f1c5a58418b7eb3b0b36983506870/0_39_2000_1200/500.jpg", "body": "When you walk into the British Library, the first thing you\u2019ll see \u2013 apart from people sitting in every available free space, writing on laptops or in notebooks \u2013 is a glass tower encasing rows upon rows of books, stretching up to the ceiling. It\u2019s fair to say that this place has a lot of experience when it comes to displaying stories. For digital, interactive stories, though, the classic glass case doesn\u2019t really work. These tales often invite the reader to play a part in the narrative and shape their own experience, but this can be difficult when you\u2019re standing in an exhibition room with people looking over your shoulder, waiting for their turn. Allowing for interactivity in the finite and often restrictive setting of an exhibition is not an easy task. But in its latest exhibition, Digital Storytelling, the British Library has tasked itself with just that. It is not the first time the British Library has featured digital works: however, it is the first time that an entire exhibition has revolved around \u201cthe ways in which digital technologies have shaped how we communicate and tell stories\u201d, as the curators put it. It features highly regarded commercial classics of interactive digital storytelling, such as the Inkle\u2019s 2014 steampunk narrative fiction game 80 Days, and Nyamnyam\u2019s 2019 Elizabethan comedy narrative adventure Astrologaster, sitting beside intimate personal narratives such as c ya laterrrr, an autobiographical hypertext account of the loss of author Dan Hett\u2019s brother in the 2017 Manchester Arena terrorist attack. Despite the modest size of the exhibition room, the curators (Giulia Carla Rossi, Ian Cooke, and Stella Wisdom) have selected a wide range of pieces spanning genres, topics and emotions, made with a variety of digital tools. Nearly all of the pieces are snapshots of recent history, waypoints for some of the ways that digital media have been used in storytelling. Windrush Tales (3-Fold Games) is the only piece still in development; this exhibition contains its first playable preview. It is an interactive narrative game based on the lived experiences of Caribbean immigrants in postwar Britain. As Giulia Carla Rossi, co-curator of the exhibition and curator for digital publications in contemporary British and Irish published collections, highlighted: \u201cIt feels special to be able to have this work on display this year, which marks the 75th anniversary of the arrival of passengers from the Empire Windrush to the UK.\u201d The preview of Windrush Tales is one of the highlights of the exhibition, both as an experience and as an invitation to think about digital storytelling\u2019s present and future, rather than its recent past. Negotiating the tension of bringing interactive, digital pieces into the physical space of an exhibition is one of the greatest challenges when it comes to displaying stories of this nature. A lot of these experiences are meant to be sat with for a while. They\u2019re intimate and reflective, perhaps not naturally suited to this environment. QR codes on some of the pieces allow visitors to experience the stories on their phones, but the very nature of a couple of these stories means they cannot be properly experienced here \u2013 though that would be too much to ask of any exhibition of playable stories. It\u2019s not like we\u2019d go into an exhibition of an author\u2019s work and expect to be able to sit down in a comfy chair and read the entirety of a novel. Instead, this is a sampler, a useful introduction. One thing that helps is videos showing demonstrations of play alongside some of the more complex exhibits, and which I\u2019d love to see at future museum displays of interactive art and media. As Twitch has proved, watching someone play is a perfectly legitimate way of experiencing something interactive. Created by Florence Smith Nicholls, they not only help clarify how to play or navigate the stories, but also make the exhibition more accessible. Hopefully these playthrough videos will be archived as part of the British Library\u2019s vast collection alongside the games themselves (many of which are already held here) \u2013 because when it comes to interactive art and playful culture, archiving examples of play as well the games themselves is vital. Not a lot of context is given to the history of digital storytelling, for example how personal computers or the development of the internet changed and shaped the medium. Nor is much said about ongoing debates and tensions in this space, such as the role of procedural generation and how these technologies affect the labour of creatives. However, because the fairly small space of the exhibition isn\u2019t filled by these larger themes, it allows room for the pieces on display to breathe and manifest in the spaces they\u2019re given.

Weekly visitors to the site\u2019s hay fever advice pages have tripled in the past five weeks, according to NHS England, with 27,834 visits in 24 hours on Sunday \u2013 one every three seconds. On Friday, the Met Office put 12 areas of the UK, covering England, Wales and most of Scotland, on red alert for \u201cvery high\u201d pollen levels. \u201cWe are seeing lots of high count days because the weather is very suitable for pollen emission from grasses,\u201d said Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, a senior palynologist at the University of Worcester, who leads the UK\u2019s pollen forecasting programme in association with the Met Office. Adams-Groom said pollen counts this year were roughly average, but added: \u201cThe problem for hay fever sufferers is not so much the size of the pollen count, since any amount over 50 pollen grains per cubic metre of air is problematic for the majority, it is more the perpetual onslaught of high days, due to the almost continuous good weather in many regions since the season began in late May/early June.\u201d If the hot weather continues into next week, the grasses will become exhausted more quickly, offering some respite to those with hay fever, she said. \u201cAlready, I am seeing some evidence that this is happening, with grasses going over very quickly.\u201d Typically, the season for grass pollen, which causes most allergies, lasts from mid-May until July, while the weed pollen season generally covers the end of June to September. The Met Office pollen forecast show that some areas are getting a double hit. Hay fever symptoms include sneezing, coughing, a runny or blocked nose, as well as red, itchy or watery eyes. Sufferers can also experience headaches, earache or lose their sense of smell. Scientists predict that as global heating causes a higher frequency of hotter, drier summers and warmer wetter winters in the UK, the seasonal pollen pattern could change. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing scientific consensus that climate change will impact the pollen season in the UK. It could result in longer pollen seasons,\u201d said a Met Office spokesperson. Urban areas tend to have lower pollen counts than the countryside, but research has also shown that people in urban areas experience more severe symptoms because pollution can exacerbate the body\u2019s reaction. Prof Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester who carried out the research, said: \u201cPollution can damage the protective barriers in our nose and respiratory tracts so we\u2019re more likely to get things in, we\u2019re seeing that pollution can have an effect on immune sensing \u2026 and it can narrow airways and make it difficult to breathe. \u201cWe are seeing more and more people developing hay fever. It has been increasing year on year and in the hospitalisation data, you can see that trend too. More of us are being very ill with it.\u201d Margaret Kelman, the acting head of clinical services at Allergy UK, said one in four adults in the UK were affected by hay fever and that the number had been increasing sharply. \u201cThe number of people affected by hay fever has trebled in the last 30 years.\u201d The increase is partly due to better diagnosis, but is likely to also be climate-related. \u201cThe weather affects hay fever exposure and symptoms because pollen counts are higher on dry, warm days with low humidity and a gentle breeze to help disperse the fine pollen granules into the air and keep the pollen grains circulating\u201d said Kelman."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a66f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/16/alessia-russo-leaving-manchester-united-with-arsenal-among-suitors", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Alessia Russo leaving Manchester United with Arsenal among suitors", "lead": "Alessia Russo will leave Manchester United when her contract expires at the end of the month, the club has confirmed", "author": "Suzanne Wrack", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 09:03:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112218", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/af23418d7fa6222f49c759ee6a9c4d0cf0e4d3d0/0_131_4513_2708/500.jpg", "body": "Alessia Russo will leave Manchester United when her contract expires at the end of the month, the club has confirmed. Russo was the subject of two world-record bids from Arsenal in January, which were rebuffed by United. After 18 months of talks over a new contract, it is understood it was not until the final week of the season that United said they would match the salary on offer from Arsenal, a move that has frustrated the player and been deemed too little too late. Russo starred for England at the Euros last summer, coming off the bench to score four times. Leading the line for United, she scored 10 league goals last season as they finished second behind Chelsea, securing Champions League football for the first time. She posted a message of thanks to the club and said leaving had been \u201cthe hardest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make\u201d. Russo joined United in September 2020 after graduating from the University of North Carolina, where she played alongside the now Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy. Arsenal have been the frontrunners in the race to sign Russo since January. However, with the forward available for free there has been lots of interest, including from Lyon and clubs in Spain and the National Women\u2019s Soccer League in the US. The departure of the lifelong United fan will be a worry for fellow supporters. With the club having finished two points behind Chelsea and qualified for the Champions League there was hope that they would hold on to key players. However Russo\u2019s exit is likely to be followed by that of the influential Spain right-back Ona Batlle, who has been a long-term target of the European champions Barcelona. Russo\u2019s destination is expected to be announced soon, with the 24-year-old due to join up with England on Monday before flying to Australia for the World Cup on 5 July. United concluded a statement confirming Russo\u2019s departure by saying: \u201cEveryone at the football club would like to thank Alessia for her service and wish her luck for the future.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a670", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2023/jun/16/how-to-spot-a-sunak-the-stephen-collins-cartoon", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to spot a Sunak in the wild: the Stephen Collins cartoon", "lead": "Nothing changes \u2026", "author": "Stephen Collins", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 09:00:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112236", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/887f46da626f7b0f045cf8548ce22a9213ceccb4/113_276_1368_821/500.jpg", "body": ""}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a671", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/16/experience-i-knew-nothing-of-the-pandemic-until-my-submarine-surfaced", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Experience: I knew nothing of the pandemic until my submarine surfaced", "lead": "We were suddenly bombarded with information that made no sense to us", "author": "Pierre Oll\u00e9on", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 09:00:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112254", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4245c0fae88b35987af614664c57322cd998783a/0_934_7087_4255/500.jpg", "body": "In 2019, I started at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, a prestigious French engineering school where students undergo military training with the air force, army or navy. I was sent to the naval school in September for two months of basic training. I was then qualified to be part of the mechanics and engineering team, and could choose my next placement. I signed up to go on a nuclear submarine, which can stay underwater for up to 10 years without surfacing. I really wanted to go out into the ocean, although I was nervous when we went for the first time. I got used to it after a few trips back and forth for training, and was eager to embark on a longer journey. In January 2020, I left for a patrolling mission, along with a 75-person crew. I had got to know everyone quite well, which made me feel confident that everything would run smoothly. The main goal of the mission was to navigate through the water, identifying boats and aircraft with our sensors while remaining undetected. We were the eyes and ears of the French navy, 300 metres under the ocean. Being in a submarine is a bit like being in a spaceship. Letters from family were allowed \u2013 to keep crew members motivated \u2013 but, for safety and discretion, all communication from the crew\u2019s families was seen first by navy staff who removed any content that could cause panic on board. For example, if my partner broke up with me through a letter, that might be censored. We received regular news bulletins with updates on politics and football games, but not much about things that could affect the crew\u2019s efficiency and psychological state. The only news I received from my family were things like \u201cYour brother won his judo competition\u201d or \u201cWe miss you\u201d. In February 2020, as Covid started to emerge in Europe, the navy began filtering out all Covid-related news in our bulletins, which meant that we basically stopped receiving any news at all. They asked our families not to send anything that would worry us. My mum later told me she had written to me about Covid several times, but I never read any of that in her letters. Throughout March and April, we had no idea that Covid was even a thing, let alone that France was under strict lockdown. We only found out in mid-April 2020, two days before we were set to come back. The radio channels on the submarine announced the news: \u201cThere is a deadly virus. It has arrived in France; you can\u2019t leave your home.\u201d The navy probably thought: \u201cThe country is locked down. We have to explain what\u2019s going on.\u201d Everyone else in the world had weeks to follow the news, whereas we were suddenly bombarded with information that didn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cLockdown\u201d was a new word to me; I didn\u2019t know what to expect. When I got out of the submarine, I got my phone back and received weeks\u2019 worth of panicked messages, along with explanations about Covid and the lockdown. My stepdad sent a detailed plan of how and where to buy a mask \u2013 I\u2019d never worn one before. I took a train back to Paris, where my family lives, and was completely disoriented. People had masks and gloves on. I was not at all in this mindset. Nothing made sense to me. The streets were empty and I was just thinking, \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d I tried to hide the feeling that I was arriving from another planet, so on the train, I put over my mouth a fireproof hood that had been given to me by the navy. I just thought, everyone is hiding their mouths, so I\u2019ll do it, too, even though I didn\u2019t know why. I had to adjust to being locked down with my family 24/7 after not talking to them for months. The transition was harsh, but the rest of the time was similar to everyone else\u2019s: online classes, family time, not going out. Today, I am an intern at the French National Centre for Space Studies and I\u2019m almost done with my engineering degree. Looking back, I feel returning to a different world was a unique opportunity. I had two lockdowns: one underwater, then one at home. I couldn\u2019t say which one felt weirder. \u2022 As told to Livia Giannotti Do you have an experience to share?

It inspired me to write my first book when I was five, called Lenin and His Magical Goose, in which Lenin meets a magical Armenian goose and they invade Finland together and make it socialist. My favourite book growing up I really liked Tom Sawyer &amp; Huckleberry Finn. By this point I had arrived in America and had difficulty figuring out what the county was all about. That Mark Twain guy really explained it to me. Also, it was my first real foray into humour and I never looked back. The book that changed me as a teenager I read Judy Blume nonstop because she was such an honest writer. Are You There, God, It\u2019s Me Margaret was mind-blowing when you consider its adult themes in a book aimed at young people, and I think Forever \u2026 taught me just about all I know about intimacy. The writer who changed my mind I guess George Orwell, with Nineteen Eighty-Four. I grew up loving dictatorships as a Soviet citizen, but Orwell made it seem a lot less sexy. I\u2019m glad Lenin never met that magical goose. The book that made me want to be a writer Oh God, all of them. Every book I read as a kid made me want to be a writer. But maybe the Old Testament really did the trick. I went to a very conservative Jewish school and we had the Torah and Talmud stuffed down our throats for half the day. So I wrote my own version of the Torah in which Exodus became Sexodus, and so on (I was 11 or 12). The rabbis were none too pleased. I guess it was my first satire. The book or author I came back to Reading George Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch as a teenager was not a great idea. But when you\u2019re in your 20s it rocks. The book I reread I guess the Old Testament (see above). It\u2019s really quite lyrical in places, though could do with less genealogy and a lot less smiting. The book I could never read again I guess Evelyn Waugh\u2019s Black Mischief. Hoo boy, that is um \u2026 Yeah. The book I discovered later in life Later in life? Who has time to read? The book I am currently reading Calling Ukraine by Johannes Lichtman. Certainly seems topical. My comfort read Nabokov\u2019s Pnin, over and over and over again. Best of his books, certainly the most humane. Just yum yum yum all the way. \u2022 Our Country Friends by Gary Shteyngart is published by Atlantic.

One reason these phrases resonate is because self-improvement can be a crucial step towards improving the world. From the climate crisis to social inequality and global health emergencies, the problems facing humanity are so big and interconnected that each individual person is both affected by them and also able to have an impact on them. Likewise, the sheer scale of the challenges faced by humanity call for big ambition \u2013 and big aptitude. One upshot of this is a renewed regard for expertise. Not so long ago, populist politicians frequently dismissed experts as elite, out of touch and irrelevant. But reality has begged to differ. During the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance, people across the world realised just how much we depend on knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. For Prof Keith McLay, provost of learning and teaching at the University of Derby, the fact that the World Health Organization recently declared an end to Covid-19 as a global health emergency underlined how much we need experts to solve problems. \u201cNobody ever solved a problem without reasoning or analytical skills or without the ability to understand. Education is the building block for that,\u201d he says. These analytical and critical thinking skills have become particularly crucial in a world rife with division, fake news and disinformation, in which people increasingly struggle to agree on basic facts. \u201cIt\u2019s not sufficient to dismiss something as a lie or not real without being able to back that up with evidence and analysis,\u201d says McLay. \u201cThat\u2019s what higher education is about. Every degree programme is about positing a hypothesis: you present evidence, analyse it and arrive at an outcome. [Doing that] is antithetical to [the] post-truth [era], and that\u2019s what we reveal to our students.\u201d McLay highlights a 1990 quote from Nelson Mandela: \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon that you can use to change the world.\u201d And in today\u2019s era of social flux, war, conflict, and chaos, he notes that now, more than ever, we must learn from the lessons of the past. \u201cNow is the time that we must use education to solve global social problems and avoid conflict,\u201d says McLay. As a professor of early modern military and naval history, he is keenly aware of the kind of devastation that unchecked conflict can lead to. \u201cOur students are encouraged to find the solutions to the most pressing global challenges and create positive social change \u2026 These young people are learning how to direct their anger and frustration with the current state of the planet and lack of change from politicians and heads of state into positive action, specifically aiming to make a difference,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey are not just learning from books. They are active in the field with our leading researchers. Some have worked with the team in the Maldives, Seychelles, Guam, for example \u2013 making new discoveries, and conducting groundbreaking research that could change everything about the world we live in.\u201d For instance, he points to the university\u2019s world-leading team working on various projects associated with coral reefs. The majority of these studies explore the impact of the damage caused to the world\u2019s reefs by climate change. Some of the university\u2019s students \u2013 both undergraduate and postgraduate \u2013 have played significant roles in some of the projects, for example, conducting research in the university\u2019s aquatic research facility on impacts associated with coral bleaching and disease. \u201cThis is what the role of a university should be \u2013 to find the finest and most passionate minds and provide them with the skills to critique, challenge, discover, and change,\u201d says McLay, who has responsibility for the strategic leadership of learning and teaching and the academic portfolio across the whole of the University of Derby. \u201cThese individuals are our future. It is their learning that will be applied to challenges and diseases, which we can\u2019t even begin to imagine at this time. They will bring the solutions. It is down to us to give them the skills, experience, and education.\u201d Do you have an idea for a novel research project or course syllabus that could supercharge humanity\u2019s efforts to save the world?

Find out more at derby.ac.uk Deborah Robinson, professor of special educational needs, disability and inclusion at the University of Derby\u2019s Institute of Education, highlights the role that education has to play in helping people feel more empowered, fulfilled and effectual. \u201cIt can open up possibilities and, in short, it can make people feel fulfilled and happy,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere there is high-quality education, particularly education that enables debate and critical thinking, we know we see more acceptance of diversity and experience more peaceful and tolerant societies.\u201d Robinson works with colleagues to improve the social and educational inclusion of children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities. Her research explores policy and practice for SEND (special educational needs and disability) and inclusion in the areas of teacher education, service provision, assessment and literacy. \u201cFor me, the challenge is how education can be a catalyst for social inclusion. Education itself is wonderful as a process but it must lead to people being able to fulfil their potential and experience an included adulthood where participation in work and community life is possible for all disabled people.\u201d Inclusivity is also crucial when it comes to careers guidance. The University of Derby is also home to the UK\u2019s leading research institute for careers information, advice and guidance, the International Centre for Guidance Studies (iCeGS), which has been helping schools and colleges to deliver careers guidance since it was established 25 years ago. \u201cOur research focuses on transition. We work with different organisations to understand what best supports individuals to progress in life and to achieve their goals. We help them to raise their aspirations and expectations for life,\u201d says Siobhan Neary, professor of career development practice and head of iCeGS, whose research focuses on CPD (continuing professional development), workforce development and professional identity. \u201cWe look at how careers are integrated in the curriculum. Discussions about careers involve everyone, so it is important it is not sidelined.\u201d There are many other ways the University of Derby tries to make students feel more included, involved and empowered. Its Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme gives second-year students the chance to take part in a funded research project that tackles big global problems. \u201cIf you are studying for a degree, you are not just a consumer of knowledge \u2013 you\u2019re a creator of it,\u201d says Sarah Charles, head of the Institute of Education at the University of Derby, which has collaborative working arrangements with schools and colleges locally, nationally and internationally. Staff at the university have long been conscious of the role education plays in equipping individuals with the skills to tackle wider social problems \u2013 and how this is interlinked with realising a student\u2019s full potential. \u201cThe philosophy that underpins our approach to learning and teaching draws on the work of Giorgio Agamben, an Italian philosopher, who writes a lot about potential,\u201d says McLay. \u201cWe want our students to have both the content- and subject-specific skills of their degree programme, whether that be nursing or engineering. Importantly, they must also have the graduate skills to enter the world as citizens who can apply what they have learned and renew their potential time after time.\u201d The university bases its curricula on an applied approach that gives undergraduates opportunities to put what they learn into practice, either through an industry placement or by getting representatives from industry to come into the university. Students studying a humanities-based subject \u2013 history, for example \u2013 get the chance to work with a museum or other cultural organisations based in Derby on something such as a forthcoming exhibition, or to help train museum guides in what the university calls \u201clive briefs\u201d. Placements are not a one-way street, says Charles. All stakeholders can benefit from involvement. \u201cThe symbiotic relationship between theory and practice is realised on placements allowing students to apply, evaluate, and generate new knowledge.\u201d Do you have an idea for a novel research project or course syllabus that could supercharge humanity\u2019s efforts to save the world?

Their average cost has dropped significantly over the past decade, they\u2019re increasingly ubiquitous, and they\u2019re undoubtedly powerful weapons as we work to build a zero carbon economy. But there\u2019s one problem: the technology itself is only part of the equation, and the much messier part involves people \u2013 their reactions, their feelings and their behaviours. Take the case of solar panels \u2013 also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels. Despite their obvious benefits, how do people feel about solar farms when they are situated on green field sites and agricultural land, and can change local landscapes? Offshore wind turbines make good sense from a power generation standpoint, as we live on an island with an extensive coastline surrounded by shallow seas, but they do change the seascape, and onshore wind can be even more contentious. \u201cWe need to appreciate that it can be challenging for people adapting to new technologies and we must consider them as part of the solution as well as just the engineering solution itself,\u201d says Chris Sansom, professor of concentrating solar power at the University of Derby, whose research focuses on finding solutions for cleaner energy across the globe. Sansom notes that zero carbon research is concerned with many different elements. The University of Derby has a range of leading experts exploring zero carbon in relation to decarbonising manufacturing and business processes, generating low-carbon renewable energy, transporting people by zero carbon means, as well as understanding natural processes for greenhouse gas removal. \u201cWhile these may provide the scientific solutions we need, a number of things can get in the way of that,\u201d he says \u2013 such as the challenges for local residents and other people who struggle to adapt. A leader in his field, Sansom has experienced some of these challenges first-hand, including while working on a solar project in sub-Saharan Africa. Alongside researchers at the University of Derby, he has been exploring how expensive fossil fuel cookers can be replaced with lower-cost, low-carbon, efficient solar cookers. \u201cI went to Kenya to visit and I\u2019ve never seen so many coffee tables that looked remarkably like PV panels,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is that people couldn\u2019t fix them as they were high-cost and impossible to maintain. We hadn\u2019t thought through how people were going to use the technology and what they would do if it went wrong. That\u2019s why we are focused on developing innovative solutions, the kinds of technologies where they can be fixed locally.\u201d Similarly, when trialling solar cookers in India, Sansom experienced how cultural expectations can have an effect on how new technologies are received. The project, based in Rajasthan, explored how solar cookers could be used as an alternative to wood stoves. He found that while they were effective from an environmental perspective, it made the women in the communities he worked with \u2013 who would traditionally be tasked with collecting firewood \u2013 feel redundant and undervalued. \u201cSocial and cultural norms shouldn\u2019t be underestimated when planning a route to a new net zero carbon world. Many technologically sound interventions in developing countries have failed for that reason,\u201d adds Sansom.

Find out more at derby.ac.uk These kinds of challenges are instructive for anyone seeking to solve humanity\u2019s most pressing problems. Simply turning up with a clever new technology or a scientific breakthrough is rarely enough; you also need to address people\u2019s behavioural blockers \u2013 their resistance, reluctance, or any practical difficulties they may face. The increasing need to consider the interplay of technological advances and behavioural changes can make efforts to tackle big global problems all the more challenging \u2013 and pressing. Indeed, in recent years, wider efforts to tackle the climate crisis have been caught up in the broader culture wars, with societies polarised and divided despite the urgent need to act collectively. Opposition to net zero measures often comes from those who might face short-term financial pain from the transition to a low-carbon economy \u2013 for instance, individuals and businesses in areas that are economically reliant on the fossil fuel industry. It\u2019s clear that mitigating the climate breakdown therefore also requires a careful consideration of human psychology too. It calls for more multidisciplinary approaches that break through traditional subject silos and facilitate more joined-up thinking. The University of Derby has been encouraging students, researchers and academics alike to embrace that approach. For instance, it has launched an MSc in behaviour change to explore innovative ways of encouraging, enabling and supporting people to make better choices for themselves \u2013 acknowledging how behavioural factors are increasingly at the heart of both public policymaking and private sector business transitions. \u201cStudying at the University of Derby is more than just getting a degree: it is about rolling up your sleeves and developing the skills that will enable you to tackle today\u2019s world of environmental and social challenges,\u201d says Prof Warren Manning, provost \u2013 innovation and research at the university. Students have the unique opportunity to come up with novel approaches to meet big challenges. The University of Derby provides forums for empowering students, including an Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme, which gives all second-year students the chance to take part in a funded and supported research project. It has also launched several applied initiatives in wider society. For instance, in 2017, it established the De-Carbonise project to work with local businesses in Derby and beyond to help put them on the path to net zero. \u201cFor many businesses, there is a strong correlation between the need to decarbonise and their energy usage,\u201d says Manning. \u201cA lot of businesses recognise that. What they struggle with is knowing what to do next.\u201d The challenge for many small-and medium-sized businesses is balancing the capital investment on zero carbon technologies and processes with more immediate financial pressures. But this is why Manning sees such value in De-Carbonise as a network that can help business owners make the necessary behavioural changes. \u201cWe get businesses to mentor each other,\u201d says Manning. \u201cWe help them talk about what behavioural steps they can take, and think about the way they organise what they do, and the capital investments they make. Chief executives see other chief executives taking measures, and it makes them competitive. They say: \u2018If that business over there can do it, we can do it as well\u2019.\u201d Fostering this kind of constructive collective mentality is arguably incredibly powerful \u2013 after all, many behavioural and psychological blockers to change can stem from cognitive biases (or mental shortcuts) that can make people more tribal. These biases can reinforce people\u2019s resistance to initiatives or information that causes them short-term pain or that challenges their own perspectives. In a similar vein, the team at the University of Derby has learned the importance of thinking about how to frame climate messages \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean starting with painting a picture of natural disasters, floods and the other miseries we can expect if we fail to reach our climate targets. \u201cWe need to balance that with an optimistic view of the future,\u201d says Fred Paterson, associate professor of sustainable business and clean growth at the University of Derby, whose research is focused on pro-environmental business. He advocates a more subtle approach: \u201cYou start with where they\u2019re at.\u201d And this means that scientists and politicians should perhaps try to view the world through the mindset of what it\u2019s actually like being in business. \u201cYou don\u2019t start with, \u2018We need to be more morally correct and save the planet\u2019, you start with what drives people,\u201d says Paterson. \u201cLet\u2019s look at what reduces your expenses, let\u2019s help your bottom line.\u201d So perhaps the real psychological lever when it comes to promoting climate action is to paint the climate not as a threat, but an opportunity. \u201cBusinesses that get ahead can get a competitive advantage by thinking about new products and services,\u201d says Manning, pointing out that if we want to reach net zero, it is going to require a significant rebuilding of society, which means new business opportunities in, for example, the hydrogen economy or the battery economy to support the rollout of new technology. \u201cEntrepreneurs should be thinking that this is a huge potential market,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are new products and services, opportunities to be more competitive, and even cost savings.\u201d Paterson adds: \u201cToday, green innovation pays off in the medium and long term, if not also as a short-term cost saver. So the inertia, the barriers to adoption, will be overcome by rethinking common practice and \u2018what we\u2019ve always done\u2019.\u201d Do you have an idea for a novel research project or course syllabus that could supercharge humanity\u2019s efforts to save the world?

Switch on your TV or scroll through your social media feed and the chances are you\u2019ll see friends, relatives and pundits at each other\u2019s throats, fighting the culture war du jour. There\u2019s no shortage of potential causes \u2013 from political disillusionment, economic upheaval, globalisation, fake news and disinformation, or self-reinforcing social media feeds. These divisions can make public discourse feel impossible, but according to academics at the University of Derby there are things we can do to be more compassionate and kinder. \u201cCompassion is noticing the distress, suffering or disadvantage of yourself or others, and then having the skills to do something about it,\u201d says Prof Frances Maratos, an expert in affective science, or the study of emotion and affect. Her research centres on understanding the psychological, neurological, cognitive and physiological correlates of emotional wellbeing. \u201cRather than focusing on the problem, compassion allows individuals to take a step back, reflect on what\u2019s not really helping, and engage in alternative thinking as to how to find a solution,\u201d says Maratos, who works with schools, businesses and other organisations to teach compassionate mind training, and to foster compassionate feelings where they may have previously been lacking. \u201cWhen people are a little bit calmer and more collected, we know it helps your brain and body work in a different way \u2013 your frontal cortices come online, and you release more acetylcholine, meaning you become solution-focused rather than problem-focused.\u201d Given how helpful compassion can be in tackling polarisation, how can we inject more compassion into the public square? The good news is that even when compassion is completely absent \u2013 as it feels in many culture war debates \u2013 it\u2019s possible to create it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that some people can\u2019t be compassionate, because they can,\u201d says Maratos, who explains that it comes easier to some people than others. \u201cWe all have different levels of emotion. But if you\u2019re one person who potentially doesn\u2019t feel things, and perhaps aren\u2019t as empathic as other people, then absolutely, it is a skill that can be learned.\u201d The first step towards understanding and compassion is knowing what to look for. \u201cWe teach individuals to start noticing triggers such as threat, fear and anxiety,\u201d says Maratos. \u201cWe sit kids and adults down and we get them to think about what the facial expressions associated with being angry or worried are. What is happening with their body language? What\u2019s going on in their heads? We also get them to think about what situations this occurs in.\u201d Maratos is also undertaking research into compassion in schools and, for the Leverhulme Trust, investigated compassion to promote wellbeing. She also continues to lecture in psychology and psychopathology at the University of Derby.

Find out more at derby.ac.uk Other academics at the university contribute to an understanding of compassion from the perspective of other disciplines. Prof Lynn Saunders is head of law and social sciences at the University of Derby, with a professional background working in the criminal justice system, in both prisons and the community. \u201cCompassion and care is important when working with people who have been convicted of serious offences,\u201d she says. Her research interests include the resettlement of people convicted of sexual offences after a prison sentence, and through her work she has discovered that even in those difficult contexts, it is possible to stimulate compassion. \u201cAlthough unpalatable as this can sometimes be, public safety depends on focusing not only on an individual\u2019s risks but also on their needs \u2013 helping to support them to be better people and to contribute positively to their communities.\u201d This sentiment is echoed by Kate Moss, professor of applied criminology at the University of Derby, who has published widely in the areas of crime reduction and homelessness. \u201cIf you can help people to understand more about a social issue, then I think that actually helps people to be more compassionate.\u201d Moss has seen perspectives shift in her own research into homelessness, including how some people\u2019s prejudices and misconceptions about homeless people have given way to a growing appreciation that it can happen to anyone. For those seeking to use their studies to make the world better, these approaches are a good example of how fruitful and fulfilling it can be to be able to think outside traditional subject silos and deploy more of a multidisciplinary approach. Undergraduate and postgraduate students at the University of Derby are encouraged and empowered to come up with novel approaches to researching global problems that often don\u2019t fit neatly into traditional fields of study. The university provides forums for facilitating this, including an Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme that gives all second-year students the chance to take part in funded and supported research projects, and PhD bursaries where students take the lead. Regardless of the approach, building compassion is everyone\u2019s responsibility and it brings benefits to us as individuals to be kinder. \u201cThe way we currently go about society is very neoliberal, and very hierarchical,\u201d says Maratos \u2013 whose work has contributed to better understanding anxiety and processes of pain in society and particularly in young people. \u201cWe have this weird predominant self-interest approach. Mostly we\u2019re teaching individuals to be narcissistic and strive to be the best.\u201d So, for example, Maratos teaches her clients to understand and guard against becoming \u201cmonopolisers\u201d in conversation settings, those who dominate the discussion \u2013 a type of person who isn\u2019t exactly uncommon in politics. She observes that situations can deteriorate, particularly if you get two monopolisers \u2013 what she terms an \u201calpha pair\u201d \u2013 taking over a conversation. That\u2019s when everyone needs to act. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a group, and you\u2019re noticing things like that, what is the skillset you can use? How can you work to avoid these situations or address them?\u201d asks Maratos. And one such skill is knowing how to direct your feelings. Even if raging at that moron on Facebook might seem like a good idea in the moment, it might prove counterproductive when it comes to actually finding common ground. So, the next time you can feel your blood starting to boil, before you explode and launch another salvo at your opponents, perhaps stop and put yourself in your opponents\u2019 shoes, show a little humility and, who knows, maybe you will feel better and, if we all do it, perhaps we\u2019ll end up with a slightly more compassionate and kinder world?

Here\u2019s a summary of the main news developments: Fallout from allegations levelled against the Liberal senator David Van continued. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said he had been made aware of a third allegation against Van since he expelled him from the party room on Thursday, and called for him to resign from parliament. Late on Friday, the Victorian Liberal party\u2019s administrative committee said it would hold an urgent meeting this weekend to discuss Van\u2019s future. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has approved habitat clearing for a defence housing development in Darwin despite acknowledging there is a significant risk for what has been described as one of Australia\u2019s most beautiful endangered birds.

What a week it has been. Thanks for reading and have a pleasant evening and weekend. Stoker\u2019s message to women: \u2018Don\u2019t put up with shit\u2019 Stoker says the past week should be a lesson \u2013 to \u201cteach kids by our example\u201d and report incidents \u201cwith proportionality\u201d so problem patterns can be identified and dealt with. \u201cThis conduct isn\u2019t OK, it isn\u2019t acceptable. If there\u2019s a pattern, and I say if with some care here, then that cannot be allowed to continue. Let\u2019s chart a way forward for everyone\u2019s sake, raise kids not to accept this nonsense, especially at work.\u201d To women, she says: \u201cDon\u2019t put up with shit.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not out to make this a bigger deal than it is, I\u2019m not scarred for life, and I\u2019m not out to get anyone. I never wanted this to be public, but I\u2019m not about to cover it up.\u201d Now Van has denied the allegations, she says she is glad she went public and backed independent Senator Lidia Thorpe. \u201cWell, it tells me something. It tells me that speaking up was the right thing to do. After all, the standard we walk past is the standard we accept.\u201d Stoker says Van was right to say the pair \u201cburied the hatchet\u201d at the time and moved on with the incident but she was provoked to go public after being approached by journalists on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a professional, and I don\u2019t hold a grudge ... many journalists approached me yesterday. \u201cI would\u2019ve preferred the matter to remain private and in the past but if it was going to be reported I wanted it to be done accurately.\u201d She thanks those who have reached out to her in the past 24 hours but assures \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d. Stoker says the incident with Van \u201cwas not appropriate conduct in a workplace ... it was unprofessional and uninvited\u201d. She says she \u201cdealt with it as you\u2019d expect any woman would in a senior position\u201d \u2013 followed up on it. \u201cI didn\u2019t run to the media and didn\u2019t try to destroy a colleague.\u201d She says she immediately followed the incident up with a senior colleague and dealt with the matter. \u201cIt was important to me that others were safe, especially staff. Senator Van apologised and said I could be confident he wouldn\u2019t behave that way in future ... I accepted his apology. I got on with the job.\u201d Amanda Stoker is filling in for Peta Credlin on Sky News tonight, airing allegations she made against Senator David Van inappropriately touching her in 2020. She says she\u2019ll have \u201ca few things to say\u201d tonight about what occurred, and \u201chow we can put an end to it\u201d. Van has denied all allegations made this week against him. The Victorian Liberal party\u2019s administrative committee will hold an urgent meeting this weekend to handle the allegations raised against Senator David Van at parliament this week. A Victorian Liberal party spokesperson told Guardian Australia it has: \u2026 taken action to suspend all organisational resources and support from Senator Van. There will be an urgent meeting this weekend of the party\u2019s Victorian administrative committee to further consider the allegations raised. Former Liberal senator tells party it must \u2018reframe\u2019 its position on climate change Former Liberal senator Greg Mirabella has told the party\u2019s federal council that it must acknowledge climate change as a \u201cpolitical fact\u201d, an issue which they needed to \u201cneutralise\u201d to prevent further damage to the Coalition brand. Mirabella moved a motion at the federal council in Canberra for the party to \u201creframe\u201d its position on climate change, to focus on economic costs and benefits of the issue, rather than framed around climate change deniers. He said: We must neutralise the climate change debate. We\u2019ve certainly got to neutralise Climate 200. We must present a transformative face to the electorate. We must reposition as a party that cares about stuff. His policy motion called on the parliamentary Liberal party to \u201cdevote to energy security the same deliberate level of policy priority that it would apply to economic security or national security.\u201d Mirabella said cost of living would be a major concern at the next election, which was inextricably linked with energy costs and security. He said the Liberal party must offer \u201csolutions\u201d to costs around energy and environment, calling for a \u201creimagining\u201d of the debate. Dutton speaks about allegations levelled against Senator Van on Sky News Opposition leader Peter Dutton was just interviewed on Sky News about the allegations that have been levelled against Liberal senator David Van. Speaking about former Senator Amanda Stoker\u2019s allegation of inappropriate touching and her decision not to go public with the matter, host Erin Molan asked Dutton if senior Liberal figures should have taken action against Van earlier. Molan: Should action have been taken the moment senior people within the Liberal party found out that this had occurred even if she had handled it the way she wanted to? Should something else have been done to him to stop it happening to anyone else? Dutton then sidestepped the question. He replied: Everybody has 20:20 in hindsight. I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t privy to the information at the time. People make decisions as best they can and as I say for Amanda she made a decision that was entirely hers to make. And, you know, I really support her then but now as well. There are a number of reasons, particularly for people in public life who might make a decision not to have their name splashed over the front page of the paper and in other circumstances, they believe it\u2019s important to call it out publicly. As I say it\u2019s really up to the individual. \u2018I feel I have run my best race\u2019: MP Robinson will retire after five terms in seat of Oodgeroo More on Queensland opposition MP Mark Robinson who will not contesting the next state election, and how this potentially paves the way for former senator Amanda Stoker to stand in his seat of Oodgeroo. An emotional Robinson announced he would retire at the October 2024 poll after five terms in the seat formerly named Cleveland. He told parliament on Friday: By the time I complete this term, I feel I have run my best race. I\u2019ve run it strongly. I\u2019ve given it my all and I\u2019ve achieved much of what I set out to do when I started in 2009. Robinson, 60, said his family needs were also changing, including having four grandchildren and he and his wife caring for their elderly mothers. Robinson said he hoped a local woman would become the next and first female member for his seat based in Redland, south-east of Brisbane. He said announcing his intentions allowed plenty of time to have the best local LNP candidate out in the field \u201cwho can hit the ground running\u201d. Stoker, a former Liberal senator and Morrison government minister, has moved to the electorate and is considering a tilt at state parliament. The Sky News host served as a senator from 2018 until losing her seat after being relegated to third spot on the LNP ticket in the 2022 election. Stoker this week accused Victorian Liberal senator David Van of inappropriately touching her in 2020. Comment was being sought from Stoker. AAP Liberal party president tells members to stop \u2018navel gazing\u2019 and start reflecting modern Australia Liberal party federal president, John Olsen, has told his partymates that they must overcome \u201corganisational dysfunction\u201d if they are any chance to return to government at the national or state levels. The Liberals\u2019 annual federal council has just opened in Canberra, with a small-ish room of delegates from around the country gathering not far from Parliament House. Olsen, the federal president, opened the conference by noting his party was now in opposition in every jurisdiction nationwide except Tasmania \u2013 with a blunt speech telling his troops to \u201cpick ourselves up off the canvas\u201d. He warned against \u201cnavel gazing\u201d, saying the party would need to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d, and speaking specifically against the controversies generated by some of the Liberal state branches. Olsen said they needed to: Get the organisations out of the news cycle and the media. Democracy relies on us and we must be seen to be up to the challenge. Organisational dysfunction runs counter to that. In a written report, published inside the party\u2019s annual report, Olsen described the Coalition\u2019s May 2022 federal election defeat as \u201cone of the most significant losses in our history\u201d, noting the loss of a swathe of seats in inner metropolitan areas, as well as cratering support in seats with higher numbers of professional women and voters of Chinese ancestry. He said: To win these seats back the Liberal party must reflect modern Australia \u2013 with our people, policies and presentation. These are difficult days but our party needs us more than ever \u2026 we must do the hard work and be ready. Speed-cubing world record broken Some speed-cubing fans were left in tears after a prestigious and longstanding record was broken by American champion cuber Max Park, who took an astonishing 3.13 seconds to solve a 3x3x3 puzzle. The 21-year-old smashed the previous benchmark of 3.47 seconds set by China\u2019s Yusheng Du in 2018 to enter the Guinness Book of World Records at the Pride in Long Beach 2023 event in California. As the magnitude of his feat became clear, cheers erupted. Park\u2019s father, Schwan Park, told the Guinness book: The atmosphere was electric. Everybody knew that he had broken the record and I think partially everybody was in shock. Read more and watch the video of the moment Park broke the record (it\u2019s a lot of fun): The Liberal party\u2019s federal women\u2019s committee has called for expelled MP, Moira Deeming, to be brought back into the fold. The upper house MP was suspended by the Victorian Liberal partyroom in March after she attended an anti-trans rally, which was gatecrashed by neo-Nazis. She was later expelled from the party room after she issued an ultimatum that leader, John Pesutto, apologise or face legal action. Guardian Australia understands the party\u2019s federal women\u2019s committee passed a motion for Deeming to be brought back on Friday morning. The motion had the support of the Queensland and Western Australian women\u2019s committee presidents but was opposed by those in New South Wales and Victoria. Federal MP, Sussan Ley, who is the shadow minister for women, addressed the meeting on Friday morning but was unaware of the motion and did not vote in it. The motion described Deeming\u2019s expulsion as \u201cwithout basis\u201d: \u201cWomen have a right to participate in the political process without fear of cancellation. The silencing of women has no place in the Liberal party. Deeming told Guardian Australia: My husband and I, and our four children, as well as all those who have suffered unjustly for attending the legal &amp; peaceful \u2018Let Women Speak\u2019 rally in Melbourne are extremely grateful to [the] federal Liberal women\u2019s committee for their public show of support. Sultan of Brunei to meet with Albanese during Australia visit Anthony Albanese will meet with the Sultan of Brunei when the leader visits Australia in coming days. The prime minister said His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei is visiting as a guest of government from 18 to 21 June. Elevating the bilateral relationship with Brunei, Australia\u2019s commitment to strengthening engagement with south-east Asia, and working together with Asean throughout the region are among the opportunities Albanese has outlined as part of the visit. Albanese said: I am delighted to welcome His Majesty to Australia. Australia and Brunei share a commitment to a stable, peaceful and prosperous region. I am committed to forging stronger relationships with our neighbours in south-east Asia and working together and through Asean to meet our shared challenges. I look forward to meeting with His Majesty in Canberra to reinforce our warm and longstanding relationship.\u201d Sydney Uni VC heading to China Mark Scott, the vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney is heading to China next week on his first official visit since landing the position. Scott will embark on a nine-day trip from Monday, where he will speak at a Times Higher Education summit in Hong Kong and open a Shanghai branch of the Centre of China, first established in Suzhou in 2016. Scott will also renew MoUs with the China scholarship council University of Sydney joint funding program and the traditionally liberal journalism school Fudan University, which last year axed \u201cfreedom of thought\u201d from its charter. The Chinese market continues to be a lucrative one for the university, which accounted for 87% of its international student revenue in 2021. The last trip university visit to China was by the former vice-chancellor Dr Michael Spence prior to the pandemic in 2019. Drowning of Indigenous man during police chase sparks call for water safety review Police did everything they could to save the life of Indigenous man Brandon Clark who fled into dangerous river waters while evading officers and drowned, a coroner has found. Clark had been pulled over by police during a vehicle stop when officers discovered an alleged breach of bail. He was also affected by illicit substances at the time. \u201cBrandon did not like water or swimming. The fact that he entered the water at all is evidence of the state of mind he was in while trying to evade police,\u201d said coroner Erin Kennedy at Lidcombe coroner\u2019s court on Friday. Wading into the waters of the Manning River at Taree on the NSW mid-north coast on 22 January last year, he was swept downstream and away from officers waiting on the bank. Although initially appearing not to have trouble in the water, his body was later found after he drowned.

I and Politics Live will be back with you on Monday \u2013 until then, take care of you Ax Kremlin responds to Australia stopping Russian Federation\u2019s embassy plans I missed this yesterday in *gestures* everything \u2013 but the Kremlin responded to Australia\u2019s very swift move to stop the Russian Federation from building an embassy on land adjacent to parliament through its state news site, Tass. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was reported in the state mouthpiece as saying: To our regret, Australia diligently continues to move in the main stream of the authors of the \u2018Russophobic\u2019 hysteria that is now taking place in the western countries. Australia is trying to be an excellent student there. \u2026 Another unfriendly display from Australia. We will take this into account and if there are issues on the agenda that require the principle of reciprocity, we will act accordingly.\u201d The legislation was introduced by Clare O\u2019Neil yesterday morning and passed with the support of the parliament in just over an hour, with the opposition, Greens and crossbench having been briefed on the urgency ahead of the bill\u2019s introduction. This all reminds me of a Lithuanian saying \u2013 ai\u0161kintis santykius \u2013which roughly translates to there are no fights, just \u2018clarifications of relationships\u2019. And on that note, question time is ended. So after a very, very fiery week, with tears and recriminations and a lot of pain, the senate decided to turn down the temperature, at least for question time today. Senator Watt talks about the \u2018decline in culture and science\u2019 during QT Labor senator Murray Watt takes a dixer on industrial relations and enterprise bargaining and how things are different from the Coalition years. That gives Watt a chance to compare and contrast and talk about the \u201cdecline in culture and science\u201d and reference that the \u201cdark ages had people thinking the Earth was flat\u201d. He then turns to the Coalition benches and says \u201chello senator Rennick, how are you going?\u201d Rennick asks for that to be withdrawn and says it was a \u2018personal reflection\u2019. Watt withdraws. (In a later answer he makes the Family Feud wrong answer sound and is told to stick to words) Queensland MP hopes a female candidate with replace him in 2024 state election Queensland MP, Dr Mark Robinson, has announced he will not re-contest the 2024 state election and that he hopes that a female candidate will be preselected in his place. Robinson, an MP for the Liberal National party, said it was time to \u201chang up\u201d his \u201cpolitical boots\u201d to spend more time with his family after \u201c15 years of service to the community.\u201d After much deliberation, I have decided not to re-contest the Queensland election in 2024. Now is the right time for me to move on to other endeavours and, as a new grandfather, be more available for my family. The Member for Oodgeroo said it was his hope that a woman would be chosen as the next LNP candidate for his electorate. That is something I would dearly like to see happen as I leave. It has been an honour to serve the people of the Northern Redlands and North Stradbroke Island and I thank them for their generous support over the past 15 years. Gallagher says Reserve Bank and government to tackle cost of living together We are back in familiar house footing now, with questions about interest rates. But there is no \u2018middle Australia\u2019 tag line or even a \u201cwhy is everything harder under Labor\u2019 which before this cursed week was the main go-to. Liberal senator Dean Smith: The prime minister was quoted in the newspaper on the second of May last year \u2018Labor has real lasting plans for cheaper mortgages\u2019. How does the prime minister reconcile the statement with the fact that interest rates are up 400 basis points since May last year, adding $15,168 to annual loan costs? Katy Gallagher: I think the lack of acknowledgment of the inflationary environment that we are in at the moment. We came to government after the first interest rate rise in May last year and they have continued since with one pause and the Reserve Bank is doing what it needs to do to put downward pressure on inflation and return it to target range. The job the government\u2019s got to do \u2026 is to generate supply in housing to ease cost of living pressures for households as we tackle some of these challenges in our economy and that\u2019s why our budget had a cost of living package as part of it. We also had significant investments in Medicare and the care economy in inclusion and equality in growth opportunities to deal with the productivity challenge across the economy, and also sought to improve our budget and put it on a more sustainable footing but we are facing difficult economic times. These are not challenges, just that Australia is facing but they have been faced around the world. We have an illegal war in Ukraine that is having an impact on the global economy. The bank needs to do what it needs and that is through monetary policy, controlling inflation because if they weren\u2019t doing that the impacts on everyone across the community, but particularly those on low incomes would be much much much worse. And so our job is to work hand in hand with the work that the bank is doing, and look at how the budget can support households as we work through these difficult times. There has been an on-going inquiry into the Workforce Australia Employment Services. It has led to calls from some in the union movement to bring back employment services under government control \u2013 like the Commonwealth Employment Services (CES) used to run, before it was privatised. Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie just got in trouble for talking. It\u2019s like high school, but if the high school was only for debating kids, prefects and vice-captains. Just like in the house, the senate dixer questions are very painful. Maybe even more so, because there are three in a row. Just send the press release and save us all these precious minutes in our life. Labor senator Murray Watt is asked by Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young about the recent ABC job losses which were announced yesterday. Watt says that Labor has \u201creversed the Coalition era cuts\u201d as was promised but that the ABC is independent organisation and makes its own staffing decisions. What was obviously announced yesterday was the decision of ABC management to restructure its operations to move resources from one area to the other as actually to keep pace with changes in the media, environment and audience needs and expectations. But as I say [communications] minister [Michelle] Rowland has requested a briefing from ABC management in regards to the ABC five-year plan and the announcement this week. Hanson-Young says not all the funding was restored. Watt says it was. And around and around we go. The answers to the following supplemental questions from Larissa Waters are pretty much the same and can be paraphrased as \u2018we are better than the Coalition on this\u2019. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s enough, in terms of climate action. Because \u2018better than the Coalition on climate\u2019 is a pretty low bar. Penny Wong disagrees with the Greens on Australia\u2019s gas transitions Greens senator Larissa Waters takes the questions in a different direction \u2013 to policy. How quaint. Waters: Earlier this month, global temperatures crept one and a half degrees above historic averages for the first time in human history. Current coal, oil and gas production continuing in operation will permanently blow the safe one and a half degree limit. We have to wind down production, not expand it if we\u2019re going to have any fighting chance of stopping climate breakdown. Is the government\u2019s still going to proceed with its $1.9bn taxpayer subsidy for developing Middle Arm now that Tambor have confirmed that it will support their plans to build Australia\u2019s biggest ever gas export hub there? Penny Wong: I will in relation to that specific project on Middle Arm \u2026 I will get perhaps a little more [of a] sophisticated answer then I\u2019m urged to by those opposite [the Coalition] but I will try and get a little more information on that Senator Waters. On the broader proposition \u2026 I understand that the Greens party has a view that the way to deal with climate change in an international global economies for Australia to shut down its gas exports and to shut down its gas industry. We don\u2019t agree. We believe that what the task we have been set with and we wish it were not. After so many years of inaction on the other side is to transition what is a very resource intensive economy on a pathway to net zero by 2050. And that is not only the imperative that is not only climate, the imperative of that is also jobs. If the majority of the global economy is moving to a net zero by 2050 target, which it is and then 34% of global GDP has made that commitment, then we have to be able to compete in that world. \u2026 We don\u2019t take the view \u2026 that the way to deal with this is just to make sure that we don\u2019t shut down some of those industries overnight, so we have a fundamental difference of policy about how to deal with this. Gallagher maintains accountability to the Senate regarding Higgins broadcast The final supplementary question on that section from Marise Payne is: The minister has a duty to be accountable to this chamber. Yet the minister has continually misused claims of confidentiality in response to questions about a very public media broadcast, which the minister asked hundreds of questions about herself. Is the minister hiding behind the excuse of confidentiality, because giving a direct answer would confirm that the minister misled the Senate when she said no one had any knowledge and misled the senate when she said that she did absolutely nothing with the information. Katy Gallagher: Well, the answer to that is no. And I have been accountable to the Senate. I\u2019ve stood here every day, answering questions that related to something that happened in the previous parliament. A very distressing situation for everyone, as we all know. (There is an inaudible interjection) Well, Senator Henderson, I believe, Miss Higgins. Now \u2026 it has been distressing for a lot of people in this building, as has this week. But the answer to your question is no. And I have been accountable to the Senate on both of those points that I believe needed addressing which was around the nature of whether I\u2019d misled and also role in the compensation payment. Gallagher denies doing anything with advanced information on Higgins broadcast The next question goes to whether or not Katy Gallagher did anything with the information she received advanced knowledge of (four days). Gallagher says, as she has all week, that she did not. I did nothing with the information because I was asked to keep the information confidential. I did that. I know it\u2019s hard for you to understand that someone \u2026 given the nature of the information given to me would actually do that, but that is what I did. I don\u2019t intend to go into any further details. Gallagher: \u2018If someone comes to me with information and asked that it be kept confidential, I intend to keep that confidentiality\u2019 Katy Gallagher: I\u2019m going back to my statement, and yes, I\u2019ve given numerous [answers on this] If somebody comes to me with information and asked that it be kept confidential, I intend to keep that confidentiality. That not just in this situation, but I\u2019ve done it hundreds of situations before that. I have no doubt I\u2019ll be doing it again. Payne questions Gallagher over Higgins broadcasts The Senate question time turns to Katy Gallagher and the questions she has been asked (and answered) all week. Liberal senator and the former minister for women Marise Payne refers to the Senate president, Sue Lines as \u201cMr President\u201d and is asked by Lines to \u201crephrase that\u201d: I\u2019m not Mr President. Payne: I\u2019m sorry. My apologies, Madam President. Years of habit, unfortunately for me. Payne moves to the question, which is to Gallagher: I refer the minister to her statement to the Senate on Tuesday and subsequent answers in multiple question times. How is it a breach of confidentiality, as the minister has repeatedly claimed, to confirm whether or not the minister received an advanced copy of the media broadcast, which has subsequently been made public? Greens senator Larissa Waters says David Van\u2019s senate position is \u2018untenable\u2019 Greens senator Larissa Waters claims Liberal David Van\u2019s position in the Senate is \u201cuntenable\u201d, adding her voice to Peter Dutton\u2019s calls for him to quit the parliament. Waters told a press conference at Parliament House this afternoon: Given the multiple allegations against Senator Van, it\u2019s untenable he remain in the Senate. \u2026 Senator Van should consider his political future. She did not answer directly when asked if she would support an inquiry or investigation into allegations against Van, but noted that parliament was updating internal processes of reporting such allegations. Van released a statement earlier today in which he said he was \u201cshattered by the events of the past days and stunned that my good reputation can be so wantonly savaged without due process or accountability\u201d. He said: I will fully cooperate with whatever process Mr Dutton proposes to determine these matters as quickly and fairly as possible. Ahead of question time, Lidia Thorpe, has thanked supporters for messages she has received in the last 48 hours, after making her allegations in the Senate, and spoke about why some survivors of violence do not wish to report their claims to police. In a short statement to the Senate this afternoon, just before question time, Thorpe said: Today I want to send a message of love and support to the women, girls and gender-diverse people out there - black, brown and white - who have experienced gender-based violence and harassment. I have been touched by all the messages of support that I\u2019ve received over the past 48 hours and I thank you. To all those who continue to stand up and refuse to stay silent about the ongoing violence and harassment inflicted on the bodies of our women and girls, sister-girls and brother-boys and other gender diverse folks - I thank you. When we speak about violence, we get asked \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you take it to the police?\u201d We know the police are not the experts. 87% of sexual assault cases go unreported in Australia, because we don\u2019t want to go to the police. Yet they are the only body that is fully resourced and funded and wandering the streets 24/7. The experts are our friends, our matriarchs, our sisters who answer our calls in the middle of the night when we\u2019re feeling unsafe and look after us. The experts are those working for support services that provide vital assistance and services that are stretched, underresourced and hard to access. They cannot keep up with the demand. To all those still fighting against the violent colonial system, and the conditions that allow gender-based violence to continue, may we continue to find strength and solidarity with each other. This country has the capacity to properly fund those support services, legal services and advocacy groups, who are saving lives and protecting our community against gender based violence. Penny Wong: claim was settled \u2018in accordance with legal principle and practice\u2019 Paul Scarr\u2019s final question in this round: Minister, can you confirm that the commonwealth agreed to settle the matter without putting any of the claims made to the people involved? Penny Wong: First, in relation to the comments about when settlements occurred, it is a very long time since I was a lawyer but from the deep dark recesses of my memory I recall that settlements could occur [during] many, many stages in the process. Sometimes, as you know, before a proceedings are issued, sometimes shortly after proceedings are issued and sometimes, as you identify, after proceedings had commenced, including hearings. The response I would make to what you put to me is that the advice I have is that this matter was settled in accordance with legal principle and practice, informed by external legal advice and vital litigant obligations were upheld. Liberal lines continue on compensation claim The supplementary questions go to the same issue. Paul Scarr: In terms of the follow-up question, can the minister confirm to the chamber that the claim was settled at the very first mediation, which lasted just a single day? And also can the minister confirm that no aspect of this claim ever came before a hearing? Penny Wong: As I understand it, the matter was obviously settled and the \u2026 intrinsic nature of settlements is the fact that they often occur prior to the letter going to any court or other tribunal. I don\u2019t have personal knowledge, nor does the advice in front of me indicate how long those discussions were engaged in. I would make the point that these are matters which are settled in accordance with legal principle and practice and \u2026 advise that the parties agree that the terms of the settlement are confidential. Scarr adds: I would note that in many cases, and the opposition leader has legal experience as I do, that many claims are settled \u2026 after court hearings are initiated. And sometimes mediations even occur \u2026 on the steps of the court. Liberal senators begin on conpensation claim questions Liberal senator Paul Scarr kicks things off by asking Penny Wong: Minister, in relation to the settlement of a compensation claim on 13th December 2022, why didn\u2019t the commonwealth or its legal representatives seek any evidence from former ministers or their staff about the matters cited in the claim? Wong: The advice I have is that the claim in question was managed consistently with the commonwealth\u2019s obligation under the legal services direction. And the commonwealth settled, in accordance with legal principle and practice, in relation to the legal representation point of Senator Cash and Senator Reynolds that was managed by the commonwealth consistently with the parliamentary business resources regulations. Obviously, Senators Cash and Reynolds are under no obligation to seek this assistance from the government. I have some further information which goes to the Legal Services Direction[s] 2017, which was issued by the attorney general under the Judiciary Act, which sets out binding rules for commonwealth legal work. The claim in question was managed in accordance with those principles. A very big thank you to Natasha \u2013 and thank you for joining me this afternoon as we take you through Senate question time. Amy Remeikis with you for the next little bit. Senate question time works a little differently to the house \u2013 senators can ask questions and then two supplementary questions. Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe is speaking in the Senate, so I\u2019m going to pass the blog over to Amy Remeikis who is going to bring you the latest from the Upper House. Another truck stuck under Melbourne\u2019s Montague St Bridge In news that will surprise no one \u2026 another truck has become stuck under Melbourne\u2019s notorious Montague Street Bridge. Read more about this perennial problem in Victoria\u2019s capital from my colleague Josh Taylor: Two federal bodies created to bolster arts sector The country\u2019s arts sector will get a support boost after laws setting up two creative bodies passed parliament, AAP reports. Music Australia will aim to boost the country\u2019s contemporary music sector, while Creative Workplaces will focus on raising the standard of employment conditions in the sector. Both bodies will fall under Creative Australia, a renamed Australia Council that has been overhauled as part of a multimillion-dollar arts policy. Music Australia will be backed by more than $69m of funding over the next four years. It will focus on delivering songwriting and recording initiatives in schools, as well as supporting professionals in the industry and providing coordination for live music venues. The bill to establish the two bodies passed the Senate today without amendment. The arts minister, Tony Burke, said Creative Workplaces would raise workplace standards across all forms of art. He said: Arts workers are essential workers. They deserve safe workplaces and fair pay, like any other worker. Creative Workplaces will ensure that. The bill forms part of the government\u2019s $286m arts program called Revive. The government said further legislation will be introduced to expand on Creative Australia, including setting up a First Nations body, as well a body named Writers Australia. There were 1,592 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and five people are in intensive care. Greens, crossbenchers back campaign to lower voting age Academics say it is \u201cin the self-interest\u201d for Labor to back crossbench calls to lower the voting age to 16 after a youth-led campaign was launched in Canberra. The Make it 16 campaign has been backed by the Greens and crossbench MPs, including independent member for Kooyong, Monique Ryan. Rob Watts, an RMIT policy, politics and human rights professor said young voters were leaving the Coalition \u201cin droves\u201d in recent elections. It is in the self-interest of Labor to lock in both the 41% of voters aged 18-34 who swung over to Labor after the 2022 election and secure the support of the 600,000 15-17 year olds by giving them the vote. Seven countries, including Scotland and Wales, have lowered the voting age while Canada, Mexico and Germany are poised to follow. New Zealand has also entered the debate. Watts said amid an active global movement, there was \u201cgood chance\u201d the legislation would get through. Sociology professor Judith Bessant said young people already demonstrated a \u201ccapacity and an interest in politics\u201d. There is good research evidence that lowering the voting age leads to greater political participation in formal politics by young people. Countries where the voting age has been reduced to 16 have enjoyed increasing participation by young people in formal politics. Australia\u2019s online privacy laws should target websites instead of search engines, says Google As Australia considers the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d, Google\u2019s chief privacy officer says the law should target websites that host information instead of the search engines that make it easy to find. Keith Enright\u2019s visit to Australia coincides with a spotlight on digital privacy after massive data breaches at Latitude, Medibank and Optus. In their wake, the Albanese government announced a raft of proposed changes to the Privacy Act designed to bring the law into the digital age. One of the key proposals is similar to the European-style \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d laws but specifically targets online search results. It calls for a right to de-index online search results containing personal information, such as medical history; information about a child; excessively detailed information; or inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, misleading or irrelevant information. Read more: Crown has been slapped with a $20m fine for failing to pay its fair share of Victoria\u2019s casino tax. Victoria\u2019s royal commission into Crown Melbourne found the casino giant improperly claimed tax deductions by including the costs of certain promotional activities as amounts paid out as winnings. It also sought to deliberately conceal the nature of these deductions from the regulator. The practice was highlighted during the 2021 royal commission, with Crown accepting it was wrong to claim the tax deductions and subsequently reimbursing the state about $61.5m. A further $20m fine was issued by the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) on Friday. VGCCC chair Fran Thorn said: Not only did Crown breach its obligations by claiming tax deductions to which it was not entitled, Crown also made significant efforts at concealment, The VGCCC will not tolerate this behaviour \u2026 We expect licensees to comply with their tax obligations and to be transparent in their dealings with us.\u201d The Victorian regulator has imposed $250m worth of fines on Crown following revelations from the royal commission.

Read more about why we\u2019ve made the decision, from Guardian Australia\u2019s editor Lenore Taylor: There were 3,956 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 17 people are in intensive care. Case numbers have also dropped from last week\u2019s 6,135 \u2013 but deaths (which are always a lagging indicator) are this week nearly double the 64 recorded seven days ago. There were 6,906 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 35 people are in intensive care. This week\u2019s numbers are a sharp drop from the 11,719 cases and 81 deaths recorded last week. Dutton urges Van to resign from parliament Liberal leader Peter Dutton has told Sydney radio 2GB he believes Senator David Van should resign from parliament and seek help. Dutton said: I think it is in everyone\u2019s best interest that he resign from the parliament and I hope he\u2019s able to do that sooner [rather] than later. And, and seek the help that he needs. Dutton said it was up to the Victorian branch of the Liberal party whether he remained in the Liberal party. Dutton said he had \u201cno regrets\u201d in expelling Van from the Liberal party room and that he did not act \u201cright off the back\u201d of Lidia Thorpe\u2019s allegations, which she raised in the parliament. Van has vehemently denied Thorpe\u2019s claims. Dutton said he made his decision after speaking to former senator Amanda Stoker, who alleged Van had inappropriately touched her at a social event in November 2020. Van said he recalled a conversation with Stoker, but not the incident she alleged had occurred. Van has said he believes it is unfair that he was removed from the Liberal party room. Dutton said he stands by his choice and that he does not tolerate the kind of behaviour Van has been accused of. I\u2019ve been very clear about that for many, many years, and it\u2019s not a throwaway line for me. I believe that very strongly, and I believe that I had to act and I did that and don\u2019t have any regrets in doing so. The opposition leader Peter Dutton has accused Senator Lidia Thorpe of besmirching \u201ceverybody who works in Parliament House\u201d with sexual assault allegations he says lack detail. While Dutton moved to ban Senator David Van from the Liberal party room following Thorpe\u2019s sexual assault allegations, Dutton has now taken aim at the independent senator. Speaking to 3AW radio station, he said: Senator Thorpe \u2013 and it\u2019s been well documented in the papers, her conduct inside and outside of the chamber \u2013 does need to seek support \u2026 with all due respect to her. ... I think Senator Thorpe has lots of issues and some of those and her own conduct have been well documented. She made serious allegations in the Senate this week. She hasn\u2019t provided the names or details of individuals involved. She doesn\u2019t wish to make a complaint to the police. She says she doesn\u2019t want the matters to go further. In the absence of any detail, it\u2019s hard to just besmirch everybody without providing details. It\u2019s hard to investigate that and provide an outcome. \u2026 To besmirch everybody who works in Parliament House. This is not a partisan thing. It\u2019s not a party thing. There are individuals who need to be held to account \u2026 And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in relation to the responsibilities that I have. Van has denied wrongdoing. AGL to reduce dividend payouts from FY24 to fund transition away from coal AGL narrowed its underlying earnings ranges for FY23 to $1.33bn and $1.375bn (previous guidance was $1.25b to $1.375b) in a statement released to the ASX. The company also expects a higher underlying profit after tax of $255m to $285m (previously $200m to $280m). The upgrades reflect increased generation due to improved plant availability, a reduction in forced outages and a higher customer margin. This is partly offset by higher operating costs on increased maintenance costs, bad debt expenses and the impact of inflation. In FY24, underlying earnings are forecast to surge to $1.875bn and $2.175bn for an underlying profit after tax of $580m to $780m. AGL also announced a change to dividend policy from FY24, reducing the payout to 50 to 75% of underlying profit after tax from the previous longstanding guidance of 75%. Nicks said: That will allow us to fund the transition and also allows us to provide the appropriate returns to shareholders. As Australia\u2019s largest emitter, the company is spending up to $10bn over the next eight to 12 years on shutting down ageing coal-fired power stations and replacing them with renewable energy sources and fast-start gas units. AGL continues to target a complete exit from coal-fired generation by the end of FY35. - AAP AGL ups profit outlook amid \u2018tough period for everyone\u2019 AGL Energy has upgraded its profit forecasts as it prepares to slug customers with bill increases of up to 30%, AAP reports. Announcing a brighter outlook for shareholders this year and next, AGL\u2019s chief executive, Damien Nicks, said the business is highly leveraged to wholesale prices, which have increased significantly in recent years. We are acutely aware of the impact to our customers in this inflationary period. It\u2019s a tough period for everyone. Nicks encouraged customers to switch to monthly from quarterly bills to help manage cost of living pressures. Price changes take effect from 1 July and the company is expecting an increase in customer debt despite taxpayer-funded bill relief hitting accounts.

Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html Lidia Thorpe: \u2018not at all\u2019 safe for black women to go to the police in Australia Thorpe said referring her allegations against Van to police was not an option for her or for marginalised people who had experienced sexual violence. The police need to change their behaviours and look at themselves as to why people like me and so many other women do not go to the police. Do you think it\u2019s safe for black women to go to the police in this country? Not at all. So that\u2019s not an option. And they\u2019re the processes, they\u2019re the structures that we need to change to make [for] women and people of colour and [who are] transgender. It needs to be a safe space for us. We are questioned. We are pulled through the coals to justify what happened to us and it should be the other way around and it\u2019s not a safe space. So that was not an option for me. Circling back to Senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s interview: she has accused the media of not taking her allegations made against David Van in parliament seriously until a white woman \u2013 Amanda Stoker \u2013 also came forward. Speaking about the last week, Thorpe says: It\u2019s been horrible. I \u2026 became the perpetrator. I became the person that was demonised \u2026 And I had a media pile-on, that day. And it wasn\u2019t until a white woman stood up and said, \u2018yeah, this happened to me, too\u2019, that the media took notice. And I think that is a great example of the media landscape in this country. And that is systemic racism. I was not believed. I was questioned. I was absolutely demonised that day, by everybody. And you wonder why women don\u2019t speak out. You wonder why we are silenced. It\u2019s because of that kind of behaviour. Senator Van has denied allegations made against him. Bridget Archer \u2018heartened\u2019 by Peter Dutton\u2019s swift action after David Van allegations Asked about whether she\u2019s having conversations within her own party about how responsible it is to be pursuing the issues around sexual assault in the way the Coalition have, Archer says she has \u201ccertainly\u201d made her views known over a long period of time. She says she has not directly spoken to the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, \u201crecently.\u201d However, Archer says she was \u201cheartened\u201d by his response taking seriously the issues raised by Senator Thorpe. And he has been clear, I think \u2026 publicly that they\u2019re seeking to pursue a line of questioning around whether or not Senator Gallagher misled the parliament and that is a reasonable question to ask. And in doing that, is trying to kind of be mindful of all of those other issues that sit around it, but that\u2019s a very difficult, very delicate line to walk - I think is just my my point. And we\u2019ve seen many, many days of that and it\u2019s it really is re-traumatising for a lot of people and very difficult to sit with and \u2026 there has got to be a point where there is some type of resolution to that. Bridget Archer: issue of sexual harassment in Parliament House \u2018triggering\u2019 Archer says she\u2019s received correspondence from community members who are survivors of sexual assault saying they struggle listening to the discourse coming out of the nation\u2019s capital. Archer says for her too and other parliamentary colleagues, it\u2019s challenging: For me, personally, I found \u2026 the challenge of all of these issues in the last parliament, incredibly difficult. I do find it somewhat triggering, some of these conversations, as many other people in our community do, and I know that many other people here in Parliament House do. Bridget Archer agrees with Lidia Thorpe\u2019s assessment of \u2018really toxic\u2019 culture towards women Liberal MP Bridget Archer says she agrees with the independent senator Lidia Thorpe that the culture towards women in Parliament House and the media is \u201creally toxic.\u201d Archer told ABC Radio that some of her colleagues have turned the issue of sexual assault into a political football: If you\u2019re observing the behaviour and commentary that\u2019s been going on in parliament in the last couple of weeks, and the commentary in the media, etc, about it \u2026 you would be disinclined to come forward and say that you had experienced sexual assault because it\u2019s really as Senator Thorpe said, it\u2019s really toxic. Everybody\u2019s running a commentary about whether you\u2019re telling the truth or not. Your private correspondence is on the front page of the newspaper for people to commentate about. The parliament [is] still discussing what people knew about this, that and the other thing \u2013 in the meantime forgetting that there are victims survivors or alleged, victims at their centre of all of these things. \u2026 They\u2019re sort of turning these issues into political footballs. Helen Haines commends Peter Dutton for fast action over David Van allegations The independent member for Indi, Helen Haines, has commended Peter Dutton for the \u201cfast action\u201d he has taken in banning Senator David Van from the Liberal party room. Haines has told ABC Radio Melbourne \u201cif one woman doesn\u2019t feel safe in our parliament, then no woman [does]\u201d. The distress we witnessed in the Senate this week is truly awful. Van has denied all wrongdoing. Haines says significant progress has been made since the Jenkins Report but we have \u201cquite a way to go\u201d. When is a recession just \u2018technical\u2019 and will we get one? Expect a lot more frenzied commentary about Australia falling into a recession, particularly if the Reserve Bank puts on its boots and hikes interest rates again in July, August and perhaps September. The odds of such moves increased after yesterday\u2019s jobs numbers (see here) became the latest \u201cupside surprise\u201d about how much heat there is in our economy. New Zealand\u2019s 0.1% quarterly contraction in March triggered such headlines yesterday. Economies are a bit like the weather: the Pacific might nudge into El Ni\u00f1o conditions (any week now, by the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s measures) but it\u2019s not like a switch has been flicked. Similarly, a recession\u2019s declaration won\u2019t result in the lights flickering or switching off. That\u2019s not to minimise the financial stress many people are feeling, and likely to feel more of in the coming months. We look here at what counts as a recession and whether we\u2019re headed for one here: One takeaway is that until the unemployment rate starts to put its own boots on and starts climbing, we might be able to avoid a recession \u2013 technical or actual. Ute driver dead after police pursuit in Sydney A ute driver has died after fleeing police and colliding with another vehicle during a short pursuit in Sydney\u2019s south, AAP reports. The chase began after the driver allegedly failed to stop for a traffic and highway patrol officer on Alfords Point Rd, Menai, about 6am this morning. Further up the road, the driver\u2019s ute hit another vehicle and then came to a halt, police said. The man, who has not been formally identified, died at the scene. The driver of the other vehicle was not injured. Alfords Point Rd has been closed in both directions as specialist police head to the crime scene. Police from the Sydney city command will lead an internal investigation into the incident, which will be subject to an independent review. Temporary leadership switchup at advocacy group The Parenthood There has been a temporary changing of the guard at advocacy group The Parenthood, with CEO Georgie Dent announcing she is taking a six-month sabbatical in Canada. Jessica Rudd will take on the role from July while Dent is away. The organisation\u2019s patron, Wendy McCarthy AO, has accepted the role of chair. McCarthy said: Jessica\u2019s skills and professional experience in law, communications, media and business make her eminently qualified to lead and thrive in this role. As an organisation we are thrilled to enable Georgie Dent to take a well-earned sabbatical relocating with her family to Canada. As an organisation committed to ensuring parents are supported to combine their caring responsibilities with work and family life, the board\u2019s decision to appoint a CEO in Georgie\u2019s absence was simple. We approached this temporary change in Georgie\u2019s family situation in the same way we would if an employee was taking parental leave: with flexibility and accommodation. Senator David Van has released a statement this morning: I am utterly shattered by the events of the past days and stunned that my good reputation can be so wantonly savaged without due process or accountability. I will fully cooperate with whatever process Mr Dutton proposes to determine these matters as quickly and fairly as possible. While I understand the public interest is high, I will not be making any more public statements on the allegations until a proper examination of these claims is concluded. Labor and Greens stalled on housing future fund negotiations The government was really hoping for some sort of resolution to its housing future fund bill this sitting, but so far it doesn\u2019t look like it has bent enough to secure the necessary support. Labor needs the Green\u2019s agreement if it wants to progress the legislation through the parliament, but so far the parties haven\u2019t managed to come to a compromise. The government has agreed to make the $500m a year for social and affordable housing a floor not a ceiling, but the Greens want to see more done \u2013 and sooner. The first houses from the fund won\u2019t be built until 2025. Greens senator Larissa Waters says more needs to be done, now. Including a rent freeze. She told ABC News Breakfast: We\u2019ve been in discussions with the government for many months and we continue to make offers of compromise to them to tackle this most serious housing crisis. This is the worst it\u2019s been in our nation\u2019s history. We have seen rents go up more than 20% in the last 12 months and we know more and more ordinary Australians are literally one rent rise away from sleeping in their car. Including legions of children. So we have put to the government, just put a freeze on rents. You can do that and coordinate a cap on energy prices nationally. Why is rent any different? You could do this if you wish to. Anthony Albanese has said that national cabinet has advice that rent freezes won\u2019t work to improve the housing situation, but that the states and territories are looking at solutions. Negotiations continue. Circling back to Lidia Thorpe\u2019s interview, she says parliament still has a \u201ctoxic workplace culture towards women.\u201d It is not a safe workplace for women. Yes, there have been improvements, because we now have a plan to try and make it safer. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a completely safe environment. I have government workers \u2013 \u2026 parliamentary workers - in that place who have cried to me at the elevator because they don\u2019t feel safe in that building at night. Young women. So these are women that won\u2019t go to the authorities. These are women that won\u2019t even go to their supervisors. They\u2019ve come to me because I\u2019ve shared my story. It\u2019s just everywhere. It\u2019s such a toxic culture in that workplace. I\u2019ve never experienced such a toxic workplace culture towards women. Opposition leader Peter Dutton says he is aware of further allegations of sexual assault against Senator David Van. Dutton has told Nine\u2019s Today program: I have raised another allegation with Senator Van but I\u2019m not going to comment in relation to those matters otherwise. I made a decision yesterday based on all of the information that was available to me. Nine host: You are suggesting there is more than just the allegation from Senator Stoker and from Lidia Thorpe? Dutton: Yes, and I\u2019m not going into that detail as I said. Dutton has expelled Senator Van from the Liberal party room and he will now sit on the crossbench. Van has denied all wrongdoing. Greens Senator fears \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on victim survivors of sexual harassment and assault Waters says she\u2019s concerned what\u2019s happened in parliament will have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on victim survivors. Now it feels like we have taken a huge step backwards \u2026 I can only worry about what this week has done to anyone out there who [has] experienced sexual harassment or assault \u2013 and we know sadly how many people fit into that category. What they must be feeling when they see personal text messages splashed across the front page of a newspaper. When they see the tone that was taken in relation to sexual assault allegations this week. And when they see fresh allegations about the alleged conduct of parliamentarians, I really fear the chilling effect this will have on survivor. ... We need to make sure when women come forward they\u2019re supported and given advice, respected ask they are assisted to seek justice and we need time prove those justice system response processes, as well as cleaning up our own backyard here in parliament. Meanwhile, Greens senator Larissa Waters says it feels like parliamentary culture around women has \u201ctaken a huge step backwards\u201d this week. Waters has told ABC News Breakfast it had been an \u201cunedifying week\u201d in federal parliament. I really thought that parliamentary culture had started to turn a corner. And it felt like we were a little safer in our workplaces, but the politicisation of the sexual assault allegations raised by Brittany Higgins has dominated question time this week. And made the place feel, I think again, far less safe for any victim survivor who is watching on and seeing how allegations like this are being weaponised and politicised. She referred to allegations made in parliament by Senator Lidia Thorpe. It feels like we\u2019re back to square one and it breaks my heart \u2026 and I just hope that we can continue with the reforms that we\u2019ve started to make with the Set the Standard report and hope we can have a safer workplace going forwards. Waters said the decision to expel David Van from the party room was a matter for the party leader Peter Dutton, but she urged him to take action on how his party raised sexual assault allegations in Question Time: He now needs to do is to tell his team to rein the politicisation of sexual assault allegations in Question Time. Senator David Van has denied all allegations made this week against him. Bruce Lehrmann has denied all allegations made against him by Higgins. Thorpe: a voice with no power \u2018is not self-determination\u2019 Thorpe reiterates her commitment to Treaty: It must be between sovereign states and territories are not sovereign. \u2026 You can\u2019t have a government controlled process, which is what it\u2019s been from the beginning. It has to be sovereign ... the crown say that they are sovereign. \u2026 And that\u2019s why we ask, we stand by the fact that we are sovereign. We will continue to fight for treaty as sovereigns, and until the government recognise that we are sovereign, we can\u2019t move forward. Thorpe says she is not turning her back on the voice, but says the voice will have no power: It has no money. It has no power, and it\u2019s at the whim of the parliament and it has parliamentary supremacy over it at all times. That is not self-determination. Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe says \u201cat this stage\u201d she will be voting no on the government\u2019s bill for a referendum on the Indigenous voice to parliament. She\u2019s told ABC Radio her position on the voice is: At this stage, I\u2019ll be voting no to the bill that is before us to change the constitution, given the government have not come forward with proof on what their interpretation of sovereignty is. I know that for months now that they continue to say that this does not affect the sovereignty of First Nations people in this country, however, they\u2019ve never provided any evidence. And that\u2019s \u2026 why I will be putting in an amendment to that bill for them to acknowledge the sovereignty of First Nations people. It has been a rough week in parliament and usually, Friday is a day MPs are freed from the bounds of parliament, but today there is no relief for the senators, who are sitting an extra day to try and get through the legislative workload. House MPs are off as usual and won\u2019t return until Monday, but it is a full day for the Senate, including a question time. Yesterday, the finance minister and minister for women, Katy Gallagher, became tearful as she took yet another question on what she knew about Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations before they were publicly aired. Gallagher said she would keep fronting up but she took her promise of confidentiality seriously and had already explained herself. Anthony Albanese will address the local government conference which has been in town for most of this week. He\u2019ll give that speech around 8.30. Peter Dutton addressed it earlier in the week. We\u2019ll keep you updated on the happenings of the Senate and politics more general through this blog today. Take care of you. Magnitude 7 quake hits south of Fiji There has been a magnitude 7.0 earthquake south of Fiji. However, the Bureau of Meteorology says there is no tsunami threat to Australia. Pig slaughterhouse protests Activists are planning a weekend of protest at slaughterhouses across the country to draw attention to the use of carbon dioxide gassing to stun pigs. Farm Transparency Project last month released vision showing the effects of gassing on pigs, which showed animals suffocating and writhing in agony in tightly cramped chambers. The vision, first reported by the ABC, prompted calls for greater investigation into alternative stunning techniques. Gassing is now considered industry best practice. Activists, angry at a lack of action, have staged protests at Swickers slaughterhouse in Kingaroy, Queensland and in Hobart. They are planning further protests in Adelaide, Cairns, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne in coming days. Chris Delforce, founding director of the Farm Transparency Project, said: What happens to animals inside Australian slaughterhouses is an area of significant public interest, we are taking action to bring much needed attention to an issue that the government would much rather ignore and hide from. Good morning! Thanks to Martin for kicking things off. This is Natasha May \u2013 I\u2019ll be with you into the afternoon. Show of support for Chinese-Australian artist Australian consular officials in Poland will attend the opening of an exhibition in the country\u2019s capital by Chinese-Australian artist Badiucao today, to send a message to Chinese authorities who have allegedly tried to stop the show going ahead. On Wednesday Australia\u2019s ambassador to Poland, Lloyd Brodrick, met the Shanghai-born Australian artist, as well as executives from the museum where the show is being held, Warsaw\u2019s Ujazdowski Castle. Both Badiucao and the museum allege that China\u2019s ambassador to Poland, Yao Dongye, has visited the museum twice over the past two weeks, demanding the exhibition not go ahead. Badiucao, who is based in Melbourne, uses art to explore censorship and human rights abuses in China, including the manipulation of historical memory about the Tiananmen Square massacre, the forced cultural assimilation of Uyghurs, pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and China\u2019s position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that Brodrick had met the artist and museum executives on Wednesday: They discussed Badiucao\u2019s work, his concerns in relation to personal safety and the support the Australian government was providing. Full story here: The Australian Services Union has criticised the federal government over its handling of a Services Australia procurement process, which it says will leave more than 600 call centre employees out of work in a matter of weeks. Services Australia-contracted Serco employees were told today that the company\u2019s contract would end on 30 June. Most are award workers, while some are casual, with little to no termination entitlements. ASU Victorian private sector branch secretary Imogen Sturni said the decision would see workers unemployed in a fortnight: Most of these workers do not have the safety net provided by generous termination benefits and, even for those who will receive a minimal termination payment, two weeks\u2019 notice is a pretty shoddy thing to do to them. It is the responsibility of government to ensure that its procurement processes do not have unreasonable adverse effects on workers. Sturni said ASU delegates had been advised that the decision would impact around 610 workers at Essendon Fields and Mill Park sites. She said the union was hoping that Serco would be able to reassign some workers to other jobs internally, but it was likely that positions would be limited and only temporary. A Services Australia spokesperson said it had conducted a competitive procurement process for a new supplementary call centre contract to provide services from 1 July 2023, and Serco had not been selected: We thank Serco for their support. They\u2019ve provided services to supplement day-to-day operations and to help fill short-term requirements \u2013 particularly during business peaks and in the coronavirus pandemic. Serco is responsible for the arrangements of its staff. Services Australia has been actively recruiting for APS staff and has ensured contracted staff were encouraged to apply for job opportunities as they became available. PM to announce community energy upgrades fund Local councils will be able to apply for money to make swimming pools, sporting grounds and courts more energy efficient under a new $100m fund, AAP reports. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will announce today in Canberra the community energy upgrades fund in a speech to the nation\u2019s councils. Under the scheme, councils can upgrade energy systems for pool heating systems, lighting for sports grounds and courts and fund new storage technology at community centres and libraries. The government plans to have the program up and running before the end of the year. Albanese is expected to say he is pleased at the number of local governments to have made commitments to net zero. The prime minister will also appeal to mayors to help improve housing affordability and unlock more supply. Triple America\u2019s Cup skipper and dual Australian Olympian Sir James Hardy has died in Adelaide aged 90, AAP reports. The yachtsman, vintner and community leader died peacefully yesterday. A member of the America\u2019s Cup Hall of Fame, Hardy helped set the tone for Australia\u2019s momentous and nation-building victory in the famous race. He skippered Australia\u2019s America Cup challenges in 1970, 1974 and 1980 and was a key adviser for the Australia II crew, led by John Bertrand, that in 1983 ended the 132-year US dominance of the race. In a 2021 interview he said: Basically I was back-up skipper for Bertrand, and he did pinch a nerve in his neck and he was off the boat. I believe it was nine or 10 races. Known as \u201cGentleman Jim\u201d, Hardy was made an OBE in 1975 and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981 for services to yachting and the community. Australian Sailing president Alistair Murray said: There will never be another Sir James. His contribution to the sport cannot be overstated. He was beloved by everyone he met and could not have given more of himself to driving the success of sailing in Australia. Personally, he was my hero, and I was proud to call him my friend. On behalf of Australian Sailing, I would like to share our sadness at the news and pass our condolences to his family and the many sailing friends he made along the way. Hardy competed in consecutive Olympic Games, Tokyo in 1964 and Mexico City in 1968. Australian Olympic Committee president Ian Chesterman said Hardy was a giant of his sport: James Hardy\u2019s name is inextricably bound with the sport he loved over so many decades. He ignited Australia\u2019s obsession with claiming the America\u2019s Cup trophy, eventually achieved in 1983, with Sir James advising winning skipper John Bertrand. He is survived by his wife Joan, brother David, sister Pamela, and sons David and Richard. A private funeral will be held in Adelaide, with a memorial service to follow at a later date. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer, here to get you up to speed on the main stories while my colleague Natasha May fires up the Mac. A second female politician has accused Liberal senator David Van of sexual harassment. This follows allegations by Lidia Thorpe on Wednesday, which he strenuously denied. He\u2019s been dumped from the party room by leader Peter Dutton, who said the parliamentary workplace support services would now investigate the claims. We\u2019ll have the latest as it happens. A cracked windscreen, oil leaks and seatbelts that didn\u2019t work were among the defects found by police when they raided two depots of the bus company Linq Busline at the centre of the Hunter Valley crash tragedy last night. And the latest data shows Australia\u2019s population grew 1.9% last year, the fastest for 13 years, thanks to returning foreign students and migrant workers after Covid. The population at 31 December 2022 was 26.3 million people, the ABS said. There were 619,600 overseas migration arrivals and 232,600 departures, resulting in Australia\u2019s population growing by 387,000 people from overseas migration. It means a potential boost for growth but, with further rate hikes a possibility, we look at whether recession is likely or not. And in news out overnight, triple America\u2019s Cup skipper and dual Australian Olympian Sir James Hardy has died in Adelaide. The yachtsman, vintner and community leader died peacefully yesterday."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a677", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/16/itv-in-talks-to-buy-group-behind-the-traitors-and-fleabag-all3media", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "ITV in talks to buy group behind The Traitors and Fleabag", "lead": "Discussions with All3Media come amid plan to move away from reliance on TV advertising", "author": "Jasper Jolly", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 08:26:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112370", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1a7487ba0e93f7629ee7171dac4caaadb5bc1a3a/11_159_4251_2552/500.jpg", "body": "ITV has confirmed it is in talks to buy All3Media, which owns the production companies behind hit shows such as Fleabag, The Traitors, and Wild Isles, as it seeks to expand its studio arm. The FTSE 250 broadcaster is in talks with All3Media\u2019s joint owners, the US media companies Warner Bros Discovery and Liberty Global, it said on Friday in a stock market announcement. Carolyn McCall, ITV\u2019s chief executive, is trying to diversify the company\u2019s revenues away from a reliance on television advertising, which is expected to decline further as the UK economy slows. By contrast, the global demand for new content remains strong. All3Media could be valued at as much as \u00a31bn, according to Reuters which first reported the talks. One option under consideration could involve Liberty growing its existing 9.9% stake in ITV, while Warner Bros could sell out, according to a source cited by Reuters. ITV confirmed that it was \u201cactively exploring the possible acquisition of All3Media\u201d in a statement. Discovery and Liberty Global bought All3Media in 2014 for an enterprise value of about \u00a3550m. The company, which also owns the makers of Gogglebox, Midsomer Murders and The Only Way is Essex, had its biggest revenue year in 2021, making \u00a3867m. All3Media was set up in 2003, and has steadily grown by acquiring production companies across different genres and regions. It includes production companies in the UK, US, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and New Zealand, with a central office handling functions such as finance. That would fit with the ITV Studios arm, which makes shows such as Love Island and Line of Duty. ITV Studios reported record revenues of \u00a3458m in the final three months of 2022. At the start of 2023, ITV Studios\u2019 revenues remained steady, cushioning the blow from a 10% decline in advertising sales. ITV and other broadcasters dependent on advertising have had to contend with inflation and rising interest rates, which have prompted advertisers to scale back their campaigns in anticipation of a weaker economy. McCall has also had to deal with the fallout from the departure of the former star presenter Phillip Schofield from the broadcaster\u2019s This Morning show. Schofield last month quit This Morning after admitting he had lied about an \u201cunwise, but not illegal\u201d affair."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a678", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/16/divided-tories-prepare-for-free-vote-on-boris-johnson-partygate-report", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson tells allies not to vote against Partygate report", "lead": "Deeply divided Tory MPs prepare for free vote with some saying they need to back parliament\u2019s procedures", "author": "Kiran Stacey and Rowena Mason", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 08:05:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112388", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/afcc3b746e7a52f3ebaf249b373f17fc30492684/0_271_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has told allies not to vote against the privileges committee\u2019s report on Partygate on Monday when MPs will decide whether to give it their formal approval. Sources close to the former prime minister said on Friday he has told supporters not to reject the report at what is likely to be a heated but largely symbolic debate next week. The report, which was published on Thursday, found Johnson lied to the Commons when he told MPs he believed he had not broken lockdown rules by attending parties in Downing Street during the pandemic. MPs will be given their chance to comment on the report during a debate on Monday, which will culminate in a free vote to approve it. The committee said that had Johnson still been an MP, it would have recommended he be given a 90-day suspension. Johnson stood down before the report was published however, leaving members instead to vote on the recommendation that he not be granted a former member\u2019s pass. The Conservative party is deeply divided over the vote, with some backbenchers promising to approve it but others warning they would retaliate against anyone who does so. The Tory former cabinet minister Damian Green said on Friday morning he intended to vote for the report, calling it \u201cvery clearcut\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that parliament respects its own systems,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe set up this committee asking them to do this very serious report. They\u2019ve come up with what is clearly a very damning set of conclusions. If parliament runs away from that then it calls into question whether we should carry on having this kind of self-regulation.\u201d Johnson\u2019s allies concede they expect parliament to approve the report, with opposition parties united in favour of it and mass abstentions expected on the Tory benches. Johnson has told allies to stay away from the vote in the hope of depriving the moment of drama. But several of those closest to the former prime minister are promising to target any Conservative MP who does turn up to vote in favour. One Johnson backer told the Guardian on Thursday: \u201cThey just don\u2019t realise the extent of anger they have created, and that will be manifested.\u201d Nadine Dorries, who has promised to resign from her Mid Bedfordshire seat in protest at not being given a peerage but has not yet done so, has warned \u201cdeselections will follow\u201d for Tory MPs who vote for the report. Downing Street has still not said whether Rishi Sunak will attend Monday\u2019s vote, with the government declining to put pressure on MPs. The Telegraph reported on Friday the prime minister planned to meet an unnamed foreign leader on that day, which might render him unable to vote. Johnson could cause further problems for Sunak if he is unveiled as a new columnist for the Daily Mail on Friday as expected \u2013 though the parliamentary committee which vets business appointments for former ministers is now looking into the rumoured role. A spokesperson for the committee said its chair, Eric Pickles, would be writing to Johnson to ask for clarification on whether he does intend to take up the role. A report in the Financial Times even suggested Johnson could stand as an independent in next year\u2019s London mayoral contest. Penny Mordaunt, the Commons leader, made it clear on Thursday the government would not put pressure on Tory MPs to vote one way or the other on Monday. She told the Commons she wanted MPs to \u201cread the report \u2026 make their own judgments about it, and take the task that is our privilege to do seriously and soberly\u201d."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a679", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/16/dont-worry-darling-to-rafiki-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Don\u2019t Worry Darling to Rafiki: the seven best films to watch on TV this week", "lead": "Florence Pugh and Harry Styles star in a twisty 50s mystery with serious Stepford Wives vibes, and the defiant lesbian romance that is set in \u2013 and banned in \u2013 Kenya", "author": "Simon Wardell", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 08:00:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112408", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7086d40ac1fcc7f276bf38b238c1df6fa9bf7a88/0_20_2400_1440/500.jpg", "body": "Pick of the week Don\u2019t Worry Darling With gossip about Shia LaBeouf\u2019s firing, director Olivia Wilde\u2019s relationship with cast member Harry Styles, and star Florence Pugh\u2019s alleged pay gap to Styles, this 50s-set cold war mystery arrives carting a ton of baggage.

Sally (Binoche) reluctantly carries out illegal courier jobs for her convict brother Dennis (Frank Grillo), who is being threatened in jail. That is until the latest package turns out to be Leila (Hala Finley), a victim of child sex trafficking. Going on the run with the girl, Sally has to choose between loyalty and morality, while Morgan Freeman\u2019s FBI veteran gets ever closer. Saturday 17 June, 6.25am, 5.55pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** The Killing of Two Lovers The film\u2019s title and clanking soundtrack give a jagged edge to this wrenching drama about a couple\u2019s trial separation. In a rural Utah town, Clayne Crawford\u2019s David tries to keep things friendly with wife Niki (Sepideh Moafi) for their four kids but hopelessness threatens to overwhelm him; the awkward exchanges between father and children reveal the impact the split is having on everyone. Director Robert Machoian skilfully establishes an air of knotted suspense over David\u2019s mental state, in a landscape where all joy seems to have washed away.

With the capital evacuated, viewers may be reminded of the eerily empty city of 28 Days Later, but for audiences in 1950 the recent war would have given the film an added frisson, as the search roams through bombed-out buildings and unnaturally quiet streets.

Amir El-Masry plays Omar, a Syrian musician stuck with other single men in the middle of nowhere. Along with Farhad (Vikash Bhai), an Afghan Zoroastrian and Freddie Mercury fan, he awaits a decision about his claim while fluctuating between boredom and despair. Still, there\u2019s a lot of leftfield humour to be had from their lot, not least in the \u201ccultural awareness\u201d classes run by Sidse Babett Knudsen\u2019s teacher. Tuesday 20 June, 9pm, Film4 *** Oldboy His romantic mystery Decision to Leave was one of the finest releases of last year, but Korean film-maker Park Chan-wook is better known for intricate, violent revenge tales, none better than this 2003 movie. Cho Min-sik gives his considerable all (not least in the notorious octopus-swallowing scene) as Oh Dae-su, a father held captive for 15 years by figures unknown, then suddenly released. His hunt for his jailers brings him into contact with Kang Hye-jung\u2019s chef Mi-do, but their tender connection is skewed by Dae-su\u2019s vengeance, depicted in impressively bloody detail.

In the 1990s, Blake\u2019s talents could have put him alongside his gifted peers in the international jazz polls, but while many focused on updates of classic jazz traditions, he didn\u2019t, and still doesn\u2019t. Now 59, he retains the inviting flair he has always had \u2013 for rich intricacy snaking through a folksy melodic openness, and spontaneous resources embracing swing, improv and the contemporary freebop of sax stars such as David Liebman (one of his first tutors), Joe Lovano and the late Michael Brecker. On Dance of the Mystic Bliss \u2013 a dreamy title that slightly short-changes the joyous audacity of this music \u2013 Blake surrounds himself with a dynamic Brazilian trio comprising two percussionists and exciting guitarist Guilherme Monteiro, plus New York folk/psychedelia violinist Skye Steele (uncorking a storming free-barndance hoedown on the dirgily Ornettish Sagra here), cellist Christopher Hoffman and bassist Michael Bates. The opening Merle the Pearl is a tumbling tenor sax vamp over a funky guitar hook that veers into a highlife vibe. Standout Little Demons \u2013 a ducking-and-diving tenor theme like a punchy Brecker lick, answered in short ripostes from the band \u2013 abruptly shifts into a John Scofield-like blues-chordal cruncher from Monteiro that makes you jump out of your skin. On three delicately devious reveries, Blake\u2019s slow-burn imagination blossoms: the closing Weeds \u2013 moving from a snarling guitar break to a twilit film-noir sleepwalk that borders on Ellingtonesque \u2013 is a characteristically captivating snapshot of a unique artist\u2019s long-caressed sonic palette.

The wistful, softly insistent From the Mountains and Ole &amp; Gard are never far from orthodox song-shapes, maybe a little soft-centred for contemporary audiences, but executed with a quiet passion.

Pence\u2019s daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond, was announced as co-author. Pence Bond is also the author of a series of children\u2019s books about the family\u2019s pet rabbit, Marlon Bundo, which the HBO talkshow host John Oliver memorably satirised with a book in which Marlon turned out to be gay. Pence published a campaign-oriented memoir, So Help Me God, last year. In that project, in preparation for his presidential run and now on the campaign trail, he has sought to gradually distance himself from his former boss \u2013 not least because Donald Trump sent to the Capitol the mob which threatened Pence\u2019s life on January 6. On Thursday, Simon &amp; Schuster said: \u201cWhen Mike Pence was a young politician, reporters used to ask him: \u2018Where do you see yourself in five, 10 years?\u2019 Without fail, the former vice-president would reply: \u2018Home for dinner.\u2019\u201d Before becoming vice-president, Pence was a congressman and governor of Indiana.

While facing likely indictments over his election subversion and incitement of the Capitol riot, Trump has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal criminal charges over his retention of classified records and 34 state criminal charges over his hush money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who claimed a sexual affair.

Lovers and gods are cruel; life\u2019s beauty is dangerously close to being unbearable. Early on in The Late Americans, graduate student poet Seamus pictures his cohort as living in a dollhouse: \u201cIt was so easy to imagine the hands of some enormous and indifferent God prying the house open and squinting at them as they went about their lives \u2026 in an exhibit called The Late Americans.\u201d Are our lives spectacles? And how can we continue to live when pain is both ubiquitous and mundane? The answer comes in bodily connection, but physical encounters may result merely in the transfer of pain. Taylor emerged aged 30 with his Booker-shortlisted 2020 debut Real Life. This was a painful, often funny, always dazzling autobiographical novel, with the narrator closely inside the head and body of its lonely Black, gay graduate student protagonist. Taylor revealed himself as brilliant at intense, awkward social comedy, and revelatory, unerotic sex scenes. The skill was in the delineation of moment-by-moment bodily life, charting tiny shifts between tenderness and violence and the hourly exhaustion of being in a disordered body. Unusually, Taylor was prepared to tell as well as to show, using his characters to think hard about his world. These were the strengths and preoccupations, too, of his 2021 short story collection, Filthy Animals, featuring a series of complicatedly entangled characters. Again, there was the precise attention to bodily experience, the restrained but revelatory lyricism that could illuminate the darkest material: \u201cWhat he wants is not to maim himself but rather to pry open the world, bone it, remove the ugly hardness of it all, the way one might take the spine from a deer or a fish or some other animal snared.\u201d The Late Americans is a more ambitious, nimbly diffuse novel, moving between a large cast of characters, mainly gay graduate students of dance or creative writing. The campus setting enables the creation of basically similar people who define themselves by difference: who eats meat and who loathes the killing of animals; who applauds the death penalty and who loathes the killing of humans; who has money and who has to earn it by making low-key pornography. There is an accomplished reticence about race here: it\u2019s revealed stealthily, usually at moments when characters encounter racism. This connects to the novel\u2019s intrepidly questioning vision of identity politics. It opens with Seamus, the white working-class gay poet whose vision of the \u201cLate Americans\u201d provides the book\u2019s title, angry because his classmates reduce a poem to \u201cits increasing cultural salience re: women, re: trauma, re: bodies, re: life at the end of the world\u201d. He hates these poetry workshops because he believes that trauma has nothing to do with poetry; that a true poem takes in the world, but bears no sign of the personal material that forges it. It is a daring move to start the book with this provocation. I wonder if it\u2019s less daring to have it come from a white man. This is a novel that believes in the possibility of great art and of politics and that wants both to be about more than identity. So are Seamus\u2019s pronouncements the thoughts of the novel? It\u2019s never quite clear. The time span is larger here than in Taylor\u2019s previous books. As with his realist heroes \u2013 Tolstoy, Austen, DH Lawrence \u2013 weeks or even months pass in a single sentence. Likewise, we are entering new heads right up to the final chapter, and there\u2019s a lonely swimming instructor called Bea who gets just a single section, looking out of her window at some of the other characters. Together, these elements give the novel a sense of contingency: we could as easily be hearing about any other troubled graduate student, a few months earlier or a few months later. Taylor writes an admirably serious blog on Substack grappling with questions of what the novel is for, where he\u2019s set Rachel Cusk\u2019s notion that novelistic character is outdated against his commitment to the realist novel. He believes that \u201ca character with a body is a social creature\u201d and that the \u201cdenuded and tranquilised autofiction narrators of the 2010s\u201d lack full bodily life. I could feel him grappling with these questions in The Late Americans with volatile ambivalence. Scene by scene these characters have the bodily particularity, the specificity of the great realist novels. But through Taylor\u2019s proliferating characters, he seems to strive towards the kind of homogeneity we find in Cusk\u2019s Outline trilogy, and not just because graduate students are already homogeneous. The dollhouse image is a vision of graduate life but the fear is that it\u2019s also a vision of America, because there is no great world for these students to aspire to. Seamus thinks at one point that they all suffer from identical pain \u2013 \u201csmall, common things \u2013 hurt feelings, cruel parents, strange and wearisome troubles\u201d. This idea is challenged by the specificity with which violence and cruelty find their targets. There\u2019s a painful scene where a Black woman is shamed for her abortion and then assaulted by a white man. Pain may not be equal after all, but Seamus isn\u2019t undermined \u2013 this is all part of the book\u2019s tension. The Late Americans is baggier than Cusk\u2019s Outline and baggier than Taylor\u2019s own Real Life. It\u2019s a less entirely resolved read than either of them, but for me, this book assures and deepens Taylor\u2019s position as one of the most accomplished, important novelists of his generation. He is undoubtedly on to something expansively new in his sense of what the contemporary novel can do. \u2022 The Late Americans by Brandon Taylor is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).

Plibersek had been asked last year to reconsider the development in savanna woodlands at Lee Point after more than 100 endangered Gouldian finches were spotted in bushland marked for imminent clearing. On Friday Plibersek said she had determined the project would have a significant impact on the birds but it could still proceed with some changes to the original proposal. Those changes include a requirement for a 50m buffer around Gouldian finch habitat, which is concentrated around a waterhole. In a letter to Environmental Justice Australia (EJA), which was acting on behalf of the Environment Centre NT (ECNT), Plibersek said she had received advice the buffer would \u201callow the finches to roost and forage in a natural environment that should allow them to flourish within the area\u201d. \u201cIt will also significantly improve the beauty of the area for the new residents and other members of the community,\u201d the letter says. Defence Housing Australia will also be required to identify environmental offsets before any clearing takes place near the waterhole. But the ECNT said it was outraged by the decision to allow the development to proceed given the acknowledged risk to the birds and Australia\u2019s \u201cterrible record on extinctions\u201d. \u201cMinister Plibersek came to office with a mandate to end the extinction crisis, so this decision is heartbreaking to Lee Point and bird lovers alike,\u201d the savanna and freshwater campaigner Jess Black said. \u201cThe minister needs to step up and stop the destruction of Gouldian finch habitat at Lee Point. \u201cLand clearing is rampant across the territory and we\u2019re seeing the collapse of tropical savanna ecosystems before our eyes.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ellen Maybery, a senior specialist lawyer at EJA, said the decision was \u201cillogical\u201d when Australia had a zero new extinctions target. \u201cOur client is devastated by the minister\u2019s response to the obvious risks this development poses to Gouldian finch habitat,\u201d she said. Plibersek said the proposal in its original form would have resulted in an unacceptable impact on the species. But she said the varied approval had led to a redesign that would \u201cavoid the most adverse impacts on matters of national environmental significance and result in a nature-positive outcome\u201d. \u201cWe need to invest in more housing for communities, but we also have a responsibility to reduce our impact and protect our threatened species and the places they call home,\u201d she said. Plibersek said the buffer zone would protect the most important habitat and retain a wildlife corridor that would benefit residents. She said changes would be made to clear invasive gamba grass and replace it with native grass species that the Gouldian finch can feed on. She said access points to Casuarina beach had also been changed to avoid disturbing migratory birds that used the beach to roost and breed."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a67e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/16/isle-of-wight-fossilised-remains-identified-as-new-dinosaur-species", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Isle of Wight fossilised remains identified as new dinosaur species", "lead": "Creature has been named Vectipelta barretti after Prof Paul Barrett of London\u2019s Natural History Museum", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 07:48:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112502", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/02466628ab90b16af00f3525d084c16b9e06726e/0_443_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Fossilised remains from the Isle of Wight have been identified as a new dinosaur species that has been named after a palaeontologist at the London\u2019s Natural History Museum. It belongs to a group of plant-eating dinosaurs known as ankylosaurs that was found in the 1980s on the island\u2019s Wessex formation \u2013 a geological feature dating to between 145m and 66m years ago. After analysis revealed it was a new species it was named Vectipelta barretti \u2013 after Prof Paul Barrett, the head of fossil vertebrates at the Natural History Museum (NHM). It is the second armoured dinosaur to be found on the island, the first one being Polacanthus foxii, which was unearthed in 1865. V barretti differs from its predecessor P foxii in its neck and back bones. Analysis also shows both species have different pelvic structures and V barretti has a more blade-like, spiked armour. Barrett said: \u201cI\u2019m flattered and absolutely delighted to have been recognised in this way, not least as the first paper I ever wrote was also on an armoured dinosaur in the NHM collections. I\u2019m sure that any physical resemblance is purely accidental.\u201d The findings are described in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. The co-author, Dr Susannah Maidment, a senior researcher at the NHM, said: \u201cPaul has been a really important and significant mentor, supervisor, colleague and friend to myself and several of the other authors on the paper, and we wanted to thank him and recognise his huge contributions to dinosaur palaeontology.\u201d Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Maidment said when the remains were discovered in the 1980s they were thought to be from the same species as the 19th-century find on the island. But, she added, \u201cwe\u2019ve now discovered it\u2019s rather different from the Polacanthus and it\u2019s a new species. It\u2019s got differences in its vertebrae, its pelvis and some of its armour is different as well. So we are quite confident it\u2019s a completely different animal.\u201d Although both ankylosaurs originated from the same island, the researchers found they were not closely related. In fact, they said, V barretti is most closely related to some Chinese ankylosaurs, suggesting these dinosaurs moved freely from Asia to Europe in the Early Cretaceous period, up to 145m years ago). Stuart Pond, a researcher at the NHM department of Earth sciences, said: \u201cThis is an important specimen because it sheds light on ankylosaur diversity within the Wessex formation and early cretaceous England.\u201d The researchers said rocks from the Wessex formation and the Isle of Wight were \u201chugely important\u201d to understanding more about how dinosaurs became extinct."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a67f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/16/i-felt-violated-it-was-a-dark-period-for-all-of-us-sigur-ros-on-their-nightmarish-recent-years", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I felt violated.

Given the dramatic events in the band members\u2019 lives during its long gestation, you suspect it serves a similar purpose for the Icelanders themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a comfort blanket for us maybe,\u201d agrees frontman J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r \u201cJ\u00f3nsi\u201d Birgisson from his home in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. The period the album emerged from was, he says, \u201cdepressing and heavy and intense\u201d. In March 2018, the Icelandic government accused Sigur R\u00f3s of evading 151m kr\u00f3na (\u00a3840,000) of tax between 2010 and 2014. The band blamed an accounting error and repaid the debt plus interest, but faced a second prosecution for the same offence in 2020, which froze their assets. They have all now been acquitted but Birgisson has been off the hook only since March. And that was not all. In September 2018, artist Meagan Boyd publicly accused drummer Orri P\u00e1ll D\u00fdrason of sexual assault five years earlier. D\u00fdrason denied the allegations but resigned a few days later, temporarily reducing Sigur R\u00f3s to a transatlantic duo of Birgisson and bassist Georg \u201cGoggi\u201d H\u00f3lm. Did it still feel like a band at all? \u201cIt was strange,\u201d says H\u00f3lm, sitting in the band\u2019s Reykjavik headquarters with returning keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson (who had left the band in 2013). Now in their late 40s, they look like mismatched detectives reuniting on a cold case in a Nordic noir show. \u201cThere were definitely points when me and J\u00f3nsi would go, well, I guess we\u2019re a band but we\u2019re not really doing anything.\u201d Amid all of this, Birgisson split from Alex Somers, his partner of 16 years and frequent artistic collaborator. A band whose music inspired breathless celestial metaphors seemed to fall to earth with an ugly thud. \u201cOur main purpose is the music but obviously there is this thing called life that happens around it and you have to deal with it,\u201d says H\u00f3lm. When Sigur R\u00f3s formed in 1994 as teenagers, Birgisson says, they made music because \u201cit gives you a purpose to live and be happy\u201d. As a non-anglophone post-rock band from a \u201ctiny little island in the middle of nowhere\u201d, they didn\u2019t exactly dream of Madison Square Garden, but their second album, 1999\u2019s \u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun, was a word-of-mouth phenomenon whose cheerleaders included Radiohead, Coldplay, David Bowie and Cameron Crowe. In a genre with a forbiddingly studious reputation, Sigur R\u00f3s had an elemental grace and a direct line to one\u2019s tear ducts. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get goosebumps, then we have to work a bit more,\u201d says Sveinsson. \u201cOf course, you have to be careful not to go full Disney on it. You\u2019re playing with emotions, but you don\u2019t want to force-feed it. It\u2019s not like foie gras.\u201d What happened next is a familiar story: young band makes music for pleasure, then reluctantly becomes a travelling business. While their music remained uncompromising, the external pressures and strains mounted. According to Sveinsson, their darker 2002 album ( ) \u2013 no titles, no lyrics \u2013 \u201creally represents the state we were in at that time: this is so fucking heavy! Just keeping track of who you are is kind of tough.\u201d \u201cYou can easily lose yourself,\u201d H\u00f3lm agrees. \u201cYou move around the world in this bubble called Sigur R\u00f3s. It is a bit of \u2013 excuse my French \u2013 a mindfuck, being in a band that young.\u201d By the end of the 2000s, he says, \u201cwe all crashed a little bit. We just didn\u2019t admit it to ourselves.\u201d Sveinsson had always been the most sceptical about \u201cgoing into the industry and taking part in all that noise\u201d and by 2012 the noise was too loud. \u201cIt was just too much. I was burned out and had to leave.\u201d Did it feel like a temporary break? \u201cNo, it felt very final, actually.\u201d His bandmates pressed on with the unusually crunchy and imposing Kveikur (2013). \u201cMaybe it was some sort of retaliation,\u201d says H\u00f3lm. \u201cThat album is quite aggressive and angry.\u201d \u201cI call it the inferior album,\u201d Sveinsson deadpans. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s great.\u201d The band appeared to be thriving, headlining arenas and appearing in The Simpsons and Game of Thrones, but sessions for a new album fizzled out in 2017, around the time Birgisson stealth-moved to LA for a change of scene. \u201cVery sunny and bright compared to dark and depressing,\u201d he says. Zoom-phobic and just out of bed, he angles his phone so that all I can see most of the time is a shrub festooned with Christmas lights. I feel like David Attenborough, scanning the undergrowth for a glimpse of the lesser spotted J\u00f3nsi. Ironically, it was pesky admin that held Sigur R\u00f3s together when the music stopped. Sveinsson still needed to be consulted on reissue packages and approve sync requests. The working title for 2005\u2019s explosively joyful single Hopp\u00edpolla was The Hit Song and that joke came to pass. It has supplied emotional uplift to everything from the BBC\u2019s Planet Earth and the Children of Men trailer to the film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. What did the band make of the movie\u2019s take on Iceland? \u201cTo some extent, it\u2019s quite accurate,\u201d Sveinsson says, \u201cbut to other extents, it\u2019s total bullshit.\u201d \u201cThe cliches are funny because there\u2019s a hint of truth to every cliche,\u201d H\u00f3lm says. The band\u2019s relationship with Iceland is complicated. As the country\u2019s most famous export after Bj\u00f6rk, they were constantly asked about glaciers and elf magic. \u201cObviously us doing photoshoots all wearing the same hat, looking like elves, that didn\u2019t help,\u201d H\u00f3lm admits. \u201cIt did become slightly annoying, but there is this element of truth to it. The other day I was walking my dogs in the countryside and listening to the new record in my headphones and I thought, wow, this really does sound like what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d The tax case put them at odds with their own country for the first time, to the extent that H\u00f3lm considered emigrating. How close did he come? \u201cI really did feel like I can\u2019t live in this sort of society,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt violated, basically. It was a dark period of time for all of us. It was scarring, you know. But then you realise that things just happen and it doesn\u2019t really matter where you are. I have come to the conclusion that I love living in Iceland.\u201d They blow hot and cold on the reasons for the second prosecution. One minute H\u00f3lm suggests equably that \u201cit\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault really\u201d, the next he wonders if the government was trying to make its most famous band \u201cthe poster boys of something\u201d. Sveinsson suspects that Sigur R\u00f3s were \u201can easy target\u201d compared to lawyered-up bankers and hedge-fund managers. Birgisson still sounds furious about \u201cthis fucking bullshit \u2026 The unfairness of it all, and the aggression. There\u2019s so much energy and time that goes into it that could be spent on beautiful things. You get angry thinking about it.\u201d Distance has enabled him to romanticise his homeland in lyrics that he describes as \u201ca postcard to Iceland\u201d. He\u2019s thinking of leaving LA. \u201cAmerica is so crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cTrans and queer and gay rights have been trampled on so much recently. It\u2019s scary to see. Around the world also, it feels like we\u2019re going backwards.\u201d \u00c1tta\u2019s artwork, by the veteran Icelandic artist R\u00far\u00ed, depicts a rainbow flag in flames. \u201cWe try to stay out of politics, just to make the music as neutral as possible, but we were talking about the state of the world we live in now: climate change and doomscrolling. You see all the psychopaths spending crazy amounts of money going to space when they could be saving our planet we are actually living on at the moment. It\u2019s so unbelievably ridiculous!\u201d \u00c1tta (Icelandic for eight) began life in 2018 when Sveinsson visited Birgisson as a friend and they started tentatively making new music together. \u201cIt felt like nothing had happened,\u201d Sveinsson says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re back! There you are!\u2019\u201d The band felt wiser, and more comfortable with their personality differences. \u201cWe\u2019ve all matured,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we are together it\u2019s the music. We don\u2019t have to be best buds.\u201d H\u00f3lm pulls a mock-offended face, then laughs. Sigur R\u00f3s don\u2019t talk much in the studio. The loss of a drummer and the return of the string arranger set the lush, contemplative tone. \u201cWe wanted it to be spacey and beautiful \u2013 a little bit pure somehow,\u201d Birgisson says. \u201cYou\u2019re getting older and more cynical and it\u2019s harder to move you \u2013 you just want to feel something.\u201d He likes silence, or a soundtrack so soft that it is neighbour to silence: vintage jazz and field recordings of nature. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little bit of a music hater,\u201d he confesses. \u201cThere\u2019s not very much I like.\u201d When the new album\u2019s slow advance was frozen by the pandemic, this self-defined \u201cbig loner\u201d rather enjoyed lockdown, he says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been living [out of] a suitcase for 20 years, being in the same place for two years was unheard of. So this, for me, was a beautiful rest.\u201d He exhibited paintings and sculptures, released a clubby solo album (2020\u2019s Shiver) and continued his study of perfumery. \u201cWith aroma molecules you have individual notes and tones, so you can focus your scent composition,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like music: how the elements harmonise, how much space there should be. I love this idea of triggering senses in different ways.\u201d Could he see himself letting Sigur R\u00f3s go altogether? He thinks not. \u201cYou have more outlets but you always love the band. It\u2019s been part of your DNA for so long, so you don\u2019t want to kick it to the kerb. I love Sigur R\u00f3s and I love what we have created.\u201d By growing up, the band have somehow looped back to their adolescent origins, when making music was a choice rather than an obligation. \u201cFor me, when we\u2019ve done this tour, that\u2019s it; see you in a few years,\u201d Sveinsson says, cheerfully. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I can\u2019t foresee anything after this, but who knows?\u201d Life, they have discovered, sometimes has other plans. \u2022 \u00c1tta is released on BMG/Krunk today.

When the former rugby union international Ugo Monye was asked what he felt on seeing it, he couldn\u2019t speak for tears \u2013 it took a few attempts, and a hug from a fellow panel member, before he could fashion a response. Here was a fitting reminder of how emotive the subject of women\u2019s sport can be. The provoking of a tear or two has always been the sign of a truly memorable moment in sport\u2019s ultra-masculine history but for women, excluded so long from its halls of fame, even the smallest win resonates with emotion. The first cinematic history of women\u2019s sport, Game On eschews individual moments of glory (although it does contain some inspiring montages of England\u2019s Red Roses, and their buildup campaign to the 2022 rugby union World Cup). Director Sue Anstiss knows her subject intimately \u2013 she has an MBE for her work promoting sport among women and girls \u2013 and it\u2019s her clear-eyed perspective on the long-haul, third-class journey towards gender equality that puts a catch in your throat. Given how recently women\u2019s sport was being dismissed \u2013 even among the most progressive of media outlets \u2013 as dull, substandard and irrelevant, the trajectory that Anstiss\u2019s film charts is a feelgood one. Amid the great millennial dumpster fire of doping, match-fixing and sportswashing, the advancement of women is arguably the industry\u2019s most meaningful contemporary success. And while the elite end of men\u2019s sport has proudly taken up the mantle of self-interest and moral ambivalence, its female counterpart continues \u2013 for now at least \u2013 to embody a higher purpose. For Anstiss, sport is not an end in itself but a means to improve women\u2019s lives: in the opening minutes of the documentary she calls it a \u201ctool for driving social change\u201d. Later in the film, Tanni Grey-Thompson observes that it also shines a magnifying glass on the equality that is still lacking between genders. No wonder, then, that women\u2019s sport comes across as more true to its roots, more altruistic \u2013 dare we say, more attractive? \u2013 than the ugly swamp of politics and venture capital in which men\u2019s football, men\u2019s golf and even men\u2019s cricket are currently wallowing. After all, the people who have been running and backing it \u2013 through decades of public disinterest, institutional rebuffs and a crippling lack of funding \u2013 have done so for the good of others, and with no expectation of reward. This isn\u2019t to say that male athletes, pundits and administrators don\u2019t make stands for social justice, particularly in recent years (although it\u2019s worth remembering that it was a woman, Noreena Hertz, who first recognised the potential of newly wealthy Premier League footballers to effect change, in her campaign for nurses\u2019 pay). But as Anstiss and others have noted, many men who are passionate about sport only begin to notice and acknowledge the discrimination and double standards embedded in it when it affects those close to them, usually their daughters. One audience member at the screening described just such a Damascene moment when his little girl had her after-school football session cancelled, because \u201cthere were only enough coaches to take the boys\u201d. Game On argues that sport can facilitate discussions that otherwise struggle to be voiced. From the narrow definition of femininity and the objectification of female bodies, to the social dictates that govern the kinds of beauty and activity that are \u201cappropriate\u201d for women \u2013 sport is an arena where we can confront, and ultimately defeat, our hangover of cultural chauvinism. The structural injustice and sheer absurdity of requiring women to wear dresses, or bikini bottoms, or white kit to compete is, after all, still a live issue \u2013 this is the first year that Wimbledon will allow female tennis players to wear black undershorts. But there\u2019s another discussion we need to have. Because while change is happening, other changes loom unseen. The long-overdue removal of grassroots barriers, and the hyper-accelerated professionalisation of women\u2019s elite sport, require ever more resource. The sector\u2019s rapid rise is already being fuelled \u2013 and will be increasingly steered \u2013 by the commercial interests of sponsors and administrators hungry to \u201coptimise\u201d a whole new market. The talking heads in Anstiss\u2019s film \u2013 from Grey-Thompson and Denise Lewis to Stacey Copeland and Clare Balding \u2013 all agree that women\u2019s sport is special. Its painful climb from the lower plains of niche-sporting-subculture means its greatest role models are still \u201cjust people\u201d, accessible to and invested in those who come out to support them. The family-friendly nature of matches, seats full of women and children who exhibit none of the learned behaviour of the football stadium, offers a refreshing contrast to the aggressively tribal atmosphere of so much men\u2019s sport. The metrics that measure the success of women\u2019s sport have also been different to those that prevail elsewhere. Participation and inclusion are the priorities, not shareholder profits. In March, the hosts of the 2023 football Women\u2019s World Cup, Australia and New Zealand, won a significant victory when they forced Fifa to backtrack on its planned Saudi Arabian sponsorship deal for the tournament, arguing that it made a mockery of their gender equality mission. Women\u2019s sport is entering uncharted waters, whose depths will be richly stocked with dazzling prizes and murky compromises. The question that needs to be asked now \u2013 as loudly and often as possible \u2013 is what it can do to resist the pressures that threaten its values and virtues, and fashion a sustainable future. Will (and should) its executives ignore the well-worn path to the door of the betting industry? Can England\u2019s Lionesses remain the approachable face of elite football, or will they \u2013 like today\u2019s highest-paid women\u2019s tennis players \u2013 disappear behind a wall of sponsored appearances and curated Insta feeds? The guest list at the Game On premiere boasted Olympians, netballers, rugby and hockey players, and female administrators, all of whom have spent their careers fighting for a fairer, better sports industry. If the future of women\u2019s sport needs extraordinary and principled leadership, the good news is that there are plenty of women with the qualifications and experience to offer it. \u2022 Game On: The Unstoppable Rise of Women\u2019s Sport is released on Netflix on 26 June"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a681", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/16/its-the-sids-2023-the-complete-la-liga-season-review", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "It\u2019s the Sids 2023!

It was also seriously tempting. For only \u20ac300, you too could play in European football\u2019s biggest stadium. Sixty minutes, a ref, coaches and Gatorade; medical attention as well, which was probably a good thing. Some \u20ac1bn in debt and with a salary limit of minus \u20ac144m, Barcelona had to raise money somehow if they were to start the virtuous cycle their president talked about. Or just the season with the men they had signed. Trouble was, even hundreds of people playing hundreds of games weren\u2019t going to cover Gerard Piqu\u00e9 sitting on the bench for just one. Which is where the palancas came in. The word of last summer, suddenly it was everywhere, part of the footballing lexicon, maybe even its folklore. Selling players wasn\u2019t easy, although they really did try, and so Barcelona sold other assets instead. TV rights, mostly. In total, they pulled four palancas, or levers, putting \u20ac777m on the balance sheet and seven new players on the pitch. At 9.30pm on the evening before La Liga started, Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha, Andreas Christensen and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 were finally registered along with Franck Kessi\u00e9. Jules Kound\u00e9 had to wait a while. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and Marcos Alonso followed. The next day, Barcelona drew 0-0 with Rayo Vallecano, which was at least an improvement: last season they hadn\u2019t got a point against Andoni Iraola\u2019s team; this season they got one and, as it turned out, that was enough. Because if they started it by pulling levers, leaving everything very late, they finished it early by lifting the league trophy, bidding farewell to the old place as champions four years on. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought the happiness back,\u201d Joan Laporta said. \u201cWe\u2019re not so bad,\u201d Xavi declared. Although you sometimes wondered whether they were so good either, Barcelona did effectively win the league in March and mathematically won it just beyond the city limits with four matches to spare. Nobody could catch them, not even the Espanyol fans who chased them off the pitch that night \u2013 although they got closer than anybody else. It might not have been very \u201cXavian\u201d \u2013 11 of their wins were 1-0, prompting Diego Simeone into a glorious sly dig when he said: \u201cThese days I hear a lot of strategists who like the beautiful game say that 1-0s are beautiful too\u201d \u2013 but Xavi had his first league as a coach, and had deserved it too. His team also won the Super Cup, picking Real Madrid apart. Unlikely though it seemed when they lost the first cl\u00e1sico to the sound of the Madrid fans launching into oles and chanting for Xavi to stay, Barcelona won 13 and drew one of their next 14 and were five points clear by halfway. And although Thibaut Courtois claimed \u201csometimes it\u2019s nice to be the chaser\u201d, within a month Barcelona were 11 points clear, only momentarily offering their pursuers any hope at all, and came out of the second cl\u00e1sico 12 points ahead and with the job done. They won the league having conceded just two at home: one was a penalty, the other an own goal, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen only denied a clean sheet record by teammates no longer bothered about defending once they were champions, going from 10 conceded in 33.75 games to nine in 4.25. The stats brokered little argument although, incapable of winning three in a row post-World Cup, there was something weirdly flat about Madrid, whose 4-0 win over Barcelona in the Copa del Rey semi-final made it even harder to work out quite how they had let themselves fall so far behind. As for Atl\u00e9tico, in a season of two halves they really only played one of them. The pre-World Cup period was summed up when Yannick Carrasco missed a 99th-minute penalty taken after the full-time whistle, Sa\u00fal put the rebound off the bar and Reinildo\u2019s follow-up to that somehow went over, knocking them out of the Champions League, before a 99th-minute goal saw them lose 3-2 to C\u00e1diz three days later. It was only October but it was already over, although in the spring Simeone\u2019s side started to play, chasing a runners-up spot and a fifth season in eight finishing above their city rivals, only to lose it in the 93rd-minute of the final day, which was a very atl\u00e9tico way to end it. By then, it was hard to remember the beginning, it seemed such a long way away, cut off by the World Cup. Buried by all the other stuff, too. Not least the Negreira case and the fallout from it, which you knew had got really bad when Madrid and Barcelona refused to have lunch together and the old Franco question came up again, diversion delivered and everyone a historian all of a sudden. Then, depressingly, there was the racist abuse of Vin\u00edcius, who literally took a stand that at last obliged others to follow. So much had happened, some of it really very good, some of it really very bad, and it had all stopped in the middle for Spain\u2019s national team to be both of those things at once and for Lionel Messi to complete football, a season of records finally wrapped up by Joaqu\u00edn, who retired on 622 first division appearances \u2013 the joint-highest ever. There was Pepe Reina playing his 1,000th game. Burgos goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Antonio Caro taking until a VAR-awarded penalty in the 78th minute of his 14th game to concede his first of the season. And Elche not beating anyone at all until February, 20 weeks in, to finally liberate defender Carlos Clerc to get some closure: he had gone 39 matches without a win until then. Even better was what it meant for Randy Nteka, who became the first player in La Liga history to beat the same team two games running: victorious against Villarreal on Monday with Rayo Vallecano, he left, signed for Elche and defeated them again five days later. After a 37-game sequence that ran 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, Binary Code\u2019s Real Oviedo at last scored more than a solitary goal and then went wild getting 2, 2, 3 and 2 in their next four. Referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz broke a yellow-card record in Qatar then came back to Spain and immediately did it all over again, showing 19 cards and raising as many reds in one afternoon as all the World Cup officials managed in a month, Frenkie de Jong calling it chaos having somehow escaped both matches without a booking. And even more amazingly, that same month I\u00f1aki Williams did not play a game of football for the first time in six years. Spain was just getting started up again, the bit before Qatar soon feeling like it belonged to a different age, a different season, like it didn\u2019t really count. Which, actually, is pretty much how it had felt at the time too, everyone just waiting for the World Cup. At their title celebrations, when at last it was all over, Barcelona\u2019s departing captain Sergio Busquets offered a reminder of everyone who had contributed to the champions, including retiree Piqu\u00e9, partly because he had to. Wait, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang played? This season? Was it really only this season when Unai Emery walked? That Julen Lopetegui went? And that Rino Gattuso was here, puffing his chest out and announcing he was a lion not a pussycat, making a lot of noise and a bit of fun before slinking silently away. As for the many managers at Elche, there\u2019s a prize if you can name them all. By the end of the season Elche had more of them than wins, the first team relegated and weeks before the rest. Espanyol, whose season began with their goalkeepers seemingly competing to see who could drop the biggest clanger, were next despite having the Spaniard who scored most goals \u2013 and who, at 32, got two in two minutes on his international debut. Valladolid were the third on a final day when six teams could still go down. \u201cLife hits you hard sometimes,\u201d Papa Pezzolano said after they were finally sunk by fellow strugglers Getafe. \u201cWe had a choice between good or shit and we chose shit,\u201d Getafe coach Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores had grumbled and he was soon replaced by Pepe Bordal\u00e1s, who had them Bordalasing their way to safety with just 68 passes on the final day. With three minutes and eight seconds of the season remaining, Almer\u00eda were in the relegation zone but an Adri Embarba penalty gave them a 3-3 draw and survival. Celta coach Carlos Carvalhal insisted \u201cLa Liga is much harder than the Premier League\u201d, and then set about proving it by winning just one in 11, leaving captain Iago Aspas warning: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to squeeze one bollock next to the other.\u201d But they too survived on the final day, with a win over Barcelona. C\u00e1diz, the only team down there to stick with their coach, the endearingly everyman Sergio Gonz\u00e1lez, also escaped. They had always expected to be down there; by contrast, crisis-hit Valencia, whose coach had asked them to sign \u201cfailures and losers\u201d, didn\u2019t expect to be confronted by the very real prospect of a first relegation in almost 40 years, but in the end the kids saved them, Javi Guerra, Alberto Mar\u00ed and Diego L\u00f3pez coming from the B team to keep them up on the final day. For so long Sevilla had been down there too, becoming the story of the season. After a dreadful start, they sacked Lopetegui and by the winter, half of their summer signings had gone again, but things only got worse under Jorge Sampaoli, who spent as much time suspended in glass boxes as he did bounding about the touchline in his tight blue tracksuit and beanie, handing out instructions no one could understand. Deep in trouble, they genuinely feared a return to the second division 20 years on. But then along came Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar, the \u201canti-modern\u201d manager who can\u2019t be bothered with the bullshit, and pulled them clear. Better still, he took them to Budapest, where they won the Sevilla Cup \u2013 \u201cnot bad for a bloke who won this job in a raffle,\u201d he said. Jes\u00fas Navas lifted the trophy \u2013 17 years after his first. That kept up the run. No Spanish club has lost to a team from any other country in 18 European finals, and eight teams will be back to try to take that to 19 next year. The eight doesn\u2019t include Girona, who were great fun to watch \u2013 four 2-2s, three 3-2s, a 4-2 a 6-2 and a 5-3 \u2013 but missed out on history when Osasuna beat them on the final day, and it doesn\u2019t include Rayo either, who were almost as much fun. The chant at Vallecas runs \u201cnext year, Rayo-Liverpool!\u201d and, with their team flying, at one point it seemed the flaw in this plan lay on Merseyside, not Madrid. But although they reached the final day with half a chance, in the end The Final Countdown getting belted out after every goal remained their only encounter with Europe. It does include Atl\u00e9tico. Superb post-World Cup and post-Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix too, they qualified for the Champions League for an 11th season in a row, alongside Barcelona, Madrid and Real Sociedad who are back for the first time in a decade. All 19 of the players who took them there came through the academy, coach Imanol Alguacil describing what they have done as \u201cabsolute madness\u201d. At 37, David Silva is going back with them. Below them, Villarreal qualified for the Europa League under Quique Seti\u00e9n, who left the kids\u2019 team he was coaching in Cantabria to return to the top flight and finish fifth. Even Betis\u2019s absurd red-card record \u2013 they committed the second fewest fouls but had 15 players sent off, the highest total in Europe \u2013 didn\u2019t stop them taking sixth. Which was a fitting close for everyone\u2019s favourite cheeky scamp who finally, tearfully said goodbye at 41 and departed with them in Europe again. And the Conference League spot went to Osasuna, 16 years since their last trip to the continent. Osasuna also reached a Copa del Rey final for only the second time in their history. They had somehow found their way through extra time four rounds in a row and eventually got there thanks to the first goal Pablo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez ever scored for the club he always supported \u2013 a 116th-minute belter at San Mames. Although they lost the final, Carlo Ancelotti completing his collection by winning every trophy there is in just fifteen months, the navarros weren\u2019t to be denied. \u201cWhen we played the final everyone wanted Madrid to win so that the team in seventh would also go to Europe,\u201d coach Jagoba Arrasate said, \u201cbut it turned out that the team in seventh was us.\u201d Now, he said, it was time for a beer. They had earned it. And they weren\u2019t the only ones. Best award Apart from these ones, naturally. Embarba got the golden spade, having dug Almer\u00eda out of trouble on the final day. But nothing beats Villarreal getting a real-life, 11-metre-tall, three-metre-long, 127 million-year-old spinosaur from the early Cretaceous period named in their honour. Most humble club Second Division Burgos. \u201cWe got here eating Mortadella sandwiches and we\u2019ll keep eating Mortadella sandwiches,\u201d coach Julian Calero insisted. \u201cCaviar is too expensive for this club \u2013 and, anyway, Mortadella is tasty.\u201d Best negotiator Ra\u00fal de Tom\u00e1s\u2019s agent, reported to police by the Rayo Vallecano president Ra\u00fal Mart\u00edn Presa \u2013 seen sporting an ostentatious plaster on his nose \u2013 for allegedly butting him in the face during negotiations. Four days later, the deal was done. Best appointment Jorge Almir\u00f3n had not won in 16 games when Elche sacked him in 2021. So, they decided to bring him back 18 months later. Five games and no wins later, he was gone again. Most valued member of staff Fuenlabrada\u2019s odd-job man, performing the miracle of the fish and loaves, only better. Saturday night in Primera RFEF and a ball flies off the pitch and up on to the roof alongside. Fortunately, there\u2019s a bloke with a ladder and a head for heights who doesn\u2019t just get the ball back; he gets three of them. Riskiest promise Ancelotti told Fede Valverde that he would tear up his coaching badge if the Uruguayan didn\u2019t get to 10 goals this season, but that was a pretty safe bet \u2013 completed by February \u2013 so it has to the Catalan radio reporter who said he would get a tattoo if Taty Castellanos scored three against Real Madrid. The good news is he didn\u2019t; the bad news is he got four. Worst excuse (and most disappointing refusal to heed advice from the Jackson Five) Xavi, who blamed defeat at Getafe on the sunshine. \u201cTry Nivea,\u201d Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores replied. Then there\u2019s the new Spain manager trying to explain voting Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez for The Best, and coming up with: \u201cI wasn\u2019t drunk.\u201d Best fan Javi Rico. Stupidest fan Twenty-two players to chose from and you decide to attack the 6ft 3in, 13-stone goalkeeper with the iron fists? Best broadcaster \u201cStreamers of the world, step aside! I\u2019m coming down hill with no brakes!\u201d It\u2019s Luis Enrique. Best photo Just glorious. Best bedtime story Little Red Riding Hood, read by Javier Tebas. Best promo F is for: fire, faith, fair play, fantasy, fouls, flow, fans, family, finals, force, future, fiesta, footballers and \u2026 \u201cfuck off\u201d. Best sponsor Sheffield Wednesday. Coolest player Lucas Ocampos didn\u2019t look when the first penalty was taken in the shootout at the Europa League final. Which wouldn\u2019t have been that unusual, except that he was the one taking it. Funniest player You must be Joaqu\u00edn. Actually, no, not this time; this time it\u2019s Zuhaitz Gurrutxaga. Ugliest player Mallorca striker Vedat Muriqi, a big ugly lump, 1m 90cm tall, a weird beast who makes you cross the road when you see him. That\u2019s according to his coach Javier Aguirre, anyway. Ugliest manager \u201cAguirre\u2019s right, I am ugly. I think my wife has got a problem with her eyesight,\u201d Muriqi said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not exactly handsome, either.\u201d Nicest player Borja Iglesias, who missed his first ever penalty in primera, saved by Elche\u2019s Edgar Badia, and afterwards said: \u201cI\u2019m glad it was him: he\u2019s a bloody good guy.\u201d Most perfect player Toni Lato. Gattuso thinks so anyway: \u201cMy daughter is very young, she\u2019s only 18, but I think Toni is the ideal man for her,\u201d the Valencia manager said. \u201cAny girl would like to have a boyfriend like Toni.\u201d Sadly for him, and maybe for her, one girl already did. Speaking of which \u2026 Most frightening father-in-law Luis Enrique again, who publicly announced that his daughter was going out with Ferran Torres but warned that if the Barcelona forward was ever stupid enough to celebrate a goal by sticking his thumb in his mouth, he would take him off, stick him in the stands and never pick him for Spain again. Most unlikely comparison Getafe coach Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, who likened Djene Dakonam to \u2026 his aunt. Which would have been quite odd anyway but his aunt is the late flamenco singer Lola Flores. Apparently, she couldn\u2019t sing or dance either, but you didn\u2019t want to miss her. Just like the Getafe centre-back. Most caring coach Valladolid coach Pacheta, with the kind of humanity there\u2019s no room for in football, telling defender Javi S\u00e1nchez not to come into work that weekend and instead to attend the birth of his son. \u201cHe was doubting what to do,\u201d Pacheta said. \u201cI said: go. You have to be there. This only happens to you once, maybe twice; there\u2019s nothing like seeing your child born. There\u2019s no discussion: go. It\u2019s just a game of football, someone else plays. In the end, we won, he\u2019s with his wife and child, everyone\u2019s happy. It\u2019s life.\u201d Biggest hero Unai Simon, Ivo Gribic and Alex Remiro all struck a blow against evil, smacking goal kicks straight into the spider cam. The sight of C\u00e1diz keeper Conan Ledesma sprinting across the pitch, defibrillator in hand, still gets you every time, and Chris Ramos became the first person born in the city to score for them in 30 years too. , and Chris Ramos became the first person born in the city to score for them in thirty years too. And then there\u2019s Lucas Perez who left them, giving up a place at a first division club where he was top scorer, to join Deportivo de La Coruna the team supported as a boy from the city where he was born. In the third division. On eight times less than he was earning before. And paying half of the transfer fee himself. Best trolling Minute 62 \u2026 heeeeere\u2019s Antoine! Best game Pretty much any Girona played. Betis 3-4 Celta, which had seriously good goals, particularly Gabri Veiga\u2019s first (two headers taking the ball over the defender before nudging it beyond the keeper with his right foot, a touch of the Le Tissiers about it), an Abner Vin\u00edcius miss so bad it\u2019s good, a red card (of course), some horrific acting from Aspas, and a potential equaliser headed just wide on 101min 35sec. Then there was Getafe and Valladolid. Not normally Spain\u2019s great entertainers, they served up the best show the Coliseum\u2019s seen since AD325, a superb 3-2 win for the visitors, with \u00d3scar Plano and Dami\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez scoring the pick of the goals. Best touch Simeone. Or was it Manuel Pellegrini? Best shot Pick that one out \u2026 of, er, your living room. Worst miss Step forward Gerard Moreno. No, not like that. Best assist \u201cIt was my only way out,\u201d Rodrygo Goes said. Some way out, this. Best goal \u201cIt would have been genius if they had scored, but \u2026\u201d Rayo coach Andoni Iraola said, the \u201cbut\u201d hanging heavy. \u00d3scar Trejo and Isi Palaz\u00f3n tried the Cruyff penalty only for Isi to run in and put it over the bar, so that\u2019s no good. These, though, were. \u201cI saw red shirts and I started to run,\u201d said Valverde. Before he knew it he had gone 67 metres, hit 30kph, passed three players and smashed the ball into the top corner against Mallorca. \u201cIt\u2019s a mad golazo, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Samu Chukwueze said, cracking up, after he scored an equally cartoonish goal to beat Madrid 3-2. His first had been pretty tasty too. If you haven\u2019t yet seen Martin Braithwaite\u2019s debut, match-winning goal for Espanyol against Athletic, it had a hint of Compostela and his hero Ronaldo about it. Imagine you have never scored in 116 games in Spain and then you go and do this. And then this, in the derby no less. Oh, and then this, racking up three goals from a combined 100 yards. Nemanja Gudelj, ladies and gentlemen. Mind you, Youseff En Nesyri\u2019s goal in that last game might even be better. If you like goals from the halfway line, there\u2019s Joselu at Getafe and Jos\u00e9 Luis Morales at Osasuna. Walking in, Memphis. And how about this for a way to win a Cup tie, from Abde? But the best, by miles, was in Ibiza. Ivan Morante, we salute you. Or it would be if it wasn\u2019t for Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s \u00c1ngel Correa, the footballer so magical, so capable of the impossible, that he managed to get a goal while he was sitting on the bench \u2013 thanks to a referee who initially ruled it out for offside and took so long to rule it back in again that by the time he had, Correa had gone. It\u2019s not unusual for a goalscorer to run to the bench to celebrate with his teammates; this time it was his teammates running to the bench to celebrate with the goalscorer, everyone falling about giggling. Best celebration That was good. So was Rodrygo doing an i for Ignacio in the Copa del Rey final. There was nothing quite as funny as \u00c1lvaro Morata falling down, complaining about a foul and lying faced the other way, unaware that his deflected shot was looping towards the line anyway, then jumping up and celebrating when he heard the roar greeting a goal he didn\u2019t know was his, teammates trying to convince the sceptical striker that yes, it had come off him last. I\u00f1aki Williams\u2019 reaction to scoring against Espanyol was lovely, running past the bench to embrace his kid brother Nico, who had missed two sitters in the cup semi final three days earlier and had been left out to give him \u201ca bit of breathing room\u201d. \u201cIt was emotional; I\u00f1aki knows better than anybody what a bad time I\u2019ve had: that hug helped me believe in myself,\u201d Nico said afterwards, having then come on and scored the second himself. And then there was the moment Real Sociedad captain Mikel Oyarzabal, recently returned from a knee ligament injury, scored his first goal in 315 days from the penalty spot to win the Basque derby, running towards the stands, breaking into tears in front of fans and then heading off in search of the doctors, physios and staff who guided him back, hugging them: Jon, Jon, Unai, Virigina, Imanol, Javi, Edu and the rest. \u201cThere are so many people who look after us every day and it\u2019s important that people see that,\u201d he said. And so to surely the moment of the lot, the one that said it all With five minutes to go and Sevilla trailing, relegation grabbing at their heels again, coach Jorge Sampaoli sent Gudelj on with detailed instructions \u2013 the second time he had done it this season \u2013 full-back Marcos Acu\u00f1a decided he\u2019d had enough of this. Not so much a note as an Ordnance Survey map, a set of Ikea instructions, Gudelj and \u00d3liver Torres were standing there looking at it, a pair of Homer Simpsons wondering what the hell le grille was, when Acu\u00f1a thundered over, tore it from their hands, screwed it up and threw it to the floor, telling them to stop messing about and shaking his head in disgust, at once an act of defiance and a plea for help, the confusion and crisis symbolised by that piece of paper, as if Sampaoli himself had been binned. Which very soon he was, Mendilibar becoming the managerial expression of the rebellion Acu\u00f1a began. Manager of the year Xavi won a league which, for all the levers, never looked likely. M\u00edchel almost made history at Girona, while always being as decent as his team was fun, which is very \u2013 something which can be said about Iraola too. Mid-table definitely isn\u2019t mediocrity for Mallorca, where Aguirre has done a remarkable job. Manuel Pellegrini still has things to do, he says, and does them so well. And what Jagoba Arrasate has done at Osasuna is just extraordinary. It really should be him or Imanol Alguacil at Real Sociedad. Only, how can it be when Mendilibar did that? Player of the year For a while it could have been Valverde. Lewandowski briefly, too. Vin\u00edcius was electric, the most exciting footballer about. And this was Ter Stegen\u2019s league. But in the end, while he didn\u2019t win anything, the best was Griezmann. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember the last game before the World Cup, running around in the 90th minute like he was an 18-year-old kid who had only just made his debut, even though the World Cup was four days away: not everyone has that, but he does,\u201d Simeone said. Griezmann had been good then; by the time he came back he was barely believable. Scorer of 16 goals, provider of 15 assists and so much more, not given a fixed position but the responsibility to go where the game demanded \u2013 which, it often seemed, was absolutely everywhere. He ended up being Atletico\u2019s everything, Rodrigo de Paul calling him their Messi. \u201cWhen he\u2019s at his best, he can be whatever he wants,\u201d Simeone said.

Good luck to all Guardian entrants. The Tech Mahindra Global Chess League (GCL), the first franchise-based chess event, will be played in Dubai from next Wednesday to 2 July. Six teams of six will each include an icon, two elite GMs, two women GMs and an under-21 junior. Magnus Carlsen is taking part, in what is an early opportunity for the world No 1 to recover from his failure at Stavanger, where he drew eight classical games and lost one. It was the first time since Dortmund 2007 that the Norwegian had been winless in a classical round robin, and his worst rating loss since Stavanger 2015. His previous ambition of achieving a record 2900 rating now looks just a dream. Carlsen has already bounced back in this week\u2019s preliminaries for the online Aimchess Rapid, where he overcame an early loss to qualify for the top division of eight. His opponents in Dubai will include the new world champion, Ding Liren, the defeated 2021 challenger, Ian Nepomniachtchi, and the former champion Vishy Anand. The Norwegian\u2019s team, SG Alpine Warriors (the SG stands for Sanjay Gupta, CEO of its sponsoring firm), includes three top Indian talents Dommaraju Gukesh, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Arjun Erigaisi. They are among the favourites, although other teams appear stronger on the women\u2019s boards. Carlsen is also announced as the top seed for the 206-player knockout World Cup, the only major competition he has never won, which will be staged in Baku, Azerbaijan, starting 30 July. The total prize fund, including for the parallel 103-player Women\u2019s World Cup, is a record \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.1m), including awards for first-round losers, but there is a snag. Competitors have to pay for their own travel and accommodation. John Nunn, the multi-talented chess author, grandmaster, publisher, problem solver and mathematician, added another chapter to his career when he won the European over-65 championship at Acqui Terme, Italy, scoring 7/9 and having the best tiebreak. In 2022 Nunn captured the world over-65 crown, while in winning both the over-50 and over-65 world team titles as well as the European over-50, England confirmed its status as No 1 in senior chess. That is 40 years after the vintage 1980s, when England were three times Olympiad silver medallists, behind only the golden Soviets led by Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. Acqui Terme also showed England\u2019s current depth in senior chess. In the over-50s, Keith Arkell shared first but was placed fourth on tie-break, while Stephen Dishman was in the gold medal position with a round to go. The unlucky player was Terry Chapman in the over-65s. In his teenage years Chapman was England\u2019s No 3 in his age group behind Jonathan Speelman and Jonathan Mestel, who became strong grandmasters, and would surely have become an IM had he continued play instead of opting, like several of his contemporaries, for a successful career in IT. Returning to chess after an early retirement, he took on Kasparov in a match where the then world No 1 gave odds of two pawns and the move, and held the legend to 1.5-2.5. Since then, Chapman has competed on the senior circuit, winning two European over-50 silver medals and IM norms. At Acqui Terme he got within a fraction of his goal as he finished in a four-way tie for first on 7/9, drawing with the gold and silver medallists Nunn and Lubomir Ftacnik but placed fourth on tie-break.

It feels like we\u2019re back at school Aleesha and I have been friends since we were 11. I would say that out of the two of us, she is more of a wind-up merchant. She likes to be antagonistic and contrary for the sake of it, and thinks it\u2019s hilarious if we go to a party in the same dress or jacket, whereas I find it cringe and weird. I just don\u2019t get the whole idea of dressing like your mates. It was a lot worse when we were younger. I\u2019d choose a top or something I liked when we were out shopping, and Aleesha would say, \u201cThat\u2019s so nice\u201d, and buy the same one. When we were 16, we fell out over something like that. It doesn\u2019t happen as much any more, but on big occasions, like a party, festival or friend\u2019s wedding, she\u2019ll come up to me and say, \u201cLove your dress. Gonna have to buy the same one now!\u201d She knows how much it winds me up. Case in point: Glastonbury last year, when she pulled out the same zebra-print jacket as me. I don\u2019t know why she does it. It\u2019s just embarrassing walking around in the same outfit. I like to be different, I like to feel my choices and fashion sense are my own. After I bought it, I\u2019d told her about it on a call, then she went and got the same outfit behind my back without telling me. Is that not strange? I don\u2019t like feeling as if we are back at school. Antonia, a friend of ours, then started adding fuel to the fire by saying, \u201cOh, now what are you two going to do? People will get you confused.\u201d They were winding me up and it took about 15 minutes for me to see that I probably was reacting unreasonably. But I\u2019d spent weeks planning my outfits and the thought of Aleesha piggy-backing off my well-laid plans just irked me. I\u2019m trying to be a bit less dramatic about things like this because the logical part of my brain realises that there is no point trying to control what your friends wear. But then the other part of me thinks: I chose this look first and I don\u2019t want to share my style with anyone. Aleesha should just get her own fashion sense, that would help us avoid this scenario for ever. The defence: Aleesha Our dress sense has become more similar. It\u2019s no wonder we buy some of the same items Ella is amazing. She\u2019s kind, generous and hilarious \u2013 the life and soul of any party. But whenever I buy an item of clothing that resembles hers, she reverts to the same childlike behaviour from our school days. Our friend Antonia thinks it\u2019s hilarious. I find it mildly amusing, but also think she\u2019s in the wrong. Before Glastonbury last year, I\u2019d been talking to Ella about outfits and she had shown me this cool zebra-print jacket on Zoom. I went and bought the same jacket on Depop. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until I pulled the jacket out at Glasto and said, \u201cLook what I\u2019ve got, we can be matching!\u201d Ella flipped and said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not cool. I don\u2019t want to look the same as you. Why did you buy it?\u201d I was shocked. I pointed out it was a festival and that the zebra-print jacket was mass produced: anyone can buy one. Our dress sense has become more similar as we\u2019ve grown up. Ella used to be preppy and wear classic stuff like plain designer shirts and oversized bags; now she\u2019s more eclectic. I\u2019d like to think she takes a bit of inspiration from me, as I\u2019ve always been drawn to colours and prints. Ella used to rip me for it; now she\u2019s come around, so it\u2019s no wonder we buy the same items. Ella and I don\u2019t live in the same city any more, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to be running into each other wearing matching outfits every day. Once we happened to be in similar flared trousers. Antonia pointed it out, saying, \u201cUh-oh, you\u2019re matching again.\u201d It was funny to see a flicker of panic across Ella\u2019s face. Ella\u2019s always been a bit like this. At school she wouldn\u2019t tell me the name of her perfume because she didn\u2019t want me to wear it. I thought that was funny. Maybe she likes to feel unique. We\u2019re in our 30s now, so I\u2019m not sure why it still bothers her. I still love her dearly \u2013 I just put it down to a quirk she has. It would just be good to think that, if we accidentally end up in a similar outfit in future, she would be able to keep her cool. It\u2019s not that big a deal. If anything, it just speaks to our incredible mutual fashion sense. The jury of Guardian readers Should Aleesha stop copying Ella\u2019s fashion choices? There\u2019s no need to copy someone\u2019s clothes exactly. Of course, most people who are friends will have broadly the same taste \u2013 that\u2019s the way fashion works \u2013 but that\u2019s no excuse for stepping out like a pair of overgrown twins. Be a shepherd, not a sheep. David, 43 Long-standing friendships should be cherished. Despite saying Ella is \u201camazing\u201d, Aleesha seems to take a childish glee in making her friend feel uncomfortable. Similar tastes may lead to choosing the same cut of trousers, but buying an identical jacket and knowing it will upset a friend? It\u2019s not a good look. Frances, 52 Ella\u2019s need to feel special apparently trumps decades of friendship, while Aleesha\u2019s alleged mimicry seems benign. One hopes that the two of them no longer living in the same city will end this tempest in a teapot. Donna, 77 I think Aleesha should be more considerate of Ella\u2019s feelings. I can see why Ella was upset when her friend bought the same jacket. She is rightly protective and proud of her individual style, and Aleesha should respect this. Helen, 53 Aleesha is being condescending and dismissive of Ella\u2019s perspective, which is a poor way to treat a friend. She knew exactly what she was doing when she bought that zebra-print jacket! Ella is reacting strongly to a small issue, but she\u2019s probably over her friends deliberately winding her up.

In his mission to restore a sense of wonder to life\u2019s small and ordinary things, Mark Cocker \u2013 author of the award-winning Crow Country \u2013 takes us on a soaring journey from the Cretaceous period to a summer\u2019s day in his English garden, via angiosperms, bacteria, flying ant day, Ted Hughes and the magnetic field caused by our planet\u2019s iron core \u2013 \u201cthe Earth\u2019s innermost soul\u201d \u2013 to demonstrate the essential interconnectedness of everything. Like the birds he tracks as they skirl and scream above his home, the book covers a great distance, and not always in a straight line. It is not easy to express awe in writing without flipping into hyperbole or cliche, but in his promise to express \u201chow it takes a whole universe to make just the one small black bird\u201d, Cocker aims high. In an explanatory note, he says: \u201cThis is not strictly a book of science but the hybrid form that is conventionally associated with the term \u2018nature writing\u2019.\u201d It is certainly scientifically rigorous \u2013 packed with copious footnotes, end notes and references to a glossary \u2013 and the bare facts it lays out are extraordinary. Swifts have been recorded at altitudes of 4,400m, and travel so far in a single trip that a nesting pair feeding their chicks in southern England could be scooping up insects above Germany. They weigh just 40g but have a wingspan of 42-49cm; a human would need arms 800 metres long to match the weight to width ratio. But it is also lyrical, grand and full of reverence. \u201cYou could say that the sounds of the birds, burning over our house amid their contrails of scream, are a part of the song of the Earth turning in outer space,\u201d Cocker writes. What is even more amazing than what we learn about swifts is how little we know about them, still. Until 1943, when hunters in a Peruvian rainforest flushed out 13 ringed birds from a hollow tree, observers north and south of the equator had no idea where swifts went for half of the year, and we\u2019re still not much the wiser. The birds\u2019 scientific name, Apus apus, comes from a Greek root word meaning \u201cfootless\u201d because of an ancient belief that they never landed; in the 17th century, British swift watchers thought they flew to the moon in winter. Now, thanks to a recent Swedish study, we know that in the non-breeding season, many birds spend 99% of their time flying, eating and sleeping on the wing, and some never land at all. This regular heartbeat of migratory arrival and departure gives swifts, along with swallows and martins, a special resonance. For those of us in the northern hemisphere, they represent the coming of the sun. Their mysterious \u201csocial screaming\u201d on long, light evenings fills the air with summer\u2019s soundtrack, and their departure marks a sort of ending, year after year. Swift sounds \u201care infused with post-coital melancholy\u201d, Cocker writes, as he contemplates a display at the end of the day. \u201cLike my birds this evening, summer is leaving.\u201d Changes to this ancient ritual are unnerving to humans \u2013 as they should be. After millions of years of evolution, swifts\u2019 arrival and departure in the UK has become noticeably earlier recently. Hughes\u2019s 1976 poem Swifts begins, \u201cFifteenth of May\u201d; in 2012, Cocker saw his first swift on 16 April. They are also arriving on these shores in smaller numbers. Common swifts are now red-listed and at risk of local extinction in Britain, owing to modern house-building techniques that deprive them of nesting sites, and indiscriminate use of pesticides. As insects pollinate at least $235bn-worth of crops annually around the world, this immediate and significant effect on their most dazzling aerial predators ought to ring alarm bells. \u201cWe need to reimagine our entire relationship with insects,\u201d says Cocker. Some environmentalists make their case with facts and numbers; others with rhetoric. Cocker paints a picture with shades of gratitude and wonder. \u201cImagine it: no swifts,\u201d he suggests. After spending one summer\u2019s day with him in his garden, most readers will find that a galvanising thought. \u2022 One Midsummer\u2019s Day: Swifts and the Story of Life on Earth is published by Jonathan Cape.

The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs released summary statistics on marriage and social welfare for the fourth quarter of 2022 last Friday, after months of unexplained delays, which had prompted speculation that the country was not able to track the relevant data. Missing from the quarterly report was the number of cremations held across the country \u2013 a figure the ministry has made public since 2007. On a provincial level, more than a dozen regions, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, did not include the figure in their recent reports, while some have yet to release any data at all, South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. The country of 1.4 billion people recorded over 4 million cremations during the third quarter of 2022. A quarterly or year-on-year comparison could be used to gauge the number of deaths associated with Covid as China abruptly ended its zero-Covid policy last winter. The sudden pivot from its so-called zero-Covid approach resulted in a massive surge that overwhelmed hospitals and funeral homes in December last year. Satellite images showed long queues outside funeral homes, while some crematoriums worked around the clock to keep up with the influx of bodies. While the Chinese government stopped announcing the daily tally of Covid cases and deaths during the surge, the scenes offered a hint to the severity of the outbreak and how China mishandled its Covid reopening. Officially, China put the total death toll from mid December to early February at 83,150. But the country has been accused of masking the true impact of the pandemic and underreporting fatalities by narrowing the definition of Covid deaths. Doctors have also reported being pressured over how they attribute deaths due to Covid, counting only those that died from pneumonia and respiratory failure, but not other underlying conditions. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong estimated in December that nearly a million people in China could die from Covid as the country rapidly abandoned pandemic restrictions. Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in December that the country would calculate and release data on excess mortality \u2013 the number of total deaths during an observed period in comparison to the historical baseline, but the information has not so far been made public yet."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a688", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/16/student-loan-debt-in-england-surpasses-200bn-for-first-time", "primaryCategory": "education", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Student loan debt in England surpasses \u00a3200bn for first time", "lead": "Graduates now owe an average amount of \u00a345,000, Student Loans Company figures have revealed", "author": "Richard Adams Education editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 06:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112702", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d8e683d94971fa0632b52b7f16a9dace76d80b95/0_66_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "Outstanding student loans in England have surpassed \u00a3200bn for the first time \u2013 20 years earlier than previous government forecasts, as the number of students at universities continues to outstrip expectations. The Student Loans Company (SLC), which administers tuition and maintenance loans in England, said that the balance of government-backed loans reached \u00a3205bn in the current academic year, including \u00a319bn worth of new loans to undergraduates. The figure has doubled in just six years. It reached more than \u00a3100bn in 2016-17 after the coalition government decided to increase undergraduate tuition fees from \u00a33,600 a year to \u00a39,000 in 2012. The SLC also revealed that the average amount owed by graduating students had risen again, and now sits at just under \u00a345,000. Loan repayments by graduates also rose to more than \u00a34bn in 2022-23, which the SLC said was \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d than the previous years, in part because higher inflation \u201cmay have positively affected borrower salaries\u201d. Loans to students in England remain far higher than those in other countries in the UK. Students in Scotland \u2013 where tuition is free for residents \u2013 have \u00a315,400 in outstanding loans on average, while students from Wales owe \u00a335,500 and those from Northern Ireland owe \u00a324,500 after graduation, according to the SLC. Government forecasts in 2013 were for outstanding student loans to reach \u00a3200bn by 2042, but England\u2019s undergraduate population has swelled more rapidly than expected while postgraduate students have also been able to take out loans. More recent government forecasts cited by the House of Commons library are for the total to reach \u00a3460bn by the mid-2040s. Student finances are expected to be a battleground in next year\u2019s general election, with the government having recently revised the loans system so that lower and middle-earning graduates will have to repay a greater share. From 2024-25, undergraduates will have to start repaying their loans when they earn \u00a325,000, rather than the current threshold of \u00a327,295, and will have to continue repaying for a maximum of 40 years rather than 30, when outstanding loans are written off. Interest rates will be lowered for new borrowers, which benefits high-earning graduates able to pay off their loans earlier. The changes are expected to double the number of graduates who pay off their loans in full. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that they will more than treble the expected repayments for the lowest-earning 30% of graduates. Labour has pledged to reverse the changes if elected, accusing the government of \u201chammering the next generation of nurses, teachers and social workers\u201d. While the \u00a3205bn would equate to about 8% of the UK\u2019s public sector net debt of more than \u00a32.5 trillion, how students loans are accounted for in the national accounts is complex. The portion of loans forecast to be repaid are treated as a loan, while the part expected to be written off is recorded as government spending at the time the loans are made."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a689", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/16/i-live-in-fear-of-debt-collectors-disabled-people-in-england-tell-of-toll-of-soaring-care-costs", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I live in fear of debt collectors\u2019: disabled people tell of toll of soaring UK care costs ", "lead": "Readers explain how they are being forced to give up essential social care or forgo meals and sanitary products", "author": "Frances Ryan and Rachel Obordo", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 06:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112721", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7b30b28ba36b2d0f37480149cf7d56f3156bd2f2/1244_1497_2170_1302/500.jpg", "body": "Disabled people in England are finding themselves in severe financial hardship owing to rising social care costs and the increase in the cost of living. Social care, unlike the NHS, is not free at the point of need. As disabled people are being forced to pay for their care out of their benefits, some are finding themselves thousands of pounds in arrears to councils. Others are having to give up essential care because they cannot afford the fees, or skip meals or hygiene products to pay for care. Some of the readers affected spoke to the Guardian. \u2018I\u2019ve now got to find an extra \u00a3118.67 per week\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve been receiving social care for personal care, help around the home, and shopping since medically retiring from the civil service over a decade ago. \u201cMy local council wrote to me in December 2022 stating that they had reviewed their care policy and that my care charges were to increase from \u00a327.33 per week to \u00a3146. They offered me and others affected by the change in their policy transitional protection for 12 months. So from December this year, I have now got to find an extra \u00a3118.67 per week. I\u2019ll be forced to be total financially dependent on my husband, who only works part-time so he can give me the additional care I need. \u201cI provided 13 receipts to my local council for my financial assessment, with a written explanation as to why it was necessary for me to buy or spend that money. On appeal, my council refused them all. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that in the 21st century, disabled people are being treated in this manner. It\u2019s archaic.\u201d Debra, 60, who has a congenital joint condition \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do as I can\u2019t pay\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve never had to pay for my social care but in 2022 I received a letter from my local council asking me to pay around \u00a32,000 for the year. I don\u2019t have an income aside from my benefits, so to pay it I ended up selling things including silver trinkets from my christening. It was so stressful I couldn\u2019t sleep at night. \u201cA long battle with cancer when I was a child had repercussions on my body, and recent major spinal surgery means I use a wheelchair. I have 29 hours of care a week and the help I get is my ticket to a life \u2013 full stop. \u201cEven with care, I use a food bank and eat one meal a day. A shower is now a treat. \u201cI\u2019ve not been sent a charge for this year yet and I\u2019m terrified of how much it will be. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, as I can\u2019t pay.\u201d Louise*, 37, has complex physical needs and mobility issues, from north Northamptonshire \u2018I live in fear that debt collectors will knock on my door\u2019 \u201cIn 2019 my local council asked me to pay \u00a376 a week towards my social care from my benefits, but I was unable to pay. Six months ago they said it\u2019s now \u00a390 a week. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to push back on the understanding that I will complete a continuing healthcare application to apply for NHS funding and, depending on the result, either pay for the care or submit a new financial assessment and contribute what I can. I suspect I now owe around \u00a330,000-40,000. \u201cI worked full-time for most of my life but had to stop 11 years ago when my health deteriorated \u2013 I use a ventilator to help me breathe when I sleep. I never asked to become seriously unwell and now I feel like a leech on the system. \u201cI receive six hours of care a day from an amazing company who help with medication, hygiene and cleaning. I would be lost without them. I get \u00a31,200 a month for employment and support allowance and personal independence payment, including a severe disability premium. It\u2019s still not enough with the cost of living and I\u2019m paying for bills using credit cards. \u201cI feel under enormous pressure and I live in fear every day that debt collectors will knock on my door.\u201d Mac, 35, former manager who has multiple heart, endocrine and immune conditions, from Essex \u2018I can\u2019t even afford sanitary supplies\u2019 \u201cI haven\u2019t had any social care since 2006 because it costs too much. I get around \u00a3450 a month in benefits, and Asda\u2019s Just Essentials chicken soup has been my saving grace as I can eat it with frozen veg and bread. It used to be 23p a can but it\u2019s now 45p, which has crushed me. \u201cHow can people work if they don\u2019t even have food in their stomachs? That\u2019s the level of poverty people like me are facing. I used to work, but my hands are so bad I can\u2019t write at all. I have hypermobility and my joints constantly pop out and don\u2019t always go back in. I need support getting to the shower, cleaning and doing things in a timely manner. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t do those things, but it\u2019s not easy. It would be nice to be able to afford support and care. \u201cI\u2019m going through menopause which is not great. It\u2019s also expensive and I can\u2019t even afford sanitary supplies.

We found one of France\u2019s largest artificial lakes while on a donkey-trekking holiday (but that\u2019s another story!). The lake has five lovely sandy beaches with safe swim areas, beach cafes and kayak hire. There are walks and cycle paths, but the real gem is the lake\u2019s island, with its lighthouse, a sculpture park and a chateau that is now a restaurant. Access is via a footbridge, free water taxis or by canoe. We stayed in a fabulous yurt on a donkey farm three miles away (about \u20ac400 for a week). Je ne regrette rien \u2026 Angela Luke A lush and fruity oasis, Sicily When you climb down the path to the lush Kolymbetra gardens, your skin breathes in relief after the arid heat of Agrigento\u2019s Valley of the Temples. We\u2019d seen entry to the gardens was free with a National Trust card, but we were the first visitors to present one. The receptionist was delighted, and made us very welcome. The gardens are an oasis of citrus plants, from lemons the size of grapefruit to bergamots, tangerines of every kind, kumquats and ugli fruit. The paths are steep and uneven but glorious. Lynne Collis The crystal-clear waters of a Swedish island Asper\u00f6, one of the islands in the archipelago off the coast of Gothenburg, was our base for an incredibly quiet and peaceful stay. We rented a small cabin close to the water \u2013 the views were stunning and the water crystal clear, albeit shockingly cold. There are no cars, and locals get around on their own two feet or using funny little motorised trailers. The island is reached via a regular local ferry, and a tram line connects the coast to the city centre. Helen Falling in love with Palma de Mallorca In 2011, I began a series of trips to Palma de Mallorca and fell in love with the city. From the Paseo Maritimo to the Arab quarter, there are so many places to stay, eat and wander \u2013 all with a different neighbourhood feel. The golden stone of the cathedral glowing in the sunset is wonderful seen through the masts of luxury yachts. There are tourists, but this is a working city with buses full of locals. Venture beyond the residential districts for a beach day in Ses Illetes or drink in the fabulous views from Castell de Bellver. Janet Dean Beavers and wild boar in the Czech Republic The charming village of Rusava, in the south-eastern Czech Republic, is a perfect spot for nature lovers. Stay at Hotel Rusava (from \u00a362 a night), which overlooks a valley in the Host\u00fdn-Vset\u00edn mountains. The area is great for hiking through pine and beech forests and alpine meadows. Farther afield is the Pood\u0159i wetland area, just west of Ostrava, which is teeming with bird life. To the south is Soutok nature reserve, the largest in the country. It\u2019s the best reserve I\u2019ve ever visited and I saw eagles, beaver and wild boar. For some culture, Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e is only 30 minutes away and is famous for its beautiful Unesco world heritage site castle and gardens. Rob Dalziel Blissed-out in Romania\u2019s Bear Lake Floating in the saltwater of Romania\u2019s heliothermal Bear Lake is the most blissful and extraordinary experience. It\u2019s deep (18 metres in places) and, unusually for a salt lake, fringed with trees. Once you hop in the water to float, it\u2019s perfectly peaceful \u2026 and extraordinarily warm. The top layer consists of sweet water flowing from nearby streams, and the deeper you go, the warmer the water: at one metre it reaches 35C. Some visitors come seeking cures for infertility or rheumatism; or, you can just bob about like a cork, regardless of however many papanasi cheese doughnuts you consumed in the nearby cafes the night before. Caroline Eye-popping Kastellorizo, Greece Take the ferry from Rhodes (or from Kas in Turkey) to Kastellorizo (also known as Megisti or Meis), among the most eastern of the Greek islands. There are gorgeous, well-priced rooms at Hotel Megisti, plus plenty of other apartments or hotels to choose from. Swim from the little beach on the far side of the basilica or catch a water taxi to tiny St George\u2019s island for a day of swimming and snorkelling. When the day trippers have left, head to one of the many harbourside tavernas, which serve up super-sparkly fish, fresh salads and slow-cooked lamb. Keep an eye out for inquisitive loggerhead turtles that reside in the bay, which will probably pop their heads out of the water to see what\u2019s on your plate. Jayne Relaxing in thermal spa waters, Hungary Lake Balaton is under two hours by train from Budapest. It provides a tranquil escape from the capital where thermal spa waters and endless seafood eateries line the lake. It\u2019s where Hungarians go to escape busy city life, and where my grandparents spent their summer holidays while my mother and aunt were growing up. I travelled there in 2019 with a friend and stayed with a local family on their farm. Cycling every day, delving into the family\u2019s organic produce and enjoying the relaxing water felt like a lockdown in the most wonderful way possible, before the real daunting one the following year. Zara Honey brandy and history in Sarajevo History, culture and natural beauty join hands in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s charismatic capital, Sarajevo: that\u2019s what keeps me coming back. Cradled by dramatic mountains, we spent one day hiking out to visit Lukomir village, where a traditional lifestyle can still be seen. Back in the city that evening, we dropped into the Zlatna Ribica bar (the \u201cgolden fish\u201d) to sharpen appetites with ludicrously cheap glasses of medova\u010da, a delicious honey brandy. Later, we walked via the Latin Bridge to see the spot where Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in the incident that sparked the first world war. Then we had dinner in the cheerful A\u0161\u010dinica ASD\u017d cafeteria, with its generous portions of traditional Bosnian dishes. Theo Winning tip: a treasure hunt in a Massif gorge, France The highlight of our trip last autumn to France\u2019s Massif Central was the spectacular little town of Sainte-Enimie, nestled in a crook of the Gorges du Tarn. We dropped down into the amazing gorge \u2013 dramatically revealed after the approach across the high plateau to the north \u2013 via the hermitage hewn into the rock above the town. The walk around town felt like a treasure hunt of hidden alleyways and evidence of the community\u2019s history since the seventh century \u2013 a wonderful surprise on what was a last-minute detour! The rest of the gorge is stunning and merits a holiday on its own. We plan to return for a full week of active adventure.

Juri Salvini, the head of the family, started working with his uncle at the age of 12 in a pasture called Alpe Terzera, where he still brings his cows today. This ancient practice is now part of the history of the Salvini family, composed of Juri, Katya, Alessandra and Elena, who continue to carry on this tradition every summer. Above: travelling towards the first of the six stopovers on the steep track leading to the alpine pastures towards which the Salvini family head each year. Right: Juri pours water for his cattle. Far right: the Salvini cows during the ascent to the Cima mountain hut, their final destination each summer from their home in Mezzoldo The whole family moves to the high mountain pastures with the animals, where they live in huts and spend their days suspended in time, far from the frenetic life of the close-by valley, where industry has long replaced the work of the shepherds (bergamino in local dialect). Here in the Orobie Alps the animals feed in the open air and every morning the ritual of milking in the pasture is carried out. The milk is transformed into dairy products which, when the time comes, will be brought down to the valley on horseback. The Salvini family milk their cows between the Nuova mountain hut and the Dossello mountain hut Katya is the family cheese maker. She is in charge of producing high-quality products, which differ from the intensive farming and industrial products that supermarkets are full of. Born and raised in Valnegra, she says sheep farming and breeding were not part of her upbringing \u2013 she learned the profession out of love, becoming passionate about a lifestyle that had already been lost in the country where she was born. Top: Katya is the family\u2019s dedicated cheesemaker. Above left: due to the presence of alpine grasses, milk produced during the summer transhumance is of a higher quality and has a higher nutritional value than that produced in the valleys. Above right: wooden bowls used by the family are placed in a pot over the fire after age-old rituals of life in a mountain hut In the Brembana valley, the relationship with nature and the value that the pastures give to the local biodiversity are two pillars that have resisted the changes, unlike elsewhere. The desire to return to a rural life, respecting the territory and feeding on genuine local products, resonates through the community. In addition to its practical value, transhumance has a profound cultural meaning. Juri near the Dossello mountain hut It represents the connection between man and nature; the interdependence between the local community and the mountains. It is a celebration of traditions, with festivities and rituals that accompany the passage of the cattle involving the entire community. The Salvini family rest after their meal near the Nuova mountain hut Today, the history of the Salvini family is an important example of sustainability, since transhumance offers an alternative model based on the intelligent management of resources. But the history of the Salvini family goes beyond producing excellent products. Up there, away from the noise, the family experiences all the magic of a lifestyle seasoned with sweat and effort. Above: Juri removes temporary fencing, used to control the cattle, at the Casera mountain hut. Right: cheese is loaded into a packsaddle. Far right: Juri prepares to return to the valley from the Cima mountain hut, the highest of the huts the family spend the summer months Juri, a hard worker with a taciturn and assertive character, carries out the most strenuous activities. Setting up the fences, cleaning the pastures, loading the mules and taking care of the milking is his daily bread. Katya, his partner, tidies up the shelters during breaks from work and follows the education of her daughters, including summer homework, proving to be a loving and present mother. Elena, the little one of the house, is the most followed and pampered, while Alessandra is a diligent older sister who is passionate about her parents\u2019 work. For her, cows are part of her family and she is not averse to petting them. Above: Elena with her family\u2019s cows at the Cima mountain hut. Right: Alessandra, the eldest daughter in the Salvini family, with a lamb near the Casera mountain hut, one of the family\u2019s first stops towards the alpine pastures. Far right: Katya takes a break Despite the hard work during the day, the family never fail to get together around a table. Up here, after having eaten a good meal and shared thoughts, one gives in to the sacred rest in the afternoon or at night. The days start early and end late. Mechanical means are reduced to the bone, and fatigue and sweat are the daily agenda. Comforts are few and people are tempered by the spirit of adaptation and silence, which delves inside making them pragmatic and wise. For people such as the Salvinis who are used to a life in close contact with nature, it is difficult to imagine a life in a big city, clocking in for work and thinking about what to do to have fun after work. Juri and Elena near the San Simone Pass Work has a component of adventure and satisfaction that is difficult to give up. But the warm season doesn\u2019t last for ever and the winters in these mountains are long and cold. Therefore, at the end of each summer the mules are loaded, the huts are closed and people return to the valley, in a \u201ccivilisation\u201d that chases profit, in which time is closely linked to money. The Salvini family during their descent from the alpine pastures, which takes place every September at the end of the summer season.

Nowak declined to be drawn into the row but said it underlined the need for workers \u2013 including those in the oil and gas industry \u2013 to have a seat at the table \u201cto shape concrete plans for the future\u201d. He said change \u201cmust be done with people rather than to them\u201d if the country was to avoid a rerun of the devastation caused by the deindustrialisation of the 1980s. \u201cGrowing up in Merseyside in the 1980s, I saw what happens when you don\u2019t manage industrial transition effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cRight across Britain\u2019s industrial heartlands we can see the scarring effect of long-term unemployment and cities and towns are still recovering. We are absolutely clear that we have to get to net zero in a way that supports and creates good quality jobs and gives people a sense of agency in how that transition can be delivered.\u201d Nowak, who took up the post of general secretary in January, grew up in Merseyside and worked as a call centre operator, a hotel night porter and a supermarket worker before becoming a dedicated trade unionist. He said an ideological aversion to state action meant the current Tory government \u2013 unlike its counterparts in the US and Europe \u2013 was failing to set out a coherent strategy to decarbonise, instead leaving the issue to fractured, market-led interventions. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you can leave these huge industrial transformations to the market and think everything is just going to work out \u2026 We are limping towards a green future rather than having a government with a real sense of purpose,\u201d he said. Pressure for action on the climate in the UK in recent years has come from direct action campaigns, protests and youth strikes \u2013 from Extinction Rebellion to Just Stop Oil. In recent months, some trade unions have made common cause with climate campaigners, with both groups arguing that the cost of living crisis and ecological breakdown have the same root cause \u2013 an economic system that exploits natural resources and people for the benefit of a wealthy few. Nowak said unions \u201ccan and do work together\u201d with climate campaigners, with both groups prioritising \u201ca positive long-term future for everyone\u201d over short-term private profits for a few. But he acknowledged there were differences of politics and outlook between the two, with \u201cunion activity focused on the workplace\u201d. \u201cOur credibility is rooted in those millions of union members whose work will be affected by the transition to net zero,\u201d he said. \u201cSo constructive dialogue between us is important where we have differing views from some climate campaigners, such as our view that there is an important future role for nuclear energy.\u201d Nowak is confident that the trade union movement has the capacity and expertise to ensure a just transition \u2013 if workers are given a seat at the table from the start. \u201cThis is as transformational as the railways or electricity \u2013 not just for energy intensive industries but for every sector from public to private \u2026 But in the 150 years of our history we have overseen huge change and transition and we have the ability to do the same again this time.\u201d The TUC has appointed two new project officers for worker-led transitions to net zero \u2013 one in the steel industry and the other in motor manufacturing. Nowak said the drive to net zero could not be at the expense of the UK\u2019s industrial base and said overseeing the decarbonisation of energy intensive industries such as steel, ceramics and chemicals was as important as ensuring good jobs in the newer industries such as solar and wind. \u201cIt is about making sure our members have good, secure jobs not just next year or in five years\u2019 time but in 15, 20 years\u2019 time \u2013 our members know that the jobs they will be doing and their kids will be doing will be shaped by what we do in the here and now.\u201d Nowak said anti-union laws and a culture among employers of keeping trade unions and workers at arms length were making it difficult to organise in the fast-growing wind and solar industries. But he said there were signs that Labour was developing a more coherent net zero strategy, linking a new deal for workers to trade policies and industrial strategy. Starmer is expected to make highly skilled green jobs a central plank of his clean energy pitch later this month, though Labour has been criticised for scaling back plans to borrow \u00a328bn a year to invest in the transition. Nowak said a successful transition could not be cooked up by politicians in Westminster or business leaders in boardrooms \u2013 or even trade union leaders in endless meetings. \u201cThis is not about me or the TUC or a few union leaders. What trade unions bring to the table is a network of tens of thousands of union reps up down the country that can be actively mobilised to help shape what this green future will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a resource that no government should ignore and no employer should ignore.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a68e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/16/as-well-as-fighting-russia-ukrainians-are-battling-corruption-at-home", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "As well as fighting Russia, Ukrainians are battling corruption at home", "lead": "As the UK is set to hold a conference on how to rebuild postwar Ukraine, many worry what will happen to funds sent through a system where money disappears", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 06:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112813", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4e30e4589ba36ba0d7d7b6033f899f602178ab17/0_28_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "If a fire is raging in a house, discussion of the colour of the replacement carpets is not normally the first priority, so to convene a Ukraine reconstruction conference in the midst of Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive may seem premature, and even tempting fate. The EU staged a large number of Syria reconstruction conferences premised on the defeat of Bashar al-Assad and look how that turned out. The UK\u2019s two-day conference starting on 21 June is at least the sixth since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The first was held on 4 July 2022 in Lugano, Switzerland. Germany, holding the rotating chair of the G7, held an event in Berlin on 24 October, Paris got in on the act on 13 December, Warsaw on 13 February and the EU Committee of the Regions held an event just last month, on 25 May. The proliferation of such symposiums raises questions about whether countries are competing or coordinating over a coherent plan to rebuild Ukraine, and, crucially, whether systems will be in place for when the billions in expected western aid is in Ukraine (ranked by Transparency International in 2021 as the second most corrupt country in Europe, behind only Russia) to stop members of the elite siphoning it off. The UK claims its event is warranted and different to predecessors since it is focused on how the private sector can take the helm. Estimates of the cost of reconstruction vary and obviously change with every apartment, dam and power station destroyed by Russia. The most cited damage estimate is the World Bank\u2019s assessment of $135bn of physical damage and $411bn in replacement costs. The British analysis is that hard-pressed public treasuries and even multilateral banks simply will not have such funds available once the guns fall silent. Forms of war insurance, never attempted before, will be required, and few know if the sums will add up. Hard thinking is needed in many areas. Would the call for local municipalities to drive the recovery come at the expense of the coherence that only the central infrastructure ministry can provide? How much should market forces set priorities, and would local voices be squeezed out? Is it realistic for Ukraine to skip to a net zero coal and steel sector? And how many refugees, especially those who will have lived in western Europe for two years, will ever return? Some regions face tougher challenges than others. Dr Vlad Mykhnenko, of St Peter\u2019s College, Oxford, told the UK foreign affairs select committee: \u201cAll the big cities on the Ukraine-Russia border such as Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk or Mariupol will have to find a new function in this modern, postwar Ukraine. That is a very difficult question that people are still shying away from.\u201d Olena Halushka, a board member of the Ukraine Anti-corruption Action Center, says the London agenda also needs to include future Nato membership for Ukraine, since without security there will be no investment. She argues that the west has to take complex steps towards confiscating Russian assets, too. She fears concerns over legality and precedent are making the west shy away from seizure, which she says sends a signal to Russia that it can get its money back later whatever damage it inflicts on Ukraine now. Above all, the private sector is not going to risk an investment if it fears the funding is going into not a proposed new bridge but an oligarch\u2019s back pocket. As a recent USAid report says: \u201cIf investors believe they must contend with unscrupulous rent-seeking officials \u2026 or rely on a flawed judiciary to protect their rights, they will be less likely to invest.\u201d So, alongside any reconstruction conference is a discussion, of varying degrees of frankness, about the conditions the west can set to help Ukraine kick the corruption habit. This is not of passing interest to a cadre of US officials who have spent considerable time trying to reform Ukraine, including Joe Biden. He told Brookings in 2015: \u201cThe corruption is so endemic and so deep and so consequential, it\u2019s really, really, really, really hard to get it out of the system.\u201d Of his efforts to expunge corruption when Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president, Biden claims he warned the then prime minister, Petro Poroshenko, in 2016 that if he had not sacked the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, before he got on his plane back to Washington, the US was not going to hand over a $1bn loan guarantee. He says Poroshenko rang him on his plane home to say Shokin was gone. Shokin has previously denied wrongdoing. Some, such as Henrik Larsen, an adviser to EU missions to Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, insists corruption is not an issue that can wait for the war\u2019s end. \u201cNow is the exact right moment to impose time-linked conditionality for aid,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom my experience, Ukrainians will not have direct confrontation against western donors. It would be stupid to go into open conflict, so what Ukrainian officials traditionally have done is to undermine reforms by delaying them, or saying it was an independent court that took a decision out of their hands.\u201d The lesson from the previous round of reforms was that the corrupt were not removed from the judicial system, he says. Josh Rudolph, of the German Marshall Fund, says donors, including the international financial institutions, have to be more assertive in setting conditions. \u201cYou cannot come out of this war and hand the political system back over to the oligarchs. But nor can you have a system dominated by the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, as some senior appointees in that office would be inclined to do. They have these inclinations to control the judicial system.\u201d The conditionality is currently coming from three sources: the seven accession conditions set by the EU last year, the international financial institutions and an informal group of progress-chasing G7 ambassadors based in Ukraine. The hope is that a fourth pressure point is evolving in the shape of a G7 multi-agency donor coordination platform set up in January. The G7 platform based in Brussels consists of 12 officials overseen by a triumvirate of Ukraine\u2019s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, the EU director for the European neighbourhood, Jan Koopman, and the US deputy national security adviser, Mike Pyle. \u201cFor a modern Marshall plan for Ukraine to work, you need a Marshall, someone whose focus is on this from when they get up in the morning, including selling into domestic audiences,\u201d Rudolph says. \u201cThere\u2019s a joke that the original Marshall plan was a Marshall plan to sell the Marshall plan.\u201d No such figure exists at present. Ukraine\u2019s vibrant civil society, just as much as the donors, regards fighting corruption as integral to the war effort. Egor Sobolev, a one-time head of the parliament\u2019s anti-corruption committee and now fighting on the frontline, once said when he was fighting in Bucha that during a lull in the shelling a fellow soldier in another trench yelled over to him: \u201cEgor, do you think when we repel the Russians we can also get rid of corruption in Ukraine?\u201d Haluskha, explains: \u201cThis war is, in part, about Ukraine\u2019s democratic transformation and the rule of law. Putin decided to launch the big invasion when he realised that Ukraine was close to an irreversible step away from Soviet-era corruption and governance.\u201d She says it was not a coincidence that Putin denounced all of Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption bodies by name in the rambling speech he made two days before the full-scale invasion. Mykhailo Zhernakov, the director of the Kyiv based Dejure Foundation, also shows little patience with the argument that anti-corruption reforms are best deferred until the war\u2019s aftermath. He points out that surveys show 60% of Ukrainians want the EU to do more to put pressure on the government to fight corruption. \u201cThis war is not just about land but about values. If we wanted to remain in a country that is corrupt, we might as well as not fight. Being part of the European family means rule of law. We have to fight on two fronts \u2013 the real military battle and the internal one.\u201d Ukrainian officials also know the war risks being a cover for bad people to reassert themselves. Oleksandr Novikov, the head of national anti-corruption agency, sounded a warning note at a recent OECD anti-bribery conference. \u201cHistory shows us conflict often leads to the emergence of new oligarchs who exploit chaos for personal gain.\u201d Many say checking the rise of a new oligarch class has been hampered by the abandonment under martial law of many of Ukraine\u2019s extraordinary transparency measures, including registries of the property and income of public officials. The founder of YouControl, Serhii Milman, is one of many saying these registries should now be reactivated, as \u201cin the absence of open registries, corruption grows exponentially\u201d. One western lawyer closely involved in Ukrainian extradition cases over the past decade says he is still not sure European politicians quite understand how deeply corruption is ingrained in the political culture. \u201cThe corruption itself is one thing, but then politicians, once in power, start corruption prosecutions against the leading figures in the previous regime,\u201d he says. \u201cAllegations of corruption become a tool to defeat opponents.\u201d Ensnaring political rivals is relatively easy as civil servants and administrators of state-owned enterprises can easily fall foul of contradictory bureaucratic rules. \u201cJudicial reform still needs a lot of work,\u201d says Maria Repko, the deputy director at the Centre for Economic Strategy. \u201cBad people are pursued but there are also cases that are really questionable.\u201d She knows of one donor helping Ukrainian municipalities to attract foreign funds by producing a 100-page manual on how not to get prosecuted. \u201cThe civil service right now could be prosecuted for literally anything,\u201d she says. Battle-hardened veterans in the anti-corruption war \u2013 some have been on this for a decade \u2013 say the struggle on the home front is mainly being fought around three main judicial institutions: the supreme court, the constitutional court and the high qualification commission. Each is a test of what kind of a country Ukraine can become after the war. On 17 May, the then president of the supreme court, Vsevolod Kniaziev, was allegedly caught being given a \u00a32.7m bribe. One reading of his arrest is that someone was prepared to grass him up to the investigators, and that this represents a cultural shift. \u201cThere is a new question in the air: what are you doing in the war and how dare you steal money when soldiers are dying to keep you in your comfortable chair,\u201d says Liubov Velychko, an investigative journalist. But, if proven, the episode also reveals a compromised legal system, bereft of a moral code even in wartime. Elected as recently as October 2021, wiretaps apparently show Kniaziev had established a back office at the court to collate bribes from around the country. Kniaziev denies wrongdoing and has criticised his detention but said he is cooperating with investigators. The second problem lies with the constitutional court, the body that has legal oversight of parliament and executive, including the timing of postwar elections, reintegration of occupied territories and Euro-Atlantic integration. Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office has been accused of opening the door to political interference by backing a law in December that the Venice Commission, the judicial arm of the Council of Europe, said it did not establish a credible integrity check for applicants to the court. The commission has recommended international experts have the casting vote on an advisory group of experts that would screen applicants for the court. The principle of outside judges screening applications for the judiciary has long been accepted. Sir Anthony Hooper, a former British appeal court judge and member of Matrix chambers, was the British appointee to the Ethics Council, a body that elected judges to the anti-corruption court. Hooper spent many an hour on Zoom cross-examining candidates for the judiciary about precisely how they had found the money for a $80,000 Toyota Land Cruiser. So far, Zelenskiy has refused to accept the full recommendations from the Venice Commission to give a majority to the international judges that screen applicants for the constitutional court. The dispute remains live. The third controversy has revolved around the judiciary\u2019s main governing body: the 21-strong high council of justice (VRP). This body was supposed to be ushering in a new era of judicial reform by electing 16 members to the high qualification commission of judges (VKKS), the body that selects judges. There are currently vacancies for 2,500 new judges, so if the selection system is no better than what went before, Ukraine will be embedding a corrupt judiciary for the next decade. Ukrainian civil society seems to disagree about the quality of the people elected to the VKKS, with some saying they are not \u201cthe best of the best\u201d. Others are prepared to wait. Overall, anti-corruption campaigners say they are making progress and have their clear agenda in hand. Vasyl Lozinskyi, the deputy infrastructure minister, was sacked in January and put under house arrest after he was accused of inflating the price of winter equipment, including generators, and allegedly siphoning off $400,000. He faces eight to 12 years in prison if convicted but denies wrongdoing. The ministry of defence was meanwhile found flatfooted when Ukrainian newspapers reported that its procurement department had been paying inflated prices for soldiers\u2019 rations, raising concerns about kickbacks. Many Ukrainian journalists acknowledge that new specialist anti-corruption courts are making progress, but worry the big fish can always swim free. Dmitro Firtash, a Ukrainian businessman arrested in Vienna in 2014, has avoided extradition to the US to face bribery charges for which he denies wrongdoing. Pavlo Vovk, a Kyiv district judge whose court Zelenskiy closed down in December after Ukrainian anti-corruption authorities compared it to a criminal organisation, has not been successfully prosecuted even though the US placed sanctions on him in 2022. He has called the decision to eliminate his court purely political. Vladyslav Trubitsyn, a member of the Kyiv council, was recently given permission to travel abroad even though he had twice missed court hearings on bribery charges. He is believed now to be in Poland; Ukraine has issued a warrant for his arrest. Transparency and a cleaned-up judiciary are seen as the key to stopping corruption. At the London conference, Ukraine will make a heavy sell of how digital transparency can protect the integrity of the reconstruction contracts. One thing Ukraine has shown is that it is hugely resourceful, adaptive and digitally resilient \u2013 the Estonia of the east. Artem Shevalev, a board member for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said: \u201cUkraine is the most decentralised and networked societies in the former Soviet Union.\u201d It will unveil the Dream ecosystem, intended to allow public monitoring of all stages of postwar reconstruction projects, from initial damage registration to commissioning, financing, procurement, construction and commissioning. Every object from school, hospital to house that will need to be rebuilt will have its own identifier. In theory, every dollar in this digital Marshall plan can be tracked. There are already nearly 20,000 compensation claims registered that eventually will be assessed by local government officials. Viktor Nestulia, the head of Ukraine\u2019s support, open contracting partnership, and chair of Rise Ukraine coalition, is optimistic. \u201cAs a civil society representative, I am not concerned at all about transparency in reconstruction. Ukraine is a champion in transparency. Recently there was a new transparency index and we were number one in the world on public procurement, treasury transaction, asset declaration, beneficial owners, financial reporting of companies, extractive industries, and many other datasets are available all though digital.\u201d He worries whether Ukraine has the capacity to make the right decisions. The president\u2019s office, used to operating a necessarily secretive and centralised war economy, is going to find it hard to hand the reins back to the people. \u201cHigh-level actors come to Kyiv, they go to Bucha and meet Zelenskiy,\u201d says Halushka. \u201cWhat is missing and what used to be an integral part of a visit was a meeting with civil society before the meeting with officials.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a68f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/16/first-edition-boris-johnson-report-parliament", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Friday briefing: The 106-page report that says Boris Johnson repeatedly lied to Parliament", "lead": "In today\u2019s newsletter: The 14-month parliamentary investigation into lockdown-breaking gatherings in Downing Street has finally been published \u2013 and its findings are devastating", "author": "Nimo Omer", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 05:36:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112832", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c0632155afea8602093e2ed211135043685fff67/0_82_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning. A 14-month-long parliamentary investigation into whether Boris Johnson lied to parliament over lockdown-breaking gatherings during the pandemic \u2013 which took place while the rest of the country was forced to stay inside and away from friends and family \u2013 has finally published its report. It is 30,000 words long and the culmination of months of rigorous evidence gathering. Brace yourself: it found that the former prime minister did indeed lie. Again. What a shocker. Though many expected a bad outcome for Johnson, the report is still astonishingly damning. It lays out (in excruciating detail) how he repeatedly and deliberately misled parliament when he claimed he had no knowledge of rule-breaking in and around Downing Street. And it seems as though his indignant response last week, after he resigned in anticipation of the publication of this report, made things worse for him. Initially, the recommended punishment was going to be a 20-day suspension \u2013 that number more than quadrupled to 90 days because of his attempts to \u201cintimidate\u201d the committee. The mudslinging can be entertaining to watch but it obscures the seriousness of what this report shows: the then prime minister was flouting the rules that he had set, while outside No 10 the Covid death toll rose. For more detail on this, read this brilliant Guardian timeline. While Johnson would like to frame this inquiry as a time wasting exercise, the issues at hand cut to \u201cthe very heart of our democracy\u201d, the committee said.

Obituary | Two-time Oscar-winning actor and former Labour MP Glenda Jackson has died at the age of 87 after \u201ca brief illness\u201d. In depth: How Johnson \u2018committed a serious contempt\u2019 of parliament For the duration of this scandal, Boris Johnson\u2019s main defence has been that he was advised by others that these gatherings were within the rules. The committee did not find this argument convincing, to say the least: it found that the only people who gave Johnson these assurances were Jack Doyle and James Slack, former Daily Mail journalists who worked as Johnson\u2019s head of communications. \u201cBoth men were concerned chiefly with media-handling and both were, at different times, political appointees of Mr Johnson in that role,\u201d the report says. Once he realised this excuse was not going to wash, Johnson turned to his tried and true playbook and began to disparage the privileges committee and its findings. Unfortunately for Johnson, the investigation was meticulous. All the evidence gathered was first-hand: emails, WhatsApp messages and photographs. No matter how many adjectives he throws at it, the findings are hard to dispute. *** What he\u2019s been found guilty of In its lengthy 106-page report (pdf), the committee found that Johnson had: 1. Deliberately misled parliament when he repeatedly said that either no Covid rules were broken, or that he had been assured none were broken. 2. Deliberately misled the committee by repeating those lies. 3. Breached confidence by leaking parts of the report in advance when he resigned on Friday. 4. Impugned the committee and by extension undermined the democratic process of parliament. 5. Was complicit in the \u201ccampaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee\u201d. The report eviscerated Johnson\u2019s character and conduct, condemning his inflammatory response to the committee as an \u201cattack on our democratic institutions\u201d. It found that the former prime minister had deliberately misled parliament over Partygate four times, twice in December 2021, once the next month and then again in May 2022. By doing this he \u201ccommitted a serious contempt\u201d which was made only more serious by the fact that he was the prime minister and therefore should have been the person most diligently following the rules he was setting out for everyone else. The committee also published additional evidence yesterday morning establishing that Downing Street had a \u201cculture of not adhering to any rules\u201d during Covid. If Johnson was still an MP, he would have been suspended for 90 days, the second longest suspension since 1979, bested only by former Labour MP Keith Vaz\u2019s six-month suspension for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation. The committee added that Johnson should not be given the pass that allows him access to parliament as is standard for an ex-MP. For some on the committee, this was not enough. The SNP MP Allan Dorans and Labour MP Yvonne Fovargue unsuccessfully pushed for Johnson\u2019s permanent expulsion from parliament. *** What he and allies said in response As expected, Johnson has fiercely attacked the committee, claiming that those leading the inquiry had reached a \u201cderanged conclusion\u201d that was \u201ccontradicted by the facts\u201d. He went on to say that the committee brought about \u201cwhat is intended to be the final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination\u201d. He called the report \u201cpreposterous\u201d, a \u201ccharade\u201d and added that he was \u201cwrong to believe in the committee or its good faith\u201d. His allies, from Jacob Rees-Mogg to Nadine Dorries, have added to the chorus of umbrage and anger, portraying Johnson as some kind of martyr that has fallen victim to a witch-hunt and threatening any Tory MPs that support it with deselection at the next general election. *** What\u2019s next Although Johnson\u2019s suggested suspension is still theoretical, MPs get the chance to vote on it on Monday. As of now it seems likely that they will approve it \u2013 on his 59th birthday of all days. What a lovely gift. No sitting or former prime minister has been found guilty of deliberately misleading the Commons or given such a serious sanction after an investigation. The severity of the response from the committee now gives Rishi Sunak the political cover to block Johnson from running as a Conservative candidate any time soon. But the bitterness with which this saga has ended has left the Conservative party extremely divided. While Johnson would like to paint the picture that this is a political drama in which his foes have used technicalities to bring him down, the reality is that this is about the way the government was being run during the biggest peacetime crisis it has faced. Trust in government is already at an all-time low \u2013 what happens next could damage that further.

The front pages The Guardian outlines \u201cThe verdict on Johnson\u201d, on a day that national front pages are dominated by the House of Commons privileges committee report into Partygate. The Times characterises it as the \u201cEnd of the road for Johnson\u201d, while the Mirror simply leads with \u201cLiar\u201d. The Telegraph reports \u201cJohnson allies vow to oust MPs who vote for his censure\u201d. The Mail claims there is a \u201cTory revolt over \u2018vindictive\u2019 bid to banish Boris\u201d.

Something for the weekend Our critics\u2019 roundup of the best things to watch, read and listen to right now TV Black Mirror (Netflix) Charlie Brooker\u2019s tech dystopia magnum opus returns, with season six opening in an avatar-based nightmare. Joan, a mild-mannered, mildly depressed HR manager (Schitt\u2019s Creek\u2019s Annie Murphy) watches a series that is, in fact, a dramatisation of her life, starring Salma Hayek Pinault as an awful version of her. In that patented Black Mirror way, it ruthlessly mines our latent existential dread. Lucy Mangan Music Asake \u2013 Work of Art As a man who appeared on nine singles over the course of 2022, Asake is nothing if not productive. However, this second album from the Nigerian star doesn\u2019t sound like it has been hastily thrown together, the palette of supporting sounds broad enough to encompass everything from a country-ish fiddle weaving through Mogbe, to dancehall-influenced interjections and the rather Dire Straits-evoking guitar that opens Sunshine. Alexis Petridis Film Pretty Red Dress There\u2019s warmth, humour, sadness and tenderness in this big-hearted feature debut from writer-director Dionne Edwards. It\u2019s a movie about masculinity that could have been solemn; instead it\u2019s pulsing with humanity, thanks in great part to tremendous performances from Natey Jones, Alexandra Burke and Temilola Olatunbosun. Burke (pictured above) plays Candice, a singer about to land the role of a lifetime playing Tina Turner on stage \u2013 but there are problems brewing. Peter Bradshaw Podcast The 13th Step Widely available, episodes weekly What starts as a troubling show alleging that the founder of New Hampshire\u2019s largest addiction treatment network sexually harassed patients soon becomes something far wilder. We hear that previous attempt to report on it were followed by mysterious violence; interviewees are hit with legal threats; the host is sued; and a picture of attempts to silence free speech emerges. Alexi Duggins Today in Focus Boris Johnson: the damning verdict As Peter Walker tells Hannah Moore, over the course of more than 100 pages, a privileges committee report details the parties that Boris Johnson attended during lockdown. It contrasts his behaviour with his statements to the Commons and concludes that he repeatedly and deliberately misled parliament. The punishment they recommend for him is the harshest ever to be meted out to a former prime minister. Johnson and his dwindling group of allies are furious. But is this now the end of the road for a politician who seemed to defy gravity for so long? Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad For the latest edition of the Guardian\u2019s How we met column, Neo, who lives in Cardiff and Becky, from Oxfordshire, told Lizzie Cernik about their friendship, which began in 2017 when they met at a festival. The pair bonded over a love of fancy dress; when they met, Becky was dressed as Beyonc\u00e9, while Neo was wearing 6ft wings and \u201can ostrich feather headdress that made me about 7ft tall\u201d. Becky was instantly taken with her new acquaintance. \u201cIt was as if we shared this instant connection,\u201d she said. Their friendship continued, mostly online, but intensified following the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, when they found common ground speaking about their experience of growing up mixed race in predominantly white environments. \u201cIt was like the universe had put us together so we could evolve, individually and as friends,\u201d says Neo.

For many the idea that \u201cthe national broadcaster no longer needs a political editor\u201d dedicated to TV news is absurd. But to management, who have seen the audience trends, the days of a senior journalist concentrating on filing for one 7pm bulletin is \u201cold fashioned\u201d and a luxury it can\u2019t afford. Probyn and 40 other staff in the news division have been made redundant in a major restructure along digital lines. According to a presentation to executives seen by Weekly Beast, the ABC TV\u2019s broadcast reach is predicted to trend dangerously down, from 43% in 2021 to just 31% in 2027. Four out of 10 Australians currently watch ABC TV on a weekly basis. By 2032 it will be just two out of 10, and the vast majority of people under 40 won\u2019t be watching TV at all. For a public broadcaster receiving $1.1bn a year it is not ideal to only reach a fraction of the population. To be fair, all free-to-air broadcasters are facing the same challenges. The ABC is determined to find audiences on different platforms both owned by the ABC and on third party platforms like TikTok and YouTube. That is why the ABC is replacing legacy jobs such as political editors, sound recordists and camera operators with dedicated social and digital reporters, digital distribution experts and people with skills and experience in vertical video. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup According to the internal presentation, Sky News Australia (4.9m) and Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes (2.9m) have more subscribers on YouTube than ABC News 1.73m and ABC News In Depth (1.14m). The ABC has defended the decision saying the parliament house bureau has more than 20 political reporters and editors who will lead the coverage. It also has a number of other senior correspondents in the bureau including Laura Tingle, David Speers and Greg Jennett and outside Canberra the ABC has Sabra Lane (AM), David Lipson (PM), Sarah Ferguson on 7.30, Annabel Crabb, Patricia Karvelas (RN Breakfast) and chief elections analyst Antony Green. Changing channels The ABC\u2019s New South Wales political reporter, Ashleigh Raper, has exquisite timing. Hours before the ABC announced it was making 120 roles redundant, 41 in news, it was revealed she was leaving Aunty after 15 years and heading for a new high-profile job at the Ten network. Well known to NSW audiences for her Covid reports and coverage of natural disasters like the Lismore floods and the Black Summer bushfires, Raper has been appointed network political editor. She will be reporting for Ten News First and appearing on The Project and Studio 10. Raper will move to Canberra to replace Peter van Onselen, who quit the post in March to return full-time to his role at the University of Western Australia as a politics and public policy professor. The separation hasn\u2019t gone well for PVO though, as he is now being sued by Ten for breach of contract after he referred to Channel Ten as \u201cthe minnow of Australian commercial television\u201d in his regular column in the Australian. An expedited one-day hearing is set down for 29 June. Leaving time Weekly Beast can reveal Raper\u2019s appointment led to the immediate resignation of Ten\u2019s senior political journalist, Stela Todorovic, who quit on Tuesday when she was told she would not be getting PVO\u2019s old job. Sources said Todorovic had been assured by management she was in the running for the promotion as she has been acting in the role since PVO left. When she was overlooked for Raper, who has no federal political experience, she handed in her resignation. Todorovic will serve out her notice. Todorovic\u2019s partner, Anthony Galloway, who is a political correspondent for the Sun-Herald and the Sunday Age, has also resigned his job but is working out three months\u2019 notice. Galloway is joining former Fairfax executive Chris Janz\u2019s startup, Scire, which will cover business, technology and politics. A former economics correspondent for the SMH and the Age, Jennifer Duke, is also joining Scire. Airport encounter On Sunday night the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, was pursued through Canberra airport into the car park by a reporter from the Australian, Liam Mendes, who filmed her as he threw questions her way. Mendes, who posted the video on Twitter and on the website, reported that Gallagher \u201cwas defiant and all but silent as she flew into a Canberra firestorm\u201d. But among veterans of Canberra reporting and Labor ranks the ongoing filming and repeated questioning after Gallagher said at the outset she had nothing to say was unwarranted and unusual by press gallery standards. While reporters do approach ministers at the airport for comment, they don\u2019t normally follow them up to their cars when they don\u2019t want to answer questions. Gallagher, who has denied misleading parliament over her knowledge of Brittany Higgins\u2019 rape allegation, had earlier said she \u201ccategorically\u201d denies misleading parliament. Mendes was formerly a paparazzo before he was hired by the Australian and was involved in two controversial incidents during that time. In 2016 he took the infamous \u201cgranny panties\u201d photographs of the former Sunrise presenter Samantha Armytage for the Daily Mail. The original headline of the story: \u201cArmytage dares to bare with giant granny panties showing a visible line\u201d, was eventually changed to \u201cArmytage goes solo as she heads out on a shopping trip\u201d after widespread backlash. The Daily Mail apologised to Armytage for referring to her underwear. In the same year Mendes was in the news again after police made an AVO application on behalf of a celebrity trainer, Michelle Bridges, after two encounters where Mendes photographed or filmed Bridges while she was at a restaurant and supermarket. A magistrate said Bridges\u2019 frustration at intrusions into her private life were understandable but did not warrant the making of an order. \u2018Invented\u2019 fear campaign? The front page story in the Australian on Wednesday, \u201cPM\u2019s IR agenda could trigger $13bn wipe-out and $373-a-year reduction in real wages\u201d was apparently bad news for Labor as it tries to sell its industrial relations reforms. \u201cAnthony Albanese\u2019s industrial relations crackdown on miners could trigger a $13bn hit to the economy and reduction in real wages of $373 a year, according to new industry modelling based on a 1% fall in productivity,\u201d the exclusive article said. The paper\u2019s chief political correspondent, Geoff Chambers, claimed the report \u2013 which was commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia \u2013 predicted that the reforms would also lead to a \u201creduction in real wages of $373 a year\u201d. It \u201cwarns Labor\u2019s proposed suite of IR reforms could wreak havoc on flatlining productivity and flexibility across the mining sector and related supply chains\u201d, he wrote. There was no link to the report in the Australian\u2019s story or on the Minerals Council website. But we\u2019ve seen the 10-page document and it makes no mention of the government\u2019s industrial relations policies. It does not mention the Albanese Labor government, the IR reforms or Labor policy reforms at all. In question time on Thursday the workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, said the article was part of a \u201cfear campaign\u201d and the link to Labor\u2019s IR policies had simply been \u201cinvented\u201d. The Australian\u2019s national chief of staff, Richard Ferguson, said the article clearly states that the \u201cmacro-economic modelling says restrictions on the mining sector and related supply chain industries would impact productivity\u201d. \u201cThe Minerals Council says the broad impacts of the government\u2019s IR changes on the mining industry would have at least a 1% drag on productivity,\u201d Ferguson told Weekly Beast. \u201cThe modelling considered the impact of a 1% hit to productivity on the sector and what that would mean for the economy.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a691", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/16/tv-tonight-catherine-tates-new-comedy-about-a-useless-british-royal", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TV tonight: Catherine Tate\u2019s new comedy about a useless British royal", "lead": "Tate fans will love the celebrity cameos and chundering.

But unlike most people commenting on her in the wake of making rape allegations (allegations that are vehemently denied), I do know what it\u2019s like to be raped by a political staffer while working for a politician, because it happened to me. I was one of hundreds of people who made submissions to the sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins\u2019 Set the Standard report. After the report was released, I hoped that people in positions of power would listen, would care, would act and would hold abusers accountable. I hoped that even if justice was out of reach for me, it would be within reach for younger women who reported similar experiences to mine. Set the Standard was a 456-page memo to everyone in Australian parliamentary workplaces \u2013 politicians, their staff, parliamentary department staff and journalists. The message: Do better. Some people in parliament didn\u2019t need the report to get the memo. They already understood the issues because they had lived them. Others read the report and were able to empathise and understand. But cultural change takes time and happens one person at a time. There are people in and around parliament who you could hit over the head repeatedly with that report and who would still not get the memo. There are also some people in parliamentary workplaces about whom serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour have been made which remain unresolved. The continued presence of those people undermines attempts to improve the culture. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In 2021 I had not wanted to think about the traumatic experiences I\u2019d had. But after Higgins\u2019 allegations became a major news story, I didn\u2019t have much choice. The issue was in my face every day. On news websites, on TV and on social media. In conversations with family, friends and colleagues. Strangers I met at parties found out I worked at Parliament House and wanted to talk about it. So I saw Higgins\u2019 story unfold and I listened to all the commentary around it. I watched and I learned and I considered my own options. What have I learned? I learned that if I report my experiences to the police, they might not be sympathetic to my version of events. I learned that private communications about my experiences might be leaked. I learned that if I disclose my experiences to politicians, some might be supportive. Others might choose to use my situation as a political football. I worry that politicians who don\u2019t want to become caught up in a game of political football might be reluctant to help me. I learned that if I go public in the media, my story will become public property. Journalists and the amateur commentators on social media will all have opinions about what happened and will share them freely, however uninformed they are. I learned that if I make a legal claim against my workplace, some people in the media and on social media will say that I am a liar who is only out for money. Across our society, when women report sexual assault, we ask the wrong questions. Why was she there? What was she wearing? Why was she drinking? Was she flirting with him? Why didn\u2019t she scream? Why didn\u2019t she fight? Why didn\u2019t she immediately go to the police? We don\u2019t give enough attention to the right questions: Why was he there? Why was he plying her with alcohol? Why was he trying to get her alone? Why did he touch her like that? Why did he have sex with her without her consent? When you have been sexually assaulted you question yourself constantly, because you have been raised in a society where the actions of victims are scrutinised far more closely than those of perpetrators. Victims internalise that. You don\u2019t need to be in court being cross-examined to experience it, because you have your own inner cross-examining barrister right there in your head. Getting that self-questioning voice to shut up takes a lot of therapy and hard work. For me it remains a work in progress. But every disbelieving or victim-blaming comment emboldens that internal voice and feels like a gut punch. All of us, but particularly journalists and politicians, need to realise that when we make comments about Brittany Higgins we aren\u2019t just talking about Brittany Higgins. Women like me, who have been sexually assaulted in parliamentary workplaces, hear those comments. Women who have been sexually assaulted in other workplaces \u2013 or in bedrooms, parks or alleyways \u2013 do too. And what we also hear is this: People won\u2019t believe you. People won\u2019t care what happened to you. If you\u2019re seeking justice, you won\u2019t find it. The men who rape women are listening too.

He is indicating the film festival fray on the promenade below. The crowds and the cordons; the limousines and the red carpet. He could walk down and join it, but he is happier staying put. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a keen participant of the circus.\u201d Cranston is in town for the premiere of Wes Anderson\u2019s Asteroid City, a light-footed account of \u201cbrainiac\u201d students at a stargazer convention. It is the 67-year-old actor\u2019s first visit to Cannes: in part because his greatest triumphs have been on TV, most notably in Breaking Bad; in part, perhaps, because he prefers to avoid the hurly-burly of big events. The publicist suggests cracking open the window to let in the breeze. He must be boiling in his cream suit. His Wyatt Earp moustache may start to wilt. \u201cNo, leave it,\u201d he instructs. \u201cThe air-con is good.\u201d Fittingly, Asteroid City positions him adjacent to the action, neatly quarantined in his own private space. Cranston plays the tale\u2019s straight-edged narrator, on hand to introduce the cast and explain the plot\u2019s twists and turns. The bulk of the film plays out in a dust-blown 50s town. Anderson arranges his characters against a salmon-pink desert; every frame resembles a William Eggleston print, and vintage American cars gleam like boiled sweets. Only once does the narrator blunder on to colourful Main Street. \u201cAm I not in this scene?\u201d he asks, briefly stumped, before scarpering back to the safety of his box. The narrator is your classic elder-statesman role. It makes the most of Cranston\u2019s velvety voice, his air of authority and his confident swagger, like a riverboat gambler. He took his cue, he explains, from the newsreaders of his youth and studied footage of Walter Cronkite and Edward R Murrow to prepare. \u201cThe only problem was speed,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Wes\u2019s movies, everyone talks very quickly. I don\u2019t think there was any actor on set who didn\u2019t get the same response: \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s good. Now much, much faster.\u2019\u201d He hopes that he nailed it, but occasionally on set he had his doubts. Comedy is a good deal harder than drama, he thinks, because the genre is more fragile and therefore more dependent on tempo and momentum. There were days on Asteroid City when he felt himself lagging, struggling to find the right balance. Probably, that is as it should be. \u201cFrustration is inherent in any production,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, it\u2019s inherent in any career.\u201d I am guessing that he is speaking as an expert. His CV, after all, is a testimony to heavy lifting. Cranston has been acting since his early 20s, but spent several decades as a jobbing foot soldier, toiling away in TV sitcoms and little-seen movies. It was OK, he insists, because he was making a living and paying the rent. That was his baseline. Anything beyond that was a bonus. His father, he tells me, had been a Hollywood workhorse himself. Joseph Cranston acted on TV in Space Patrol, Dragnet and The Red Skelton Hour and wrote B-movie scripts for films I haven\u2019t seen (The Corpse Grinders, The Crawling Hand). Joseph, though, always believed that he was built for better things. Indirectly, he taught his son how not to manage a career. \u201cMy dad wanted to become a star,\u201d he says, emphasising the word as though it\u2019s draped in tinsel and wrapped in neon. \u201cWhich to me is the equivalent of saying that you just want to be rich, without having an idea or a plan of how to acquire wealth. \u2018I want to be a star.\u2019 How futile is that? It\u2019s a sign of immaturity, which I would tell him directly if he were still alive.\u201d Furiously chasing his Hollywood dream, Joseph skipped out on the family when Cranston was 11. The two didn\u2019t meet up for another 10 years. \u201cAfter that, we got along as best we could. But it\u2019s as if the book of my relationship with my father is missing seven or eight chapters in the middle. You have to leapfrog the plot and you know you\u2019re missing things. What happened? Why?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cSo it was never what you\u2019d hope a father-son relationship would be.\u201d The way Cranston sees it, a successful acting career depends on four factors. He checks them off one by one. The first is talent, otherwise what is the point? The next is persistence, followed by its cousin, patience. You need those to stay the course. They see you through the endless knock-backs and the more ridiculous gigs. You hold your nose, do your best and keep going. Eventually, hopefully, you graduate to better work. \u201cThe fourth thing is the intangible one,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fourth one is luck. No career is made without a healthy dose of luck, and it\u2019s an entity of its own. You can\u2019t will it to come. You have no idea when it might. It comes when it chooses. Sometimes, not at all.\u201d This brings us back to Cranston, or to his slightly younger self. By the time he hit 50, he was getting good mileage from a three-quarter-full tank. His turn as the put-upon dad in Malcolm in the Middle had secured his finances. He had also cropped up in Seinfeld, playing the shifty dentist, Tim Whatley, who Jerry suspects has converted to Judaism for the jokes. Cranston says he managed to make Seinfeld laugh at the audition and that this, more than anything, is what got him the job. \u201cBut I was only in six episodes. People always think it was more: \u2018Oh no, no, it was a lot more than that.\u2019 Like, they know better, like, they\u2019re telling me!\u201d Seinfeld was fun and Malcolm in the Middle was good. It was Breaking Bad, though, that slotted the last piece into place. Here at last was the reward for all that persistence and patience. Here, finally, was a showcase for the man\u2019s acting talent. In the figure of Walter White, the high-school teacher turned drug kingpin, Cranston created an antihero for the ages; a brilliant chemist who has been thwarted and burns with entitlement and self-pity. It was a character, he says, that was based in part on his dad. Joseph died in 2014, only a couple of months after Breaking Bad\u2019s final season. One obviously wonders what he made of it all. \u201cOh, he seemed sincerely happy for me,\u201d Cranston says. \u201cAlso, he had a great work ethic. He was always writing, always looking for work. And he did look out for opportunities to take advantage of my position in order to further his career. Hitting up my agency to read his scripts.\u201d He laughs shortly. \u201cSo yeah, he was hustling right up to the end.\u201d The great thing about Breaking Bad was that it could be viewed in two ways, often simultaneously, to the point where ambivalence became the show\u2019s natural state. On the one hand it spun a classic tale of redemption, charting an overlooked man\u2019s audacious climb towards greatness. And on the other it pitched us towards hell, and made us root for a monster who destroys everything that he loves. Even Vince Gilligan, the show\u2019s creator, has since found himself cooling on tragic Walter White. \u201cLike, wait a minute, why was this guy so great?\u201d Gilligan said to the New Yorker last year. \u201cHe was really sanctimonious and full of himself. He had an ego the size of California and always saw himself as the victim.\u201d What about Cranston? Did he like Walter White? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, grimacing, \u201cI can only answer that question in retrospect, because I didn\u2019t have the luxury of objectivity back then. Did I like Walter White? Now I\u2019m thinking of him as a character. He was a phenomenal character to play. Because of his complexity, his loss of direction, and the emergence of an ego that he hadn\u2019t had the permission to show. Did I like him? I mean, if you ask someone if they like themselves, they\u2019d be like, \u2018Yes\u2019. Basically yes.\u201d It sounds as though he\u2019s equating himself with the man that he played. \u201cWell, yeah. Because at the time you\u2019re so in it. You\u2019re so subjective. You\u2019re not seeing how other people perceive you.\u201d He scratches his moustache. \u201cI think he\u2019d say \u2013 I\u2019d say \u2013 that he tried to be a good person.\u201d One downside with luck is that people tend to ride it for too long. That was the problem with ill-starred White, who had his chance to get out once he had safely banked his first fortune. Possibly it was also an issue for Cranston Sr, who regarded his son\u2019s lucky streak as his own golden ticket. If there is a last essential to any successful career, it may be the ability to quit when you\u2019re ahead. Cash your chips and bow out. Leave the public wanting more. In a couple of years, Cranston will be 70. This, he has said, might be a good point to sit back and take stock. He would like to spend more time with his wife, Robin Dearden. He wants to read some big novels and regain some sense of privacy. His impending birthday is one catalyst. Covid was another. Lockdown, he says, taught him the value of home and of a different way of being. For the first time in years he was able to walk about incognito. \u201cThis was the great thing about Covid,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean to say that in a flippant way, because it was also devastating to many families. But it taught us cohesiveness, and it taught us to wear masks. That\u2019s been a healthy development. Also, an attractive addendum to my wardrobe. It means I can walk down the street in my mask, hat and glasses and not be recognised. Which is a nice thing. I\u2019d rather not give that up.\u201d Anonymity and obscurity: that\u2019s what he\u2019s craving today. It appears that the circus will have to proceed without him for a spell. \u201cObscurity.\u201d He laughs. \u201cYeah, I like that. Yes, please.\u201d \u2022 Asteroid City is released in the UK on 23 June."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a696", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/roger-payne-60-years-discovery-of-whale-song-their-haunting-sounds-reveal-new-secrets", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Almost 60 years after the discovery of whale song, their haunting sounds reveal new secrets", "lead": "In 1967, Roger Payne, who has died at 88, noticed that the mammals\u2019 calls were organised in repeating patterns, spurring the discovery of whale song", "author": "Sophy Grimshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 05:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112961", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e003a3a3c136469a78713cea5e52a4184f1d4e06/233_951_4645_2787/500.jpg", "body": "The idea that whales \u201csing\u201d, commonly accepted today, is relatively recent. Until the late 1960s it was thought that whale noises were nothing more than expressive sounds or calls. But in 1967, a discovery by the marine biologist Roger Payne, who died last Saturday, changed our understanding \u2013 ushering in a new way of looking at the world\u2019s largest mammals. As the young Payne listened on repeat for days to recordings made of humpback sounds captured underwater off the coast of Bermuda, he noticed the calls were organised in repeating patterns. Speaking to Guardian Seascape in 2020, he described it as his \u201cwow\u201d moment, spurring on the discovery \u2013 made alongside other researchers \u2013 that all whale species \u201csing\u201d in some rhythmic form, even in the \u201cclicks\u201d of toothed whales, such as sperm whales. Some whales even use the sonata form, common to human music: a theme, followed by a variation, then a return to the theme. The zoologist Katy Payne \u2013 Roger\u2019s collaborator (and former wife) \u2013 would go on to prove that whales use what can be described as rhyme, a technique whales seem to use to remember long and complex sections of repeating patterns, topped and tailed with \u201cend phrases\u201d. Katy Payne showed humpback whales in a given area sing different versions of the same song \u2013 essentially a \u201chit\u201d \u2013 that changes slightly throughout the course of the season. Indeed, it was the humpback \u2013 toothless baleen whales, with fleshy, concertina-like jaws \u2013 that quickly stood out as the most prolific cetacean singer, creating songs that are also emotionally affecting to human beings. Why whales sing is still not comprehensively clear, but Roger Payne soon observed differences between their songs and their other social sounds: for example, between the \u201calmost whispering\u201d tone of mothers communicating to calves, and the long, loud broadcasts of males seeking a mate. It is primarily males that sing songs, though there are some recordings of females singing, too. The role of whale song in mating is still not fully understood. In 2020 Stanford University researchers found that blue whales sing at different times of day and night as their migration behaviour changes \u2013 though, again, precisely why is unclear. What is known is that, given the distances whales travel in deep ocean, the volume and \u201cbroadcast\u201d quality of song is key. Roger Payne\u2019s assertion, early in his career, that a blue whale, in deep ocean free from human noise pollution, could transmit a song that might be heard by another whale as far as 13,000 miles away, was so controversial among biologists that he described the reaction as almost \u201ccareer-ending\u201d. Another theory of his was that music might predate human life, given that whales predate humans in evolutionary terms. In his later years, Payne became interested in how technology might help to decipher a vocabulary of \u201cwhale speak\u201d, if enough samples could be gathered \u2013 though he stopped short of using the term \u201clanguage\u201d as it was too open to being misconstrued."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a697", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/16/a-shopping-guide-to-the-best-summer-hats", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A shopping guide to the best \u2026 summer hats", "lead": "As we approach midsummer, you\u2019ll need one of these", "author": "Melanie Wilkinson", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 05:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112979", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eec0b144aadc4b43be67cff3d81ed2ff6a581a5e/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Buy Blue print, \u00a335, boden.com Striped, \u00a345, arket.com Patterned wide brim, \u00a382 by Rae Feather from smallable.com *** Rent Denim bucket style, \u00a336.65 for four days rental by Erdem from hurrcollective.com Striped with pom poms, \u00a344 for four days rental by Yosuzi from mywardrobehq.com Canvas with toggle, from \u00a311 for three days\u2019 rental by Jacquemus from byrotation.com *** Thrift Cap, \u00a314, beyondretro.com Bucket hat, \u00a325, rokit.co.uk Floral straw hat, \u00a328.99, revivalvintage.co.uk"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a698", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/16/windrush-pardner-hand-saving-scheme-celebrated-at-bank-of-england-museum", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Windrush \u2018pardner hand\u2019 saving scheme celebrated at Bank of England Museum", "lead": "When people came from the Caribbean last century and were turned away by banks, many relied on communal trust", "author": "Harriet Sherwood", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 05:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.112998", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7cd15ad9f82164957153a97b8acec1a311dd13a3/0_180_1180_708/500.jpg", "body": "Among the challenges faced by the Windrush generation when they arrived to work in Britain in the 1940s, 50s and 60s was the refusal by many banks and building societies to allow them to open accounts, deposit savings or take out loans. Instead, they set up their own community schemes, based on those that had existed for generations in the Caribbean and elsewhere, that relied on trust. Now the Bank of England is hosting an exhibition in partnership with Museumand, the National Caribbean Heritage Museum, on \u201cpardner hand\u201d \u2013 a collective savings scheme that is still thriving 75 years after the Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury in Essex. \u201cBritain\u2019s banking system didn\u2019t welcome us as their clients,\u201d said Catherine Ross, who came to England as a seven-year-old in 1958. \u201cThe reason why we came was to make money, but we had nowhere to keep it safe. People were forced to keep cash under their mattresses.\u201d The new arrivals turned to a centuries-old system whereby people banded together in groups for the purpose of saving, known as pardner hand. It was a type of Rosca (rotating savings and credit association), used by people around the world, especially when access to traditional banking services is limited. Under the system, a group of people agree to save money together over a set period of time, with each individual handing their cash to one of their number for safekeeping. Each week, one \u201cpardner\u201d receives a lump sum made up of that week\u2019s total contributions. \u201cTrust was a huge factor,\u201d said Ross. \u201cBut most people set up pardner hands with people from their island, so you knew who you were involved with.\u201d Her parents resented their exclusion from the banking system, she said. \u201cWe were invited to come to Britain, and we assumed we were wanted and there would be fair play. Instead, we had to work as a community to look after ourselves.\u201d For her parents, the pardner hands was a lifeline, she said. \u201cBut they also used the under-the-bed system.\u201d The exhibition includes interviews with and photographs of members of the Windrush generation that used pardner hands. Savings were used to fund businesses, buy homes and pay for weddings and funerals. \u201cPardner hand is part of the extraordinary contribution that the Windrush generation and their descendants have made to life in the UK,\u201d said Jennifer Adam, the curator at the Bank of England museum. It is the first in a series of planned exhibitions at the Bank relating to themes of financial exclusion. Pardner hand is still thriving in communities of Caribbean heritage in the UK, with many schemes run on apps. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s only a small amount, it\u2019s good discipline and can make a difference, especially now,\u201d said Linda Burrell, Ross\u2019s daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the Bank of England is telling this story and acknowledging what happened.

Air pollution was classified as a type 1 carcinogen, the most certain category possible. This was mainly based on more than 20 years of research in particle pollution and lung cancer. The number of research studies has almost doubled since the IARC meeting in Lyon, with even more evidence on lung cancer in never-smokers, but governmental action to reduce air pollution has not kept up. Globally, outdoor air pollution is second only to tobacco as the greatest cause of lung and respiratory cancers. This holds true in almost all parts of the world, with a notable exception of low-income countries where people (especially women and children) also breathe smoke in their homes from cooking on open fires. In the past 10 years new studies have linked air pollution to other cancers, including breast and bladder cancer. These have also been associated with nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant from diesel traffic that is being targeted by low emissions zones in many cities. There is emerging evidence of links to childhood leukaemia too. For those people with lung cancer, smokers and never-smokers, their prognosis and survival appears to be reduced if they live in a polluted area. Research includes a recent study of more than a quarter of a million people with lung cancer in Pennsylvania. This raises questions about the impact of air pollution on the way that cancer progresses and how it may change the effectiveness of chemotherapy. In 2020, Dr Michelle Turner of ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, led a review of evidence on cancer and air pollution. She said: \u201cActions to reduce outdoor air pollution will reduce lung cancer in both smokers and in non-smokers. They may also improve survival from lung cancer, especially in those diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease. A study from the UK\u2019s Francis Crick Institute found that living for three years in an area of higher particle pollution might be sufficient to promote growth of EGFR-driven lung cancer, a type of cancer common in never- and light-smokers.\u201d Across the UK, about 3,500 cancer deaths were attributed to air pollution in 2015. These are not spread evenly. Air pollution affects us all, but some communities are affected more than others. Greatest concentrations are often found in the poorest communities and also in areas with the highest proportion of black, Asian and multiple ethnicities. Turner explained: \u201cRecent studies have shown stronger associations of ambient air pollution and lung cancer risk in lower-socioeconomic neighbourhoods where there are higher air pollution levels. There is an urgent worldwide need for multiple, multi-level public health and policy interventions to improve outdoor air for lung cancer prevention and to reduce disparities in the disease\u201d. Last year the UK set a target to reduce the worst PM2.5 particle pollution in England to 10 micrograms per cubic metre by 2040. The EU is discussing a proposal to meet this target by 2030. This is double the World Health Organization guideline. Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, from the University of Southampton, said: \u201cAir pollution increases the risk of lung and other types of cancer including breast, liver and pancreas. Overall, the American Cancer Association for Cancer Research states that for every 10 micrograms per cubic of increased exposure to PM2.5, the risk of dying from any cancer rises by 22%.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a69a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/16/what-steps-government-help-mortgage-borrowers", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What steps could government take to help mortgage borrowers?", "lead": "As interest rates rise, cash-strapped households need speedy solutions to meet monthly payments", "author": "Hilary Osborne", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 05:00:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113035", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6dd8f40d27ca6cade77fbbd2d4e51df47e47720a/129_0_3735_2242/500.jpg", "body": "As rising interest rates put a squeeze on millions of mortgage borrowers there have been calls for the government to intervene. But what could it do to help cash-strapped households? Improve help with monthly payments There is government help for those who are really struggling, called support for mortgage interest (SMI). This is available to people who are getting one of a list of other benefits including universal credit and income support. It is not available as soon as you go on benefits and is not a payout but a loan \u2013 when you eventually sell your house you will have to repay it. You might also need to repay it if you go bankrupt or enter an insolvency plan. The government could change the terms of this help \u2013 it could be available more quickly, or to a wider group of people. Nevertheless, it will probably remain targeted at only the very worst off. Reintroduce tax relief on mortgage payments More than 25,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to let people make mortgage repayments from their salary before it is taxed \u2013 a move that could reduce some of the pain by reducing wages taxes. This would not be unprecedented \u2013 throughout the 80s and 90s borrowers could claim mortgage interest relief at source (Miras), which gave them tax relief on their interest payments. But the government has already ruled out its reintroduction, saying it does not believe it to be the most effective way to target support to those who need it most. \u201cThe tax relief would be of greater benefit to those paying higher rates of tax with the most expensive properties and would only benefit those in employment,\u201d it says. Ease rules on interest-only mortgages Borrowers could cut their monthly costs by switching from a repayment mortgage, which includes paying off the some of the original loan each month, to an interest-only loan. The government and regulators could make this an easy option by scrapping rules which mean that borrowers have to show how they will repay the mortgage at the end of the term. They are unlikely to do this across the board: the rules were brought in after the financial crash to stop people taking on mortgages they could not afford to repay and are considered to have prevented reckless lending. However, regulators have been allowing some borrowers to switch to interest-only without a repayment plan and this is likely to continue to be a strategy (see below). Continue insisting lenders help borrowers In December the government told lenders they must do everything they can to support borrowers, including letting them move to interest-only payments temporarily if necessary or switch to a new rate without an affordability check as long as they are up-to-date on repayments. After the 2008 banking crash and during the Covid crisis, lenders exercised this kind of forbearance and repossession rates were kept down as a result. \u201cIt is likely the government and regulators will continue with having underlying forbearance measures and encouraging lenders to take an individual approach to borrowers,\u201d says David Hollingworth of brokers L&amp;C Mortgages. Target certain groups The government could target the borrowers most at risk of falling into arrears, says Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at consultancy BuiltPlace. He suggests these might include those in shared ownership properties who have rising rents to pay alongside their mortgage, those with Help to Buy equity loans who face interest payments on that debt alongside their home loan (currently set at 1.75% in the fifth year and rising each year), and those caught up in the cladding scandal and facing high service charges. In these cases it might not be the mortgage payments that are reduced but the other costs on top could be capped. Many housing associations have agreed to cap shared ownership rent rises at 7%, but the government could choose to make this compulsory and even lower it. Introduce a mortgage protection fund Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has revived his call for a \u00a33bn emergency mortgage protection fund, which he first called for in the aftermath of Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget. The fund would allow homeowners whose mortgage payments have risen by more than 10% of their income to apply for a \u00a3300-a-month grant. \u201cIf we don\u2019t give that sort of help to those people, you\u2019d see a spiral down and it will hit the whole economy,\u201d Davey said on Friday. Opponents argue that such a scheme would unfairly help wealthier people who can afford to own a home, to the detriment of tax paying renters. Order the Bank of England to hold rates For more than two decades the Bank has been independent of the government \u2013 one of Gordon Brown\u2019s first acts as chancellor was to set it free, and since then it has been responsible for setting interest rates. To step in and force its hand would be a big intervention, and is probably the least likely action the government will take at this point."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a69b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/16/boris-johnson-party-tories", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "So long as we treat Boris Johnson as a lone wolf, the other Tory beasts will roam free | Andy Beckett", "lead": "Arguing that the former leader\u2019s premiership was a one-off won\u2019t prevent another calamitous Tory government, says Guardian columnist Andy Beckett", "author": "Andy Beckett", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 05:00:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113056", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aaba4de7451b93af74776be5cc75a241c1a5337f/0_97_7120_4274/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson is history. Or so hope Rishi Sunak, many other Tories, the sober parts of the media and most voters. Johnson\u2019s terrible government, which ended only nine months ago, looks even more unlikely to have a sequel after this week\u2019s extraordinarily critical report by the privileges committee on his lies to parliament about Partygate, and his equally extraordinary tantrum in response. His three years in power, with the constant lying, corrupt sense of entitlement and lethal incompetence, are increasingly presented these days as an aberration, the product of a politician uniquely unsuited to rule us. It is now time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Johnson era, Tories have been saying all week, adopting the faux-casual language politicians always use when conducting awkward manoeuvres. The argument that his premiership was a one-off suits a lot of people. Ministers seeking to present the Sunak regime as a fresh start. Journalists keen to make a morality tale out of Johnson\u2019s rise and fall. Voters wanting to believe that nothing like his premiership will ever happen again. Even Johnson himself, and his shrinking but still substantial bloc of followers in the electorate, have an interest in his government being seen as profoundly different from what came before and after. Yet how much of an outlier was his government really? And how far can Johnson be separated from the Tory system that produced him? The answers to these questions will help decide the next election, and the reputation of Conservatism for decades to come. If enough voters can be persuaded that Johnson is not a freak but in many ways a classic product of the Tory media-political complex, the party will be in even deeper trouble than it is now. Perhaps the favourite conventional wisdom of British politics is that the Conservatives are always changing. Yet the fact that this is broadly true \u2013 even relatively dogmatic Tory premiers such as Margaret Thatcher made shameless U-turns \u2013 obscures the less-cited truth that in some ways, the Tories are always the same. As the American political scientist Corey Robin points out in his book The Reactionary Mind, conservatives of all countries favour hierarchies; and less openly, \u201cliberty for the higher orders and constraint for the lower orders\u201d. You can see this instinct for inequality in Partygate, or in Sunak\u2019s desire to deregulate the City of London while making protest harder. He and Johnson may openly loathe each other now, and Sunak may try to present himself as a totally different kind of premier, yet underneath their governments have been pretty similar. In their disregard for the law and enthusiasm for culture wars; their blind faith in Brexit and blatant misuse of facts in parliament; their appointment of the same mediocre but tabloid-pleasing ministers; and their reliance on the same Australian electoral strategist, Isaac Levido. Sunak and Johnson have followed essentially the same formula: Conservatism with populist additives. Johnson was just luckier in having an electorate ready to swallow it. Another danger with singling out his government is that it downplays other Tory disasters. From appeasing Hitler in the 30s to accelerating the loss of Britain\u2019s great power status through the 1956 Suez blunder to being fatally outwitted by the unions in the early 70s, Conservative leaders have regularly made huge errors. Yet each time, the toxic administration has been effectively sealed off by the party afterwards so as not to contaminate its reputation for grown-up realism in office, which too many non-Tories as well as Tories still buy into. As the Covid inquiry is already making clear, with its revelations about inadequate pandemic planning under both Johnson and Theresa May, \u201cbecause of the preoccupation with readiness for Brexit\u201d, it is very important that disastrous Tory mistakes are not treated yet again as isolated and unrepresentative events. In one sense, the Johnson premiership is not even over: we are still living with the damage. If voters want to reduce the chance of further calamitous Tory governments, there needs to be a much wider awareness that the party of privilege, always including politicians who believe they were born to rule, and egged on by most of the press, has a constant capacity to make spectacular mistakes through overconfidence. And conversely, more voters need to appreciate that Labour, as the party with an inferiority complex that rarely lifts, is likely to make fewer such misjudgements. Its errors are more likely to come from excessive caution, or too much compromise with implacably hostile forces, or a half-defeated passivity in the face of mounting opposition. Labour\u2019s delaying of its one bold spending commitment, to invest heavily in a greener economy, could be a depressing recurrence of this pattern. If Labour wins the next election anyway and the Tories are faced with the unfamiliar frustrations of opposition, there is little to stop them producing another Johnson: another leader who can bluster but can\u2019t govern. Assuming that Sunak resigns or is removed \u2013 the latter scenario is already the subtext of much of his Tory press coverage \u2013 the system to anoint a populist successor remains in place. A decisive role for the illiberal party membership is likely in any leadership campaign. Simplistic solutions to Britain\u2019s problems, such as anti-wokeness, are still in fashion in many Tory circles. More nuanced, less modernity-hating Conservatism remains marginal, as it has been since David Cameron abandoned his relative liberalism a decade ago. Beyond the party, too, there has still not been nearly enough of a reckoning about the Tory record since 2010. Thoughtful centrist or centre-right publications, such as the Economist and the Financial Times, lament the performance of the economy since then, and criticise individual Tory policies, without ever quite facing up to how extreme and reckless the Conservatives have often been. One reason for that silence may be that when Labour offered alternatives, under Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn, that in much of Europe would have been considered respectably social democratic, the business establishment did not back them. To accept that the Johnson government was merely one episode in a longer saga of Tory misrule requires all who rejected the alternatives, including Miliband and Corbyn\u2019s opponents inside Labour, to admit a degree of complicity in this awful Conservative era. It\u2019s much more comfortable just to write off Johnson as \u201ca wrong \u2019un\u201d, as the former Tory minister David Gauke did this week. But while we stare at Boris the monster, other Tory beasts roam free.

Yet the country remains in limbo, with little clarity about whether the most popular party will be able to take power and with its leader placed under investigation. The progressive Move Forward party stunned many observers by winning the most seats in May\u2019s election after promising change in a country that has been ruled by coup-maker Prayuth Chan-ocha for nine years. Move Forward, which is hugely popular among younger voters, has since announced it has agreed to form a coalition with other opposition parties. But Thailand\u2019s election rules, combined with a legal case hanging over the party\u2019s leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, means its path to power is uncertain. The Election Commission said last week that it was pursuing an investigation into Pita to determine whether he ran despite being aware that he was ineligible. The case centres on a claim that Pita owned shares in a media company, which would be a breach of election rules. It follows a series of petitions filed against Pita by his opponents. Pita has denied the allegations, saying the shares were inherited from his late father and that iTV, the company in question, has not operated as a media business since 2007. Earlier this month he announced he had transferred ownership of the shares to prevent any efforts to revive the company\u2019s media operations from affecting his role in politics. He was confident he had not broken any rules, he said. If Pita is found to be in violation, he could face up to 10 years in jail, a 20-year ban from politics and a fine. The investigation was likely \u201cjust the beginning\u201d, said Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. It was possible another case against Pita, based on similar allegations, could be filed in the constitutional court by either the Election Commission or by a group of at least 50 MPs or 25 senators. Such cases could take months, even years, to resolve. The investigations add to the obstacles for Move Forward. Pita was already facing an uphill battle to take power because Thailand\u2019s electoral rules require him to pass a joint vote by both the 500-member House of Representatives and the Senate, whose 250 unelected members were appointed by the military after the coup in 2014. It is unclear if enough senators \u2013 who are perceived as being mostly aligned with the conservative military establishment \u2013 will vote for Pita. If they do not, the country could face a deadlock. That Pita was facing a legal challenge could provide senators with a reason not to back him, said Siripan, who added that many were already nervous of the party\u2019s reformist agenda. \u201cMove Forward has created a feeling of fear among these conservative segments in Thailand,\u201d he added. A nation transfixed Move Forward campaigned on a promise of major changes, including removing the military from politics, reducing its budget and scrapping mandatory conscription. It also promised to tackle the big, powerful monopolies that dominate the economy, and reform the strict lese majesty law that shields the king from criticism. The latter promise is especially sensitive, and conservatives oppose any weakening of the law. Ken Lohatepanont, a commentator on Thai politics, said getting that past the Senate would be challenging and the outcome was hard to foresee: \u201cAfter the initial rush, few senators have come out since to announce publicly that they are supporting Pita. We may not know whether he has the votes until it comes to actual voting in parliament, assuming Pita has not been disqualified before then.\u201d The latest legal case has dominated the news in Thailand, with daily updates reporting technicalities of the law and of iTV\u2019s records and shareholder meetings. Move Forward say it was only recently, in iTV\u2019s latest financial report, that the company description changed, so that it was listed as a media business providing advertising services. Previous financial reports either noted that the company was a media business but not operating, or described the company in other terms. Move Forward has questioned if there are efforts to revive the company\u2019s media operations as part of a political attack. In 2020, Move Forward\u2019s predecessor party Future Forward was dissolved and its leaders banned from politics for 10 years by the constitutional court after it was found to have breached funding rules. Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a lecturer at Chulalongkorn University\u2019s faculty of law said the episode was likely to have a damaging impact on trust in Thailand\u2019s politics and institutions. Thai politics had been stagnant for a long time, he said, adding that the election and emergence of Move Forward marked \u201cthe first time in many years that people feel empowered that they can change something, they can make a big change to the country\u201d. The results had offered \u201ca glimmer of hope\u201d, he added. \u201cIf you crush that hope, there\u2019s going to be serious distrust towards public institutions \u2013 the court, the Election Commission, the whole constitutional system.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a69d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/country-diary-a-female-goosander-is-left-to-defend-her-ducklings-alone", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Country diary: A female goosander mother is left to defend her ducklings alone | Phil Gates", "lead": "<strong>St John\u2019s Chapel, Weardale:</strong> Unlike migrating drakes, females like this one can\u2019t simply fly off when we approach her brood on the river", "author": "Phil Gates", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 04:30:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113094", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1d85ec99d51b0866d414524c4abb88a91633e071/0_104_1559_936/500.jpg", "body": "Outside the breeding season, goosanders are usually wary birds, liable to take flight at the first inkling of an approaching human threat.

We surprised her as we crossed the narrow footbridge over the River Wear. She had nine ducklings, not long out of their hollow-tree nest, and now they were trapped between us and a low waterfall that tumbled over a rocky ledge. In winter, she would have flown away in an instant, but now she would not even swim her way out of trouble. Her ducklings, as buoyant as corks, could not swim up the waterfall and were constantly swept downstream towards us by the force of its flow. A goosander in a state of high anxiety, swimming in circles with her charges huddled around her, climbing on to her back. Where was the father? Back in the 1980s, it was proven that British goosander drakes, identified by tags and coloured dyes, undertake a long summer moulting migration to Scandinavia. He would have left the nest as soon as she began to incubate eggs, more than a month ago, and may now be loafing around in the Tanafjord in Norway, in the company of 35,000 others from western Europe, moulting out of their dapper bottle green, pink and white breeding plumage into drabber feathers. With luck, he\u2019ll be back in November to father some more ducklings. Why fly so far to moult? Goosanders only colonised Scotland in the 1870s, spreading into the border county rivers and northern England 50 years ago. The drakes\u2019 long summer migration might be a legacy of their earlier, more restricted continental distribution. As for the females, there\u2019s not enough time to join their consorts in Scandinavia after they\u2019ve raised their ducklings here, so they stay on our rivers to moult in winter eclipse plumage. We left our single-parent goosander in peace, crossing the bridge quickly so that she and her flotilla could pass underneath.

Brian Houston, the founding pastor of the Hillsong church, is on trial for one count of concealing a serious indictable offence of another person by not reporting to police his father\u2019s confession to repeatedly sexually assaulting and raping a young boy who was a member of his church. Brian Houston has pleaded not guilty. Frank Houston died in 2004. When he confessed his offending to his son in 1999, Brian Houston reported it to senior members of the church but not to police. Prosecutors have argued Houston did not go to police in order to protect his father\u2019s reputation and that of their church.

Boulten said Brian Houston held a genuine \u201cbelief, on reasonable grounds\u201d that Sengstock did not want the matter reported. \u201cBrett Sengstock did not want the matter taken to police,\u201d Boulten told the court earlier in closing submissions. \u201cHe did not want any civil or criminal action against Frank Houston. He never reported the matter to police.\u201d Section 316 of the NSW Crimes Act states a person has a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for not reporting their knowledge of a serious crime if \u201cthe person believes on reasonable grounds that the alleged victim does not wish the information to be reported to police\u201d. Boulten told the court on Friday that Sengstock had been consistent in his position: \u201cHe never wavered in his determination not to cooperate with the church or with any police investigation. \u201cYour honour has a duty, we say, to find Mr Houston not guilty.\u201d Boulten said there was no attempt by Brian Houston to \u201ccover up\u201d his father\u2019s offending. Brian Houston preached at a Hillsong conference in 2002, in front of thousands of parishioners, that he had confronted his father over \u201cthe accusation\u201d, and that his father had made \u201ccertain confessions\u201d. He did not, in the sermon he delivered, specify the nature of the offending. Sengstock gave evidence in the trial, telling the court he never said he did not want Frank Houston\u2019s crimes reported to police, and believes the church \u201cbought\u201d his silence by giving him $10,000, a payout agreed with his signature on a blank napkin, secured at a meeting at a suburban McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Sengstock told the court he felt judged by fellow parishioners, and pressure from them to keep the matter within the church. A church leader wrote to him, saying \u201cthe secular courts are not the way to go\u201d, and telling him he would \u201cget a fair hearing\u201d within the church. He said he had felt unable to speak out against the institution which had dominated his life: \u201cI was in the moral and spiritual control of Frank and the church.\u201d In court, Sengstock was asked directly why he didn\u2019t report his abuse to police. He replied: \u201cQuite frankly it was because I was paid for my silence.\u201d But Boulten said Sengstock\u2019s evidence before court was unreliable. He had made errors with dates, and over matters of fact, such as what type of car Frank Houston drove, Boulten said. \u201cBrett Sengstock is confused and he\u2019s got things wrong,\u201d Boulten told court. \u201cThere are problems with his reliability.\u201d The New Zealand-born pentecostal Christian pastor Frank Houston was a \u201cserial paedophile\u201d, according to his son. He founded the Sydney Christian Life Centre in 1977. Brian Houston, and Brian\u2019s wife, Bobbie, founded the Hills Christian Life Centre in 1983.

Bola Tinubu, who was sworn in on 29 May, has surprised many observers by taking a running start to his tenure of Africa\u2019s most populous country. In little over two weeks he has banished a longstanding petrol subsidy, ejected the country\u2019s central bank governor and ended restrictions on the rate of the naira, Nigeria\u2019s currency. The steps have fired up markets, sending stocks in what is also Africa\u2019s largest economy to their highest level in 15 years. But they have also increased living costs and drawn criticism from many Nigerians who have faced years of economic mismanagement. Joseph Essien, 47, a taxi driver in Lagos, said he had stopped working altogether because he was no longer making any profit after the rise in petrol prices. He said he used to spend about 5,000 naira (\u00a38.40) a day on fuel, which would last him for a day of eight hours and then into the next. Last week he was spending about 15,000 naira on fuel that barely lasted him a day. \u201cOver the weekend I just told myself it wasn\u2019t worth it; I\u2019m just working to pay Bolt [the ride-hailing company] their commission and I\u2019m left with nothing,\u201d he said. Tinubu, 71, who won as the ruling party candidate in February\u2019s election, last week suspended Godwin Emefiele, the controversial central bank governor, after criticising his botched replacement of naira notes in the lead-up to the election. Inflation hit an 18-year high and Nigeria\u2019s debt soared to more than $150bn (\u00a3118bn) under Emefiele\u2019s watch. On Saturday, the national domestic security agency arrested Emefiele \u201cfor some investigative reasons\u201d, without giving further details. Rid of its former governor, on Wednesday the central bank floated the naira to foreign exchange buyers, signalling the end of Nigeria\u2019s control of its official rate, which soon dropped by about 40% \u2013 the biggest fall in its history. Countries including the UK had lobbied for that move as essential to boosting foreign investment. A Whitehall source said it meant \u201cshort-term pain for long-term stability\u201d. Nigerians were already reeling from chaos triggered by Tinubu in the first minutes of his presidency when he declared in his inauguration speech, off-script, that Nigeria\u2019s costly fuel subsidy was \u201cgone\u201d. The move sparked panic-buying before pump prices tripled, leaving travellers stranded. Two states have announced three-day office weeks for their civil servants in response, while one has reduced school teaching to three days a week. Bolt increased its minimum fares earlier this month after the fuel subsidy was dropped but the union for drivers using ride-hailing apps said the increase goes nowhere near covering petrol prices that have roughly tripled. Drivers went on strike last week in protest, and this week suspended the strike while negotiating with Uber and Bolt. Nigeria\u2019s main workers\u2019 union has also threatened to strike. Dosunmu Oluwaseyi, 35, the floor manager of a restaurant in the Victoria Island commercial district of Lagos, said she like many had taken to \u201ctrekking\u201d to work, choosing shorter, cheaper bush taxi routes and making up the difference on foot. \u201cSome people stay at work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will not be able to go home every day. By the grace of God they should reduce [the price].\u201d Ikemesit Effiong, head of research at analyst company SBM Intelligence, said Nigeria was in \u201cnational sacrifice mode\u201d. The devaluation of the naira combined with the dropping of the fuel subsidy was already causing inflation, he said. He added: \u201cThe hope is that the end of the subsidy regime frees up enough resources, political trust and transparency permitting, to be channelled towards desperately needed infrastructural and social investment.\u201d Some have urged Tinubu, an archetypal \u201cbig man\u201d with a reputation for lavish spending, to tighten his own belt in these times of need. They suggest shortening his convoys of blackout-windowed 4x4s, which can stretch to more than 60 cars, or getting rid of some of the seven aeroplanes in his presidential fleet. Charlie Robertson of the emerging markets investment firm FIM Partners praised Tinubu\u2019s policies, saying they had prevented Nigeria defaulting on its debts, which would have led to rampant inflation. \u201cWe were heading to [the situation of] Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cMillions of refugees pouring across the border desperate for jobs and stability.\u201d He said the fuel subsidy was \u201csimply unaffordable\u201d, and freeing up the naira would encourage investment in the country and could boost a stagnant private sector, potentially creating jobs. But he added: \u201cThis is the easy stuff to do. The hard stuff is to make the country ready for industrialisation and a boom.\u201d For now Essien, the taxi driver, sits at home with his family, desperately learning the coding language Python. \u201cBy the end of this month I hope to be able to get a grasp of an aspect of it, and look for remote jobs,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6a0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/16/lidia-thorpe-says-she-was-demonised-after-raising-sexual-assault-allegations-in-the-senate", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lidia Thorpe says she was \u2018demonised\u2019 after raising sexual assault allegations in the Senate", "lead": "Independent senator claims she faced a pile on and media only took notice when a white woman made similar allegations", "author": "Amy Remeikis", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 03:34:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113149", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5b97ea73b8dc4ff2bfe441071e2723215fd7e4d3/0_61_4482_2689/500.jpg", "body": "The independent senator Lidia Thorpe has said she was \u201cdemonised\u201d after raising allegations of sexual assault in the parliament and was only taken seriously when a white woman shared her own allegations. Thorpe noted there was a huge difference in how she was treated after making allegations about being \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d in a parliamentary stairwell, compared with when former the Liberal senator Amanda Stoker raised her own allegations. \u201cIt\u2019s been horrible,\u201d Thorpe told ABC\u2019s Radio National. \u201cI became the perpetrator. I became the person that was demonised \u2026 I had a media pile on that day. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t until a white woman stood up and said \u2018yeah, this happened to me, too\u2019 that the media took notice. \u201cAnd I think that is a great example of the media landscape in this country and that is systemic racism. I was not believed. I was questioned. I was absolutely demonised that day, by everybody. And you wonder why women don\u2019t speak out. You wonder why we are silenced. It\u2019s because of that kind of behaviour.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Thorpe raised allegations against the Liberal senator David Van in the Senate on Wednesday, which she withdrew later that evening. Thorpe gave a fuller statement on Thursday, alleging she was followed and \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d in a parliamentary stairwell but without naming anyone. In a statement on Thursday, Stoker alleged that Van apologised for squeezing her bottom twice at a social event in 2020, which she described as inappropriate, \u201cunprofessional and uninvited\u201d. Van has vehemently denied Thorpe\u2019s allegations, which he described as false. Van said he recalled a conversation with Stoker, but not the behaviour she described, saying he wouldn\u2019t have done that. The Liberal MP Bridget Archer told the ABC that what Thorpe was saying \u201cwould have resonated also with a lot of women across the country\u201d who \u201chave had that feeling of being in any number of kind of public places or workplaces or anywhere where you\u2019re conscious of your personal safety\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s something that women are vigilant about all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re conscious of where they are, what their surroundings are, who\u2019s there. And this is the issue. That\u2019s what we need to try and change and particularly in workplaces where people really are entitled to feel safe.\u201d The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, expelled Van from the party room on Thursday, a move Van has said was unfair. On Friday, Dutton said he had been made aware of a further allegation against Van, but declined to go into any detail. He also called for Van to resign from the parliament and said his future with the Liberal party rested in the hands of the Victorian state branch. Dutton told Sydney radio station 2GB that he \u201cdidn\u2019t act right off the back\u201d of Thorpe\u2019s Senate statement and that there \u201cwere further allegations that were brought to my attention\u201d which he considered to be \u201cseperate issues in that sense\u201d. The host referred to Stoker as a \u201cquality woman\u201d. In another interview, with Melbourne radio station 3AW, Dutton said Thorpe had \u201cbesmirched everybody who works in Parliament House\u201d. \u201cSenator Thorpe \u2013 and it\u2019s been well documented in the papers, her conduct inside and outside of the chamber \u2013 does need to seek support \u2026 with all due respect to her,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Senator Thorpe has lots of issues and some of those and her own conduct have been well documented. \u201cShe made serious allegations in the Senate this week. She hasn\u2019t provided the names or details of individuals involved. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t wish to make a complaint to the police. She says she doesn\u2019t want the matters to go further. In the absence of any detail, it\u2019s hard to just besmirch everybody without providing details. It\u2019s hard to investigate that and provide an outcome.\u201d In her statement to Senate on Thursday, Thorpe said: \u201cYesterday I made remarks in relation to another senator. I then had to withdraw them because the rules of the Senate do not allow you to speak about someone\u2019s character, only about something they have said. So today I will speak about my experience of parliament.\u201d Thorpe said she did not believe the parliament was a safe place. Independent MP Helen Haines said \u201cpolitics was being privileged over people\u201d and \u201cpolitical point-scoring\u201d was still taking precedence over creating a safe work place. \u201cI take Senator Thorpe\u2019s reflection on this very, very, very seriously,\u201d Haines said on ABC radio Melbourne. \u201cIf one woman doesn\u2019t feel safe in our parliament, then no women ultimately feel safe in this parliament. So I think that what Senator Thorpe said is grave \u2026 and underscored we have quite a way to go.\u201d The Greens senator Larissa Waters told the ABC she feels \u201clike we [the parliament] have taken a huge step backwards\u201d and the job of the parliament was now to \u201cactually set the standard for the rest of the nation\u201d. \u201cI can only worry about what this week has done to anyone out there who has experienced sexual harassment or assault and we know sadly how many people fit into that category,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat they must be feeling when they see personal text messages splashed across the front page of a newspaper. When they see the tone that was taken in relation to sexual assault allegations this week.\u201d In a statement Van said he was \u201cutterly shattered by the events of the past days and stunned that my good reputation can be so wantonly savaged without due process or accountability\u201d. \u201cI will fully cooperate with whatever process Mr Dutton proposes to determine these matters as quickly and fairly as possible,\u201d he said. \u2022 Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

For that to happen though, MPs first have to vote on whether to accept the findings of the report. The paper says that even Johnson\u2019s allies expect the vote to pass on Monday: \u201cJust seven of the 352 Tory MPs yesterday publicly indicated they would vote against\u201d. But, as the paper\u2019s headline notes, \u201cJohnson allies vow to oust MPs who vote for his censure\u201d.

In her posts \u2013 which also contained allegations about dealings she had with an Australian music company \u2013 Banks shared a screenshot of a Guardian story about how streaming platforms were affecting the country\u2019s listening habits; it noted that just 22 of the 296 songs included in Australia\u2019s weekly Top 50 across 2022 came from Australian musicians. \u201cAustralians don\u2019t even want to hear Australian music LOL,\u201d Banks wrote, adding that that was a \u201ccorrelation between the government\u2019s purposeful ethnic cleansing of [First Nations] peoples and their inability to produce music anyone anywhere cares about.\u201d Banks may not be an expert on Australian culture, but her take was met with a collective wince from the local music industry. Many praised her for identifying the country\u2019s whitewashed, colonised cultural output; others pushed back at her assertion that Australia has produced very little \u201cgood\u201d music, and that \u201cmusical talent is just not in the gene pool\u201d. As a musician and a music lover, I know our music scene is rich and diverse; I know our music is good. And the world knows it too. First Nations rapper The Kid Laroi is certainly an anomaly in our white-dominated industry, but he has had incredible success overseas; and over the last year there have been many other Australian artists packing out tours around the world, including G Flip, Courtney Barnett, R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol, Tame Impala and Flume. But Banks hit upon something that not many want to confront: the lack of new Australian music on our own charts. This week, there are only two Australian songs on the Aria Top 50 singles chart; Kylie Minogue\u2019s new track Padam Padam, and Vance Joy\u2019s 2013 indie anthem Riptide. Meanwhile, 21 weeks into the year, the Top 50 albums chart has seen just two No 1 albums from Australian artists: Cub Sport with Jesus At The Gay Bar and Peach PRC with Manic Dream Pixie. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Aria charts take into account physical and digital album sales as well as streaming numbers \u2013 and while they might not cover everything, they remain one of the few ways to track an artist\u2019s impact, and present opportunities for not just artists but their entire team. A work that performs well on the charts also becomes eligible for Aria awards \u2013 a criteria which drew the ire of Gumbaynggirr rapper Tasman Keith last year, whose acclaimed album A Colour Undone missed out as a result. \u201cAria needs to evolve,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe system isn\u2019t set up for the small town mission kid, it\u2019s set up for the big label white man.\u201d Australian music is good, so why aren\u2019t more Australians listening to it? Australia\u2019s charts need to change An ex-employee at Aria told the Guardian that the lack of Australian artists on the charts has less to do with Australia\u2019s listening habits, and everything to do with how the charts are calculated. \u201cA lot of the [chart] rules around streaming were implemented when it was in its infancy in Australia,\u201d said the ex-employee, who did not want to be named. \u201cChanges are needed to better reflect the different ways people interact with music when it\u2019s so readily accessible \u2013 and that just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d Streaming, for instance, has changed everything. Audiences can now listen to practically any song that\u2019s ever been released, at any time, across a variety of platforms \u2013 and interpreting the data for chart use has proven difficult too. Older releases are \u201cclogging\u201d our charts too; Harry Styles\u2019s As It Was, for instance, has fallen out of the Top 20 songs on the Aria singles chart only once since its release in April 2022. Taylor Swift\u2019s Anti-Hero and Miley Cyrus\u2019s Flowers ran a similar course. \u201cCounting consumption [of older titles] as 1:1 with a brand new release is like comparing apples and oranges,\u201d they said. Every chart around the world has to contend with the ramifications of streaming. In the UK, the Official Charts Company rewrote its rules to limit the amount of songs from one artist that can enter the chart; this was, in part, an effort to curb the complete dominance of Ed Sheeran\u2019s album \u00f7. Now an artist can only have a limit of three songs in the UK chart at any given time \u2013 and as a result, Sheeran is one of five UK artists who has achieved a No 1 UK single so far this year, with UK singles topping the Top 100 chart for 11 out of 21 weeks. In Australia this year, no local artist has a No 1 single. From cultural cringe to content quotas: other barriers to entry Maybe Australia\u2019s charts should follow the UK\u2019s lead \u2013 but it won\u2019t completely solve the problem, because there\u2019s a few problems happening at once. Australia is a small market, which offers few options for artists to \u201cmake it\u201d \u2013 it says a lot that The Kid Laroi had to move overseas for his career to take off. A rock, indie, pop or alternative act may find success on Triple J \u2013 in fact thanks to the station\u2019s quota of 40% Australian music, the 2022 Hottest 100 countdown featured 57 Australian songs \u2013 but for artists whose music is not really skewed towards that specific 18 to 24-year-old market, there aren\u2019t many other options. Triple J\u2019s digital sister station Double J, targeted at older listeners, is dwarfed in terms of listener reach; Double J reaches 550k listeners every week, compared to 3.2m for Triple J, according to the ABC. No wonder so many female artists who \u201caged out\u201d of Triple J want Double J to be given an FM license. As Ben Eltham highlighted in April, the dominance of streaming platforms \u2013 and their algorithms \u2013 is making it harder for Australian music to reach Australian ears. And commercial radio doesn\u2019t help much either. A 2019 parliamentary report into the Australian music industry found that local music quotas for commercial stations were \u201cpoorly understood, rarely enforced and some stations only played Australian music during unpopular late-night hours\u201d. Another issue is how prohibitively expensive it is to tour Australia. Artists must fly their entire crew across the country if they wish to actually reach more cities; in Europe or the US, you can just pile your team into a van and drive. And then there\u2019s Australia\u2019s storied \u201ccultural cringe\u201d. AA Phillips describes it as a \u201cdisease of the Australian mind\u201d, in which Australians consider homegrown art to be just not as good as art made overseas. It explains why Australians look to larger countries to validate our own talent, while remaining ignorant of our own artists and, in particular, First Nations culture. Perhaps Banks got it right when she described a music business that \u201clooks to England and the USA for ideas to regurgitate\u201d. Australian music diehards adore the local scene \u2013 but among the mainstream, the Aria charts show an aversion to it. There are a few potential solves. Commercial radio stations across the country could make a bigger commitment to champion Australian music. And some already are. The Maddy Rowe Show across Nova networks on Sunday evenings is a flagship program that plays exclusively Australian music. Abbie Chatfield regularly platforms local musicians in a devoted segment on the national Hit network. Triple J\u2019s quota has proven effective \u2013 but they can\u2019t carry it all. Allowing Double J to graduate from digital only to an FM band would also open up more opportunities for local artists. Implementing a three-song limit on the Aria Top 50 singles chart, as the UK did, may help prevent major artists from overwhelming the charts. We could even take it further; what would it look like to limit the length of time a song or album could feature on the charts, to prevent blockbuster artists like Harry Styles charting a year after a release? Australians shouldn\u2019t have to seek out Australian music. It should be all over the radio, soundtracking our lives and dominating our charts."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6a3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/15/us-open-golf-2023-first-round-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US Open golf 2023: first round \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Hole-by-hole report:</strong> American duo Rickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele lead on eight under par after first round in LA", "author": "Matt Cooper (now) and David Tindall (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 02:35:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113205", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/586c0aee4880c801e2b38d13cea507f5a99fdff1/0_160_3050_1831/500.jpg", "body": "We\u2019ll close coverage with a link to Ewan Murray\u2019s first round report.

Strange to think that he ended the round barely moving the ball with a swing having started it by launching a tee shot 382 yards. A fun little post-round exchange between the press and the left-handed Brian Harman. Question: \u201cThat 6th hole is one everyone talks about. Does it favor righties or lefties, lefties over righties?\u201d Harman: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I only played it left-handed today.\u201d Rory McIlroy\u2019s card. This is the fifth straight US Open that he has ended the first round within three strokes of the leader. On all four previous occasions he went on to record a top 10 but he is yet to add to his first championship win in 2011. McIlroy\u2019s bogey putt: If he misses this it will be a crushing blow after such a fine day of golf. Here we go \u2026 he\u2019s made it and straight in the middle too! A 65 to open his 2023 US Open account, three shots back of the lead and currently tied for fifth. Wow. Rory McIlroy has missed only two greens in regulation all day including at the 18th. The first miss left him on short grass. This second time he is in thick Bermuda rough. It\u2019s his first test from it and \u2026 he\u2019s whiffed it! His fourth shot is from deep in that grass and leaves him with 11-feet for bogey. A big moment coming up. Dustin Johnson drops a shot at his 18th hole (the 9th). His bunker escape left him 11-feet for par and the ball refused to drop. Updated scores: -8: R Fowler (F), X Schauffele (F) -6: W Clark (F), D Johnson (F), R McIlroy (17) -5: B Harman (17) -3: B DeChambeau (F), S Scheffler (F), S W Kim (F), P Barjon (F), H English (F), S Bennett (F) The length of the par-three holes has been a significant discussion point all week and Dustin Johnson has turned the 9th into a longer one than even the USGA planned. The tee shot is playing 184 yards but Johnson has cleared the green, found a bunker by the 18th green and has an awkward 30-yard shot coming back. Wyndham Clark has been asked after his 64 if he\u2019d had any inkling that LA CC would suit him this week. \u201cYeah, I did,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here Tuesday of last week, played a practice round with a buddy of mine and he showed me around. I felt like there were a lot of holes that fit my eye. I liked the greens and I loved the design of the golf course. I usually play good on courses where I feel comfortable and I like the design of it.\u201d No eagle for Dustin Johnson at the eighth. But a two putt birdie eases him into solo second on -7, just one behind the long-time leaders. Frustration for McIlroy at the 16th. He torched his drive 370 yards and had a short iron to the green on the 529-yard par-four but the approach came up just short of the putting surface. It\u2019s his first missed green in regulation all day. Meanwhile, Dustin Johnson thrashes his approach to the front fringe of the green of the par-five 8th (his 17th) \u2013 an eagle would tie the lead. Wyndham Clark has only made seven pars today. Seven birdies and one eagle tussled with three bogeys on his way to a six under 64 that he completed with a 24-foot par breaking putt at the last. Could Rory McIlroy catch the leaders? After opening the back nine with five straight pars he sets up an 11-foot birdie opportunity at the 124-yard par-three 15th and takes it. He\u2019s six under for the round but he has three tough holes to come. The 16th ranks fourth most difficult so far today and the 17th is first in that list. His drive at 16 finds the fairway. A quick quiz question: What do current co-leader Xander Schauffele and one of today\u2019s two hole in one stars Matthieu Pavon have in common? Answer: both have family histories that include a lot of football. Schauffele had one grandfather who played for Austria and another who played for VfB Stuttgart, and Pavon is the son of Michel Pavon who played football for Toulouse and Bordeaux (he won Ligue 1 with them in 1999). Remember Sam Bennett from the Masters? Then an amateur, he was third at halfway and ended the week 16th. He has since turned professional, was 20th last week in the Canadian Open and is now five under through 16 holes after holing a delicate birdie putt from eight feet at the 16th. Dustin Johnson took the conservative route at the 315-yard par-four sixth. He didn\u2019t attack the green from the tee but his 75-yard approach from the fairway set up a kick-in birdie. He\u2019s six under with three to play and, like Fowler and Schauffele earlier in the day, he is ending his round on the front nine. Rory McIlroy reaches the 632-yard par-five 14th. \u201cHe likes this hole,\u201d says his putting coach Brad Faxon TV commentary as he tees it up. \u201cFore!\u201d shouts McIlroy as the tee shot flies left of the fairway. It only reaches the rough but pops up in the air and then disappears. Dustin Johnson is making smooth progress. The 2016 US Open champion has circled five birdies and is yet to drop a shot in his opening 14 holes. And Clark has edged one shot closer the lead. -8: R Fowler (F), X Schauffele (F) -6: W Clark (16) -5: D Johnson (14), B Harman (13), R McIlroy (12) A first backward step for the afternoon pace-setter Brian Harman. He drops a shot at the 502-yard par-four 13th, the first test in a tough stretch of six holes to close the back nine. It includes a quartet of par-fours over 490 yards and a par-five that is 628 yards. He slips back into a tie for third with Clark and McIlroy on five under. After a bright start, Poland\u2019s Adrian Meronk, who we mentioned earlier, has slipped back into the pack. He was -2 through the 8th and is now level par through the 15th. It completes a hat trick of early flourishes. He was -2 through seven holes at the Masters and -1 through six at the PGA Championship. Another par breaker for Wyndham Clark. A birdie at the 632-yard par-five 14th which means he\u2019s played the three long holes in just 10 blows today. He\u2019s five under for the round. The record breaking rounds of Rickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele are the stories of the day. But how do the field scores compare to the past? Stats man Justin Ray has the answer: While on my last break I decided to do a little digging about Paul Barjon\u2019s background on New Caledonia. He lived on the South Pacific islands until he was 16 (having been born in France). There were only three courses to play and he has said recently: \u201cIt was tough to judge how good you are when you play on a small island.\u201d A multiple winner in Canada, he played the PGA Tour last year but lost his card. As Dave tucks himself into bed, the field continues to tuck into LA CC. Every shot under the card is almost certainly vital because it\u2019s hard to see how the course will be this vulnerable at any stage later in the week. Harman pars 11 to stay at -6 but Clark drops a shot up at 13 to drop back to -4 alongside English. And with that, I\u2019ll hand back to Matt to steer this ship to the finish. That\u2019s four birdies in five holes for Brian Harman who hits -6 and closes the gap on the joint leaders to just two. His latest red circle comes at 10 via a birdie putt from 13 feet. He finds the green at 11 but is some 50 feet away. The birdies keep on coming for Wyndham Clark, an excellent winner of the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow last month. The 29-year-old hasn\u2019t finished better than 75th in six major starts but he\u2019s now tied fourth here on -5 after his latest birdie at 12. The American-dominated leaderboard also features Harris English in sixth. He\u2019s something of a US Open specialist after fourth at Winged Foot in 2020 and third at Torrey Pines in 2021. -8: R Fowler (F), X Schauffele (F) -6: B Harman (10) -5: W Clark (12), R McIlroy (10) -4: H English (13) Brooks Koepka made a subdued start to his bid to win a second straight major and sixth in all. But he\u2019s ended his front nine with a pair of birdies to climb back from +3 to +1. That\u2019s still nine back and only tied 59th but having won the 2018 US Open after an opening 75 he won\u2019t be pressing the panic button yet. Also at +1 is Jordan Spieth and the triple major champion has yet to make a birdie. The good news is that he teed off at 10 so will now tackle LA CC\u2019s easier front nine. Slight technical hitch here but there\u2019s been nothing wrong with Rory\u2019s front nine play. It\u2019s been exemplary. He can\u2019t drain his long birdie try at 9 but that\u2019s an outward half of 5-under 30. Now can he make further inroads on leaders Fowler and Schauffele on the course\u2019s tougher nine? Not much to shout about for the defending champion, Matt Fitzpatrick. The Sheffield golfer started off with a pair of bogeys and remains at 2-over after following a birdie at 6 with a bogey at 7 and two pars. That\u2019s an outward 37 that leaves him two back. Fitzpatrick showed admirable honesty in his pre-tournament interview, saying this about the state of his game: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as it was last year.\u201d At the ninth hole, a par 3, Rory plays a solid tee shot to about 25 feet away. Brian Harman, the unassuming left-hander, fancies a piece of history too and he\u2019s roared to -5 after birdies at 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8. He\u2019s got some history in this event thanks to a tied second place at Erin Hills in 2017. Harman also finished sixth in last summer\u2019s Open at St Andrews although they\u2019re his only two top 10s in 28 starts in the majors. McIlroy will soon be joining Harman at -5, three off the lead, after plonking his approach at the par-5 8th to around 30 feet away. His eagle try cosies up to the hole so that\u2019s a certain birdie. Frenchman Paul Barjon is the surprise name in the leading bunch. He was asked earlier what was it about the course that was pleasing to his eye. \u201cIt\u2019s good. I like kind of a linksy style. There\u2019s not a whole lot of trees. There\u2019s a few around the tee boxes and a couple holes on the front nine of trees. But kind of reminds me a little bit of back home when I played British Amateur and all these courses. But I\u2019m excited to see the scores when it firms up a little bit. We had a little drizzle this morning and I think it softened the greens up a little bit. So I think that\u2019s probably explains also why the scores are fairly low.\u201d Could he repeat the US Open heroics of Gregory Havret at Pebble Beach \u2013 another California venue - and make a title challenge? Havret finished runner-up that week in 2010, losing by a single stroke to Graeme McDowell. It obviously seems highly unlikely that Barjon can stay in the hunt given that he\u2019s been plugging away without much success on the Korn Ferry Tour this season. But he does have some California form though after finishing 10th in the 2022 American Express at La Quinta. Time for the scores on the doors. Let\u2019s scan the top nine: six Americans, two Europeans and a South Korean. -8: R Fowler (F), X Schauffele (F) -4: W Clark (9), B Harman (7), R McIlroy (7) -3: B DeChambeau (F), S Scheffler (F), S W Kim (F), P Barjon (F) Dustin Johnson, a double major champion, and fellow big-hitting American, Tony Finau, are pootling along nicely. Both are at -2 after 7. But it\u2019s not such good news - yet - for Jordan Spieth. The 2015 US Open winner was a popular pick this week when it became clear that LA CC was a course that lent itself to brain rather than brawn but he\u2019s +1 after 7 and has missed one of those short putts (at 15) that somehow continue to trip him up. Rory has no such trouble with his short birdie putt at 7 and that puts him in a three-man group on -4 (tied third) alongside Americans Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman. McIlroy couldn\u2019t make birdie at 7 but he\u2019s hit a stunner of a tee shot on the long par-3 8th. That\u2019s inside three feet and he marches \u2013 yes, that\u2019s very much the Rory on the charge march \u2013 down the fairway, all ready to complete the job with his putter. Could Rory do something daft here and even challenge the two leaders? He has the harder nine still to come but in this sort of mood he\u2019s dangerous. Rory\u2019s tee shot at the short par-4 6th lands in the thick stuff but he controls what your or I would call a chop out to perfection. The ball pops up onto the green and even has the cheek to roll back a little from a slope, stopping about seven feet away. He\u2019ll have that to get to -4 alongside Wyndham Clark, who also shows great scrambling skills to get up and down for birdie at 8. Rory\u2019s birdie try is a fast breaker but he sets it out too wide and has to settle for par to remain at -3. The hottest man on the course is Sam Burns. The American has gone birdie-eagle-birdie at 14, 15 and 16. Here\u2019s the meat in that par breaker sandwich\u2026 A quick look behind the numbers to see how Fowler and Schauffele arrived at their stupendous 62s. These are live Strokes Gained stats by the way. Rickie Fowler Putting: 1st Around The Green: 24th Approach: 3rd Off The Tee: 16th Tee To Green: 2nd Xander Schauffele Putting: 3rd Around The Green: 8th Approach: 1st Off The Tee: 29th Tee To Green: 1st So, no-one has putted better than Fowler while Schauffele\u2019s approach play leads the field. Maybe Rory can join the \u201862 club\u2019. McIlroy, the 2011 winner at Congressional, adds a birdie at five from 20 feet to cruise to -3. A reminder that the Northern Irishman started with a 65 when he triumphed 12 years ago while his other three major wins came from fast starts too: 67 at the 2012 US PGA and 66s at the 2014 Open Championship and US PGA. It\u2019s been a good day for Schauffele and Fowler and Xander has taken to Twitter to give his buddy a virtual high five. We have a second hole-in-one!!! Sam Burns matches Matthieu Pavon by sinking his tee shot at the short 124-yard par-3 15th to jump to -2. Maybe that\u2019ll be the catalyst for Burns to have a big week. Despite five PGA Tour wins since May 2021, including this year\u2019s WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, his majors record is fairly woeful. He\u2019s played in 12 and never managed anything better than tied 20th (2022 US PGA). Thanks Matt. Coming up now, do first-round leaders have a good record of kicking on in US Opens? Me with this report. Since the start of the century, we\u2019ve had five examples of players going wire-to-wire i.e. holding the lead after 18, 36, 54 and 72 holes. Tiger did it in 2000 and 2002 while Retief Goosen (2001), Rory McIlroy (2011) and Martin Kaymer (2014) also led from pillar to post. In addition, most US Open winners are never far from the lead after the opening lap. Overall, 17 of the last 24 champions were in the top 10 after day one; six more of those were in the top 20. This century, the only player to win from outside the top 25 after day one is Brooks Koepka, who was only 46th at Shinnecok after a first-round 75. Even then, Koepka was just six back and that\u2019s the biggest deficit made up since Lee Janzen came from seven in arrears after day one in 1998. Time to hand the reins back to Dave. Before I do so, Wyndham Clark moves to three under for the round through six, joining Nick Hardy (through nine) as the afternoon front-runners. The American Cameron Young is another struggler this afternoon. It is perhaps no surprise, however. Since finishing 7th at the Masters he\u2019s played five times without breaking the top 50 and in three previous starts in the US Open he has never gone sub-72 (and never made a cut). He\u2019s three over through five holes. Scott Blair has added to the cue debate, emailing: \u201cAs a matter of mild interest (possibly) in Michael Green\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Coarse Golf\u201d - which my dog-eared copy tells me was first published in 1967 - this shot is known as the \u201cWalter Lindrum\u201d.\u201d Lindrum was an Australian billiards star who broke 57 world records (some still stand). Everyone in the field has now hit a shot. It\u2019s been a long day and plenty of golf to come. It\u2019s been a difficult start for the defending champion Matt Fitzpatrick who is +2 through four holes after dropping shots at the 1st and 2nd. A couple of veterans are thriving early in the afternoon wave. Phil Mickelson, who needs this title to complete the career Grand Slam and has finished runner-up in it no less than six times, is two under through six and playing alongside Padraig Harrington, who is one under the card. The Irishman is narrowing his eyes and nibbling on his bottom lip \u2013 always signs that he\u2019s enjoying himself on the course. Take a bow Alejandro Del Rey. He sounds a little bit like the signatory of 16th century Spanish-Dutch treaty, but in reality is a DP World Tour performer who earned his tee time via International Qualifying at Walton Heath. He has just reduced the 315-yard par-four sixth to a tap-in eagle (just 2\u20197\u201d) and is now one under for the round. Michael Meagher emails: \u201cAs he\u2019s about to start, can I be the first of many across the next four days to say \u201cOh, Rory\u201d?\u201d Well, he\u2019s added another birdie at the 2nd, this time from 12 feet. Michael might be in for another Rory rollercoaster. After all the drama of the last hour or so, let\u2019s return to an earlier debate. At 20.39 Dave and Julien Menz were wondering what would happen if a golfer putted using a snooker-style cue action. Just a few days ago Dan Walker and Stephen Hendry had a go at just that. Here\u2019s the proof: The par five 1st hole is supposed to be easy. Relatively speaking, maybe, but Brooks Koepka opens with a bogey. Playing partner McIlroy runs his eagle attempt nearly six feet past the hole but drains the return to open with a birdie. The first round morning wave is complete. Fowler and Schauffele, the two history makers, will tuck into lunch with a five shot advantage over their fellow finishers. A sensational effort. -8: R Fowler (F), X Schauffele (F) -3: B DeChambeau (F), S Scheffler (F), S W Kim (F), P Barjon (F) 382 (three hundred and eighty-two in vidiprinter-speak). That\u2019s how far Rory McIlroy has just hit his tee shot at the par five 1st. He had nothing more than a short iron to the green and has a 43 foot putt coming up for an eagle. A good point made by the World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler after his own 67. Asked about the 62s posted by the leaders he said: \u201cI think the USGA will be a bit frustrated that the number was that low today. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be seeing too much of that over the weekend.\u201d Xander Schauffele on his 62: \u201cI just played some pretty good golf. I saw Rickie\u2019s score and I tried to chase him down. The green speeds were perfect for holing putts.\u201d While that latter point might have been true, Fowler and Schauffele took advantage more than the rest of the morning wave. Bryson DeChambeau\u2019s assessment of LA CC after his first round 67: \u201cThis golf course, you\u2019ve got to be a great putter. You\u2019ve got to have great iron play into the greens. You\u2019ve got to be disciplined. It teases you wanting to go for certain shots in certain places. And you\u2019ve got to be a great driver of the ball. Everybody thinks the fairways are wide. No, no, no. Realistically they\u2019re like 25-yard fairways at best in some areas.\u201d Schauffele ties Fowler at the top of the leaderboard. His birdie putt was really quite limp, pulling up nearly four feet short. He mops up the par, however, and the pair have tied Branden Grace\u2019s record low round at a major championship (which he signed for at Royal Birkdale in the 2017 Open) and now share the US Open best. Rickie Fowler on his start: \u201cI got a couple of things sorted yesterday. Xander has a putt to eclipse me, just hope he puts a good roll on it.\u201d That\u2019s why folk like him. He\u2019s good at golf and he\u2019s nice. Schauffele has 27 feet to break the record Fowler set, well, seconds ago. It\u2019s really quite astounding what they\u2019ve spent this Californian morning doing. The pair of them are five (yes, five) clear of the next best efforts. And then there were two! Schauffele\u2019s turn to take aim at a 61 after he makes birdie at his 17th hole (the 8th). -8: R Fowler (F), X Schauffele (17) -3: B DeChambeau (F), S Scheffler (F), S W Kim (F), P Barjon (15) Talking of Meronk, he\u2019s opened with a birdie at the 1st. This time last year I mentioned to a Polish friend that her nation had a golfer making a name for himself. \u201cA Polish golfer?!?\u201d she responded with a combination of bafflement and disdain. \u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d She had good reason to doubt what she was hearing. Golf was first played in Poland over 100 years ago but the Communists took a dim view of such a bourgeois pastime and even today there are only 34 full courses in the country (and severe weather makes them unplayable most of the year). But since that conversation, I\u2019ve updated her three times with news that he\u2019s won the Irish Open, the Australian Open I wrote about 20 minutes ago and last month\u2019s Italian Open. In a bleak year for the sport, his rise has been a genuine feel-good story (and one of expanding the game). Fowler takes aim from 57 feet for birdie and a 61 \u2026 It\u2019s a decent effort but a safe one too, pulling up a little short. He converts the par from three feet with aplomb for his eight under 62. It\u2019s the lowest round in US Open history with 10 birdies and two bogeys. As things stand he has gained over three strokes on the field with his approaches and also his putting. Great stuff. This is the 123rd US Open and only six men (Johnny Miller, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Weiskopf, Vijay Singh, Justin Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood) have posted 63 - the championship\u2019s record low round. Rickie Fowler has found the green on the par-three ninth. He needs a two putt for the first-ever US Open 62. (Meanwhile, Schauffele has moved to seven under through 16. London buses blah blah blah.) Fowler makes his birdie at 17! A wonderful putt into the centre of the cup and he looks calm behind the shades. Eight under for the round and history beckons for him at the 18th. Thanks Dave. I was talking to PGATour.com\u2019s Ben Everill earlier this week. He\u2019s an Australian and likened LA CC to the courses on the Melbourne sandbelt (albeit he swiftly added that the thick Bermuda rough around the greens is a very glaring difference). Might Poland\u2019s Adrian Meronk take to the test because of the sandbelt similarity?! It seems an unlikely connection but he won the Australian Open there late last year and has just started his round. Fowler wedges to 13 feet with his third to 8. If he makes that and pars the last it\u2019ll be the lowest score in US Open history. If he birdies both, he\u2019ll have the lowest score in the history of major championships, currently held by Branden Grace (62)! To see if the record books will be rewritten, I\u2019ll hand over to Matt! Fowler\u2019s ball lands to the right of a small wooden bridge and the lie is in the barancca scruff. It\u2019s one to pace and think about. No point in playing the hero here. It\u2019s a par 5 let\u2019s not forget. Maybe time to just wedge it back into play and that\u2019s what he goes for. Smart move. Meanwhile, Schauffele\u2019s chip from down below the short par-4 15th doesn\u2019t make the green but he gets up and down for par to stay at -6, one back from Fowler. We also have a new clubhouse leader as DeChambeau rolls in a testy one to post 3-under 67. -6: R Fowler (16) -5: X Schauffele (15) -4: S Scheffler (16) -3: B DeChambeau (F) Finally some problems for the two runaway leaders. Schauffele\u2019s tee shot at 15 curls left into the barranca short and left of the green. And at the par-5 8th, Fowler leaks his drive way right. It\u2019s one of those where it\u2019s so far off line he might find an alternative route back to the fairway/green. While the top two wobble, Scheffler\u2019s putter keeps hot and he nails a 10-foot birdie at 16 to climb to -4. Randomly, the leading European is Frenchman Paul Barjon at -2. Rickie Fowler is set to post the lowest score in US Open history and yet he could be beaten to the punch. Xander Schauffele has just drained a bomb from downtown LA at 5 and he\u2019s up to -6 and just one back. It\u2019s three back to the fast-finishing Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler. Americans are dominating their home Open for now. Perhaps Rory will have something to say about that when he gets going at 9.54pm UK. Julien Menz emails: \u201cGiven the acceptance of longer putters, I just wonder whether it might often be easier to use the top of the putter as a sort of cue (lying flat, the perfect way to read the green). As someone who is far better at billiards than golf (and has used the technique before) what do golf rules allow?\u201d I\u2019m the worst person in the world for golf rules, Julien, as they bore me senseless but it sounds fun if nothing else. Actually I tried it once on the practice green after an 18-hole match with my fellow blogger Matt and KK Downing from heavy metal gods Judas Priest. A ridiculous sentence but actually a true one. Scottie Scheffler\u2019s putter, his weakness over the last few months, is behaving very nicely indeed thankyou. He trickles a slippery 10-foot putt straight into the middle of the cup at the par-3 15th and he\u2019s up to -3 and solo third. That\u2019s still four off the lead because Fowler has just converted a birdie putt of his own, a seven-foot right-to-left breaker hit at perfect speed. That\u2019s nine birdies in 15 holes. Bonkers. Fowler leads by two and he\u2019s just hit a beautiful curling draw with a wood to find the putting surface at the 258-yard par-3 7th. Another birdie attempt coming up. The clubhouse leader is Jacob Solomon after a 2-under 68. The 26-year-old, who came through Local and Final Qualifying to secure a US Open debut, later described his round as \u201cone of the coolest days of my life, no doubt\u201d. As for how the course played: \u201cYeah, it was a little more gettable probably for us than it will be for others this afternoon. We had minimal wind, able to stop wedges near the hole. I hit a couple wedges that really landed and then bounced out and ripped back a little bit. Definitely had the right tee time. I was pumped to see that I was first out. I relished that opportunity. I liked it. The liked the way it played.\u201d Solomon is a native of the San Francisco Bay Area and a big fan of the Golden State Warriors and San Francisco 49ers, it says here in his Bio. Solid par for Fowler at 5 so he remains at -6 with four to play. Those holes are a 315-yard par 4, a 258-yard par 3, a 537-yard 5 and a 184-yard par 3. If he can play that closing stretch in 2 under, he\u2019d have shot the lowest 18-hole score in US Open history. Blimey. Schauffele is just one back at -5 so the same applies to him if he can negotiate his final five in 3 under. Perhaps I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. -6: R Fowler (14) -5: X Schauffele (13) -2 J Solomon (F), B DeChambeau (15), Gary Woodland (15) S Scheffler (14), S W Kim (13), Ryan Fox (13), M Meissner (12), P Barjon (11) An anxious look from Xander Schauffele as he hits his tee shot at the downhill par-3 4th, a hole measuring 234 yards today. To his relieft, it clings onto the left edge of the green. Jon Rahm finds a much better line but he\u2019s maybe a half a club to a club short although he\u2019ll still have a very outside look at birdie. Bryson DeChambeau is ticking over nicely. After ditching the crazy diet (eight protein shakes per day), he\u2019s found some much better form again and finished tied for fourth in the recent US PGA Championship. A combination of four birdies and two bogeys today have put the 2020 US Open winner at -2. The afternoon wave will be heading out in just under 10 minutes. Some names (and UK times) to look out for. 1st tee 21:32 C Smith (Aus), S Bennett (US), M Fitzpatrick (Eng) 21:54 B Koepka (US), H Matsuyama (Jpn), R McIlroy (NI) 10th tee 20:59 P Mickelson (US), P Harrington (Ire), K Bradley (US) 21:43 T Finau (US), J Spieth (US), P Cantlay (US) Let\u2019s take a look at that spectacular double whammy from Pavon and Hovland. For the record, Pavon\u2019s ace was the 49th hole-in-one in US Open history. Hovland, meanwhile, has added a birdie at his next. Playing the last two holes in -3 has taken him to -2 for the tournament. Why is Rickie Fowler leading? Don\u2019t be cheeky at the back and say it\u2019s because he\u2019s made more birdies than anyone. Okay, it is that but breaking down his stats he currently ranks 1st for Strokes Gained: Putting, 1st for SG: Tee To Green and 3rd for SG: Approach. That\u2019ll work. Just to show the force is with him, Fowler comes within an inch of holing a bunker shot at 4. He taps in to stay at -6 with five to play. Scottie Scheffler is currently 13th for SG: Putting which makes him very, very dangerous. That heated up shortstick can\u2019t cook up another birdie at 13 but it\u2019s another hole ticked off without drama and he remains tied for third. This is remarkable stuff from Rickie Fowler and the Californian now has eight birdies on his card after making his fourth on the spin from short range at 3. Xander Schauffele is in hot pursuit though and birdies at 10 and 11 take the Tokyo Olympic champion to -5, just one back. Time for a leaderboard update\u2026 -6: R Fowler (12) -5: X Schauffele (11) -3: M Meissner (10) -2 J Solomon (F), D Wu (15), S Scheffler (12), S W Kim (11), R Fox (11) Hole-in-one!!! Boom, France\u2019s Mathieu Pavon drains his tee shot at the diddy widdy par-3 15th. Magnifique!! Imagine if someone else did something similiar. Well, a Norwegian would and that man, of course, is Viktor Hovland who with one swish of a mid-iron holes out for eagle at the 485-yard 2nd, his 11th, to leap from +1 to -1. It\u2019s all happening. Here he comes, walking down the street, getting the funniest looks from, everyone he meets. Okay, the funny looks are coming from those who said Scottie Scheffler couldn\u2019t putt anymore. To make a mockery of those claims, he\u2019s just drained another 20 footer at 12 and leaps to -2. As mentioned, Hugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy Mansion sits on the property and, erm, players have been hearing noises. No, not what you\u2019re thinking, there is wildlife roaming around. That led to this rather strange exchange in Patrick Cantlay\u2019s press conference earlier this week. Q: I\u2019m curious, in the times you\u2019ve been here, have you heard any weird stories or heard any weird noises in the area to the right of the 14th tee? PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, you can hear The Monkees almost every time you go back there. No, Hugh isn\u2019t a fan of Davey, Peter, Mike and Micky (well, he might be), there are actual monkeys providing the simian sonics. Plus other unspecified animals too. All a bit odd. The best Hollywood films mix light and shade so let\u2019s not focus just on the birdies. Justin Rose had high hopes of a big week following his win at Pebble Beach \u2013 a five-hour drive up the coast from here \u2013 as well as strong recent form such as 9th at the PGA Championship, 12th at Colonial and 8th in Canada last week. But the Englishman is currently a miserable five over after a horror run of bogey, bogey, bogey, double bogey from 15-18. Much work to do. Also struggling are Adam Scott, Jason Day and Patrick Reed at +4. Justin Thomas, Tyrrell Hatton and Francesco Molinari are also not exactly enjoying themselves at +3. DeChambeau gets an approach to stop obediently by the hole at his 12th hole and that four-footer should take him into red figures. That\u2019s where pre-tournament favourite Scottie Scheffler is right now after back-to-back birdies at 9 and 10. Over at 2, a sumptious approach from Fowler finishes a foot away. Looking the epitome of California cool in his shades, Fowler will have that to get to -5 and a two-shot lead. Is that cool? I think it is. Sky commentator Rich Beem, the 2001 PGA Championship winner, reckons there\u2019s a 63 out there today. Could Fowler be the one to post it? Well, his next hole, the 3rd, is playing the easiest hole on the course currently. Paul McGinley in the Sky commentary box says the \u2018marine layer\u2019 \u2013 always part of the weather forecast in California - has kept some moisture in the course. That, and the lack of wind, explains why the scoring is \u201cpretty good\u201d, according to the Irishman. McGinley also says the USGA wouldn\u2019t have wanted to make the course too penal on day one given that this is its first time hosting a US Open. Fowler converts his birdie chance and with Solomon giving one back at 16, Rickie is our new solo leader at -4. He then booms one down the 2nd fairway to celebrate his new-found status. -4: R Fowler (10) -3: J Solomon (16), R Gerard (15), D Wu (13), X Schauffele (9) Thanks Matt. Beautiful bunker shot from Fowler at the 1st, his 10th, and he\u2019ll have a short birdie putt to join Solomon at the top on -4. Four of the top six were born in California which is quite the stat given where we are. A par for Jon Rahm at the 18th to turn in level par. Time to hand back to Dave. A new solo leader after Alabama\u2019s Jacob Solomon needs just two shots at the 124-yard par-three 15th. He\u2019s four under for the round in his first start above the second tier Korn Ferry Tour. His warm-up for this week? He was fourth with 18 holes to play in the Knoxville Open at the end of last month. -4: J Solomon (15) -3: R Gerard (14), D Wu (12), R Fowler (9), X Schauffele (8) Conners is not the leading Canadian at the moment, however. That honour goes to Adam Hadwin who is two under through eight holes and thankfully unharmed after being flattened by a security guard last week when celebrating the Canadian Open win of his friend Nick Taylor. You\u2019ve probably seen this but it\u2019s still worth another look. Hadwin is the man in a hoodie who enters stage right! A steady start for Canada\u2019s Corey Conners. He spent the first 54 holes of the PGA Championship on the front page of the leaderboard before wilting in the final round. He\u2019s failed to make the cut in all four appearances in this championship and, as he tries to break that trend, he\u2019s one under through the 10th. Dave talked of the creativity of Michael Brennan earlier. Here\u2019s the evidence of that imagination! Jon Rahm misses the fairway at the 520-yard par-four 17th. He hacks out onto the fairway, still 175 yards short of the pin. He hasn\u2019t hit one fairway after five tries today and errant driving has been an occasional weakness this year. His approach shot leaves him 20 feet for par. He holed from 13 feet for par on the 16th but he\u2019s asking a lot of his putter. The latest situation at the top end of the leaderboard: -3: J Solomon (13), D Wu (11), X Schauffele (7), G Charoenkul (6), P Barjon (6) -2: R Gerard (13), R Fowler (8), S W Kim (7), M Mesiiner (6) Xander Schauffele makes a tidy par at the 16th to stay three under. He doesn\u2019t just have an excellent championship record - he is also a frequent fast starter. In his six starts he\u2019s twice been one shot back of the leaders, once been two back, twice been three adrift and four in arrears is his worst effort. He\u2019s currently on track to maintain that pace. Paul Barjon of France makes it a five-way tie at the top. Scoring is currently better than many might have expected. But a handful of high quality players are struggling early in their first rounds. Tyrrell Hatton is three over through eight holes and Jason Day is on the same score having played seven. Among those on two over are Justin Thomas (through 9), Adam Scott (7), Justin Rose (7), Collin Morikawa (7) and Viktor Hovland (6). Max Homa is currently two under for the round. The LA resident is playing alongside Collin Morikawa (two over) and Scottie Scheffler (one over) and said yesterday: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep this joke that I used last year. I know the US Open does themes for their first and second round pairings, so it\u2019s nice they put the three good looking guys together yet again.\u201d Here comes Rickie Fowler. He joins the leaders on three under with a birdie at the 7th. -3: J Solomon (12), D Wu (9), R Fowler (7) X Schauffele (5) -2: R Gerard (9), M Homa (6), S W Kim (6), G Charoenkul (3) Peter Allan emails: \u201cGood to see Fowler and Gerard doing well. Just need Lawrence and Johnson to join them for the Liverpool footballers reunion.\u201d (Ryan) Gerard and (Rickie) Fowler are two under and just one back of the lead. Peter might be disappointed to learn that Rickie Fowler is thinking of investing in Leeds United alongside Justin (Mickey) Thomas and Jordan (anyone got one?) Spieth. Xander Schauffele joins the lead group on three under with a birdie at the par-five 14th. As Dave noted earlier, he\u2019s relentless in this championship with six top 20s from his six starts. In all majors that tally is 16-for-24. A Californian native, might this be the week he wins one? Remember when the world of golf argued about the best player in the world yet to win a major? These days the debate is about the world\u2019s best player yet to record a major championship top 10 finish. Because, somewhat incredibly, both Max Homa (six PGA Tour wins) and Sam Burns (five PGA Tour victories) are yet to achieve that feat. Homa has just drained a 32 foot par putt at the 5th to stay one under for the round. The English amateur Barclay Brown is level par through three holes. He became a favourite of many at last year\u2019s Open with his trademark floppy hat and a name that resembles an English character actor from the Terry-Thomas era. He made the cut at St Andrews and is on track to return to the Old Course to play for GB&amp;I in September\u2019s Walker Cup. Dylan Wu completes a birdie at the 8th to make it a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard. Dave started a corny musical theme earlier and I\u2019ll run with it. No LA connection but I\u2019ve fired up the ukulele and am singing, George Formby style, \u201cAnd Mr Wu\u2019s a round one leader now.\u201d Sergio Garcia is into the red with a birdie at the 15th. It\u2019s his sixth hole of the day and his 23rd major championship start since he won the Masters in 2017. He hasn\u2019t finished top 10 in any of them. It\u2019s a remarkable run but he was so keen to play this week he went to Qualifying in Dallas and earned his spot. Jacob Solomon and the Mexican amateur Omar Morales are playing in the first group out. And they\u2019re having a great time. They share the early lead on three under. -3: O Morales -a- (10), J Solomon (10) -2: R Gerard (9), D Wu (7), K Streelman (6), X Schauffele (3) Fleetwood secures a birdie at the 6th with an excellent lag putt to steady the ship. He\u2019s now level par for the opening round. Meanwhile, Bryson DeChambeau, the 2020 champion of this event, had completed back-to-back birdies at the 14th and 15th to atone for an early bogey. Tommy Fleetwood takes aim at the green on the par-four 6th. And his ball makes it \u2013 well, trickles onto the second cut at the back of the putting surface. He\u2019s one over par through his first five holes off the back of his defeat in extra holes last week at the Canadian Open. Starting his round on the back nine, Xander Schauffele had made birdie at two of his first three holes. Good afternoon everyone. If you\u2019re thinking that the Thursday morning galleries seem a little quiet and sparse you\u2019d be right. The fans are out there but maybe not in the numbers we\u2019ve come to expect at US major championships. The daily capacity has been reported as 24,000 with a significant number of them corporate, rather than general admission, tickets. Those fans can walk the course but they do have \u2026 alternative options. Time now to hand over to Matt Cooper for a few hours. Best warn him that I\u2019ve already done the Lionel Richie jokes. Somewhat unusually, there are five par 3s on the card at Los Angeles Country Club and two today are playing over 250 yards. Patrick Reed has come a cropper at the 254-yard 11th, his second hole of the day, after racking up a double bogey following a tee-shot that went long of the green. At 2, Scheffler tries to balance the books with a 20-foot birdie attempt but the putt leaks right towards the end of its journey so that\u2019s a par. Playing partner Morikawa, meanwhile, has opened bogey-bogey after another dropped shot. Other big names have made sticky starts too. English pair Tyrrell Hatton and Tommy Fleetwood are both at +1 after 4 and 3 holes respectively. You\u2019ll also find major winners Bryson DeChambeau (4), Jason Day (3) and Adam Scott (2) at +1. One the 8th, the Mexican amateur Morales has a 20-footer for eagle that almost drops. No matter, a kick-in birdie makes him the first player to hit the giddy heights of -3. -3: O Morales -a- (8) -2: J Solomon (7), D Wu (5) It\u2019s six swishes and a dropped shot for Scheffler at the 1st. There\u2019s a surprise. Double major winner Collin Morikawa also coughs up a bogey at the par 5 after racing his opening putt 15 feet past. But over at 10, Rahm overcomes his poor opening tee shot to make birdie after brushing in a 15-footer. That 3 is matched by Xander Schauffele, a man who fully deserves the title of US Open specialist. The Californian has played in six of these and has finishes of 5th, 6th, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 14th. Scheffler is making a horlicks of this 1st hole. After chipping out with his second, he hoicks his 220-yard approach into a greenside bunker so he\u2019ll have to get up and down from sand for an opening par. Up at 3, here\u2019s a real test of Justin Thomas\u2019 mental resolve as his approach grazes the flag, dances around the hole and then spins back 70 feet and nearly off the green. To his credit, JT keeps calm and two putts to stay at even par. Lots of big names teeing off now and how about this for a three-ball: Jon Rahm, Viktor Hovland and Xander Schauffele. Lionel Richie watches on and it\u2019s once\u2026 twice\u2026 three times a fairway as the trio\u2026 actually that gag is ruined by Rahm. Schauffele and Hovland find the short grass but Rahm bellows \u2018fore left\u2019 as he tugs his three wood left into thick bermuda rough. He won\u2019t be dancing on the ceiling about that. Or summat. Suddenly we have a three-way tie on -2 as Morales and Solomon pick up shots. -2: O Morales -a- (6), J Solomon (6), D Wu (3) -1: R Gerard (5), H Buckley (4), S Stallings (4), R Sloan (3), F Molinari (2), K Streelman (2) Bob Dylan played LA\u2019s legendary Whisky A Go Go many times so perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that the first man to break that tie on -1 is another Dylan. Dylan Wu didn\u2019t birdie the easy 1st but has picked up shots at 2 and 3 to take the solo lead. Hurrah. Back at the first, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler hits away at the 1st but it\u2019s a scruffy one and trickles into sand. This is LA right so let\u2019s take it in our stride that Hugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy Mansion overlooks the 14th hole while golfers at the 4th can peer into the home of Lionel Richie. Jokes write themselves here but I\u2019d certainly be tempted to slice one into Lionel\u2019s garden to\u2026 you know the rest. We now have an 11-way tie at the top as 2019 Open Championship hero Shane Lowry taps in for birdie at 1. We could be in Norris McWhirter territory soon. To be fair, Los Angeles Country Club designer George C. Thomas has a reputation for giving players an easy opening hole before gaining his revenge straight after. The leaderboard is certainly showing that so far. Another player hoping to join that logjam at -1 is 2013 US Open winner Justin Rose. He\u2019s starting at the 10th but hates his opening shot, fanning a fairway wood into a bunker or near a bunker (the cameraman couldn\u2019t pick it out). Playing partner Jason Day doesn\u2019t like his either, his ball settling in deep rough down the left. Currently a 10-way tie for the lead at -1! The latest to hit that number is 2018 Open champion Francesco Molinari, who made Los Angeles his base a few years ago when becoming a member at nearby Riviera, home of the prestigious Genesis Invitational. He\u2019s not been in the best of form lately, missing cuts at both the PGA Championship and the Memorial Tournament and failing to make the weekend in seven of his last tournaments. Tommy Fleetwood, a runner-up in the Canadian Open last week, is still looking for a first major and, indeed, a first victory on American soil. His opening tee shot finds sand down the left but it\u2019s a par 5 and he can still make birdie from there. The Englishman has some notable history in this event, finishing fourth at Erin Hills in 2017 and runner-up at Shinnecock in 2018 when closing with a brilliant 63, the joint-lowest ever round in this tournament. He shares that honour with Johnny Miller, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Weiskopf, Vijay Singh and Justin Thomas, the latter his playing partner today. Meanwhile, how about that for some imagination from amateur Michael Brennan at 3. He\u2019s in deep rough to the right of the green, floats a chip away from the hole and watches his ball catch a slope and trickle back onto the green and into the hole. An air of Tiger at 16 in the 2006 Masters about that one. It takes Brennan into a tie for the lead at -1. Well, here\u2019s Phil Mickelson giving World No. 2 Jon Rahm a chipping lesson! The cynic would say Rahm (1) has more US Opens than Phil (0) but Mickelson is a six-time runner-up in this thing, has the small matter of six majors and is a short-game genius. Rahm heads out today at 4.24pm UK time while Mickelson starts his latest tortured bid to win his national championship at 8.59pm. It\u2019s going to be slow going out there today and, as we\u2019re on the west coast of America, UK viewers who want to see Sky Sports\u2019 coverage through until 3am may need some help. This press room coffee is pretty neat. Los Angeles Country Club hasn\u2019t seen rain in a month so is playing firm and fast. Balls are landing on greens, hopping forward and rolling and rolling. Rather like an Open Championship you could say. One bonus for the the morning starters is the lack of wind; flags are limp, trouser legs are not flapping. Very early days but four players are now under par for the round. Here they are: -1: O Morales -a- (2), M Kim (2), R Gerard (1), S Stallings (1) Scottie Scheffler saunters onto the practice range. The 2022 Masters winner has been a beacon of high-class consistency this season, winning the Waste Management Phoenix Open in Arizona and The Players Championship in Florida. In 11 other starts he hasn\u2019t finished outside the top 12. That deserves a \u2018wowzers\u2019. From tee to green his numbers have been off the planet so if the putter warms up the American will be hard to stop as he bids to land a second major. Scheffler gets going alongside Collin Morikawa and Max Homa at 4.13pm UK time. Michael Kim makes an opening birdie, his red number coming at the short par-4 10th. It\u2019s been 10 years since the former California-Berkeley grad finished 17th in the US Open at Merion (where Justin Rose won) to secure Low Amateur honours. The 29-year-old hasn\u2019t quite had the career many tipped him for \u2013 indeed this is his first start in the US Open since then - but he did manage a PGA Tour win at the 2018 John Deere Classic and you can\u2019t knock that. He\u2019s also been a good follow on Twitter this week with his insights from the course in practice. Hole locations for the opening round are here. Take a quick scan. So we\u2019re in Los Angeles this week, the first US Open to be held here in 75 years. Your kind of town? Hello! And we\u2019re off and running in the 123rd US Open! Omar Morales \u2013 a college amateur from nearby UCLA \u2013 had the honour of hitting the first ball of this year\u2019s event. The Mexican is 20 years old and part of a three-ball at the 1st also featuring South African Deon Germishuys and American Jacob Solomon. Over at the 10th, there\u2019s another three-ball teeing off: Japan\u2019s Ryutaro Nagano alongside American duo Berry Henson and Hank Lebioda. Not a great start for Hank there; he\u2019s made double bogey. But Morales has posted the first birdie of the day, tapping in on the 594-yard par 5 opener after putting his approach to just 20 feet. With Hollywood a short drive from Los Angeles Country Club, perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that the build-up to this year\u2019s US Open has been laced with talk of plot twists and betrayal. The PGA Tour\u2019s bombshell decision to effectively merge with the rebel LIV Golf organisation, this new entity backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, has sent golf into a tailspin. Check out the transcripts from this week\u2019s player press conferences. A cursory \u201chow\u2019s the course playing, John/Scottie?\u201d followed by a barrage of questions on \u201cthe big news last week\u201d. The show must go on and this week\u2019s venue - a beefy but strategic 7,423-yard par 70 with five par 3s and three par 5s - looks an intriguing all-round test. But make sure you find a comfy chair; we could be in for some looooong old rounds. With conditions firm and fast, the rough described as \u201cbrutal\u201d and a configuration of holes - lengthy par 3s, driveable par 4s and reachable par 5s - that will cause back-ups and delays, rounds will be slow. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they\u2019re under six hours,\u201d said Padraig Harrington. Gulp. Still, we have a raft of plotlines to keep us entertained: Rory to end his nine-year majors drought? Jon Rahm or Brooks Koepka win their second major of the season? Victory for one of the California locals (Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay, Max Homa)? Matt Fitzpatrick to defend his crown? A first major for Viktor Hovland? Will Jordan Spieth\u2019s imagination be fired? And so it goes on. Some of those cats are out early so let\u2019s adjust to Pacific Time (eight hours behind UK), feel the California vibe and watch the film of this year\u2019s US Open unfold.

They start when you learn early that things like your goldfish and budgerigar \u2013 even your dog \u2013 die. Then comes that chilling moment when your parents respond that, yes, people do too. It takes a few years for that to fully sink in and gives rise to another thorny question that adds to emergent teen angst: what happens next? Those turning 13 around 1990 were either fortunate or unfortunate, depending on disposition, to benefit from Kerry Packer\u2019s personal experience that he\u2019d \u201cbeen to the other side, and let me tell you, son, there\u2019s fucking nothing there\u2019\u2019. As teenagers of an earlier generation we had no such wise, brutal wisdom upon which to draw. We seemed to sail through early, mid-and late teendom blissfully unpreoccupied with what next, focused instead on the now: What is the meaning of life? Some found \u2013 or reverted to \u2013 God. Others went surfing. To Thailand. Or mushrooming. Others simply went to the Valhalla cinema, blood coursing with THC, hoping the answer might be in the Friday evening double late screening of Koyaanisqatsi and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Those who stayed awake emerged little wiser. We moved on. Grew. Let it go, mostly, for a few decades albeit while flirting with the possibilities that clues might also be discovered in The Big Lebowski (Abide) or in the pages of Moby Dick (where the answer is simply the journey to the edge). But age, the travails of the world, and most of all the chill of mortality and greater preoccupations with legacy, have a way of resharpening focus on that question in middle- and late middle-age. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Which is why it\u2019s so heartening to learn that an organisation named the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC) is having a conference in London later this year to consider, among other things \u2013 according to its front man, the charismatic controversialist and Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson \u2013 \u201cissues metaphysical, cultural and practical\u2019\u2019 and \u201cpertaining to the meaning of life\u2019\u2019. That\u2019s some deep contemplative action right there. But who gets to play? Besides Peterson (courter of controversy on everything from trans-rights and gender roles to his advocacy of the all-beef Lion Diet and climate change science scepticism) a few eminent Australians are apparently going along to spitball the meaning of it all with other deep-thinking and -talking types including Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg and Michael Shellenberger. Two former Australian prime ministers in John Howard and Tony Abbott, and former deputy prime minister John Anderson, are invited. So, too, former Liberal National party senator Amanda Stoker, South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic, and shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie. None of these people have, let\u2019s say, reputations for thinking too far outside of the deeply conservative box on a range of social issues (name pretty much any one). Fine. But it\u2019s their scepticism \u2013 or in Howard\u2019s case \u201cagnosticism\u2019\u2019 \u2013 on climate change that seems most starkly at odds with a genuine quest to parse the meaning of life. As Guardian Australia\u2019s Graham Readfearn and Paul Karp pointed out here, the alliance\u2019s vision document asks how it might \u201ceffectively conceptualise, value and reward the sacrificial, long-term, peaceful, child-centred intimate relationships upon which psychological integrity and social stability most fundamentally depend\u2019\u2019. Peterson has said a model for this was \u201csomething approximating the nuclear family\u201d with \u201clong-term, committed, stable heterosexual marriages sanctified by the community\u201d. All of which sounds like a pretty closed door kind of place where the invited Australian thinkers might well, in the infamous words of Howard as PM, feel comfortable and relaxed. But the IRL world with all its human complexity doesn\u2019t quite roll so neatly. It\u2019s doubly interesting how ARC\u2019s (Arc \u2013 get it, as in saving the human species? ... or perhaps not) vision doesn\u2019t believe humanity is \u201cnecessarily and inevitably teetering on the brink of apocalyptic disaster\u2019\u2019 despite evidence that we are already well and truly down that road. It\u2019s a handy trait \u2013 the ability to choose belief, religion\u2019s bedrock, ahead of fact, which is that of science, when considering the small question of humanity\u2019s future. What if the meaning of life happens to be: securing the future of subsequent generations by saving the planet? Just asking. No need to go all the way to London to ponder \u2013 or to determinedly not contemplate \u2013 that. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6a5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/16/speed-cubing-world-record-broken-max-park-3-13-seconds-rubiks-cube-like-3x3x3-puzzle", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Speed-cubing world record broken: Max Park takes astonishing 3.13 seconds to solve 3x3x3 cube", "lead": "The 21-year-old, who is an official ambassador for Rubik\u2019s Cube, smashed the previous benchmark set by China\u2019s Yusheng Du in 2018", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 02:14:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113244", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1c94d201a93c2624f4be7d35472c34be77f3a94b/110_0_3350_2010/500.jpg", "body": "Some speedcubing fans were left in tears after a prestigious and longstanding record was broken by American champion cuber Max Park, who took an astonishing 3.13 seconds to solve a 3x3x3 puzzle. The 21-year-old smashed the previous benchmark of 3.47 seconds set by China\u2019s Yusheng Du in 2018 to enter the Guinness Book of World Records at the Pride in Long Beach 2023 event in California. As the magnitude of his feat became clear, cheers erupted. \u201cThe atmosphere was electric,\u201d Park\u2019s father, Schwan Park, told the Guinness book. \u201cEverybody knew that he had broken the record, and I think partially everybody was in shock. \u201cThe cubing world has been nothing short of ecstatic. Everybody was really waiting to see who was going to break that record. When Max did it, everybody was very happy for him.\u201d Schwan described the 3x3x3 record as the \u201ccr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\u201d of cubing titles after his son added it to a host of others he holds, including the single solve and average solve world records for the 4x4x4 cube, 5x5x5 cube, 6x6x6 cube and 7x7x7 cube. Park rose to global prominence after appearing in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Speed Cubers, in which he starred alongside fellow champion and good friend Feliks Zemdegs. \u201cA lot of Max\u2019s fans, from the Netflix documentary, they all reached out and were very happy for him,\u201d Schwan said. \u201cA few people said they even cried.\u201d At the age of two, Park was diagnosed with autism, leaving his parents to search for ways to develop his fine motor skills. After he picked up a Rubik\u2019s Cube, they realised the puzzle could help. His parents began to understand the benefits of using cubing as a kind of therapy, and they used competitions as a means of teaching him social cues such as pointing, standing in line and waiting his turn. \u201cIt was a giant playdate situation that we were going to exploit for Max\u2019s social development,\u201d Park\u2019s father said in the Netflix documentary. Guided by his motto \u201cdon\u2019t think, just solve\u201d, Park became the Rubik\u2019s Cube world champion at the age of 15.

As Van denied all allegations made against him this week, the party late Friday announced it would suspend all resources and support to him, with an urgent meeting this weekend to consider the allegations raised by Senate colleagues Amanda Stoker and Lidia Thorpe. It comes after Stoker, a former Liberal senator, assured she was \u201cfine\u201d and \u201cnot scarred for life\u201d by the alleged incident, but was pleased she had spoken up. On Friday, the leader of the Liberal party, Peter Dutton, urged Van to resign from parliament as the further allegation of sexual misconduct went public. Dutton\u2019s calls came after being made aware of another allegation of inappropriate touching against Van since he expelled him from the party room on Thursday and raised it with Van on Friday morning. \u201cI made a decision yesterday based on all of the information that was available to me. It had come to me overnight and on that morning, I raised it with him. I made a decision and that\u2019s a decision I don\u2019t regret at all,\u201d Dutton said. Dutton told Sydney radio 2GB that he thought it was in \u201ceveryone\u2019s best interest that he [Van] resign from the parliament\u201d. The independent senator Lidia Thorpe raised allegations against Van in the Senate on Wednesday, which she withdrew later that evening. Thorpe gave a fuller statement on Thursday, alleging she was followed and \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d in a parliamentary stairwell, but without naming anyone. A spokesperson confirmed on Friday evening the party\u2019s Victorian administrative committee would meet over the weekend to consider Van\u2019s future. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Filling in for Peta Credlin on Sky News on Friday, Stoker said she was confident \u201cspeaking up was the right thing to do\u201d after alleging her former colleague had inappropriately touched her in 2020. Stoker confirmed in a statement on Thursday evening that she had alleged Van had \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d her at a social event in November 2020 by squeezing her bottom twice, prompting Dutton\u2019s decision. Van has denied all allegations made this week against him. Stoker said the alleged incident with Van \u201cwas not appropriate conduct in a workplace \u2026 it was unprofessional and uninvited\u201d. She said she \u201cdealt with it as you\u2019d expect any woman would in a senior position\u201d by following up on it with a senior colleague and dealing with the matter privately instead of going to the media. \u201cIt was important to me that others were safe, especially staff. Senator Van apologised and said I could be confident he wouldn\u2019t behave that way in future \u2026 I accepted his apology. I got on with the job,\u201d she said. Stoker said Van was right to say the pair \u201cburied the hatchet\u201d at the time and moved on with the alleged incident but she was provoked to go public after being approached by journalists on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not out to make this a bigger deal than it is, I\u2019m not scarred for life, and I\u2019m not out to get anyone. I never wanted this to be public, but I\u2019m not about to cover it up,\u201d she said, adding the fact Van had since denied the allegations \u201ctells [her] something\u201d. \u201cIt tells me that speaking up was the right thing to do. After all, the standard we walk past is the standard we accept.\u201d In the Senate on Friday, Thorpe thanked supporters for messages she had received since making her allegations in the Senate, and spoke about why some survivors of violence do not wish to report their claims to police. Van has vehemently denied Thorpe\u2019s allegations, which he described as false, and called for an investigation into them, which he said he would cooperate with. \u201cNothing [Thorpe] has alleged about me is truthful. No such exchange occurred between us. There is no interaction that could conceivably resemble what she described today,\u201d he said. Van said he recalled a conversation with Stoker, but not the behaviour she described. \u201cI said I had no recollection of the events at all and said, you know, it was not something I would do, but you have to respect colleagues if they feel like something has happened. I support them, we remained friends from that day since,\u201d he said. After Dutton\u2019s comments about further allegations, Van released a statement on Friday saying he would cooperate with any investigation. \u201cI am utterly shattered by the events of the past days and stunned that my good reputation can be so wantonly savaged without due process or accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cI will fully cooperate with whatever process Mr Dutton proposes to determine these matters as quickly and fairly as possible. \u201cWhile I understand the public interest is high, I will not be making any more public statements on the allegations until a proper examination of these claims is concluded.\u201d Van has said he believed it was unfair he had been removed from the Liberal party room. Dutton said he was not making any judgment on the veracity of the allegations, but he believed he had made the right decision. Dutton has referred the matter to the parliamentary workplace support services, which was set up after the inquiry by the former sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins carried out following widespread allegations of sexual harassment and assault were raised in parliament house in 2021.

Rafael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was inspecting the state of Europe\u2019s largest nuclear plant following last week\u2019s breach in the Kakhovka dam downstream on the Dnipro River. He said IAEA inspectors would remain at the site. \u201cWhat is essential for the safety of this plant is that the water that you see behind me stays at that level,\u201d Grossi said in two tweets issued from near the station, including next to a pond that supplies water for cooling. \u201cWith the water that is here the plant can be kept safe for some time. The plant is going to be working to replenish the water so that safety functions can continue normally.\u201d Grossi said the visit, his third to the plant in southern Ukraine since Russian forces occupied it in the first days of their February 2022 invasion, had gathered \u201ca good amount of information for an assessment\u201d. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling near the plant, endangering its safe operation. The station\u2019s six reactors are now in shutdown. An IAEA spokesperson said gunfire briefly halted Grossi\u2019s convoy as it headed back to Ukrainian-held territory after the visit, but the delegation was in no immediate danger. A Russian energy industry official was earlier cited by Tass news agency as accusing Ukraine of opening fire at the convoy. Earlier in the day, Grossi said it was unrealistic to expect Moscow and Kyiv to sign a document on the site\u2019s security while fighting raged nearby. The Kakhovka reservoir was normally used to refill the cooling pond adjacent to the plant but cannot do so now because of its falling water level after the breach, officials say. Instead, the pond, which is separated from the reservoir, can be replenished using deep underground wells, they say. Grossi was earlier quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the situation at the site was \u201cserious\u201d. \u201cOn the one hand, we can see that the situation is serious, the consequences [of the dam\u2019s destruction] are there, and they are real,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, there are measures that are being taken to stabilise the situation.\u201d Grossi\u2019s trip was delayed by a day for security reasons amid heavy fighting. Russian forces captured both the nuclear plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam shortly after President Vladimir Putin sent them into Ukraine in February 2022. Grossi has repeatedly called for an end to fighting in the vicinity of the facility to avoid any catastrophic accidents. Power lines have been repeatedly cut. There are diesel generators at the plant, which also has alternative water sources.

Shortly before noon a semi-truck collided with a bus carrying mostly seniors, en route to a local casino. The crash happened near the community of Carberry on Thursday, 100 miles (160km) west of Winnipeg. The drivers of both vehicles survived and are currently in hospital. \u201cThis incident does have echoes of the tragic collision that happened in Humboldt, Saskatchewan, and we are very much aware of that.

In the coming months, the Andrews government will announce a suite of measures to boost housing supply, which could include changes to planning laws to fast-track approvals and limit the powers of councils to object to major developments. But it could hit a roadblock in the upper house, where Labor relies on the support of the Greens and two other crossbenchers to pass legislation. The Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, has written to the premier, Daniel Andrews, saying Labor must introduce a mandatory inclusionary zoning scheme, which would involve 50% of homes in new developments being either public or affordable, in order to secure the minor party\u2019s support. She is also continuing to push for a statewide two-year rent freeze. \u201cWhile we remain unconvinced that the existing planning laws and the role local councils play in implementing these laws, in and of themselves, are the cause of the housing crisis, we wish to work constructively with the government to address the housing catastrophe engulfing Victorians,\u201d Ratnam\u2019s letter reads. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cIn order for the Greens to be in a position to consider supporting any changes to the state\u2019s planning laws, the reforms must demonstrate that they meaningfully address housing affordability, and are not merely a free ride for the property industry.\u201d Ratnam told Guardian Australia that developers would not provide public or affordable housing in their projects without government intervention. She pointed to the Arden urban renewal precinct in North Melbourne, where there are plans for a development to house 15,000 people but there are no requirements for public or affordable housing. The social and affordable housing element of the Gasworks project in Fitzroy has also recently been \u201cpaused\u201d. \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t have the interventions from the government that we should have had, including building more public and affordable homes. It\u2019s left to the market, it\u2019s left to developers who are motivated by making more profits,\u201d Ratnam said. Mandatory inclusionary zoning has already has been implemented, in varying capacities, in South Australia, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. In South Australia, 15% of new dwellings in all significant development projects must be affordable, including at least 5% for high-needs groups. Earlier this week, the Council to Homeless Persons proposed every new property development in Victoria should include a mandatory quota of social housing. The powerful Property Council of Australia balked at the idea, describing it as a \u201ctax\u201d that could affect housing affordability. Support for such a scheme is also growing within the Victorian Labor party, which will hold its state conference this weekend. Among the 109 motions, known as \u201curgency resolutions\u201d, to be debated is one that calls for the introduction of mandatory inclusionary zoning for all residential developments of three or more dwellings. Under the proposal, developers would either have to provide land or stock to the government, or pay a levy on the value of their developments, to \u201ccreate an enduring funding stream for social housing\u201d. Another resolution calls for a cap on the number of nights each year an owner can rent out a property as short stay accommodation, while recommending to national conference that it \u201cremove negative gearing tax arrangements\u201d for properties used for such a purpose. A Labor source said the motions may be changed or dropped before the weekend, as factions and unions negotiate over proposals. But they anticipated most housing-related motions would be \u201cbroadly supported\u201d. The state conference will be the first since 2019, before the federal intervention into the party after allegations of branch stacking.

The amount, over four kilos, was enough to kill the entire city\u2019s population three times over, the governor\u2019s office announced on Thursday. The seizures were made by California highway patrol (CHP) officers and are a part of Gavin Newsom\u2019s plan to address the spread of fentanyl, blight and public safety in the city where 268 people died from accidental overdoses in the first four months of 2023, according to a report from the city\u2019s medical examiner. All of the fentanyl was found in and around San Francisco\u2019s historic and long-embattled Tenderloin neighborhood. In late April, after a deluge of criticism over the city and state\u2019s response to the local fentanyl and homelessness crises, Gavin Newsom announced that the CHP, the state national guard and the attorney general\u2019s office will aid San Francisco\u2019s law enforcement to \u201cfocus on targeting fentanyl trafficking, disrupting the supply of the deadly drug in the city, and holding the operators of drug trafficking rings accountable\u201d, the 28 April press release read. Newsom and some local officials, though, have shot down community-led harm-reduction initiatives. The city\u2019s supervisors have pushed to replace the Tenderloin Center, which was designed as a temporary harm-reduction measure, with 12 smaller \u201cwellness hubs\u201d around the city. These would provide health and shelter services, as well as allowing supervised drug use to prevent overdose deaths. But last summer, Newsom vetoed legislation that would have allowed supervised drug-use centers in three California cities, including San Francisco. And the plan for the wellness hubs stalled after San Francisco\u2019s city attorney raised the objection that the city could wind up bearing significant legal liability. Non-profits are now seeking a way to fund the overdose-prevention portions of their operations without city funding. The Tenderloin, which comprises roughly 50 square blocks, most built just after the 1906 earthquake, has become the national face of the coinciding crises of addiction, gross income inequality and a statewide housing shortage. And while the headlines that come out of the city are jarring, it is far from the only place where opioid addiction has led to cycles of death and despair. Across the state, one in five deaths of California\u2019s teenagers and young adults (ages 15-24) are tied to fentanyl. Drug overdoses now kill two to three times as many people in the state as car accidents, according to data compiled by the consulting group California Health Policy Strategies. Since 2017, the number of deaths related to the synthetic opioid, which is 50 times stronger than heroin, has increased by 1,027%. The crisis, which has visibly unfolded in cities across the US, has sent officials scrambling for solutions. In addition to the boost in law enforcement, Newsom allocated an additional $172m for a project distributing naloxone, an overdose medication."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ab", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/live/2023/jun/15/supreme-court-decisions-student-loans-trump-news-politics-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "law", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Second Trump defamation trial brought by E Jean Carroll scheduled for January 2024 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Date set for $10m lawsuit brought by the New York writer who previously was awarded $5m for verdict against ex-president", "author": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong (now) and Chris Stein (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 23:08:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113361", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6c91599d2eda1a05f70c299dc50c15bbce0307/0_0_2958_1775/500.jpg", "body": "Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: A federal judge set a date for a second defamation trial brought by E Jean Carroll, the New York writer who last month won a $5m jury verdict against Donald Trump for sexual abuse and defamation. US district judge Lewis Kaplan signed an order on Thursday scheduling the trial for 15 January 2024, \u201cunless this case has previously been entirely disposed of\u201d. US district judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over Donald Trump\u2019s latest criminal case, issued her first order since the former president\u2019s arraignment earlier this week. Cannon has ordered defense attorneys to contact the justice department to expedite the process of obtaining security clearances, suggesting that, for now, she may be interested in moving the proceedings along without delay. The supreme court ruled that Native American children can continue to be protected under federal law against being removed from their tribal communities for fostering or adoption, rejecting a petition from a white couple who argued that the provision was a form of racial discrimination. The supreme court\u2019s decision upholds decades of federal law that gives Native Americans and tribal members preference in the adoption or foster care of Native American children. The supreme court\u2019s decision was supported by Native Americans, tribal leaders and top Democrats. Following the announcement of the court\u2019s 7-2 decision, several tribal leaders commended the supreme court\u2019s ruling, calling it a \u201cmajor victory for Native tribes, children and the future of our culture and heritage\u201d. Former New York mayor Bill de Blasio was ordered to pay $475,000 for misusing public funds on a police security detail during his failed 2020 presidential bid. De Blasio \u201cplainly violated\u201d the city\u2019s prohibition on using public resources to advance a political campaign, the chair of New York\u2019s conflicts of interest board said. The fine is the largest ever handed out by the board. The mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Suarez will be an outsider in a crowded field dominated by two other Florida men: Donald Trump, the twice-indicted former president, and Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor. Jack Teixeira, the 21-year-old US airman accused of leaking confidential intelligence and defense documents online, was indicted by a federal grand jury, the Department of Justice said on Thursday. Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, has been charged with six counts of willful retention and transmission of classified information relating to national defense, the justice department said. Texas governor Greg Abbott\u2019s decision to bus migrants to Los Angeles this week has been decried as a \u201cdespicable stunt\u201d, as advocates in California reported that the group was not offered food during the 23-hour trip. Abbott has faced increasing scrutiny for his bussing program over the last year, which immigrants\u2019 rights groups have said can be exploitative and cruel. The Senate confirmed the former American Civil Liberties Union attorney Nusrat Jahan Choudhury as the first Muslim woman to serve as a federal judge on Thursday. Choudhury, 46, is also the first Bangladeshi American to serve in this lifetime position. She will serve as a judge on the US court for the eastern district of New York. Race has emerged as a central issue in the 2024 Republican presidential race, with the GOP\u2019s primary field featuring five candidates of color: Miami mayor Francis Suarez, South Carolina senator Tim Scott, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and radio host Larry Elder. The candidates of color are considered underdogs in the field currently dominated by Donald Trump and Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis. But AP reports that the Republican party\u2019s increasingly diverse leadership suggests it may have a real opportunity in 2024 to further weaken the Democrats\u2019 grip on African Americans and Latinos. It writes: Those groups have been among the most loyal segments of the Democratic coalition since Republican leaders fought against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Republican presidential contenders of 2024 walk a fine line when addressing race with the GOP\u2019s overwhelmingly white primary electorate. In most cases, the diverse candidates in the Republican field play down the significance of their racial heritage. They all deny the existence of systemic racism in the United States even while discussing their own personal experience with racial discrimination. They oppose policies around policing, voting rights and education that are designed to benefit disadvantaged communities and combat structural racism. Donald Trump\u2019s insistence on holding on to the contents of his boxes \u2013 and demanding them to be returned \u2013 is typical of the former president\u2019s behavior, according to a report. During his time in the White House, Trump\u2019s aide referred to the boxes of documents he kept close as the \u201cbeautiful mind\u201d material, the New York Times reports. It says: Starting in the early months of his administration, Mr. Trump began using a cardboard box to bring papers and documents from the West Wing up to the residence at the end of the day. In the White House, according to two people familiar with the practice, Mr. Trump was generally able to identify what was in the boxes most immediately around him. One of those people said he was \u201cmeticulous\u201d in putting things in specific boxes \u2014 notwithstanding a picture released by the Justice Department showing classified documents spilled on the floor of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly after John F. Kelly took over as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff in July 2017, Mr. Kelly and other aides grew concerned that some documents were likely presidential records and might go missing if they were kept in the residence. They impressed upon Mr. Trump that the papers had to be tracked, but he was not especially interested, the people said. Aides started examining the boxes to check for presidential records, but Mr. Trump still found ways to bring items to the residence. And the boxes began to multiply. He could point to specific boxes that he wanted to take with him on Air Force One when he was traveling, and decline to take others, appearing aware of the contents inside the boxes he chose, both officials said. Trump has claimed that he \u201chadn\u2019t had a chance to go through all the boxes\u201d as an explanation for why he failed to return the classified documents. \u201cIt\u2019s a long tedious job. Takes a long time, which I was prepared to do, but I have a very busy life,\u201d he told his supporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Former New York mayor Bill de Blasio has been ordered to pay $475,000 for misusing public funds on a police security detail during his failed 2020 presidential bid. The fine by New York\u2019s conflicts of interest board \u2013 which de Blasio is challenging in court \u2013 is the largest ever handed out by the board, and comes after a years-long investigation into his use of taxpayer money to cover travel costs of NYPD officers who accompanied him on 31 out-of-state campaign trips. De Blasio \u201cplainly violated\u201d the city\u2019s prohibition on using public resources to advance a political campaign, according to the board\u2019s chair, Milton Williams. Lawyers for de Blasio described the ruling as \u201creckless and arbitrary\u201d, arguing that recent \u201cunprecedented threats of political violence\u201d underscored the security needs of public servants. De Blasio has previously faced allegations of misusing his security detail. Under today\u2019s ruling he will be forced to reimburse the city for $320,000 for the expenses the NYPD incurred, as well as a $155,000 fine. Donald Trump has just taken to Truth Social to demand that all charges against him be dropped and for \u201ceverything that was illegally taken\u201d from his home to be returned. The post reads: So now that everyone understands that the Presidential Records Act, plus the Clinton socks case, totally exonerated me from the continuing witch hunt brought on by corrupt Joe Biden, the DoJ, deranged Jack Smith, and their radical left, Marxist thugs, when are they going to drop all charges against me, apologize, and return everything that was illegally taken (Fourth Amendment) from my home? This was nothing other than election interference!! Jack Teixeira, the 21-year-old US airman accused of leaking confidential intelligence and defense documents online, has been indicted by a federal grand jury, the Department of Justice said on Thursday. Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, has been charged with six counts of wilful retention and transmission of classified information relating to national defense, the justice department said. A federal judge has set a date for a second defamation trial brought by E Jean Carroll, the New York writer who last month won a $5m jury verdict against Donald Trump for sexual abuse and defamation. US district judge Lewis Kaplan signed an order scheduling the trial for 15 January 2024, \u201cunless this case has previously been entirely disposed of\u201d. It comes after a ruling earlier this week allowing Carroll to pursue her $10m defamation case against the former US president that was filed following the publication of her 2019 book in which she accused Trump of rape and his claim she was lying. Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s schedule of legal proceedings, according to Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney: Texas governor Greg Abbott\u2019s decision to bus migrants to Los Angeles this week has been decried as a \u201cdespicable stunt\u201d, as advocates in California reported that the group was not offered food during the 23-hour trip. On Wednesday, 42 migrants, including 15 youth and three babies, arrived at Union Station in downtown LA, said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, the communications director for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights-Los Angeles (Chirla), who met the group when they arrived. The travelers he spoke to came from Venezuela, Honduras, Guatemala and Haiti, and one came from China, he said, adding some told him they had been on the bus for nearly a day without any food or drink. Abbott tweeted that it was the \u201c1st bus of migrants\u201d arriving in LA, claiming Texas border towns \u201cremain overrun &amp; overwhelmed because Biden refuses to secure the border\u201d. Recent reports, however, have found that the number of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border is at its lowest levels since the start of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Abbott has faced increasing scrutiny for his bussing program over the last year, which has reportedly sent tens of thousands of migrants to Democratic-run cities, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington. Immigrants\u2019 rights groups have said the practice can be exploitative and cruel, noting last year that one bus Abbott sent to Philadelphia had a 10-year-old girl on it who had to be hospitalized from dehydration and a high fever. Last month, the governor sent buses to vice-president Kamala Harris\u2019s residence in Washington. Read the full story by my colleague Sam Levin here: This first order by Aileen Cannon, the Florida district judge assigned to oversee Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case, suggests she may be interested in moving the proceedings along without delay. Cannon was appointed to the federal bench by the former president three years ago, and gave him a favorable ruling at an earlier hearing last year. But she was later rebuked by an appeals court panel for granting Trump\u2019s request for an independent special master to review the documents. That action slowed the justice department\u2019s investigation and prompted questions over her impartiality. There is no certainty she will remain on the case. But while she is the assigned jurist, Cannon will have broad authority to control almost every aspect, including which evidence is admissible, the ability to slow down or speed up proceedings, and even the legal viability of the justice department\u2019s case. My colleague Richard Luscombe has a handy explainer on Who is Aileen Cannon, the judge assigned in Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago case? US district judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over Donald Trump\u2019s latest criminal case, has issued her first order since the former president\u2019s arraignment earlier this week. Cannon ordered defense attorneys to contact the Justice department to expedite the process of obtaining security clearances. The order reads: On or before June 16, 2023, all attorneys of record and forthcoming attorneys of record shall contact the Litigation Security Group of the U.S. Department of Justice, if they have not done so already, to expedite the necessary clearance process for all team members anticipated to participate in this matter. Joe Biden\u2019s re-election bid has won the support of four major American environmental groups, who say he\u2019s done more to fight climate change than any other president. The endorsement from the Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters Action Fund, NextGen Pac, and NRDC Action Fund marks the first time the four groups have jointly endorsed a presidential candidate. \u201cPresident Biden has acted courageously during a critical inflection point in the climate fight,\u201d Sierra club national executive director Ben Jealous said in a statement. \u201cNo other administration has done more to move us forward. The stakes could not be higher and the choice could not be more clear. We need President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris back in the White House for another four years.\u201d President and CEO of the NRDC Manish Bapna warned, \u201cA GOP presidency would throw the country\u2019s hard-won climate gains into hard reverse, condemning our children to cascading crises of climate, nature, and inequity. We cannot allow that to happen.\u201d \u201cFor everyone who grasps the stakes in this existential fight, Joe Biden is the clear choice for 2024. We\u2019re counting on him to take the climate fight to the next level in a second term \u2014 and he can count on our support,\u201d Bapna said. White House chief of staff Jeff Zients is cheering the Senate\u2019s confirmation of Joe Biden\u2019s judicial nominees. It\u2019s been a priority for the president ever since he took office, and has become even more so since Democrats lost control of the House, and their ability to pass Biden\u2019s agenda: The latest heading to the bench is Nusrat Choudhury, the first Muslim woman to serve as a federal judge, and the first Bangladeshi American: House Democrats will attempt a rarely deployed parliamentary tactic to force a vote on a bill protecting abortion rights, Axios reports. Democrats will next week file a discharge petition on the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, a bill the chamber has approved in prior congresses when Democrats have controlled the House, but which has attracted no Republican support. The GOP currently controls the House in the current Congress and has shown no willingness to bring the proposal up for a vote, and the discharge petition would force them to do so \u2013 but only if it is in signed by all Democrats and at least five Republicans. Axios reports that the absence of any Republican defectors means the tactic is unlikely to succeed, and is more about keeping the pressure on the GOP after a midterm election in which the party\u2019s candidates underperformed, in part due to voter anger over the end of Roe v Wade. Democrats have increasingly turned to discharge petitions as part of their strategy now that they\u2019re in the minority in the House. Earlier this week, they filed petitions on two bills dealing with gun control issues, which Republicans have thus far ignored. There are those who would call Donald Trump a cult leader, but don\u2019t count former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin among them, the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly reports: The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin courted controversy when she denied that supporters of Donald Trump behaved like cult members. Palin\u2019s attempt to deny that Trump has a cultlike following, however, prompted predictable pushback on social media by those who thought her attempt to define a cult actually precisely described Trump\u2019s enthusiastic fan base. \u201cThe definition of a cult,\u201d Palin told the rightwing network Newsmax, \u201cis a group of people who are excessively supporting one another and a cause. [It\u2019s] all about conformity and compliance and intolerance of anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with what their mission is. Say what you will about Donald Trump, but he knows how to please a crowd, and that skill was on display on Tuesday when, following his arraignment at Miami\u2019s federal courthouse, he headed to famous Cuban restaurant Versailles. \u201cFood for everyone!\u201d he declared to a crowd of admirers after walking in. But as the Miami New Times reports, it was a promise the former president did not keep: So, New Times wondered, did Trump \u2014 who famously fancies his chicken from KFC and his steaks well-done and slathered with ketchup but isn\u2019t exactly known for picking up the check \u2014 treat his fan club to a spread of croquetas, pastelitos, and cubanos chased with cafecitos? It turns out no one got anything. Not even a cafecito to-go. A knowledgeable source assures New Times that Donald Trump\u2019s stop at Versailles totaled about ten minutes, leaving no time for anyone to eat anything, much less place an order. Of course, with a long campaign ahead of him \u2014 possibly punctuated with additional South Florida court appearances \u2014 Trump will have plenty of opportunities to make good on Tuesday\u2019s promise. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Republican senator Marco Rubio fretted that special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment of Donald Trump will just mean more vitriol directed at the FBI and justice department. But of course, most of those attacks are coming from Rubio\u2019s fellow Republicans. Listen to the Florida lawmaker\u2019s interview here: In other 2024 news, former president Barack Obama has weighed in on Republican presidential contender Tim Scott\u2019s approach to racism and systemic inequality in America. Scott, the lone Black Republican in the Senate, has downplayed the impact of systemic racism in the country. Obama pushed back on that: This is what it\u2019s like to be a Republican presidential candidate today. You throw your hat into the ring, only to find yourself immediately set upon by Donald Trump\u2019s surrogates. Miami mayor Francis Suarez found this out when Carlos Gimenez, a Republican lawmaker representing Miami\u2019s suburbs in the House, went on Fox News to denounce him: As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Trump-aligned Super Pac Maga Inc is circulating an email titled \u201cWhat Conservatives Need To Know About Francis Suarez,\u201d which includes the line, \u201cFrancis Suarez represents everything wrong with swampy, RINO politics.\u201d Quite the welcome for Suarez to the 2024 field. The mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, is due to make a speech at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California, later today as he launches his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Suarez officially launched his campaign with a video released this morning, alongside the caption: My dad taught me that you get to choose your battles, and I am choosing the biggest one of my life. I\u2019m running for president. Suarez will be an outsider in a crowded field dominated by two other Florida men: Donald Trump, the twice indicted former president, and Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor. Trump leads most polling averages by more than 30 points. The former vice-president Mike Pence leads the rest of the pack, way back. The New York Times noted an ad buy in early voting states charging Biden with failing to control crime. The paper also referenced an FBI investigation that could damage Suarez\u2019s run. The Times said: Mr Suarez is little known outside his state, and he is facing emerging allegations of influence-peddling on behalf of a real estate development company. The editorial board of the Miami Herald said \u201c$10,000 monthly payments [Suarez] received from a developer for consulting work \u2013 while serving as mayor\u201d, while \u201csmall potatoes compared to Trump\u2019s legal problems \u2026 look like a conflict of interest\u201d. The board added: Is being president really Suarez\u2019s goal? Here\u2019s more on Suarez\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign launch. The Republican Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, has called on the Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, to \u201cstop pussyfooting around\u201d on whether he is going to run for president in 2024. DeSantis, at a press conference in Fort Pierce, Florida, suggested Newsom had \u201creal serious fixation on the state of Florida\u201d while he had his own \u201chuge problems\u201d in California. He said: What I would tell him is, you know what? Stop pussyfooting around. He added: Are you going to throw your hat in the ring and challenge Joe? Are you going to do it? Or are you going to sit on the sidelines and chirp? Why don\u2019t you throw your hat in the ring, and then we\u2019ll go ahead and talk about what\u2019s happening. DeSantis\u2019 remarks came after Newsom said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that he would debate the Florida governor in a forum moderated by Hannity. \u201cI\u2019m all in. Count on it,\u201d Newsom said in the interview, aired on Monday. \u201cYou would do a two-hour debate with Ron DeSantis?\u201d Hannity asked. \u201cMake it three,\u201d Newsom replied, adding: I would do it one day\u2019s notice with no notes. I look forward to that. In the same interview, the California governor insisted he did not intend to challenge Biden to the Democratic presidential nomination next year. Kamala Harris has released a statement supporting the supreme court\u2019s decision upholding the Indian Child Welfare Act. In the statement, the vice president said the decision was a \u201cvictory for Tribal sovereignty and Native communities\u201d. She added: For centuries, Native children were torn away from their families and their communities. These acts were not only violations of the basic human rights of those children and their families but also an attack on the very existence of Tribal Nations. The Indian Child Welfare Act \u2013 or ICWA -was passed to address this systemic injustice. As District Attorney of San Francisco, I represented children and families in ICWA cases. As Attorney General of California, I partnered with Tribal leaders, child welfare agencies, and law enforcement officials to enforce ICWA. So I have seen firsthand how essential this law is to the safety and wellbeing of Native children. Harris said she and Joe Biden would \u201ccontinue to fight to protect Native families, children, and communities\u201d, and to \u201cstand with Tribal Nations in defense of Tribal sovereignty\u201d. The supreme court\u2019s liberals together with most of its conservative majority united to reject a challenge to the Indian Child Welfare Act, which protects Native American children from being removed from their tribal communities for fostering or adoption. While the decision was a win for indigenous rights and the Biden administration, the nation\u2019s highest court has plenty of high-stakes decisions left to make in its term, including cases dealing with affirmative action, Joe Biden\u2019s student loan relief plan and congressional redistricting. Those could be among the verdicts released tomorrow at 10am eastern time, when the court will announce more decisions. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Donald Trump hired a lawyer who tried to convince him to negotiate with the justice department over the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago, but the former president declined to do so, according to a report. The Senate\u2019s Republican leader Mitch McConnell expressed hope the court would stop Biden\u2019s attempt to relieve federal student loan debt. Interior secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary, welcomed the supreme court\u2019s upholding of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Deb Haaland is a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, and made history as the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary when she was confirmed to lead the interior department under Joe Biden. Haaland was also among the petitioners in Haaland v Brackeen, the just-decided supreme court case upholding the Indian Child Welfare Act. Here\u2019s what she had to say about the decision: One of the major outstanding cases before the supreme court is a challenge to Joe Biden\u2019s plan to relieve some federal student loan debt. The plan is currently on hold due to a court ruling, and opposed by most Republican and a few Democratic lawmakers. On the Senate floor today, Mitch McConnell, the chamber\u2019s powerful Republican minority leader, expressed hope that the court would soon issue a ruling stopping the plan for good: In the coming days, the Supreme Court will rule on President Biden\u2019s plan to impose student loan socialism on millions of working families across America. The Court\u2019s decision will settle whether the President is allowed to use two-decade-old\u2019\u201cemergency\u2019 authorities dating back to the early days of the War on Terror to put $430 billion in debt on the American taxpayer\u2019s tab without Congressional approval. But the American people don\u2019t need to wait for the Supreme Court to explain to them why letting wealthy people dine and dash doesn\u2019t make sense. They know the Biden Administration\u2019s plan adds up to a raw deal. He concluded his remarks: \u201cThe Biden Administration\u2019s student loan socialism plan is painfully unfair. And very soon, we\u2019ll find out if it isn\u2019t just downright illegal.\u201d The Senate\u2019s Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also hailed the supreme court\u2019s decision upholding the Indian Child Welfare Act. \u201cThe Indian Child Welfare Act has been the law of the land for decades and today the Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional right of tribal sovereignty,\u201d the New York lawmaker said in a statement. \u201cFor hundreds of years, indigenous communities have fought for their very existence, and today is nothing short of a momentous day that ensures that indigenous children maintain a connection to their culture.\u201d Joe Biden has released a statement of strong support for the supreme court\u2019s decision upholding the Indian Child Welfare Act. Here\u2019s what the president has to say: I stand alongside Tribal Nations as they celebrate today\u2019s Supreme Court decision. This lawsuit sought to undermine the Indian Child Welfare Act \u2013 a vital law I was proud to support. The Indian Child Welfare Act was passed to protect the future of Tribal Nations and promote the best interests of Native children, and it does just that. The touchstone law respects tribal sovereignty and protects Native children by helping Native families stay together and, whenever possible, keeping children with their extended families or community who already know them, love them, and can help them understand who they are as Native people and citizens of their Tribal Nations. The Indian Child Welfare Act safeguards that which is most precious to us all \u2014 our children. Today\u2019s decision from the Supreme Court keeps in place a vital protection for tribal sovereignty and Native children. Our Nation\u2019s painful history looms large over today\u2019s decision. In the not-so-distant past, Native children were stolen from the arms of the people who loved them. They were sent to boarding schools or to be raised by non-Indian families \u2014 all with the aim of erasing who they are as Native people and tribal citizens. These were acts of unspeakable cruelty that affected generations of Native children and threatened the very survival of Tribal Nations. The Indian Child Welfare Act was our Nation\u2019s promise: never again. Tribal Nations fought hard to pass the Indian Child Welfare Act, and I am proud to have joined them in the ongoing efforts to defend it. Vice President Harris and I will continue to stand with Tribes to protect Native children, honor tribal sovereignty, and safeguard the essential principals of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Supreme court justice Neil Gorsuch is among the court\u2019s conservative majority, and has lent his support to opinions overturning Roe v Wade, expanding the ability to carry a concealed weapon, and other rightwing priorities. But, in an example of the nuances to these justices\u2019 legal philosophies, Gorsuch has shown a surprising amount of support for Native American tribes when issues concerning them have come before the court. Here\u2019s Slate, with more on that: Here\u2019s more from NBC News on the split between conservative justices that led to the court upholding protections for Native American children, and how that could signal the court\u2019s mood as it weighs the fate of affirmative action. Today\u2019s decision concerning the Indian Child Welfare Act was authored by conservative Amy Coney Barrett, and joined by the court\u2019s three liberals and three of its conservatives \u2013 the exceptions being Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who dissented: Here\u2019s the reaction to the supreme court\u2019s upholding of the Indian Child Welfare Act from Chuck Hoskin Jr, principal chief of America\u2019s largest tribe, the Cherokee Nation: That\u2019s all for today\u2019s supreme court decisions, but the justices will issue more tomorrow, at 10am eastern time. As usual, we won\u2019t know what they are until they come out, but the court still has to release opinions in cases impacting congressional redistricting, affirmative action, and Joe Biden\u2019s student loan relief plan. Besides upholding a law that protected Native American children, the court issued two other opinions. The justices found that bankruptcy code takes precedence over tribal sovereignty, and that a defendant can be retried if the first proceedings took place in the wrong venue before a jury drawn from an incorrect pool. Last year, the Guardian\u2019s Cecilia Nowell took a deep dive into the Indian Child Welfare Act, which the supreme court just upheld. Here\u2019s more about what the law does, and why it was challenged: When Kimora Toledo was a little girl, she and her mother Malisha would make the hour-long drive from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Jemez Pueblo at least once a month. Malisha, who is from Jemez and Tesuque Pueblos, had moved her family to Albuquerque for a better job, but her father was a Jemez medicine man and it was important to her that Kimora be immersed in that heritage. On one of those visits to Jemez, Malisha remembers dancing alongside Kimora \u2013 who\u2019s Jemez, Tesuque, Din\u00e9 and Black \u2013 during the feast day celebrations. She hoped it would be the first of many times they\u2019d dance together. But Malisha battled a criminal record and her ex, Kimora\u2019s father, managed to gain custody over Kimora and her younger brother. The two children would spend several years living at their dad\u2019s house in Albuquerque, without those monthly visits to the pueblo. When Kimora was 11, the New Mexico children, youth and families department removed her from her father\u2019s home over abuse she was experiencing. Kimora would spend the next three years in and out of group homes and rehabilitation centers, eventually landing in foster care when she asked not to be returned to her father\u2019s. Kimora had never felt more disconnected from her culture and traditional ways of healing. Her foster mother, a Mexican woman, suggested Kimora take Spanish as an elective in school. But Kimora desperately missed her mother and grandfather, and the language they\u2019d spoken during her childhood. \u201cI missed a lot of my childhood and our traditions,\u201d she said, just weeks before her seventeenth birthday. The supreme court has turned down a challenge to a law that keeps Native American children in their communities for fostering and adoption. Here\u2019s more on the decision, from the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington: The US supreme court has ruled that Native American children can continue to be protected under federal law against being removed from their tribal communities for fostering or adoption, rejecting a petition from a white couple who argued that the provision was a form of racial discrimination. The supreme court\u2019s decision in a case that ultimately pitched the Brackeen family of Texas against the interior secretary, Deb Haaland, for the US government, amounts to a victory for hundreds of tribal groups. They had united to call for a retention of the law which requires Native children to be placed as a priority within their own extended families, tribes or other Native communities. They argued that the status quo was essential for the survival of tribes themselves. The decision preserves the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). Since it was enacted in 1978 the law has helped stabilize Native American families and uphold tribal sovereignty. We\u2019re a few minutes away from 10am eastern time, when the supreme court is slated to begin releasing its latest batch of decisions. We won\u2019t know which decisions they release until they are out, but there are 21 cases left to decide, including closely watched petitions dealing with affirmative action, congressional redistricting and Joe Biden\u2019s plan to relieve some student loan debt \u2013 all issues the court\u2019s conservative majority could decide to majorly change. Follow along here as the decisions are released. As Donald Trump\u2019s legal troubles continue, Republican presidential candidates are now under pressure to commit to pardoning him if they win the White House \u2013 including his former vice-president-turned-critic, Mike Pence. Here\u2019s more, from the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly: Mike Pence is \u201cfine with Donald Trump being put in prison\u201d which is \u201cpretty disrespectful\u201d given he was Trump\u2019s vice-president, a rightwing radio host told Pence in a testy exchange. Pence was Trump\u2019s vice-president when Trump sent a mob to the US Capitol on January 6, in an attempt to block certification of the 2020 election. Trump did little to call off the mob when it placed Pence in danger, some chanting for him to be hanged. Trump could yet be indicted for his election subversion but Pence\u2019s exchange with Clay Travis was about a more pressing problem, the 37-count federal indictment over the handling of classified records to which Trump pleaded not guilty this week. Earlier this week, Americans watched as Donald Trump appeared in federal court to answer the first-ever indictment brought against a former president. But it all might have been avoided if he had taken the advice of one of the attorneys he hired after the FBI retrieved boxes of classified documents from his Mar-a-Lago property last August, the Washington Post reports. According to their story, Christopher Kise, a former Florida solicitor general Trump retained after the search of his resort last year, suggested that he approve opening under-the-radar negotiations with the justice department to resolve potential charges related to his possession of government secrets, but the former president refused. Here\u2019s more from the story: One of Donald Trump\u2019s new attorneys proposed an idea in the fall of 2022: The former president\u2019s team could try to arrange a settlement with the Justice Department. The attorney, Christopher Kise, wanted to quietly approach Justice to see if he could negotiate a settlement that would preclude charges, hoping Attorney General Merrick Garland and the department would want an exit ramp to avoid prosecuting a former president. Kise would hopefully \u201ctake the temperature down,\u201d he told others, by promising a professional approach and the return of all documents. But Trump was not interested after listening to other lawyers who urged a more pugilistic approach, so Kise never approached prosecutors, three people briefed on the matter said. A special counsel was appointed months later. Kise, a former solicitor general of Florida who was paid $3 million upfront to join Trump\u2019s team last year, declined to comment. That quiet entreaty last fall was one of many occasions when lawyers and advisers sought to get Trump to take a more cooperative stance in a bid to avoid what happened Friday. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment including more than three dozen criminal counts against Trump for allegedly keeping and hiding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Trump, 77, now faces the most legally perilous moment of his life playing out in a federal court \u2014 charges that could bring decades in prison. He pleaded not guilty in Miami on Tuesday and vowed to fight the charges. \u201cPresident Trump has consistently been in full compliance with the Presidential Records Act, which is the only law that applies to Presidents and their records,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. \u201cIn the course of negotiations over the return of the documents, President Trump told the lead DOJ official, \u2018anything you need from us, just let us know.\u2019 Sadly, the weaponized DOJ rejected this offer of cooperation and conducted an unnecessary and unconstitutional raid on the President\u2019s home in order to inflict maximum political damage on the leading presidential candidate.\u201d The supreme court could today issue a decision in a case with big implications for how legislative maps are drawn nationwide, potentially impacting the balance of power as Republicans and Democrats vie for control of Congress in the 2024 elections. The case is Moore v Harper, which comes out of North Carolina and deals with the ability of state courts to strike down congressional maps drawn by their legislatures. Here\u2019s what the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington wrote about the case, when justices heard arguments in December: Republicans from North Carolina who brought the case argue that a provision of the US constitution known as the elections clause gives state lawmakers virtually total control over the \u201ctimes, places and manner\u201d of congressional elections, including redistricting, and cuts state courts out of the process. The Republicans are advancing a concept called the \u201cindependent state legislature theory\u201d, never before adopted by the supreme court but cited approvingly by four conservative justices. The direction of questioning at Wednesday\u2019s hearing suggested that three of those conservative justices \u2013 Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas \u2013 were open to the idea of adopting the theory, despite decades of precedent from their own court dismissing it. They seemed to have the slightly more tentative backing of Brett Kavanaugh, who was part of the legal team in 2000 that assisted George W Bush through Bush v Gore, the case that in modern times put the independent state legislature theory on the map. On the other side of the argument, the three liberal-leaning justices were profoundly critical of the notion that state legislatures should be given free rein to control federal elections virtually unrestrained by state constitutions and judicial review from state courts. Questions from John Roberts suggested he might be seeking a more narrowly-drawn compromise position. Which left all eyes on Amy Coney Barrett, the third of Donald Trump\u2019s three appointees. Potentially, she might find herself casting the decisive vote. Though it gives little clue as to which side of the fence Barrett will be standing on when the ruling comes down, she did ask several probing questions of the lawyer representing North Carolina\u2019s Republicans. She said that those pushing for state legislatures to be freed up from oversight had a \u201cproblem\u201d defining their terms, and she questioned whether the theory had any bearing in legal text. But after that hearing, a twist emerged: the North Carolina supreme court reversed itself in the issue that had been brought before the US supreme court, leading to a split in the parties that brought the case over whether the issue is moot. There\u2019s speculation that the supreme court will end up not ruling on the matter at all, though some court watchers believe that, if they were going to do that, it would have happened already. It\u2019s a complicated issue that, again, could have major impacts on control of Congress, one of the most important political battles out there. Here\u2019s more from Scotusblog on the late developments in the case: The lawyers involved in a major election law case once again disagreed on Thursday about whether the Supreme Court has the power to reach a decision in the case in light of a ruling last month by the North Carolina Supreme Court in the underlying dispute. Three sets of challengers and the Biden administration, which filed a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief supporting the challengers, urged the justices to dismiss the case. But a group of Republican legislators, who prevailed in the new state supreme court ruling, insisted that the justices should go ahead and decide the case \u2013 a view shared by Common Cause, one of the group\u2019s opponents. In December, the justices heard argument in Moore v. Harper, in which a group of Republican legislators from North Carolina argued that the \u201cindependent state legislature theory\u201d \u2013 the idea that the Constitution\u2019s elections clause gives state legislatures nearly unfettered authority to regulate federal elections \u2013 barred the North Carolina Supreme Court from setting aside a congressional map adopted by the state\u2019s legislature. But late last month, the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling, holding that it does not have the power to review the challenges to the map at all. The North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s April 28 decision prompted the Supreme Court to request additional briefing on the impact of that decision. In a four-page brief filed on Thursday afternoon, the Biden administration told the justices that they should dismiss the case. The Supreme Court, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar explained, granted review to decide whether the U.S. Constitution\u2019s elections clause bars state courts from considering whether the redistricting map enacted by the North Carolina legislature violates the North Carolina constitution. The question, Prelogar continued, comes to the court in the context of the challengers\u2019 claims that the new congressional map adopted by the state legislature violated the state constitution\u2019s ban on partisan gerrymandering. But the North Carolina Supreme Court threw out those claims last month, Prelogar noted, holding that there is no role under the North Carolina constitution for state courts to consider partisan gerrymandering claims. Therefore, Prelogar reasoned, a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on the \u201cindependent state legislature\u201d theory would have no effect on the challengers\u2019 claims. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Today at 10am eastern time, the supreme court will issue a new batch of decisions in 21 cases. Last year, the court\u2019s six-justice conservative majority made clear their willingness to upend longstanding precedent by overturning Roe v Wade and allowing states to ban abortion, and handing down other rulings expanding gun access and prayer in schools. Today, the court has a similarly weighty batch of cases it could announce decisions on, including a challenge to Joe Biden\u2019s plan to relieve some federal student loan debt, and another petition urging it to end race-conscious admissions at some universities. There\u2019s no telling which decisions will actually come out, and the court has plenty of more obscure cases it\u2019s considering, too. But even if they don\u2019t issue their verdicts in those cases today, they\u2019ll have another chance soon, since they\u2019ve announced they could also issue decisions tomorrow. Whichever way it goes, we\u2019ll be covering it live here. Here\u2019s what else we expect to happen today: Miami\u2019s mayor Francis Suarez, the latest entrant to the Republican presidential race, is spending today hyping up his campaign, including with a speech in the evening at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in California. The AFL-CIO trade union federation will soon formally endorse Biden\u2019s re-election, the Wall Street Journal reports, showing that his vow to be \u201cthe most pro-union president\u201d is paying off. Republicans were the victors in last night\u2019s Congressional Baseball Game, an annual charity event."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/16/street-sexual-harassment-offences-england-and-wales-bar-set-too-high-charities-say", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bar for street sexual harassment offences in England and Wales set too high, charities say", "lead": "Open letter says burden on victims to prove intent leaves door open for perpetrators to claim they were joking", "author": "Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 23:01:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113380", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1bcecaa578318d970576f38f6fc60be2735ab26d/0_313_4328_2596/500.jpg", "body": "Proposals to tackle sexual harassment in the street in England and Wales do not go far enough because the bar for offences has been set too high, charities have warned. The Fawcett Society, Girl Guiding and Refuge are among organisations who say the requirement to prove perpetrators intended to cause alarm or distress undermines the provisions of two bills intended to protect women and girls going through parliament. Signatories, who also include UN Women UK, Barnardo\u2019s, Suzy Lamplugh Trust and White Ribbon UK have written an open letter, published on the Plan International UK website on Friday to coincide with a House of Lords debate on the protection from sex-based harassment in public bill. They write: \u201cWe believe that some of the work undertaken by government to make life safer for women and girls is being undermined by the demands set for them. In practice, the burden on victims to prove intent leaves the door open for the perpetrators to say: \u2018I only meant it as a joke.\u2019 \u201cAs charities advocating and working with women and girls, we believe the actual harm suffered by victims, rather than the intent of perpetrators, should be at the heart of legislation.\u201d The sex-based public harassment bill is a victory for campaigners who have lobbied for a change in the law for years. But they are concerned that men will be able to claim they did not have any intent to cause offence. As the bill stands, victims would have to prove that the behaviour complained of was \u201cintentional\u201d and aiming to cause \u201charassment, alarm or distress\u201d. Kathleen Spencer Chapman, head of policy, advocacy and research at Plan International UK, and Gemma Tutton, co-founder of Our Streets Now, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see all sides of the house \u2013 and the government \u2013 continue to support this bill. However, the bill places a burden on victims of public sexual harassment to evidence intent by having to prove that the perpetrator intended to cause \u2018distress or alarm\u2019. This cannot be right.\u201d Similarly, the online safety bill criminalises cyberflashing, another form of public sexual harassment, but only when the intention is either \u201csexual gratification\u201d or to cause \u201calarm, distress or humiliation\u201d. The open letter also expresses concern that the government is rowing back support for the worker protection (amendment of equality act 2010) bill, which would strengthen workplace sexual harassment laws. A government spokesperson said it was committed to supporting women and girls to feel safer both on streets and online, adding: \u201cWe disagree with the notion that there will be a burden on victims to \u2018prove\u2019 the perpetrator\u2019s intention in cases of public sexual harassment. As in any prosecution, the defendant\u2019s guilt must be proven by the crown, including mental elements such as intent.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ad", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/16/uk-government-help-winter-energy-bills-mps", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK government urged to outline plans to help with winter energy bills", "lead": "Report by cross-party MPs criticises previous \u2018lack of urgency in addressing market failures\u2019", "author": "Julia Kollewe", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 23:01:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113399", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a353f3e1fac2e35a6695a150e6663ecc4eaa37db/0_149_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "MPs have urged the government to set out its plans to protect households from high energy bills this winter as they said about 1.7 million people, including some of the most vulnerable groups, had been left waiting too long to receive previous support. The public accounts committee (PAC) said that although schemes were introduced quickly, the government \u201cdid not have the bandwidth\u201d to make sure help reached all groups in a timely fashion. The cross-party group said it had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero\u2019s (DESNZ) \u201clack of urgency in addressing the energy market failures that are leading to high energy bills for consumers\u201d. PAC\u2019s chair, Meg Hillier, said: \u201cThe surge in energy prices has caused serious difficulties and hardship for households across the UK. It is of course welcome to see government moving quickly to put in place support for both households and businesses to keep the lights on. But many of those who most needed help were kept waiting longest for it. For some households, every day left without support presented impossible choices.\u201d The committee urged the government to provide an update on its plans to ensure there is affordable energy for households this winter. Hillier said: \u201cAlmost halfway through the year, we have not yet seen plans to ensure energy affordability for the coming winter. As a matter of urgency, government must show it is clear not just on how households and businesses will be protected in any future price rises, but how to ensure resilience in the sector as a whole.\u201d About 900,000 households without a direct relationship to a domestic energy supplier, such as those in park homes or living on boats, became eligible for the energy bill support scheme only in late February, almost five months after consumers began receiving discounts on the main scheme. About 830,000 households in Northern Ireland began receiving support with their energy bills in January. By the end of April, \u00a3160m of energy support vouchers for households using traditional prepayment meters had not been redeemed. In February, DESNZ estimated support for households and businesses would cost \u00a369bn, of which \u00a316bn was paid between October and December 2022. A DESNZ spokesperson said: \u201cToday\u2019s report fails to recognise the complexities of delivering support to households without a direct relationship with a supplier \u2013 and it is right we made sure there was a robust system to help protect people against fraud before rolling it out.\u201d He said millions received help within weeks and 83% of energy bill support vouchers had now been redeemed."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/15/fowler-and-schauffele-hit-62s-at-us-open-to-etch-names-into-golfing-folklore", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fowler and Schauffele hit 62s at US Open to etch names into golfing folklore", "lead": "The American duo post 62s to set record pace at US Open and join Branden Grace as only golfers in history to achieve the feat", "author": "Ewan Murray at LA Country Club", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 22:51:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113453", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5512ee53cee9977966bd3d204e5c54e32facd7e6/0_115_4578_2747/500.jpg", "body": "Jack Nicklaus never managed it. Neither did Tiger Woods. Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Seve Ballesteros \u2026 the list goes on. Luminaries of this sport have come and gone without ever posting 62 at a US Open. On a benign afternoon in an opulent corner of Los Angeles, two players delivered the magic number within an hour of each other. La La Land, indeed. It was easy to feel a degree of sympathy for Rickie Fowler. As he celebrated the making of history, so soon after a form slump which threatened his career, Xander Schauffele appeared on the horizon. The duo lead this, the 123rd staging of the US Open, at eight under par but the bigger picture was the significant one. Only Branden Grace at the 2017 Open Championship had previously signed for 62 in a major. Fowler and Schauffele have etched their names into golfing folklore. Such roars of delight have not been heard in these parts since the Playboy Mansion was in operation behind the 14th tee. \u201cIt\u2019s not really what you expect, playing a US Open,\u201d said Schauffele. \u201cBut monkey see, monkey do. I was just chasing Rickie up the leaderboard. I was glad he was just in front of me.\u201d Schauffele was not taking matters any further than that. \u201cIt\u2019s just Thursday,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cIt\u2019s a good start.\u201d Schauffele is the world No 6. His performance comes as no real surprise. There is, however, extra significance attached to Fowler\u2019s display. For the previous two years, he was not even eligible to play in the US Open. His world ranking briefly slipped to 185th, which was remarkable given his earlier prominence in the sport. In 2014, for example, his worst finish across four majors was a tie for fifth. Fowler, who is back working with his longtime coach Butch Harmon after what looked a costly hiatus, has rediscovered his mojo. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been long and tough,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cA lot longer being in that situation than you\u2019d ever want. But it makes it so worth it having gone through that and being back where we are now. \u201cI would say we\u2019re starting to get maybe as close as we\u2019ve ever been to where I was through kind of that 2014, 2015. I\u2019ve been playing fairly consistently, but a lot of it for me is what I\u2019ve been able to get out of off weeks where I\u2019m not playing very well, still able to make the cut and kind of turn those into at least top 20s or top 10s. The last few years those were missed cuts and going home.\u201d Fowler\u2019s round included 10 birdies, with Schauffele recording eight. Both played the front side, their second nine, in 30. Caution relating to the next three rounds is probably sensible; the United States Golf Association is unlikely to take kindly to their course setup being butchered in this fashion. Revenge will be served. \u201cYou just wait until this place firms up,\u201d added Schauffele. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be nasty.\u201d A menacing cavalry has sight of the leaders. Dustin Johnson, the 2016 champion, did not miss a single fairway during his 64. From the third, Johnson reeled off five threes in a row. The only aberration on Johnson\u2019s card came at the 9th, his 18th; until then, he had aspirations of joining the 62 club. Rory McIlroy\u2019s outward nine of 30 was his lowest in his major championship career. The Northern Irishman, carrying confident demeanour once more, was also six under when taking to the 18th. Trouble beckoned for McIlroy; he seemed distracted when missing the green with a nine-iron and could move the ball only a matter of centimetres from thick rough beside the putting surface. McIlroy boomed home a bogey putt from 11ft to save a 65. This had the feeling of a key moment. Scottie Scheffler, who has endured putting woes all year, found some rhythm on the greens before signing for a 67. Bryson DeChambeau, the LIV rebel with a cause, matched Scheffler\u2019s tally. DeChambeau had been seen battering shots down the driving range for hours on end on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been hitting more golf balls than I would like to, ever,\u201d DeChambeau admitted. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what I did in 2018 that made it so repeatable and I\u2019m very close to figuring it out. It is just going to a take a little bit more time, little bit more grinding, a little more thought. \u201cI have got to come up with something unique that allows me to be super-stable through impact.\u201d It is curious that DeChambeau makes regular reference to 2018; his sole major win to date, at the US Open, came two years later. Viktor Hovland and Jon Rahm slipped in 69s. Hovland holed his second shot to the 485-yard second. Sergio Garc\u00eda is even par. Those to struggle included Tyrrell Hatton, who is four over. Justin Rose, who would ordinarily relish a US Open test, is plus six. Tommy Fleetwood dropped shots on the last two holes when en route to a 73. Adam Scott and Jason Day matched the score of Fleetwood."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6af", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/15/greg-abbott-texas-la-karen-bass-immigrant-bus", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greg Abbott decision to bus migrants to LA condemned as \u2018despicable stunt\u2019", "lead": "Los Angeles mayor says Texas governor \u2018using human beings as pawns\u2019 amid reports migrants were not given food or drink on bus", "author": "Sam Levin in Los Angeles", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 22:50:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113485", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e87c2b426202678f69739114238f830f17ca2403/0_304_8192_4915/500.jpg", "body": "Governor Greg Abbott of Texas\u2019s decision to bus migrants to Los Angeles this week has been decried as a \u201cdespicable stunt\u201d, as advocates in California reported that the group was not offered food during the 23-hour trip. On Wednesday, 42 migrants, including 15 youth and three babies, arrived at Union Station in downtown LA, said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, the communications director for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights-Los Angeles (Chirla), who met the group when they arrived. The travelers he spoke to came from Venezuela, Honduras, Guatemala and Haiti, and one came from China, he said, adding some told him they had been on the bus for nearly a day without any food or drink. Abbott tweeted that it was the \u201c1st bus of migrants\u201d arriving in LA, claiming Texas border towns \u201cremain overrun &amp; overwhelmed because Biden refuses to secure the border\u201d. Recent reports, however, have found that the number of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border is at its lowest levels since the start of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Abbott has faced increasing scrutiny for his bussing program over the last year, which has reportedly sent tens of thousands of migrants to Democratic-run cities, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington. Immigrants\u2019 rights groups have said the practice can be exploitative and cruel, noting last year that one bus Abbott sent to Philadelphia had a 10-year-old girl on it who had to be hospitalized from dehydration and a high fever. Last month, the governor sent buses to vice-president Kamala Harris\u2019s residence in Washington. LA councilmember Eunisses Hernandez said on Thursday several city agencies and nonprofits triaged the situation, offering health screenings, mental health care, connections to legal aid, assistance with family reunification and homeless services if needed. \u201cOur community organizations do this every single day, the only difference here is these migrants were used as a political stunt, transported to our city for political means,\u201d she said. \u201cThis action by the governor of Texas is a reflection of how incapable he is of running a state, of meeting a crisis head-on. It\u2019s just really pathetic. But Los Angeles is a place where we value and welcome everyone.\u201d LA mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that after she took office last year, she directed city agencies to plan for possible scenarios in which LA \u201cwas on the receiving end of a despicable stunt that Republican governors have grown so fond of\u201d. \u201cThis did not catch us off guard, nor will it intimidate us. Now, it\u2019s time to execute our plan. Our emergency management, police, fire and other departments were able to find out about the incoming arrival while the bus was on its way and were already mobilized along with non-profit partners before the bus arrived,\u201d she said. Advocates in LA transported the group to a nearby church where they were connected with services and, when possible, put in touch with family members. Some have since been transferred to San Diego or northern California, and everyone remaining in LA was getting shelter, Cabrera said. He said the group seemed exhausted but that the children were playing with each other and were well taken care of: \u201cThe governor [of Texas] will need to check his heart and his conscience. What we will do is treat migrants like the human beings they are, with dignity and respect. These individuals are seeking safe harbor, and that\u2019s the least we can do.\u201d At least one migrant told Cabrera he had a court date scheduled in New York, raising concerns about whether California was an appropriate destination for everyone on the bus. \u201cHe said, \u2018Is New York close by?\u2019\u201d The migrants have been authorized to enter the US, due to findings that they have credible fears, but have not yet been granted asylum, which will be a long process: \u201cThis will be an uphill battle for many of these folks who are hugely traumatized. So we cannot add to their trauma by acting unconscionably and cowardly.\u201d Hernandez said she learned of one hungry toddler who arrived at the church saying he had had no food or drink, but was fed and seemed to be doing well. She also learned of two arrivals who said they had no connections to the state of California. Tiffany Burrow, the director of operations for the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition, based in Texas, said her group helps coordinate transportation for migrants arriving across the US-Mexico border and had reached out in advance to advocates in LA about the arriving bus, but was not involved in the operations of this bus. Texas\u2019s emergency management division would typically coordinate this kind of trip, she said. Burrow said that while it can be beneficial to offer free transportation that gets migrants out of remote towns and closer to their final destinations, \u201cwhen politics get in the middle of it, that\u2019s less helpful and makes it more of a challenge.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to assess if it\u2019s really truly helping the migrants or not, and the big question here is, was California indeed the final destination for these folks?\u201d Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Abbott, said in an email that the governor launched the \u201cborder bus mission\u201d in April 2022 and has since sent 21,000 migrants to cities with sanctuary policies, adding: \u201cEach bus is stocked with food and water and makes stops along the trip to refuel and switch drivers. Migrants are allowed to purchase any needed provisions or disembark at any of these stops, as they have been processed and released by the federal government.\u201d Texas will continue the trips \u201cto provide relief to our overwhelmed border towns\u201d, he said. Shiu-Ming Cheer, the interim co-executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center, which recently pushed for to LA to adopt a sanctuary city policy, praised the city\u2019s handling of the migrants: \u201cLos Angeles has telegraphed its strong support for migrants and been on the forefront of making sure migrants who arrive here, and people who\u2019ve been here for decades as immigrants, are really treated compassionately and are able to receive services.\u201d Florida governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican running for president, has also faced a backlash for sending migrants to Democratic regions. A sheriff recently recommended criminal charges over a flight he sent to Massachusetts, saying migrants were \u201clured under false pretenses\u201d. Earlier this month, he flew asylum seekers to Sacramento, California\u2019s capital, prompting the state attorney general to threaten that Florida officials could be guilty of \u201cstate-sanctioned kidnapping\u201d."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6b0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/15/blood-test-to-detect-50-types-of-cancer-could-be-given-to-1m-people-on-nhs", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Blood test to detect 50 types of cancer could be given to 1m people on NHS", "lead": "Chief executive Amanda Pritchard says that if early results are successful it will be rolled out more widely next year", "author": "Nadeem Badshah", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 22:49:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113513", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a8816773f665bf6af1376864ead7908cd83dadf8/356_65_4054_2433/500.jpg", "body": "A blood test which can detect 50 cancers before symptoms start to show could be offered to a million people in a pilot programme from next summer, according to the head of the NHS. Amanda Pritchard, NHS chief executive, said the Galleri test has the potential to \u201ctransform cancer care forever\u201d, according to reports. The liquid biopsy detects tiny fragments of tumour DNA in the bloodstream and alerts doctors as to whether a cancer signal has been detected and predicts where in the body that signal may have originated. If early results are successful, a pilot screening programme involving one million patients over two years is scheduled to begin next summer. The test is expected to find 5,000 potential cases of the disease every year. The Galleri test is being given to 142,000 people without symptoms across England and will report its results in April. According to the Times, a researcher involved in the NHS trial told a conference of health service leaders in Manchester that the tests could eventually be carried out by people in their own homes. Pritchard reportedly told the NHS Confed Expo conference: \u201cOur pioneering NHS Galleri trial, now in its second year, is the first step in testing a new way to identify cancers before symptoms appear. \u201cIf provisional results prove successful, we will be rolling out the test to an extra one million people across the country from next summer, with the aim of diagnosing thousands more people with cancer at an earlier stage. \u201cLives are saved when cancers are caught early and this test has the potential to transform cancer care forever \u2014 especially for the types that often don\u2019t show symptoms until a later stage, when they can be much harder to treat.\u201d Gillian Rosenberg, innovation lead on NHS England\u2019s national cancer programme, told the conference they were speaking to the national screening committee and would like to expand testing if the early results were successful. She added they expected \u201cabout 5,000\u201d positive referrals in each year of the pilot programme. This month, a separate study published at the world\u2019s largest cancer conference in the US suggested the Galleri blood test, made by the California company Grail, could help speed up diagnosis and fast-track patients for treatment. Results from the much smaller NHS suggested it has the potential to spot and rule out cancer in people with symptoms. Experts at the conference had welcomed the findings but said more research would be needed before the test could be rolled out in healthcare systems. The Symplify study, led by the University of Oxford, involved 5,461 people in England and Wales who were referred to hospital by their GP with suspected cancer. The test correctly revealed two-thirds of cancers among those in the study. In 85% of those positive cases, it was also able to pinpoint the original site of cancer. It was more accurate in older patients and those with more advanced cancers, according to the trial results. The results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\u2019s annual meeting in Chicago."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6b1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/15/spain-italy-nations-league-semi-final-match-report", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Joselu hits late winner to send Spain past Italy and into Nations League final", "lead": "The substitute Joselu came off the bench to score another late goal and seal a 2-1 victory for Spain over Italy in the Nations League semi-final", "author": "Sid Lowe", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 22:28:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113545", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b646dcc20a796bba07d9b1de8a38e184e94c2f6d/0_257_4245_2548/500.jpg", "body": "Joselu, the man who waited 14 years for a Spain call-up and then scored twice within three minutes of coming on for his debut, has gone and done it again. Introduced with five minutes left in the semi-final of the Nations League against Italy, his second substitute appearance for the national team at the age of 33, he had only been on the pitch for two of them when his moment came. Picaresque, he called it: lurking near the goalline, a crafty little wave of the boot edged the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma and the seleccion into Sunday\u2019s final against Croatia. Born in Germany, the former Newcastle and Stoke striker \u2013 a veteran of 10 different clubs in three different countries who was relegated with Espanyol this season \u2013 has some record for Spain: three games played, three goals scored. In the 84th, 85th and 88th minutes. And now, maybe, a winners\u2019 medal on the way, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of faith,\u201d he said. With the score at 1-1 in Rotterdam and the match heading to extra time, which was the last thing anyone wanted, he decided to hang around the keeper and wait to \u201csee what happened\u201d. What happened was that he became a hero. The move built by Ansu Fati, Jordi Alba and Rodri had broken down but the ball came back to the Manchester City midfielder to strike from the edge of the area. It took one deflection, then another and dropped right in front of the Italian keeper and just a toe away from the Spanish forward. A gentle touch was enough to end it at 2-1, everyone going wild. In the stands, his wife started to cry. Spain had done it; they had deserved it too, eventually at least. Spain had been rescued from going behind near the half-hour by the VAR, just at the point at which they appeared most vulnerable. Unable to control Davide Frattesi or the game, it was hard to imagine them responding at that point. But by the second half it had become a different game. Luis de la Fuente\u2019s side had scored one with two minutes gone, now they had another with two minutes to go. And this time there was no response from Italy. The opener had been given to them by Donnarumma and Leonardo Bonucci, the keeper playing the defender into trouble on the edge of the area and Yeremi Pino punishing them for it, given the chance to bend a shot into the corner. On the touchline, it was all Roberto Mancini could do to shrug. Yes, \u00c1lvaro Morata had chased the keeper, Gavi had chased the defender and Pino had waited to pick up the pieces, the movements coordinated, but still this was too simple. Worse, Italy\u2019s manager had seen this before from a goalkeeper with a reputation that sometimes doesn\u2019t match reality. If the way Spain had pressed to force that error was characteristic of them, what followed was not, which is why the lead did not last long. At this stage, the game was open, direct, the teams stretched and the midfield mostly a transit zone, passed quickly. Spain were exercising little of the control that is supposed to define them; instead, it was chaotic. A lot was happening, but that was a question more of quantity than quality. When the press was applied to Unai Sim\u00f3n for the first time he gave it away, and relatively simple balls forward were causing more problems than they should have. From one, Italy had the equaliser. From another, they thought they had the lead. Again the space was easily found and Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo\u2019s cross hit the outstretched arm of Robin Le Normand, making his debut. There was little doubt about the penalty and none about its execution, Ciro Immobile hitting the spot-kick hard and low to level it. Forced to scramble a little too often, the structure insecure, Spain were caught again 10 minutes later. Alba was the man beaten this time: as he hung a leg, Frattesi spun him and went through to beat Sim\u00f3n. The VAR check, though, ruled it out. Another direct delivery had Immobile scampering up the right, pulling the ball back across goal and just beyond Nicol\u00f2 Barella, the seleccion struggling with how high Italy were pressing. Slowly, though, Spain did start to exercise a little control, to look little more like Spain, even if their next shot came from a simple clearance that had Morata running at a retreating defence to draw a sharp save from Donnarumma. Rodri was beginning to get hold of the ball, Mikel Merino finding a more natural place alongside him. On the right, Jes\u00fas Navas was beginning to progress. Gavi, flitting around him, found Morata for a shooting opportunity. And although the closest anyone came before the break was Rafael Tol\u00f3i, whose sliced shot from the edge of the area spun just over the bar, that shift became more marked in the second half. Just two minutes in, Merino volleyed against the bar from close range, Morata spinning and putting the rebound wide from a few yards. Rodri then put an overhead kick just too high after Donnarumma dived out and flapped. And yet if Spain were taking control, it took a superb save from Sim\u00f3n to keep them in it when Zaniolo\u2019s left wing cross found Frattesi alone inside the six-yard box and a Federico Dimarco cross almost found Giovanni Di Lorenzo sliding in. At the other end Donnarumma flashed out a fast hand to flick away from Morata at the near post. It was the Atletico\u2019s striker last opportunity, replaced by Joselu as the clock ticked down. The 33-year-old didn\u2019t have long; he didn\u2019t need long, either."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6b2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/15/athletics-dina-asher-smith-daryll-neita-dead-heat-marie-josee-ta-lou", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Asher-Smith and Neita run a dead heat in battle of Brits but lag behind Ta Lou", "lead": "British sprinters finish joint-fourth behind Marie-Jos\u00e9e Ta Lou, with Asher-Smith admitting she was \u2018hoping for a little bit quicker\u2019", "author": "Sean Ingle in Oslo", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 21:45:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113576", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0137a8daa056adfe6c06dd07cba8d65ba3af2134/0_397_8330_5001/500.jpg", "body": "The battle for bragging rights between Britain\u2019s top two sprinters was left hanging in the warm Oslo air after Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita could not be separated after a thrilling 100m.

But while there was no world record on this night, there were plenty of brilliant races and fast times. Chief among them was the sight of the Norwegian Karsten Warholm back to his best in the 400m hurdles. The world record-holder and Olympic champion delighted his home crowd by charging to victory in 46.52 \u2013 the fourth-fastest time ever and a Diamond League record \u2013 in his first race of the year. \u201cThe adrenaline was really pumping in the last 100m,\u201d he said. \u201cToday shows in the right circumstances, I can really attack the world record, maybe even this year. It really sucked to be out injured last year and I wanted to make sure I came back with a big boom.\u201d There was also a European 1500m record for another Norwegian Olympic champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who ran 3.27.95 to put him sixth on the all-time list. \u201cThe race went as expected \u2013 running by myself as usual and the crowd was amazing,\u201d said Ingebrigtsen, who ran a world best over two miles in Paris last Friday. Such was the quality of the race that Britain\u2019s Josh Kerr and Neil Gourley both ran 3:30 yet were only ninth and 10th respectively.

Hamilton was speaking before this weekend\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix, where Verstappen is odds-on to secure his 41st victory, matching Ayrton Senna\u2019s wins. When asked if the Dutchman could yet equal or surpass his own record, Hamilton was unequivocal. \u201cHe has got a very long career ahead of him so absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cRecords are there to be broken and he has got an amazing team.\u201d However the seven-time champion also insisted he and his Mercedes team would be unstinting in their efforts to return to the top step of the podium. \u201cWe have to work harder to try and continue to extend [the win record],\u201d he added. \u201cI hope that at least within the last period of time in my career we get to have some close racing.\u201d After a very strong result at the last round in Spain, Hamilton indicated that he was optimistic regarding further upgrades, so much so that Mercedes could challenge the Red Bulls at Silverstone on 9 July. \u201cI am really, really hopeful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe performance we had in Spain, each lap I was only about three-tenths off Max, which is the closest we have been this year. I am hoping by Silverstone we would have taken another step so I am hopeful maybe that will be a race where we can actually race them.\u201d Hamilton also played down expectations of an announcement of a renewal of his contract with Mercedes, which ends this year, but did indicate his intent was very much that it was to be concluded. \u201cIt will get done when it is done, if that\u2019s next week or a months time as long as it gets done I am not really bothered,\u201d he said. Mercedes, who enjoyed the fruits of their new car design concept at the last round in Barcelona with a second and third place for Hamilton and teammate George Russell, will be eager to see how their improvements play out in Montreal. They looked strong on the straights and medium to high speed corners in Spain but face a new challenge on the shorter straights of Canada and in several of the heavy braking and lower-speed corners. Verstappen has five wins already this year, in what is proving to be an utterly dominant Red Bull car and leads the world championship by 53 points from his teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez.

The buildup to Antony Blinken\u2019s China visit has been marred by a series of tense exchanges. On Wednesday Qin Gang, China\u2019s foreign minister, told Blinken in a phone call that the US should stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs. Qin also said that the US should respect China\u2019s concerns on the \u201cTaiwan issue\u201d. Daniel Kritenbrink, the US state department\u2019s top diplomat for east Asia, later told reporters that he did not expect \u201csome sort of breakthrough or transformation\u201d in the US-China relationship, according to Reuters. Kritenbrink added: \u201cWe\u2019re coming to Beijing with a realistic, confident approach and a sincere desire to manage our competition in the most responsible way possible.\u201d Last week the US conceded that China had been spying on the US from Cuba since at least 2019. The White House had initially denied reports that China had struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Cuba to eavesdrop on the US. News of the eavesdropping unit had threatened to derail Blinken\u2019s visit \u2013which had already been postponed from February, when an alleged Chinese spy balloon was shot down in US air space, bursting hopes for a rapprochement building on President Xi Jinping\u2019s face-to-face meeting with President Joe Biden in November. Blinken, who will be in China on 18-19 June, will be the highest ranking US official to visit the country since Biden took office. The visit comes at a low point in US-China relations. Beijing has repeatedly accused the US of engaging in double standards and a \u201cnew cold war mentality\u201d when it comes to trade sanctions and export controls. In recent days Chinese state media has published several articles throwing cold water on the prospects of dialogue. On Tuesday, one commentator for the state broadcaster CCTV wrote: \u201cSince the start of the year, America has been a bit vicious with regards to China. \u201cEvery time they say they want to meet, the US is keen to play tricks on China, creating the illusion that the US is eager to communicate. At the same time, it has repeatedly tested and provoked China\u2019s bottom line,\u201d wrote Yuyuan Tantian, the CCTV-affiliated blogger. Jessica Chen Weiss, a professor of China and Asia-Pacific studies at Cornell University, said that she didn\u2019t expect \u201cmajor breakthroughs\u201d from the visit. \u201cGiven the current levels of mistrust and tension in the relationship, a good outcome would be a better understanding of each side\u2019s concerns and red lines as well as modest progress on areas of overlapping interest,\u201d such as the economy, climate change and \u201cthe resumption of people-to-people interactions post-Covid\u201d. Jonathan Ward, author of The Decisive Decade, a book about US competition with China, said that the state of US-China relations pointed to a \u201cdangerous future ahead\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think any particular meeting is going to change the structural problem in the US-China relationship,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThe broader picture is that the Chinese Communist party has a clear strategy to become a leading economic power, and the US has only woken up to this very recently.\u201d Outside of formal diplomacy, Beijing has opened the door to western businesspeople. In May, Elon Musk visited China, meeting foreign minister Qin and other senior officials. And Bill Gates, who tweeted on Wednesday that he had arrived in Beijing, is reported to be meeting Xi on Friday. It has not yet been confirmed if Blinken will also meet with the Chinese president."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6b8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/jun/15/escape-to-the-page-an-online-creative-writing-retreat-with-guardian-masterclasses-week-3", "primaryCategory": "guardian-masterclasses", "subCategories": "test", "title": "An online summer writing retreat: Week three", "lead": "Join us for the last week of our unmissable creative writing retreat with more than ten sessions led by award-winning authors<br><strong>Online workshop</strong><br><strong>Date: </strong>Monday 7 August \u2013 Sunday 13 August 2023<br>Catch up recording available", "author": "", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 20:39:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113748", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2352320bad67c3af8e58caa74e3ee290a8d1e72e/0_0_1240_744/500.jpg", "body": "Book now Our popular online writing retreat has returned.

It was September 2017 and he had made it 2-0 on 85 minutes in the World Cup qualifier at the Ta\u2019 Qali National Stadium. Bertrand, then at Southampton, had never previously scored for England at any level. He would not do so again. And yet he did not celebrate. It would have been inappropriate given the prevailing mood among the 3,700 travelling fans. Bertrand simply pulled up his shirt and mopped the sweat from his brow. It was a defining on-field image but, really, the most memorable ones came from the visiting enclosure, England\u2019s addition of two stoppage-time goals for a 4-0 win almost irrelevant. By then, about two-thirds of the England support had sloped off in search of spirit-lifting refreshment, some having first taken down their flags from the perimeter fencing, which was quite the sight. It was one of those toxic nights, the team bus abused by fans on the way into the stadium and then some more on the way out. And there is little doubt that it frames England\u2019s return on Friday night for the Euro 2024 qualifier, if only to serve as a barometer of the progress under Gareth Southgate. England have travelled with a sense of assurance and purpose, tranquillity, too, which tends to be the case these days, Southgate further boosted by the presence of five newly minted Manchester City treble winners. Has Jack Grealish sobered up yet? When that is one of the talking points, you get the picture. Good news for Grealish: the four-day Abode on the Rock dance music festival got started on Thursday afternoon. Back in 2017, Southgate had looked enviously at Spain. \u201cHow can we possibly compare ourselves to a team who have Champions League winners throughout?\u201d he asked. It is all change now, his squad also featuring Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jordan Henderson \u2013 who won the competition with Liverpool in 2019. The Chelsea trio of Reece James, Ben Chilwell and Mason Mount, victors in 2021, are missing through injury. \u201cIt is a massive positive,\u201d Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United striker, said this week. \u201cWe have got players that have experienced massive occasions and it is only going to help us as a nation to hopefully get over the line in a major tournament.\u201d Rashford\u2019s presence is a thing, given the scrutiny around his non-tournament involvement with England. When he withdrew from the squad for the opening Euro qualifiers against Italy and Ukraine in March, which England won, it was the fifth time he had done so since September 2020. Rashford cannot help it if he is injured and Southgate has lost Lewis Dunk and Jude Bellingham from his original squad to fitness issues. But the rest are here and it is worth saying that the trip to face the world\u2019s 172nd-ranked nation comes nearly three weeks after the end of the Premier League season. England will complete the seemingly eternal campaign against North Macedonia at Old Trafford on Monday. Back again to Malta 2017 and, as Southgate confronted the disconnect between the team and the fanbase, he admitted that in his day as an England international, there were players who \u201cducked\u201d call-ups. It was because the environment was all wrong, the shirt heavy, and Southgate was acutely aware that there remained a body of work ahead. Malta was a turning point: surely one of the twin lows of Southgate\u2019s tenure. The other was the 4-0 Nations League defeat against Hungary last June when the crowd at Molineux turned on him savagely. At the Ta\u2019 Qali Stadium, Southgate\u2019s lineup featured his stalwarts \u2013 Kyle Walker, Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane, with John Stones and Rashford on the bench \u2013 and it was a listless performance until the late flurry. \u201cHallelujah,\u201d Clive Tyldesley said in commentary when Kane opened the scoring in the 53rd minute. There were boos from the England end for a misplaced pass before half-time, exaggerated cheers for a shot on target. \u201cWe\u2019re fucking shit,\u201d was the song. Progress had been slow from Southgate\u2019s first game in charge \u2013 the 2-0 Wembley win over Malta in October 2016 \u2013 and there would be no immediate uplift. Remember the paper-plane throwing and apathy of October 2017 during the victory over Slovenia at Wembley that secured World Cup qualification? Southgate did not want to address the problems between the squad and supporters in the immediate aftermath of Malta away. But he certainly did two days later, wondering whether the players\u2019 wealth was a part of it and drilling down with particular intensity on to the notion that they did not care. More often than not, Southgate said, they had cared too much. \u201cThey\u2019ve been wrapped up in the experience too much,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve not been able to give their best for that reason.\u201d Southgate called for a fresh start, for support, and doubled down on his push for a cultural reset, to bring the squad closer to the fans, to close the divide. He looked to American sport and how they were more open with the media, helping to break down barriers. Lift-off would come at the 2018 World Cup with the run to the semi-finals and that was when the playwright James Graham started to feel that something extraordinary was happening, a shift in the national mood driven by the national team. Graham has chronicled it in his new play, Dear England, which opened at the National Theatre on Sunday, Joseph Fiennes the blockbuster choice to play Southgate. It is most assuredly a moment for football. And one that felt a long way away when Bertrand saw his shot go in. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pleasant journey to the stadium in 2017 and it was less pleasant going home,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure everyone knew we had won 4-0 because they were in the bar at 1-0 \u2026 some at 0-0. For us, it\u2019s a good reference to see how far the relationship with the fans has come. The connection feels completely different now.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6bb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/just-stop-oil-protesters-glyndebourne-opera-festival", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Just Stop Oil protesters interrupt opera at Glyndebourne festival", "lead": "Three activists use glitter cannons and air horns during performance of Poulenc\u2019s Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites", "author": "Nadeem Badshah", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 20:01:29", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113806", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/554775162d9adbccec8bedadb495c0f73bf5e465/0_215_768_461/500.jpg", "body": "Just Stop Oil protesters have interrupted a performance during the Glyndebourne opera festival in East Sussex by letting off glitter cannons and blowing air horns. The disruption took place during a performance on Thursday of Francis Poulenc\u2019s Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites at the festival near Lewes. The incident occurred at about 5.30pm and the opera restarted after a delay of about 20 minutes. A Glyndebourne spokesperson said the incident was formally reported to police but officers were not on site and no arrests had been made. The stage was cleared and ushers peacefully escorted the three protesters from the theatre within a minute, she said.

Sound familiar? \u201cWe are running out of time. Take action with Just Stop Oil.\u201d Earlier on Thursday, more than a dozen Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested during slow marches through London as new legislation came into force giving police officers greater powers to intervene and prevent disruption.

Bee-eaters are a species found commonly in the southern Mediterranean and northern Africa, and as our planet warms they \u2013 along with other species \u2013 are being pushed further north.\u201d The three bee-eaters, including a nesting pair, were spotted in a sand quarry near Cromer, north Norfolk. Observers anticipate more might yet join them. Last year eight bee-eaters took up residence at the same location, where they hatched and fledged chicks before returning south. Formerly very rare breeders in the UK, this year marks the seventh breeding attempt in England in the past 20 years, which experts have said suggests they are attempting to establish a regular breeding colony in the UK, a clear impact of climate change. As well as bees, they feed on dragonflies and other flying insects, which they catch in mid-air.

During a sun-drenched buildup at Edgbaston, as players prepped, bar staff loaded up the store rooms like missile silos, and mowers buzzed around the outfield, there has been an abundance of knowing looks and instant smiles, every interaction swiftly followed by theories and predictions. The stage is finally set, the pyrotechnics locked and loaded, and all we need now is that initial spark. It comes at 11am on Friday morning when, in front of 25,000 spectators, and hopefully millions watching and listening at home and overseas, the first cherry-ripe ball is sent down \u2013 a moment which itself has become part of the 146-year legend. In the past they have sailed past off-stump, flown gallingly wide to second slip, whistled to the rope or clattered into the timber; often it means little, sometimes it sets the tone. In the last series, it unquestionably did the latter. When Mitchell Starc detonated the leg stump of Rory Burns at a febrile Gabba 18 months ago, it set in motion a full-blown dismantlement of England and a 4-0 defeat from which many \u2013 including yours truly \u2013 expected a long and painful road back. Joe Root lasted one more limp tour as captain and Australia, it was thought, would probably be nailed on to end a 22-year drought during the return visit this summer. In the intervening time they appear to have grown stronger. Under the blue-eyed, smiling leadership of Pat Cummins they have clearly deepened their bonds as a playing unit, confident enough to relegate their head coach, Justin Langer, to the role of Banquo\u2019s ghost up in the commentary box. A generational great such as Steve Smith has been augmented by the rise of Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head, an intimidating attack by Scott Boland. World Test champion status has deservedly followed and this Ashes defence, Cummins admits, will now define their legacy. But England have changed dramatically, a team liberated in the image of their aggressive captain, Ben Stokes, and an uber-optimist Kiwi in their head coach, Brendon McCullum. It has shifted the needle and turned the task of picking favourites and underdogs into a fool\u2019s errand. Much like the one-day team\u2019s epiphany under Eoin Morgan, they have developed a groundbreaking style of play and, while it has been a high-wire act at times, the upshot \u2013 11 wins from 13 \u2013 means both teams are peaking nicely. People call it \u201cBazball\u201d in a nod to McCullum\u2019s nickname but most do so knowing it massively undersells the role of Stokes. The all-rounder is on record that it simply should be \u201cEnglish Test cricket\u201d, believing he and McCullum have set a template which could outlast his own creaking body. Back in January the pair even gave a presentation to the counties, espousing the virtues of batting fast, bowling solely for wickets, entertaining above all, and treating the draw with contempt. There are sceptics on both sides of the divide and elsewhere waiting for it to fail, either nauseated by the talk of saving Test cricket, or fancying it as a flash in the pan and symptomatic of wider decline. There are also those \u2013 including yours truly \u2013 who believe regardless of its sustainability, it has been a joyful counterpoint to a global landscape being terraformed into a succession of soulless franchise leagues. And all told, it probably has given England their best shot at regaining the urn. Stokes was in a pretty relaxed mood a day out from the toss, wearing the bucket hat that sums up his team\u2019s club-side outlook and the knee brace that sums up the concerns over his durability as a bowler. Once again he stressed the result doesn\u2019t matter to him and, while supporters may disagree, on one level he was right: whatever the final scoreline, these next six weeks really are positively pregnant with possibilities \u2013 a goldmine of storylines simply waiting to be extracted and polished up. Chiefly this is the binary reaction that will result from the two contrasting playing styles but also the individual threads one to 11 on both sides, be it the late arrival of Moeen Ali \u2013 a \u201cgut and heart\u201d decision, said Stokes \u2013 the restoration of Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps, or Head\u2019s golden streak of run-a-ball form for Australia. Harry Brook will make his Ashes bow, while Boland has his chance to prove all the predictions from that remarkable debut right: that he will relish the Dukes ball in England. And there is the possible swansong for two of England\u2019s all-time greats \u2013 not that either is saying this. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson play their 135th Test match together this week, having already passed the 1,001 Test wickets shared in tandem by Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. Broad is 18 short of 600, Anderson 15 away from 700. To simply reach this point is testament to their professionalism, skill and insatiable hunger for the Ashes contest. And what follows could rival the farewell those two Australian greats experienced back in the day. Warne would have loved this Ashes series, both England\u2019s devil-may-care approach \u2013 on and off the field \u2013 and the well-oiled Australian machine it comes up against. And so to pinch a line from his old friend Rob Key upon uniting Stokes with McCullum last year, and with that first ball nearly upon us, it\u2019s time to buckle up and enjoy the ride."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6be", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/15/nusrat-jahan-choudhury-first-muslim-woman-federal-judge", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nusrat Jahan Choudhury confirmed as first Muslim woman to be federal judge", "lead": "ACLU attorney, 46, confirmed as lifetime judge for eastern district of New York in 50-49 Senate decision \u2013 but Joe Manchin voted against", "author": "Erum Salam", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 19:50:37", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.113903", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7384444a53a1ff625600bce970aab6dada5bbb28/0_0_7602_4561/500.jpg", "body": "The US Senate has confirmed the former American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Nusrat Jahan Choudhury as the first Muslim woman to serve as a federal judge on Thursday.

Some superstars are bigger, though, so big they are not content with merely singing about money, or even making lots of it, but prefer to move entire economies with their vocal cords. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance tour in Stockholm last month could be part of the reason for Sweden\u2019s higher than expected inflation figure, according to Michael Grahn of Danske Bank, who suggests the influx of her fans \u201cprobably\u201d accounted for the majority of a 0.3% rise in hotel and restaurant prices. But Queen Bey is far from the only independent woman with the power to deliver a diva dividend.

While the fanbase financial heft wielded by Swifties and the BeyHive is impressive, there is nothing new about blockbuster acts moving markets. Pop pickers of a more mature vintage can cast their minds back to 1964, when the Beatles came to the rescue of the British economy. International currency exchange rates were fixed at the time, via the Bretton Woods system introduced in 1944. A 2014 International Monetary Fund report lays out how this left the UK with a persistently negative imbalance between imports and exports that put it at risk of a chastening downward revaluation from $2.80 against the dollar. The Fab Four may have lamented the attention of the taxman but they proved a friend to the exchequer. According to the IMF report, the Beatles\u2019 sizeable \u201cinvisible export\u201d income in dollars, Deutschmark and yen \u2013 derived from international ticket sales, appearance fees, royalties and performance rights \u2013 helped right the balance and stave off devaluation. Today, Beatlemania is still worth about \u00a382m a year to the Liverpool economy and supports more than 2,000 jobs, the local council found. The city also estimates that stepping in to host this year\u2019s Eurovision song contest, in place of war-stricken Ukraine, could bring \u00a340m to the city. A study into the full effect is due out next year. Ipswich council credited homecoming gigs by the Suffolk songsmith Ed Sheeran with a \u00a39m injection into the town\u2019s economy. Research from the National Arenas Association backs that up, suggesting for every 10,000 gig visitors \u00a31m is injected into the local economy. At a national level, UK Music estimates the industry\u2019s contribution to the British economy in 2021 was \u00a34bn \u2013 up 26% on 2020 but still down 31% on the pre-Covid all-time high of \u00a35.8bn in 2019. Employment in the industry reached 145,000 in 2021 but remains 26% below pre-pandemic levels. A UK Music report this year says Britain is one of a small number of countries that are net music exporters, along with the US and Sweden, and it sold \u00a32.5bn overseas in 2021. Jon Collins, the chief executive of Live, the voice of the live music and entertainment industry, says revenue from gigs and festivals in Britain is thought to have returned to pre-pandemic levels. The group will soon release a report estimating that live music\u2019s \u201cgross value added\u201d \u2013 a different measure of economic contribution to that used by UK Music \u2013 was more than \u00a35bn in 2022. \u201cThat includes the production, light and sound technicians, specialist haulage companies, a whole ecosystem that\u2019s built up around the talent,\u201d Collins says. But he warns that the industry faces two main risks. One is the reversion from a pandemic-linked special VAT rate of 5%, similar to that charged across Europe, back to a standard 20%. The other is the lack of post-Brexit agreement between the UK and EU on a \u201ccultural waiver\u201d to allow bands to tour freely, rather than being turned away at the border. \u201cIt\u2019s a major barrier,\u201d says Collins. \u201cFrom the Beatles to Radiohead, there are stories of bands going off around Europe and coming back with a bigger fanbase and a more refined sound.\u201d Any impediment could be damaging, given that global competition is hotting up. In South Korea, for instance, the emergence of K-pop as a global phenomenon has added a new string to the bow of an export-led economy better known for its manufacturing and technology prowess. According to one admittedly optimistic estimate, K-pop is worth $10bn to the Korean economy, while in 2018, the Hyundai Research Institute (HRI) reported that K-pop band BTS alone accounted for an estimated $3.54bn. In smaller economies, the potential for an artist to establish themselves within the national financial firmament is huge. Sweden thanked Abba for the music by awarding the group a prize for their contribution to the country\u2019s exports. And legend has it U2 were one of Ireland\u2019s top three exports in the 1990s, before the economic boom that earned the country its Celtic Tiger nickname. In 2008, it seemed as if Iceland, reeling from the hit its bank-heavy economy had taken from the financial crash, would require help from Bj\u00f6rk in its hour of need. The esoteric and hugely successful artist teamed up with the female-led venture capital firm Audur to launch a sustainable investment fund. Audur, has since merged with Virding and, as far as public information about its subsequent investment performance goes \u2026 it\u2019s oh so quiet. Top 10 songs about money C.R.E.A.M.

The proposed merger, which also involves the DP World Tour (formerly European Tour), is facing two separate Senate investigations both launched this week, and a new threat by the chair of the Senate finance committee, who said he would introduce legislation to revoke Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-backed fund\u2019s tax-exempt status. \u201cThe PGA Tour\u2019s involvement with the PIF [Saudi Arabia\u2019s public investment fund] raises significant questions about whether organisations that tie themselves to an authoritarian regime that has continually undermined the rule of law should continue to enjoy tax-exempt status in the United States,\u201d Ron Wyden, the Democratic chair of the finance committee and one of the toughest critics of Saudi Arabia on Capitol Hill, wrote in a letter to the PGA\u2019s management. In the four-page letter to the PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, and chair, Ed Herlihy, Wyden demanded to be provided detailed information about issues ranging from the players\u2019 free speech rights, to the structure of the deal and compensation of managers, to whether the PIF\u2019s potential ownership of US real estate posed a threat to national security. Washington has a long history of disrupting proposed mergers and acquisitions that are politically unpalatable, and the PGA\u2019s shock announcement that alongside the DP World Tour, it had agreed to a merger with the Saudi\u2019s LIV Tour \u2013 after a year of bitter litigation between the parties and which in effect would mean Saudi Arabia taking control of top-level golf \u2013 comes at a time when the country\u2019s relations with Washington are at a low. One longtime attorney who works on foreign transactions said Joe Biden\u2019s administration is growing increasingly frustrated by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s, warm relations with China. The kingdom has few vocal allies in Washington. There are several hurdles that experts said could stand in the way of a deal. The most obvious one would be a decision by the US Department of Justice to block the deal on antitrust grounds. The DOJ informed the PGA on Thursday that the merger would face a review because of antitrust concerns, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The Biden administration could also \u2013 in theory, and under pressure from Congress \u2013 decide to launch a national security review of the proposed transaction. While Congress has fewer concrete tools to block a deal, measures like Wyden\u2019s proposed bill to strip Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund of tax-exempt status could bite the kingdom. The proposed merger will not only face opposition from senior Democrats such as Wyden and Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut but also Republicans who have expressed discomfort with it, as well as a vocal and important lobby of family members of victims of the 9/11 terror attacks on the US, who said in a recent statement that they had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the PGA\u2019s decision to reverse course and agree to a deal. Khalid Aljabri, a Saudi expert and frequent commentator on US-Saudi relations, said the PGA-LIV merger exemplified Bin Salman\u2019s blueprint of using infinite resources to \u201cbully\u201d his way to getting a seat at the table. In announcing the merger last week, Monahan accepted \u201cpeople are going to call me a hypocrite\u201d given his previously hostile stance to LIV but he insisted the move was the correct one for golf, a view shared by Keith Pelley, the DP World Tour\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for global golf and the men\u2019s professional game,\u201d said Pelley. \u201cI am just thrilled with the announcement and what it means going forward.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/penn-and-teller-magic-and-comedy", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Penn & Teller\u2019s long goodbye: megastar magicians put new spins on old tricks", "lead": "The duo\u2019s First Final UK Tour is more amusing than astonishing but demonstrates what drew them to the confounding craft in the first place", "author": "Brian Logan", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 19:00:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114048", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/981b930987fc942d11309320965d82f01bfe9a59/242_190_8327_4997/500.jpg", "body": "Penn &amp; Teller\u2019s professional relationship is almost as old as I am.

Their tricks were brasher and more dangerous, their mouthy irreverence a contrast to the genteel discretion of the Paul Daniels generation. But the future doesn\u2019t last for ever. Penn &amp; Teller are enfants terribles no more, and their new show begins with a burlesque on their own decrepitude: an escapology routine in which the trembling twosome break free from dressing gowns and rocking chairs, then spring forth \u2013 youthful once more! \u2013 to present the rest of the show. The intention, of course, is to mock the idea that P&amp;T might be past it. And fair enough: the ensuing two hours prove there\u2019s life in the Las Vegas stalwarts yet. But it\u2019s not groundbreaking life. The wheel has turned. Their show \u2013 the so-called First Final UK Tour \u2013 now feels like a very traditional magic offering, the convention against which today\u2019s upstarts, those latter-day Penn &amp; Tellers, will kick. The issue, perhaps, is that magic, more than other art forms, is reliant on novelty, surprise and the raising of stakes. It\u2019s a lot, but not always enough, for magicians to come on stage and deliver a succession of excellently orchestrated, usually confounding, tricks \u2013 which is what Penn &amp; Teller do tonight.

For magicians must outdo themselves, again and again, just to stand still. What Penn &amp; Teller offer instead is an enjoyable greatest-hits package that includes several new spins on old tricks. You\u2019ll have encountered the Russian roulette stunt before, whether with bullets in guns or nails strategically placed under paper cups. P&amp;T\u2019s innovation is to replace those props with Teller himself, swaddled in foil, and four additional Teller replicas. Here comes Penn with a giant mallet, brought down with force on all but one of the Tellers\u2019 heads. It\u2019s fun, and its accomplishment is a delicious mystery \u2013 even if it\u2019s a fairly minimal twist on a trick you\u2019ve seen plenty times before. Elsewhere, there is novelty, but it\u2019s often attached to routines that can feel disposable. Their front-row stooge may have blanched at Penn &amp; Teller\u2019s sock-clad feet in her face, but for the rest of us, the card trick demonstrating sleight-of-foot rather than sleight-of-hand is easy to enjoy. Again, the set-piece is neat in which Penn misinterprets the Spanish-language instructions on his new trick, leading to some monkey business with an errant ape. But we\u2019re in the realm of amusement here, not astonishment. Amusement is good, of course \u2013 but Penn &amp; Teller themselves have been complicit, over their careers, in the conjuring arms race that requires not just amusement but ratcheting levels of flabbergast. The issue tonight is also one of show construction. Maybe I\u2019ve been spoiled by the likes of Derren Brown, who doesn\u2019t just manipulate his audience trick by trick, but across the dramatic arc of whole shows. I\u2019ve come to expect of my magic sets that some failed trick earlier will be redeemed at the end, or some seed planted in Act One will blossom into something spectacular before curtain call. But it\u2019s not so tonight: Penn &amp; Teller deliver just one routine after another, and end on a dying fall, with Penn Jillette\u2019s paean to the carnival fire-breathers of his Massachusetts youth. It\u2019s not the first time in a P&amp;T show, nor the first time tonight, that the pair linger in vaudeville nostalgia. An escapology stunt plays out against a backdrop of Houdini performing the same feat. There\u2019s a lecture-demo that places the technique known as the \u201cFrench drop\u201d in its magic-historical context. Perhaps that\u2019s the spirit in which this classic-style magic show should be received. As they age (if not yet to their rocking-chair and bathrobe dotage), perhaps Penn &amp; Teller\u2019s impulse towards the spectacular and the overreaching fades, to be supplanted by a refreshed appreciation of the simple but confounding craft that drew them to magic in the first place. It\u2019s understandable to hanker, as an audience member, for some new spin on Teller\u2019s signature stunts, which he performs once again tonight: clipping the petals of a rose\u2019s shadow; swallowing handfuls of needles then disgorging them, threaded. But that shouldn\u2019t diminish our appreciation of the artistry he brings to their execution. Eight thousand performances, in Penn\u2019s estimation, have gone into it: an assiduous honing of craft that was the hallmark of the carnie acts for whom P&amp;T first fell. Not every show has to be the future of comedy; some can just savour its present, and past. Penn &amp; Teller are at Hammersmith Apollo, London, until 18 June"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/england-and-wales-abortion-law-has-been-settled-tory-mp-tells-commons", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England and Wales abortion law has been settled, minister tells Commons", "lead": "Edward Argar says government does not intend to change law after case of woman jailed for late abortion", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:58:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114068", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bfb07a691cc9f99c12058829780b1c3df2f1f6aa/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Abortion law in England and Wales has been settled by parliament and the government does not intend to change it, a justice minister has told MPs, after a woman was jailed for taking abortion pills after the legal limit. Edward Argar was speaking after opposition MPs secured an urgent question on the 162-year-old legislation underpinning abortion regulations in part of the UK, during which there were cross-party calls for an overhaul. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, urged the government to work with Labour to look at options to prevent a repeat of the case, which has prompted outrage after the woman was sentenced to more than two years in prison after a court was told she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant when she took an abortion pill. \u201cTherefore, I ask that the Sentencing Council looks at this to stop this sort of circumstance with this sort of sentence,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, there needs to be safeguards and time limits and this needs to happen to prevent late-term abortion. We do not want to see vulnerable women serving prison sentences or being prosecuted when it is not in the public interest to do so.\u201d Argar said the Sentencing Council was independent. \u201cAnd it determines what to review and how to review it \u2026 I suspect they will have heard her comments but again, it would be inappropriate for me to seek to direct the Sentencing Council, given its independent function,\u201d he said. A \u201clongstanding position\u201d remained that it was for the House of Commons \u201cto seek to make changes if it so wishes, but not for the government,\u201d Argar said. \u201cAny such vote would be in normal process a free vote and would be brought before this house in the context of a private member\u2019s bill or similar, or perhaps a dexterous amendment, which I know some [MPs] opposite are not averse to doing successfully.\u201d In a charged debate \u2013 during which only men responded from the Conservative side, while the response was almost entirely from women on the opposition benches \u2013 Diana Johnson said the government and parliament \u201cmust look at this outdated legislation and make it fit for the 21st century\u201d. \u201cAs we know, earlier this week a mother of three children was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for ending her pregnancy and was prosecuted under section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, a piece of legislation dating from 1861, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment,\u201d said the Labour MP, who in 2018 tried to amend provisions in the 1861 act relating to abortion with a backbench bill. \u201cThis case was desperately sad and thankfully rare and it has been debated widely in the media and throws up important questions that merit an open debate in a health democracy,\u201d Johnson said. She challenged the government on why it was reasonable to have different legal frameworks in different parts of the UK as a result of MPs voting three years ago to change the law in Northern Ireland, where abortion was decriminalised. The Labour MP Stella Creasy said there had been 67 prosecutions in the last 10 years under the older legislation, adding: \u201cThe conviction that we have seen in England and Wales shows that it is not a theoretical issue to consider whether women in England and Wales have a legal right to an abortion. They don\u2019t. They have a situation where they are exempted from prosecution.\u201d There was anger from the opposition benches when the Tory MP Nick Fletcher, who said he expected that parliament would vote to liberalise abortion laws in future, said he was sure there were not any women who went to a clinic for an abortion who \u201cdid not hate\u201d the experience. Labour\u2019s Charlotte Nichols joined other MPs in asking government to table time for a reasoned debate on abortion reform in England and Wales in the coming weeks, adding that in a future debate MPs should take care not to make assumptions about what women believed. Another Labour MP, Janet Daby, brought up a case from a constituent who was seeking an abortion due to medication her partner was taking that causes foetal abnormality. The woman was told this was not a legally valid reason, said Daby, who asked the government to review this situation."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/boris-johnson-lied-privileges-committee-report-carnival-crazy-sketch", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What do you know, Boris Johnson lied.

Sir Bernard Jenkin, meanwhile, had allegedly himself attended a party in December 2020, and should therefore recuse himself from a job that had already finished, according to Boris Johnson and his allies, so desperate that they were dredging up ideas that started, \u201cfirst, go back in time\u201d. On Thursday morning, however, there were no surprises. The former prime minister had lied to parliament and nobody, anywhere, dropped their marmalade. There had just been so many spoilers: Johnson\u2019s resignation letter at the end of last week, a howling and at times hilarious rebuttal of the lying he was about to be found guilty of; the many attacks on the personal probity of Harriet Harman, committee chair; and last but not least, Johnson\u2019s long history of lying; so ceaseless, so well-documented, that if he hadn\u2019t been lying about the parties, you\u2019d have wondered whether he was feeling OK. To be fair to the committee, they weren\u2019t tasked with writing a thriller. And to be doubly fair, they did have a few eyebrow-raisers, the greatest of which is probably that, were Johnson still an MP, he would have faced a 90-day suspension rather than the 10-day punishment he already found \u201cegregious\u201d. Committee members were miffed about his resignation letter, in which \u2013 adjusted for brevity \u2013 he said everyone was a liar one way or another, apart from him. This itself was \u201ca very serious contempt\u201d, they found, but they had seen nothing yet. By mid-morning, another powerful tirade had dropped, anyone would think Johnson was getting paid by the word. \u201cA load of complete tripe,\u201d he called their report, \u201ca charade\u201d. \u201cThe terrible truth is that it is not I who has twisted the truth,\u201d Johnson wrote, like a man with concussion trying to tell you a riddle. \u201cIt is Harriet Harman and her committee.\u201d This screed was a little unhinged \u2013 he called this a dark day for democracy, labelling the committee a \u201ctiny minority\u201d with a vendetta. But how can a committee be anything other than a minority? And if finding a person guilty is a \u201cpolitical assassination\u201d, a \u201cfinal knife thrust\u201d, then what would a good day for democracy look like? Gigantic committees, 350-people strong, who find everyone innocent, yup, that sounds good, that doesn\u2019t sound at all like a pantomime directed by an autocrat. Relax, though, I don\u2019t believe he has actually lost his marbles: this is just the opening of his second act, where he roars back as Trump-without-a-tan, daring you to laugh at his nonsense because he knows the only-half-listening will mistake this for fun. There were some plucky interventions from opposition MPs, the Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper suggesting that Johnson should have his ex-PM stipend of \u00a3115,000 a year removed, and Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonnaire saying he should repay the \u00a3245,00 spent on his legal fees. But really this is a blue-on-blue moment. Penny Mordaunt announced mid-morning that Monday\u2019s vote in the Commons, whether to accept the report and its recommendations, will be a free one, which was not so much an invitation to Conservatives to consult their consciences as a starting gun; let the carnival of crazy begin. Johnson supporters took to the socials to make dark threats to MPs voting in favour of the report; nice seat you\u2019ve got there. It\u2019d be a shame if you were deselected. Sure, if the past year has taught us anything, it\u2019s don\u2019t put anything past a Conservative constituency party. Where you see a risky old idea, they see a dare. But it\u2019s debatable whether such a tactic can work any more, on MPs who, quite reasonably, see themselves as mainly keeping these seats warm for the next guys. Nevertheless, the Boris Chorus had a demonic energy by the afternoon, with Brendan Clarke-Smith helpfully providing a shareable graphic \u2013 I\u2019m Backing Boris \u2013 and Jacob Rees-Mogg referring to Boris \u201cdoing very well against the marsupials\u201d, which is how you know he\u2019s cleverer than you, because do you see what he did there, no really, do you? Johnson himself was next sighted, presumably because he had told a load of photographers where he\u2019d be, just guessing here, out running: fists clenched lightly, chest forward, apparently wearing swimming trunks, the mighty silverback was ready for his enemies and could outpace them all. Though there seemed to be a minder keeping pace with him quite easily, and he was clearly walking. Will Johnson\u2019s loyalists bring down this report, destroy their party, force a general election, and sweep him back to power on some new ticket, leader of the Truth Party? Nope. Don\u2019t be silly. How have they got the energy to be so silly, in this heat?"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/15/thurrock-council-hid-losses-gambled-millions-risky-investments", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Thurrock council hid losses as it gambled millions on risky investments", "lead": "Official report criticises Tory-run authority\u2019s dysfunctional leadership and says it tried to silence critics", "author": "Patrick Butler Social policy editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:36:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114108", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8590fff15e1a26903a9d180aa5a0a318dc111ace/0_281_4608_2765/500.jpg", "body": "Bankrupt Thurrock council recklessly gambled hundreds of millions of pounds on risky commercial investments while covering up evidence of its losses and attempting to silence critics, a devastating official review has concluded. The government-commissioned report published on Thursday said the Tory-run council\u2019s financial collapse in 2022 was the culmination of years of dysfunctional leadership characterised by complacency, denial, and what the review called \u201cunconscious incompetence\u201d. Thurrock declared effective bankruptcy in December after running up a \u00a3500m deficit \u2013 at the time thought to be the largest in local government history \u2013 triggered when a series of financial speculations funded by a \u00a31.5bn borrowing spree turned sour. The review concluded the failures at the Essex council amounted to an \u201cabdication of responsibility\u201d by politicians and senior managers which over a period of years had permitted good practice norms in local government to \u201cdecay or fall into disuse\u201d. The financial collapse will have catastrophic implications for the council, which may not survive in its current form, the review said. Paying off the resulting debts means local people will see a \u201csignificant and rapid reduction\u201d in the level of council services while facing higher council tax bills. Thurrock\u2019s plight echoes recent insolvencies at Croydon, Slough, and Woking councils, each of which fell into difficulty after borrowing hundreds of millions of pounds to pump into ill-starred commercial investment and regeneration schemes. The review blamed Thurrock\u2019s leadership for failing to challenge a series of significant commercial investment decisions taken by the council\u2019s former finance director Sean Clark. It had delegated extraordinary power to him to invest hundreds of millions of pounds without meaningful political or executive oversight. Clark borrowed from other local authorities to finance loans of more than \u00a3600m to companies owned by the businessman Liam Kavanagh to invest in 53 solar farms. This, alongside investments in other business, exposed the council to serious losses and forced it to write off millions on bad deals. Clark, who left the council in January after being suspended in September, oversaw a rapid expansion in its borrowing from \u00a334m to \u00a31bn in just four years, despite neither he nor his team having the skills or experience to handle such a big investment programme. Although the review blamed Clark for the conception, development and ultimate failure of the investment strategy, it said the fiasco could not be laid at his door alone. \u201cPut simply, [Clark] could not have acted as he did in a well-functioning, well-led authority,\u201d the review concluded. It added: \u201cOur assessment therefore is that, although serious mistakes have been made by individuals, the challenges facing the council stem from a series of self-sustaining, systemic weaknesses which have allowed for repeated failure over many years.\u201d Council leaders were timid and incurious, the review said. Although they were often denied meaningful information by officers, they in turn signed up to a \u201cgood news culture\u201d that unwaveringly rejected criticism of the strategy, and dismissed concerns raised in the media by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and others. Thurrock\u2019s leaders became reliant on the \u00a320m a year initially generated by the investment strategy, the review said, because it allowed them to largely insulate local services from austerity cuts, and set some of the lowest average council tax bills in the UK. This meant they could avoid taking hard decisions, said the review. It cited an unnamed councillor who said: \u201cThe money coming in was nice and we can\u2019t escape that. When other places were looking at significant cuts we were having arguments here on how to spend the surplus.\u201d The council is now under special measures and run by a government-appointed team of commissioners. It is expected to have to approach the government for a bailout as it attempts to try to balance the books. Andrew Jefferies, the council\u2019s leader, said: \u201cWhilst I am deeply sorry for the shocking and unacceptable failings of the past, I can pledge that under my new leadership the council will never repeat these mistakes.\u201d Thurrock\u2019s Labour opposition leader, John Kent, said: \u201cConservative cabinet members are shown to have been painfully uncritical, easily manipulated and lacking in basic leadership skills, culminating in bankruptcy, and saddling local residents with decades of debt and poor services.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/johnson-deliberately-misled-parliament-over-partygate-damning-report-finds", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson Partygate report findings threaten to further derail Tories", "lead": "Ex-PM\u2019s allies pledge to target Tory members of committee and MPs who endorse its findings for deselection", "author": "Pippa Crerar and Aubrey Allegretti", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:35:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114127", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1f2f53b3198604d0b4f5d87f1f30b7e89a33ba88/0_48_1201_721/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson deliberately misled parliament over Partygate and was part of a campaign to abuse and intimidate MPs investigating him, according to a damning official inquiry that threatens to further tear apart the Conservative party. The long-awaited report by the privileges committee said the former prime minister would have faced a 90-day suspension from the Commons had he not quit in rage at its conclusions last week. The original suspension was due to be 20 days but the committee said his attempts to intimidate it would have increased the punishment. He was also found to have knowingly misled the committee, breached Commons rules by partially leaking its findings last Friday, and undermined the democratic processes of parliament. As a result, the cross-party committee recommended Johnson be banned from getting the pass granted to former MPs that allows them privileged access to the Westminster estate. In concluding that Johnson deliberately \u2013 and not just recklessly \u2013 misled parliament, the committee cited his repeated and continuing denials over his knowledge of rule-breaking Downing Street gatherings as well as the frequency with which he \u201cclosed his mind\u201d to the facts. \u201cThe contempt was all the more serious because it was committed by the prime minister, the most senior member of the government,\u201d it said. \u201cHe misled the house on an issue of the greatest importance to the house and to the public, and did so repeatedly.\u201d Soon after the report was published, Johnson accused the committee, which has a Tory majority and a Labour chair, of trying to \u201cbring about what is intended to be the final knife thrust in a protracted political assassination\u201d. He said its findings were \u201cpreposterous\u201d and a sign of \u201cdesperation\u201d. Allies of Johnson reacted with fury and pledged to target Conservative members of the committee and Tory MPs who endorse its findings for deselection. A vote on the findings, to be held on Monday, will be a moment of major jeopardy for Rishi Sunak as Johnson\u2019s explosive reaction threatens to undermine efforts to draw a line under the Partygate scandal and end the vicious infighting that has erupted again in recent days. The row about the report has already resulted in Johnson and the loyalist Nigel Adams sparking byelections in Uxbridge and Selby on 20 July by standing down, and Nadine Dorries plans to cause another moment of peril for Sunak later in the summer. Many Tory MPs are likely to endorse the result of the more than year-long inquiry in the free vote \u2013 which comes on Johnson\u2019s 59th birthday and three years to the day since the No 10 celebration that led to him being fined by police for breaching coronavirus laws. But there could be a damaging split on the government benches if Johnson\u2019s allies refuse to follow suit. One Tory minister said: \u201cThis should bring an end to the Boris psychodrama once and for all. We\u2019ve had enough of it \u2013 and of him. He\u2019s got nobody to blame but himself.\u201d Downing Street refused to say whether Sunak would vote on the report on Monday but it defended the committee. \u201cIt is a properly constituted committee carrying out work at the behest of parliament,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said. \u201cIt would not be right to traduce or criticise the work of the committee.\u201d The 106-page report, which accused Johnson of what amounted to an \u201cattack on our democratic institutions\u201d, found that the former MP was in serious contempt of parliament in five key ways: Misleading the Commons by claiming Covid rules and guidance were followed at all times in No 10 on four separate occasions as well as when he purported to correct the record; failing to tell MPs about his own knowledge of the gatherings; claiming he received \u201crepeated reassurances\u201d that rules had not been broken \u2013 when just two people had made the suggestion. Misleading the committee when he presented his evidence, many aspects of which were \u201cnot credible\u201d; being \u201cdisingenuous\u201d when putting forward his interpretation of government guidance; repeatedly insisting No 10 gatherings were within the rules because they were work events even though it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d he genuinely believed all guidance was followed. \u201cEgregious\u201d breach of confidence when he lashed out at the committee\u2019s provisional findings in his shock resignation, having received an advance draft; leaking parts of the draft within 24 hours despite being specifically warned not to by the committee. Impugning the committee by accusing it of \u201cegregious bias\u201d and likening it to a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d in a lengthy resignation statement that accused it of mounting a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d on him; doing so when he knew the committee would be unable to make a \u201csubstantive response\u201d, meaning his assertions would go unchallenged. Being complicit in a \u201ccampaign of abuse and intimidation\u201d against the committee that amounted to \u201can attack on our democratic institutions\u201d; being \u201cinsincere\u201d in his attempts to distance himself from the attacks on committee members, having previously claimed he had the \u201cutmost respect\u201d for its work; claiming the report \u201creeked of prejudice\u201d, which was a further attempt to undermine the parliamentary process. A special report is expected to be published in the next fortnight that could identify the MPs \u2013 thought to include Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 who may have committed contempt in a \u201csustained attempt, seemingly coordinated,\u201d to undermine the privileges committee. An official told the committee that No 10 had been an \u201coasis of normality\u201d during the pandemic, with birthday parties, leaving drinks and \u201cwine time Fridays\u201d all continuing. Staff were warned to be \u201cmindful\u201d of cameras as they left but it was \u201call a pantomime\u201d that was \u201cpart of a wider culture\u201d of rule-breaking. The committee said it took Johnson\u2019s explanations of 16 further gatherings at Chequers and Downing Street being considered by police at face value. Johnson insisted those events were within the rules and necessary to provide support to his pregnant wife, Carrie. But it warned: \u201cIf for any reasons it subsequently emerges that Mr Johnson\u2019s explanations are not true, then he may have committed a further contempt.\u201d A snap YouGov survey of more than 3,000 adults on Thursday suggested nearly seven in 10 believed Johnson knowingly misled parliament. That included just over half of voters who backed the Tory party under Johnson in the 2019 general election. Opposition parties called for Johnson to pay back the public money used to cover a \u00a3245,000 bill for his lawyers during the Partygate inquiry, with the Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, saying taxpayers should not pick up the cost. David Garfinkel, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an utter tragedy that Johnson was in charge when the pandemic struck and he should never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again. His fall from grace must serve as a lesson to other politicians to act with honesty and to serve the public as a whole, that is the only positive that can come from this.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/15/nottingham-attacks-suspect-is-former-nottingham-university-student", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nottingham attacks suspect is former Nottingham University student", "lead": "Man held by police after triple knife killings is understood to be Valdo Amiss\u00e3o Mendes Calocane", "author": "Vikram Dodd and Jessica Murray", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:30:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114145", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/32b9b374c2e3da397249c6355effddf626bfcd41/0_233_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "The suspect in the Nottingham triple knife killings is a former student at the University of Nottingham named Valdo Amiss\u00e3o Mendes Calocane, sources have said.

Calocane remains in custody and on Wednesday magistrates granted detectives an extension to hold him until Friday. Counter-terrorism officers are part of the investigation and electronic devices linked to the suspect \u2013 including a phone he was carrying when arrested \u2013 are being searched. Nothing yet points to an indication of an ideological motive. He is understood to have a history of mental health issues and was previously known to police. Sources say he came to the UK legally and that from no older than seven he settled in Nottingham, where he was educated. The university said: \u201cWe are devastated that the suspect is a former University of Nottingham student. The police have confirmed that this is not believed to be connected with the attack. Our focus remains on supporting the family and friends of Barney and Grace and our wider community. We will continue to support the police in any way we can.\u201d At a vigil in Nottingham\u2019s old market square on Thursday evening, Webber\u2019s mother, Emma, told the crowd to \u201chold no hate for any race, religion or colour\u201d in response to the attack. \u201cThe monstrous individual who shattered so many lives will not define us and I know he will receive the retribution he deserves,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, this evil person is just that. He is just a person. Please hold no hate that relates to any colour, sex or religion.\u201d Standing by her side, her son Charlie clutched a photograph of his brother to his chest as she told him Barney \u201cwas so proud of you\u201d. The family of Coates, who was described as a \u201cmassive, massive football fan\u201d, attended in Nottingham Forest football shirts. A number of Forest fans were in the crowd. Ross Middleton, the headteacher of Huntingdon Academy where Coates worked as a site manager, said Coates \u201clooked after people\u201d and \u201calways put the children first\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget how excited he was putting plans together and creating his showstopping Christmas displays,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent weeks he had helped year 3 with their sewing project and created castles for children\u2019s reading corners. He was full of fun with a mischievous glint in his eye.\u201d Coates\u2019 son, James, said his father had \u201ctouched a lot of hearts over the years, more than what we assumed and knew that he had\u201d. O\u2019Malley-Kumar\u2019s family fought back tears as they each delivered speeches to the crowd of thousands of Nottingham residents who came to lay flowers and pay respects. Her father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, became emotional as he said: \u201cWe were a four and now we are a three.\u201d Her mother, Sinead, said: \u201cAll they were doing was walking home.\u201d All the families paid tribute to how much the city of Nottingham had meant to their loved ones. \u201cNottingham, he really loved you,\u201d said Emma Webber. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t bloody get him home. We stand here and we feel your love and we are united in grief and shock and disbelief, and one day we will smile again, but it will take time.\u201d Earlier, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, visited the city to lay a floral wreath outside Nottingham Council House before an evening vigil. A handwritten note attached to the flowers read: \u201cIn memory of those who lost their lives, those who were injured and everyone who loves them. We are with you and with all the people of Nottingham.\u201d Nottinghamshire police said that after stabbing Coates, the attacker twice drove into pedestrians. \u201cHe attempted to run over a man in the Milton Street area, who remains in a serious condition in hospital. He then tried to run over two other pedestrians in the Sherwood Street area who are believed to have suffered minor injuries,\u201d the force said. It said that because its officers were behind the van when this happened, it had referred this incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, the police watchdog. An IOPC spokesperson said: \u201cWe received a referral from Nottinghamshire police on Wednesday informing us that a marked police car had been following behind the suspect\u2019s van for a short distance at the time it collided with two pedestrians in the area of Sherwood Street in the city centre on Tuesday morning. We are assessing the referral to decide what further action may be required of the IOPC.\u201d Calocane was arrested after the van stopped, and officers used a stun gun as they took him into custody."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/sudan-paramilitary-forces-blamed-assassination-khamis-abdallah-abbakar-government-official", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sudan: paramilitary forces blamed for assassination of West Darfur governor", "lead": "Khamis Abdallah Abbakar was murdered hours after criticising Rapid Support Forces on television", "author": "Zeinab Mohammed Salih in Khartoum and Jason Burke", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:21:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114163", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bb23ab421ab8aaf462d07125c91c69433ab7d2c4/0_59_3200_1920/500.jpg", "body": "Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been blamed for the assassination and mutilation of a senior government official, amid growing reports of mass killings in the restive Darfur region in the country\u2019s devastating war. Khamis Abdallah Abbakar, the governor of West Darfur, was murdered this week just hours after he gave an interview to a Saudi-owned TV station in which he criticised the RSF and described a \u201cgenocide\u201d.\u2028 The UN said \u201ccompelling eyewitness accounts attribute this act to Arab militias and the RSF\u201d, while the Darfur Lawyers Association condemned the act of \u201cbarbarism, brutality and cruelty\u201d. Sudan\u2019s war entered its third month on Thursday with a reported death toll now above 2,000, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project\u2019s latest figures, which cover fighting until 9 June. The true numbers of dead and injured is likely to be several times higher. The conflict pits the army, headed by Sudan\u2019s de facto leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the RSF, commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, an ex-warlord from Darfur who is also known as Hemedti. Burhan accused the RSF of the \u201ctreacherous attack\u201d in Darfur. The paramilitaries denied responsibility and said in a statement they condemned the \u201cassassination in cold blood\u201d of Abbakar, who was killed after being abducted from RSF protection, which \u201cthe governor had requested\u201d. Abbakar was from the Masaleet ethnic group, which has been targeted in recent weeks. Many Masaleet judges, lawyers, doctors, teachers, aid workers and other professionals have been killed in what appears to be a systematic effort to murder potential leaders.\u2028 Abbakar was the head of the Sudanese Coalition Movement, an armed group in Darfur, that was a signatory to the Juba peace agreement in 2020, which brought a fragile peace to the region. The Sudan analyst Kholood Khair of the Khartoum-based thinktank Confluence Advisory said in a tweet that the \u201cheinous assassination\u201d was meant \u201cto silence his highlighting of genocide \u2026 in Darfur\u201d. Khair added that it was unclear \u201cwhat the red lines are any more\u201d and urged for international \u201caction to protect the people of Darfur and elsewhere\u201d. The killing comes after US and Saudi mediation efforts were suspended after the collapse of multiple ceasefires amid flagrant violations by both sides. Darfur, one of the war\u2019s main battlegrounds, was already scarred by a two-decade conflict that left hundreds of thousands dead and more than 2 million displaced. Dagalo\u2019s RSF have their origins in the Janjaweed militias which the former authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir deployed against ethnic minorities in the region in 2003, drawing charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Homes and markets have been burnt to the ground, hospitals and aid facilities looted, and more than 149,000 people sent fleeing into neighbouring Chad. The Umma party, one of Sudan\u2019s main civilian groups, said El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, had been turned into a \u201cdisaster zone\u201d, and urged international organisations to provide help. The Darfur Lawyers Association reported that \u201ccross-border militias supported by the RSF\u201d had carried out \u201cmassacres and ethnic cleansing\u201d in El Geneina. The Masaleet suffered massive violence and displacement when they and other black African communities in Darfur rebelled in 2003 over decades of political and economic marginalisation by elites in Khartoum. \u2028Residents of El Geneina said the army and the police had armed the Masaleet people to fight the Arabs who took their lands. \u201cThere have been more than 100,000 refugees crossing to Chad, and several dozen injured by firearms. They also describe several hundred injured, possibly blocked in Geneina and other locations, and they also testify on the dangers of the roads to Chad, with targeted attacks on militias on those trying to cross the border,\u201d said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Tubiana, a veteran independent researcher on Darfur. \u201cThat level of violence unfortunately is not unprecedented in West Darfur, and reminds us of the most intense period of the attacks by both government forces and militias in 2003, exactly 20 years ago, and even before that. With the difference that today there is no clear decision-maker in Khartoum who could be pressured to stop the violence \u2013 it is much more chaotic.\u201d M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said about 6,000 people have fled El Geneina to take refuge in the town of Adr\u00e9 in eastern Chad over the last few days.\u2028On Wednesday, 32 people were brought to Adr\u00e9\u2019s hospital, including four women and four children, mainly from Tendelti and El Geneina. Dozens more were admitted today, MSF said. Most of the injuries are gunshot wounds. More than 100,000 Sudanese refugees have reached eastern Chad. The crisis has driven 2.2 million people from their homes, including 528,000 who have fled to neighbouring countries, says the International Organisation for Migration. MSF have called for the so far limited humanitarian response to be scaled up \u201cto respond to their most pressing needs while supporting as well the communities who host them and the thousands of refugees already in the region\u201d."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6c9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/15/west-ham-reject-arsenal-80m-declan-rice-bid-manchester-city-offer", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Arsenal to make new Declan Rice offer after West Ham reject initial \u00a380m", "lead": "Arsenal will make an improved offer for Declan Rice that will come close to matching West Ham\u2019s \u00a3100m valuation of the midfielder", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:17:29", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114182", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c02a456c9a14cd901003a3e0eabfbda04deb1eb2/53_260_4487_2692/500.jpg", "body": "Arsenal will make an improved offer for Declan Rice that will come close to matching West Ham\u2019s \u00a3100m valuation of the midfielder. West Ham turned down Arsenal\u2019s first bid of \u00a380m plus add-ons for Rice and are expecting Manchester City to enter the running. But the 24-year-old remains set on joining Mikel Arteta\u2019s side and the expectation is that he will move to the Emirates Stadium. West Ham are holding out for a record fee for Rice and intend to reject bids under \u00a3100m, as they want Arsenal to hit that figure and include add-ons. Arsenal\u2019s first proposal was spread over a number of years and contained add-ons that West Ham regarded as unrealistic. West Ham would prefer fewer instalments because it would boost their financial position. There is a feeling at the club that Arsenal\u2019s second proposal will still contain add-ons that are unlikely to be triggered. West Ham\u2019s hand would be strengthened by a bidding war, with a source predicting that an offer from City would \u201cblow Arsenal out of the water\u201d. Rice spoke to Pep Guardiola before the end of the season and the prospect of City entering the race could complicate matters for Arteta. The expectation had been that Rodri\u2019s form meant the champions did not need to spend big on a defensive midfielder. City are close to signing Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea, though they would need further reinforcements in midfield if they lose Ilkay G\u00fcndogan on a free transfer and Bernardo Silva to Paris Saint-Germain. There have been suggestions City could offer Kalvin Phillips to West Ham as part of a deal for Rice. Despite the growing tension between Arsenal and West Ham, the likelihood is that Rice will make the switch. He admires Arteta\u2019s style of football and there will be no issue over personal terms. Another factor is that Rice, who became a father last year, would prefer to stay in London and be close to his family. He also knows that he would be a regular starter at Arsenal, whereas the competition for places at City would be much fiercer. Ultimately there is confidence that negotiations will end with Arsenal paying a fee that could top \u00a3100m once add-ons are taken into account. An indication of their confidence in striking a deal with West Ham is that they are believed to have withdrawn their interest in the Brighton midfielder Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, who is a key target for Chelsea. Arsenal are also trying to sign the Chelsea forward Kai Havertz for \u00a360m. Rice has also been targeted by Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Newcastle. However Bayern have withdrawn after concluding that there is little chance of Rice moving to Germany. West Ham\u2019s co-owner David Sullivan admitted last week that Rice was going to leave. Rice has a year on his contract, with the option of an extra year, and has no intention of signing an extension. He helped West Ham win the Europa Conference League last week but is determined to compete at a higher level and play in the Champions League. West Ham will look to replace Rice with two midfielders, with Ajax\u2019s Edson \u00c1lvarez, Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse and Fulham\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Palhinha on their radar. West Ham have also held talks over signing Leicester\u2019s Harvey Barnes but face competition from Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham. Mark Warburton has left David Moyes\u2019s backroom staff a year after joining. There has been no fallout but both felt a split was the right decision. Warburton\u2019s departure will leave Moyes needing to add to his coaching team, which comprises Billy McKinlay, Kevin Nolan, Xavi Valero and Paul Nevin. Warburton came in after Moyes lost two of his most trusted figures, Stuart Pearce and Alan Irvine. West Ham are also weighing up whether to hire Tim Steidten as their new technical director. Steidten is the leading candidate but the German is not guaranteed to land the job. The 44-year-old, who left Bayer Leverkusen in March, has held at least two rounds of talks with Moyes."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ca", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/where-are-they-hope-fades-among-relatives-of-missing-after-greek-shipwreck", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Where are they?\u2019: anguish grows among relatives of missing after Greek shipwreck", "lead": "As family members arrive in Kalamata, search operation continues with negligible progress", "author": "Helena Smith in Kalamata", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:14:09", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114201", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/260d370f589fc841982a2e580a50e0923ad43473/0_0_6052_3632/500.jpg", "body": "Hope dies last and for Kassem Abo Zeed it was running out fast. Hope was the force that had led him to board a plane from Hamburg and fly to Greece after he heard that a boat carrying his wife had capsized off the country\u2019s southern coast. But by 2pm on Thursday, 36 hours after the blue fishing trawler packed with migrants and refugees had sunk in one of the worst maritime disasters in recent Greek history, hope was fading in a way he had prayed would never happen. \u201cWhy put us through such anguish?\u201d the 34-year-old Syrian asked, holding back tears, as his friend Hamza Ayash \u2013 whose brother Ayoub had also been onboard the doomed vessel \u2013 tried to comfort him outside Kalamata\u2019s coastguard building. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that hundreds of people were on the ship,\u201d Ayash said. \u201cWhere are they? We\u2019re beginning to lose hope.\u201d The two men were among the first relatives to have arrived in Kalamata, the port town that has become the nerve centre of the search and rescue operation. Of the estimated 700 men, women and children believed to have been on the vessel when it left the shores of Libya last week, only 104 have been found alive since it sank in waters described as some of the deepest in the Mediterranean at about midnight on Tuesday. Like all but one of the 78 dead found floating in the sea, all of the rescued are men. Syrians, Pakistanis, Afghanis and Egyptians, the survivors are now the only link to a chain of events that unfolded on the vessel as its smuggler captain, determined to reach Italy, negotiated seas that lie beyond the domain of any country. Almost all were described as exhausted and in a state of psychological shock. \u201cIt was difficult because the boat was in international waters,\u201d said Greece\u2019s acting civil protection minister, Vangelis Tournas, outside the harbour\u2019s warehouse where many survivors spent their first night back on land. \u201cOur coastguard approached the vessel and offered help as soon as it was informed by Italian authorities \u2026 but they [the smugglers] didn\u2019t want to respond. We ought to deplore those who for a few dollars exploit people in this way.\u201d Addressing reporters as an unusual summer rainstorm broke, Tournas said the search for survivors would continue, with a frigate, coastguard vessels, three military helicopters and merchant vessels combing seas off the Peloponnesian coast. \u201cOur goal is to save what can be saved. We will conduct the operation despite the weather.\u201d But by late on Thursday, officials were acknowledging the unpalatable: progress had been negligible. The ship had gone down in a matter of minutes, Greece\u2019s coastguard said, noting that none of the smugglers\u2019 human cargo were wearing lifejackets. When the 30-metre fishing trawler\u2019s engine stalled, the boat listed almost instantaneously, which officials attribute to the movement of the large number of people inside. And then the seas opened up, taking the capsized vessel in. Almost no one believes the ship will ever be found. \u201cThe chances of finding more people alive are minimal,\u201d Nikos Spanos, a retired Greek coastguard admiral, told the country\u2019s state-run broadcaster ERT. \u201cWe have seen old fishing boats like this before from Libya. They are not at all seaworthy. To put it simply, they are floating coffins.\u201d Abo Zeed and Ayash, natives of Deraa, the ancient Syrian city close to the Jordanian border, spoke of the long journey their loved ones had made to board the vessel in Libya\u2019s eastern region of Tobruk. \u201cMy wife Esra is 21. She had travelled with her younger brother Abdullah, crossing from Syria into Jordan and then on to Egypt and Libya,\u201d said Abo Zeed, who had previously made his own odyssey to Germany. \u201cThey paid 4,500 US dollars each for the passage,\u201d Ayash said. \u201cWe just want to know what happened to them. And if they are dead, as Muslims we want to bury them.\u201d In the rush of relief action, the shock for Greek officials and volunteers has been hard to ignore. Few disasters have cast such a pall over a community that while dealing with an emergency of such unexpected scope has also been left with questions that many thought they would never ask. \u201cKalamata hasn\u2019t really seen anything like this,\u201d said Giorgos Farvas, the town\u2019s deputy mayor. \u201cWe had an earthquake many years ago and some people died but here we\u2019re talking about possibly hundreds of deaths.\u201d Increasingly, Greek authorities believe women and children were below deck, crammed into an area more normally used to refrigerate hauls of fish. \u201cIt worries us that no more [survivors] have been found,\u201d said Nicolaos Spanoudakis, a police chief dispatched to Kalamata from Athens to help coordinate an inquiry otherwise overseen by the Greek coastguard. \u201cWe are working on the assumption that as many as 500 are missing. Women and children, it seems, were in the hold.\u201d Athens\u2019 caretaker government, which assumed office after last month\u2019s inconclusive election, has called three days of national mourning and political leaders have suspended electoral campaigns before fresh polls due on 25 June. The tragedy has raised unsettling questions that are bound to resonate beyond Greece and criticism of its former government\u2019s hardline stance on migration. Like few incidents before, it has shone a light on Europe\u2019s failure to provide safe routes for asylum seekers fleeing conflict, persecution and, increasingly, the effects of the climate crisis in Asia, Africa and the Middle East to seek opportunity in the west. \u201cThe policy that Europe has been following is greatly to blame,\u201d said Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s main opposition leader, as he visited Kalamata on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy that has turned the Mediterranean into a watery grave.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6cb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/boris-johnson-his-defence-over-partygate-report", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson: his defence over Partygate report", "lead": "The key points in the former PM\u2019s attack on committee members\u2019 integrity, evidence and conclusions", "author": "Kiran Stacey and Aubrey Allegretti", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:05:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114221", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1866065ff4dd5124c4b3fb8930e57a1b63420ec8/0_35_1201_721/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary fightback as he tries to wrestle back control of the narrative after the privileges committee released its report concluding that he deliberately misled parliament. A 1,700-word statement from the former prime minister sought to rip apart their findings \u2013 impugning the committee\u2019s integrity, evidence and conclusions. This is what he said, scrutinised in detail: It is now many months since people started to warn me about the intentions of the Privileges Committee. They told me that it was a kangaroo court \u2026 They also warned me that most members had already expressed prejudicial views \u2013 especially Harriet Harman \u2013 in a way that would not be tolerated in a normal legal process. Johnson began his letter by trying to sow doubt about the credibility of the committee. His allies talked of \u201cbias\u201d by the chair Harriet Harman and pointed to tweets from her. In one, she shared a post by Alastair Campbell accusing Johnson of lying. In a second, Harman wrote that if Johnson and Rishi Sunak accepted police fines then that would amount to an admission that they had misled the Commons. I knew exactly what events I had attended in No 10. I knew what I had seen, with my own eyes, and like the current PM, I believed that these events were lawful. I believed that my participation was lawful, and required by my job; and that is indeed the implication of the exhaustive police inquiry. The committee found it was \u201cunlikely\u201d he genuinely believed the parties were within the guidance. Johnson sought to claim that if he thought the events were within the rules and guidance, then he could not have misled parliament when they turned out to be in breach of both. But the suggestion stretched beyond the credulity of the committee, and many others. The only exception is the 19 June 2020 event, the so-called birthday party, when I and the then chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined in circumstances that I still find puzzling \u2026 So when on 1 Dec 2021 I told the House of Commons that \u2018the guidance was followed completely\u2019 (in No 10) I meant it. It wasn\u2019t just what I thought: it\u2019s what we all thought. Johnson knows there is at least one event where he has no wriggle room: the gathering in the cabinet room on his birthday. The police fined him for attending, meaning he unequivocally broke the law. He feigned ignorance as an excuse. Johnson also attempted to drag Rishi Sunak into the row, by pointing out that he was also fined for attending the event. His point was to show that others in government clearly thought that gathering, and others, were within the rules. I believed, correctly, that these events were reasonably necessary for work purposes. We were managing a pandemic. We had hundreds of staff engaged in what was sometimes a round-the-clock struggle against Covid. Their morale mattered for that fight. It was important for me to thank them. Johnson has argued that he viewed the events as work. But the committee found that his unwillingness to say whether he would have encouraged the public to attend such events was an implicit acknowledgment he did believe them to be against the rules. If we had genuinely believed these events to be unauthorised \u2013 with all the political sensitivities entailed \u2013 then there would be some trace in all the thousands of messages sent to me, and to which the committee has had access \u2026 Johnson skirted over the concerns that were raised by senior figures about some of the events. Jack Doyle, his director of communications, admitted it \u201cwould not be possible for me to say\u201d all the guidance was followed at all times. And Martin Reynolds, who was his principal private secretary, also said in evidence he cautioned against Johnson saying in parliament that all the guidance had been followed at all times \u2013 with the claim deleted from his briefing pack. They try, absurdly and incoherently, to say that the assurances of Jack Doyle and [Doyle\u2019s predecessor as communications director] James Slack were not enough to constitute \u2018repeated\u2019 assurances \u2013 completely and deliberately ignoring the sworn testimony of two MPs, Andrew Griffiths and Sarah Dines, who have also said that they heard me being given such assurances. Perhaps the craziest assertion of all is the committee\u2019s Mystic Meg claim that I saw the 18 Dec event [where guests were told to bring \u2018secret Santa\u2019 presents] with my own eyes. There was a \u201cplethora of evidence\u201d about \u201chow obvious it would have been to him\u201d things were happening that broke the law and Covid guidance, the committee found. It cited him directly passing the entrance to the press office, where the event that was \u201cbeyond desk drinks\u201d took place, with 25-40 people present. Johnson argued his mind was elsewhere with planning for a possible no-deal Brexit. The committee also took issue with the testimony of two Tory MPs \u2013 Dines and Griffiths \u2013 who were Johnson\u2019s aides at the time. It said they could provide neither the specific dates that assurances were given to him that all events were within the rules, nor who gave them to him. I was wrong to believe in the committee or its good faith \u2026 This decision means that no MP is free from vendetta, or expulsion on trumped up charges by a tiny minority who want to see him or her gone from the Commons. Trying to pin the blame on the committee is Johnson\u2019s strategy. But all MPs get to vote on the report. So a \u201ctiny minority\u201d do not have the powers to expel or sanction an individual politician. It is up to the whole House of Commons. For the privileges committee to use its prerogatives in this anti-democratic way, to bring about what is intended to be the final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination \u2013 that is beneath contempt. By calling what has happened an \u201cassassination\u201d, Johnson appeared to admit that his political career had been killed off.

It is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of today\u2019s main news stories. Kyiv reported progress in its newly launched counteroffensive, despite strong resistance from Russian troops. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told a briefing \u201cThere is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front].\u201d Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km (38 sq miles) of territory in its counteroffensive, a senior Ukrainian military commander claimed. Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov told a media briefing: \u201cWe are ready to continue fighting to liberate our territory even with our bare hands.\u201d Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato\u2019s secretary general revealed. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. A group of UN experts said they had written to Moscow raising concerns about the use of torture by Russian military forces on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war. Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress introduced legislation that would make it easier for Ukraine to fund its fight against Russian invaders by using seized and frozen Russian assets. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said it had summoned a Canadian diplomat in Moscow in protest over the confiscation of an Antonov plane in Toronto, and warned that Russian-Canadian relations were on the \u201cverge of being severed\u201d. Vladimir Putin and the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, pledged to deepen their two countries\u2019 \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d during a three-day state visit by Tebboune as the Kremlin seeks to pivot towards Asia and Africa. A Russian anti-war activist died in a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don where he had alleged he was being mistreated, his lawyer said. The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, said Russians living abroad in western countries should be closely monitored by security services, given Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. In Brussels, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says the Ukraine Defence Contact Group remained \u201claser-focused\u201d on meeting Ukraine\u2019s ground-based air-defence system needs. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog said a number of measures had been taken to stabilise the situation at Europe\u2019s largest atomic power plant. Rafael Grossi said inspectors would stay at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia, but that signing a document on security on the site was \u201cunrealistic\u201d while the two sides were still fighting. The US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark announced they will partner to send defence equipment \u2013 including hundreds of missiles \u2013 to Ukraine. A joint statement released by the British government said delivery of the equipment had already begun and should be completed \u201cwithin several weeks\u201d. As many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike earlier this week, prompting fury among Russian military bloggers. MEPs called on Nato allies to honour their commitment to Ukraine by inviting the country to join the defence alliance and support opening EU accession negotiations this year. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to allow the re-export of weapons to Ukraine, saying the move would be vital in combating the Russian invasion. In a video message shown in the Swiss parliament, he said: \u201cI know there is a discussion in Switzerland about the exportation of war material to protect and defend Ukraine. That would be vital. We need weapons so we can restore peace in Ukraine.\u201d Russian missiles hit two industrial facilities in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Thursday, and an elderly woman was killed by Russian fire in the southern Kherson region, local officials said. The Kryvyi Rih mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, reported no deaths in the latest attack on Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s home town, but said a 38-year-old man was reportedly wounded when three missiles struck two industrial enterprises overnight. Russian forces claimed they successfully hit drone production facilities in Ukraine using high-precision, long-range weapons. The head of Russia\u2019s electoral commission said the defence ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) consider it possible to hold elections on 10 September in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed, the state news agency Tass reported. Russia has said it plans to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream pipeline gas explosions. Follow our live coverage again tomorrow for the latest in Ukraine. Thank you for reading. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Thursday that he hoped for a positive outcome from Vladimir Putin\u2019s planned talks with African leaders on the future of a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine. Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato\u2019s secretary general has revealed, as Kyiv claimed further incremental progress in its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. As he arrived at a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels, the former prime minister of Norway said: The fact that training has started provides us with the option to also decide to deliver the planes and then the pilots will be ready to fly them. As recently as February, Joe Biden declined Ukrainian requests for the lightweight fighter aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is understood to have subsequently given firm commitments that the planes would be used only to target Russian forces within Ukraine. It will still take months to train Ukraine\u2019s pilots, who will have previously flown mainly in Soviet-standard aircraft. Ukraine does not yet even have runways suitable for F-16s, should Nato allies agree to provide the hardware. Beyond the provision of fighter jet training, it has been announced in Brussels that the US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark are sending \u201chigh-priority\u201d air defence equipment including hundreds of missiles to Ukraine and that the delivery will be completed within weeks. A group of UN experts said on Thursday they had written to Moscow raising concerns about the use of torture by Russian military forces on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war. The UN experts said the torture included electric shocks, hoodings and mock executions and had been carried out to extract intelligence, force confessions or in response to alleged support for Ukraine\u2019s forces, Reuters reports. The UN special rapporteur on torture, Alice Jill Edwards, said the alleged victims included civilians and prisoners of war. She said she had written to Moscow about this. A spokesperson for Russia\u2019s diplomatic mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moscow has previously denied torturing or mistreating prisoners of war and says it does not deliberately target civilians in Ukraine. While torture allegations have previously been levelled against both sides in the 15-month conflict, the team of UN independent experts said Russian forces\u2019 methods may be \u201cstate-endorsed\u201d. The consistency and methods of alleged torture suggested \u201ca level of coordination, planning and organisation, as well as the direct authorisation, deliberate policy or official tolerance from superior authorities,\u201d according to Edwards. She said: Obeying a superior order or policy direction cannot be invoked as justification for torture, and any individual involved should be promptly investigated and prosecuted by independent authorities. Russia\u2019s economy shrank by a revised 1.8% year on year in the first quarter of 2023, data from the Rosstat federal statistics service showed on Thursday, after growth of 3% in the same period of last year. Russia\u2019s economy defied early expectations of a double-digit collapse in 2022 but still contracted 2.1% after the west imposed sanctions in response to Moscow dispatching troops to Ukraine in February. Rosstat had previously forecast a 1.9% decline in the first quarter, Reuters reports. African leaders could propose a series of \u201cconfidence-building measures\u201d during their initial efforts to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, according to a draft framework document seen by Reuters on Thursday. Those measures could include a Russian troop pullback, removal of tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus, suspension of an international criminal court arrest warrant targeting Vladimir Putin, and sanctions relief. A cessation of hostilities agreement could follow and would need to be accompanied by negotiations between Russia and the west, the document states. Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress introduced legislation on Thursday that would make it easier for Ukraine to fund its fight against Russian invaders by using seized and frozen Russian assets. The US Congress has approved more than $100bn in military, humanitarian and economic aid for Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. While leaders of both parties insist US support for the Kyiv government remains strong, some members of Congress have questioned how long that level of aid can continue amid calls to clamp down on government spending. The bill\u2019s sponsors said their intention was to ensure Moscow pays for damage caused by the invasion, not US taxpayers. Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee and a sponsor of the bill, said: Over a year into Russia\u2019s full-scale war against Ukraine, more than $300bn in Russian sovereign assets remain frozen globally. Given Russia\u2019s brutality and continued war crimes against the Ukrainian people, it is only right that Russian government funds in the United States be seized and repurposed to help Ukraine rebuild its country. Among other things, the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (Repo) for Ukrainians Act introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives would give the US president the authority to confiscate Russian assets frozen in the US and transfer them to help Ukraine. It also would bar the release of funds to sanctioned Russian entities until Russia withdraws from Ukraine and agrees to provide compensation for harm caused by the war. The bill\u2019s other Republican sponsors include representatives Michael McCaul, chair of the House foreign affairs committee, and Joe Wilson, Thomas Kean and Brian Fitzpatrick. Democratic sponsors include Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and representative Marcy Kaptur, a co-chair of the congressional Ukraine caucus, as well as representatives Steve Cohen and Mike Quigley. Vladimir Putin and the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, pledged to deepen their two countries\u2019 \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d during a three-day state visit by Tebboune as the Kremlin seeks to pivot Russia towards Asia and Africa. The two leaders signed a declaration on \u201cdeep strategic partnership\u201d, among other agreements. Putin said: We are really happy to receive our friend, the president of Algeria, Mr Tebboune, in the Kremlin. Algeria is a key partner for us in the Arab world and in Africa. We will be glad to see you in St Petersburg. Relations with Algeria are of particular importance for our country. Tebboune said western pressure on Algeria would not have any impact, and both men stressed the Soviet Union\u2019s robust support for Algeria during and after its fight for independence from France. Tebboune said: Foreign countries may put pressure on us today but this will never affect our ties. Our ties never changed. Algeria has always supported Russia. Tebboune saidRussia had been providing his country with weapons to help it \u201cmaintain our independence in these difficult circumstances\u201d. The Russian foreign ministry tweeted that Vladimir Putin held talks with the president of Algeria, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, during a state visit to Russia. Putin reportedly said there was \u201ctangible potential for further development\u201d between the two nations. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had summoned a Canadian diplomat in Moscow in protest over the confiscation of an Antonov plane in Toronto, and warned that Russian-Canadian relations were on the \u201cverge of being severed\u201d. Canada on Saturday ordered the seizure of a Russian-registered Antonov-124 cargo plane at Toronto\u2019s airport, its first such asset seizure aimed at putting pressure on Moscow over the Ukraine invasion, Reuters reports. Russia told Brian Ebel, the deputy head of Canada\u2019s embassy in Moscow, that it viewed the plane seizure as \u201ccynical theft\u201d, according to a statement from the foreign ministry. In a statement, the Russian ministry said: [Canada\u2019s\u2019] Russophobic policy will entail the most serious repercussions for Russian-Canadian relations, which are on the verge of being severed through the fault of the Trudeau administration. The Canadian foreign ministry did not have an immediate comment. Canada announced the aircraft seizure while the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was in Kyiv on Saturday, where he announced $500m (\u00a3392m) in military aid for Ukraine. A Russian anti-war activist has died in a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don where he had alleged he was being mistreated, his lawyer said today. Anatoly Berezikov\u2019s lawyer Irina Gak said in a video posted on Facebook that the body of her client, who had been due to be released on Thursday, had been taken to a morgue on Wednesday. A video filmed on Wednesday showed Gak standing outside the detention centre where 40-year-old Berezikov had been held as an ambulance that she said was there to collect his body drove in, Reuters reports. These claims have not been independently verified. In the video, Gak said Berezikov had complained of beatings and of being given electric shocks and had told her he feared for his life. According to Gak, Berezikov was arrested after he posted leaflets around the city advertising a Ukrainian government project called I Want to Live, which helps Russian soldiers voluntarily surrender. Rostov-on-Don is the capital of a region adjoining Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine. According to OVD-Info, a human rights monitoring group, nearly 20,000 people have been detained for protesting against Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine since the start of the invasion. They claim criminal cases have been launched against more than 580 people. The Polish deputy prime minister, Mariusz B\u0142aszczak, reaffirmed his support for Ukraine, saying he had \u201cno doubts\u201d that Vladimir Putin\u2019s true intentions were to \u201cgo further\u201d after conquering Ukraine. The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, said on Thursday that Russians living abroad in western countries should be closely monitored by security services, given Moscow\u2019s \u201caggressive war\u201d in Ukraine. The Czech leader and former chair of the Nato military committee said he was sympathetic to Russians outside the country finding it hard to cope with the invasion but in the context of a war, security measures should be more stringent. He told the Prague-based, US-financed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: When there is an ongoing war, the security measures related to Russian nationals should be stricter than in normal times. All Russians living in western countries should be monitored much more than in the past because they are citizens of a nation that leads an aggressive war,\u201d Pavel said. That\u2019s simply the cost of war. He said the situation was similar to the second world war when more than 100,000 Japanese descendants based in the US were under \u201ca strict monitoring regime as well\u201d as they were placed in local internment camps. Pavel also said he expected the July Nato summit in Vilnius to voice clear support for Kyiv\u2019s membership of the alliance. He said: I strongly believe that all the leaders will understand that having Ukraine onboard \u2013 both in Nato and EU \u2013 is probably the only guarantee [of] how to ensure stability in this region, how to make both Nato and EU stronger, and how to keep Russia and its aggressive policies at bay. I see a number of countries agreeing on a long-term plan of support to Ukraine that will not be based on one-off contributions but on a carefully planned long-term procedure. In Brussels, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says the Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting has concluded and it remains \u201claser-focused\u201d on meeting Ukraine\u2019s ground-based air-defence system needs. He added: That\u2019s especially important since Russia has ruthlessly ramped up its missile and drone attacks over the past month against Ukraine\u2019s cities. Zelenskiy\u2019s former spokesperson has shared this video of Kyiv graduates waltzing in the subway during an air raid alert: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has said a \u201cnumber of measures\u201d have been taken to stabilise the situation at Europe\u2019s largest atomic power plant. Rafael Grossi said inspectors would stay at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia (see also this earlier post), but that signing a document on security on the site was \u201cunrealistic\u201d while the two sides were still fighting. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief visited the plant, in southern Ukraine, today after meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss concerns about the site. Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister, Alexei Sazanov, has said the country is approaching the tax ceiling for commodity industries. He cited what he called weak global demand for its products, reports Interfax news agency. The US, UK, Netherlands and Denmark have announced they will partner to send defence equipment \u2013 including hundreds of missiles \u2013 to Ukraine. A joint statement released by the British government said delivery of the equipment had already begun and should be completed \u201cwithin several weeks\u201d. As many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike earlier this week, prompting fury among Russian military bloggers. While the details remain unclear and unconfirmed, a number of Russian Telegram channels have been discussing the attack, which they say took place near Kreminna, an eastern town in the Luhansk region where there has been heavy fighting. The alleged incident took place as soldiers were gathered and made to wait for two hours for a speech from a divisional commander, identified by some as Sukhrab Akhmedov, of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army, an already controversial figure who had been blamed for the deaths of large numbers of his troops in a botched offensive last year. According to the Russian military blogger Rybar, the soldiers who were due to be deployed on an offensive had been told to muster for a speech. The tragic incident occurred near Kreminna, in one of the divisions that was about to go on the offensive. For two hours, people stood in a crowd in one place and waited for the division commander to deliver a motivational speech. But instead, Himars and enemy artillery spoke. Rybar added there \u201cwere fewer casualties in several days of fighting in the south Donetsk direction than from the criminal stupidity of the division commander\u201d. Other military bloggers quickly weighed in. \u201cIf by the middle of the second year of the war there are commanders who take the columns to the front, make the personnel form a big heap and then wait for the enemy\u2019s artillery to hit them, then such commanders should be shot in front of the columns, even if they are colonels or generals,\u201d said one. \u201cWe are at war with our own stupidity and negligence,\u201d said another. The strike was given additional credence by the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, which included it in its daily updated on the conflict: ISW has observed both of the 20th CAA\u2019s divisions, the 144th and 3rd Motorized Rifle Ddivisions, operating in the Kreminna area for the past several months and could not confirm which division was struck by the Ukrainian forces. One milblogger[military blogger] suggested that the reported Ukrainian HIMARSimars strike killed around 100 Russian personnel and wounded another 100, although ISW has not observed any visual confirmation of the strike or its aftermath.[9] The outrage is reminiscent of previous instances of notable irresponsible Russian military actions resulting in dramatic losses, particularly the 31 December 2022, Ukrainian strike on a large Russian force concentration in Makiivka, Donetsk oblast. MEPs have called on Nato allies to honour their commitment to Ukraine by inviting the country to join the defence alliance and support opening EU accession negotiations this year, a press release from the European parliament says. There were 425 votes in favour of the resolution and 38 against, with 42 abstentions. The release says: MEPs stress that they expect that the \u201caccession process will start after the war is over and be finalised as soon as possible\u201d. Until full membership is achieved, the EU and its member states, together with Nato allies and like-minded partners, must work closely with Ukraine to develop a temporary framework for security guarantees, MEPs say, which is to be implemented immediately after the war. Parliament emphasises that Ukraine\u2019s integration in both Nato and the EU would enhance regional and global security and strengthen the bonds between Ukraine and the Euro-Atlantic community. MEPs condemned \u201cin the strongest possible terms Russia\u2019s destruction of the Kakhovka dam\u201d on 6 June, which they said had caused extensive flooding and created an environmental disaster as well as ecocide in Ukraine. All those responsible for war crimes, including the destruction of the dam, would be held accountable in line with international law, they added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to allow the re-export of weapons to Ukraine, saying the move would be vital in combatting the Russian invasion. In a video message shown in the Swiss parliament, he said: I know there is a discussion in Switzerland about the exportation of war material to protect and defend Ukraine. That would be vital We need weapons so we can restore peace in Ukraine. Switzerland has a longstanding policy of barring any country that buys Swiss arms from re-exporting them to the parties in a conflict. The country also imposed a specific Swiss embargo on munitions going to either Russia or Ukraine in November last year, Reuters reports. Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the Swiss parliament via video message, where he asked Switzerland to take a leading role in the global peace summit on Ukraine, Reuters reports. Here are some images from the wires. More information to come \u2026 Russian missiles hit two industrial facilities in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Thursday, and an elderly woman was killed by Russian fire in the southern Kherson region, local officials said. Kryvyi Rih mayor Oleksandr Vilkul reported no deaths in the latest attack on Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s home town, but said a 38-year-old man had been wounded when three missiles struck two industrial enterprises overnight. On Telegram, Vilkul wrote: The destruction is significant. The attack on Kryvyi Rih followed missile strikes that killed at least 12 people in the city on Tuesday. Russia denies targeting civilians, but Ukrainian officials said none of the buildings hit had any links to the armed forces, Reuters reports. Ukraine\u2019s military also reported a new Russian attack on the southern port city of Odesa overnight but said all 18 drones launched by Russia had been shot down. An 80-year-old woman was killed and another person wounded in an attack on the Zelenivka settlement in Kherson in southern Ukraine, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Russia\u2019s Tass news agency quoted Moscow-installed officials in Russian-occupied territory in the Kherson region, which was hit by flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, as saying a child had been killed by Ukrainian shelling. Both sides have reported heavy fighting in the early stages of a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km, or 38 sq miles, of territory in its counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian military commander claimed on Thursday. Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov told a media briefing: We are ready to continue fighting to liberate our territory even with our bare hands. He confirmed that in the early stages of the offensive, which Ukraine said had begun last week, seven settlements had been liberated in the eastern region of Donetsk and in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, Reuters reports. The army has advanced by to 3km (1.8 miles) near the village of Mala Tokmachka in the Zaporizhzhia sector and by up to 7km near a village south of Velyka Novosilka in the Donetsk sector, military officials said. Russia has not officially acknowledged the Ukrainian advances. These claims have not been independently verified. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog visited Europe\u2019s largest atomic power plant on Thursday in southern Ukraine, where the Kakhovka dam burst earlier this month. The visit was announced by Ukraine\u2019s national nuclear energy company, Energoatom, in a Telegram post. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)chief, met Tuesday in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss concerns about the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm over the facility, which has repeatedly been caught in the crossfire since Russia launched its war on Ukraine in February 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. Last week, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine\u2019s partially Russian-occupied Kherson region added a new concern. The dam, further down the Dnipro River, helped keep water in a reservoir that cools the plant\u2019s reactors. The plant\u2019s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features. Russia\u2019s central election commission on Thursday set the date for regional elections in four Ukrainian provinces that Moscow claims to have annexed for 10 September coinciding with votes in other Russian regions, state news agency RIA reported. Tass, another state news agency, cited election chief Ella Pamfilova as saying that Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) considered it possible to hold the votes in September. Ruslan Stefanchuk, chair of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, has said the European parliament expects that the summits in Vilnius and Washington in the coming months will mark the start of Ukraine\u2019s accession to Nato after strong support for the country\u2019s integration into the Euro-Atlantic community. Nato sees no sign that Russia has changed its nuclear stance, the head of the military alliance said Thursday, after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, claimed that Belarus had already received some tactical nuclear weapons from Moscow. In an interview on state television on Tuesday, Lukashenko brashly warned that he would not hesitate to order their use if Belarus faced an act of aggression. The Russian president Vladimir Putin has said the weapons will be deployed to Belarus next month and will remain under Moscow\u2019s exclusive control. At the Nato headquarters in Brussels, Belgium the secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters: We are, of course, closely monitoring what Russia is doing. So far, we haven\u2019t seen any changes in the nuclear posture that requires any changes in our posture. Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric and messaging is reckless and dangerous. Russia must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Russia has invested heavily in new modern nuclear capabilities and also deployed more nuclear capabilities, including close to Nato borders, for instance, in the high north.\u201d Nato\u2019s secretive nuclear defence planning group is due to meet on Friday. Russian forces successfully hit drone production facilities in Ukraine using high-precision, long-range weapons, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Thursday, according to the state-run RIA news agency. The ministry also said Russian air defences had intercepted five US-built Himars-launched missiles and shot down 25 drones, the Tass news agency also reported. These claims have not been independently verified. More information to come \u2026 Kyiv on Thursday reported progress in its newly launched counteroffensive, despite strong resistance from Russian troops. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told a briefing: There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front]. Around the frontline hotspot of Bakhmut, \u201cthe enemy is pulling up additional reserves and is trying with all its might to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces\u201d, according to AFP Still, Maliar reported an advance of more than 3km (1.8 miles) in the area of Bakhmut. Oleksiy Gromov of the Ukrainian armed forces\u2019 general staff said Ukrainian forces have recaptured seven settlements and more than 100 sq km of territory. Russia claims to have repelled all Ukrainian assaults. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the soldiers who have lost their lives have not died in vain because Ukraine will defeat Russia. He said Ukrainians would honour their memory by winning and \u201cliving in freedom\u201d. The head of Russia\u2019s electoral commission has said that the country\u2019s defence ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) consider it possible to hold elections in September in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed, state news agency Tass reported on Thursday. Russia does not fully control the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and fighting is ongoing in all four regions. The regions are scheduled to elect local governors in September, Reuters reports. Russia declared the regions part of its own territory after hastily conducting what it called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine last September that Kyiv and the west denounced as illegal and coercive. Russia has said it plans to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream pipeline gas explosions. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the war in Ukraine is a \u201cmarathon, not a sprint\u201d and that America will \u201cstand with Ukraine for the long haul\u201d. He made the comments at a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. Also speaking in Brussels, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said defence ministers meet today at a \u201ccritical time\u201d for the war in Ukraine in a \u201cmore dangerous world\u201d. Oleksandr Vilkul, the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, has said that missile strikes on an industrial complex in the city caused \u201csignificant\u201d damage, but the two enterprises that had been hit \u201chad nothing to do with the military.\u201d Handing over to Mabel Banfield-Nwachi now. Thanks for reading. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, has arrived at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports. Grossi is expected to inspect the plant after last week\u2019s breach of the Kakhovka dam. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson has said that Russia intends to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions. Meanwhile, the Kremlin accused Australia of being \u201chostile\u201d and of \u201cRussophobic hysteria\u201d after it refused to grant approval for its plans to build a new embassy in Canberra, reports Reuters. It also said it saw no positive prospects of renewing the Black Sea grain deal, claiming that parts of the accord affecting Russia remained unfulfilled. A Kremlin spokesperson said: Work is ongoing, but to be honest we don\u2019t see any particularly positive prospects. Everything that was agreed on regarding us has not been fulfilled. The current situation, he said, could not go on indefinitely. Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a resident of the southern Bryansk region who it said had been gathering data on security forces in areas bordering Ukraine, Russian state news agency Tass reports. Separately, it said, the FSB had detained two men in the southern Stavropol region on suspicion of planning to blow up the interior ministry headquarters in the city of Pyatigorsk. The RIA news agency said the two men were believed to be supporters of the Islamic State group, reports Reuters. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has reportedly been pictured on a visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukrainian pilots have started training to fly F-16 fighters, the Nato secretary general has said. Jens Stoltenberg was speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato defence ministers. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked Norway and Denmark for their new joint defence package announced earlier (see also this post). He tweeted: A child was killed by Ukrainian shelling in the partly Russian-held southern Kherson region, Reuters reports, citing the Tass news agency. Kherson is one of four regions Russia claims to have annexed from Ukraine last year, though its forces do not fully control the territory. Vladimir Putin has praised his \u201cdear friend\u201d Xi Jinping on the Chinese leader\u2019s 70th birthday. The Russian president told Xi \u201cit is difficult to overestimate the efforts you have been making to foster the comprehensive partnership\u201d between his country and China, which have ramped up cooperation in recent years, reports AFP. He expects \u201cconstructive dialogue ... to continue for the sake of the Russian and Chinese people\u201d, he said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the war in Ukraine is a \u201cmarathon, not a sprint\u201d and that America will \u201cstand with Ukraine for the long haul\u201d. In public opening remarks at the meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group at Nato HQ in Brussels he paid tribute to the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, who he was earlier pictured embracing, and said Ukraine \u201cstands well positioned for the challenges ahead.\u201d \u201cMake no mistake, we will stand with Ukraine for the long haul,\u201d he said, adding that US commitment is reflected in its security and defence support. The contact group, he said, has been focused on protecting Ukrainian infrastructure with air defence assets and will continue to adapt systems to meet changing needs on the ground. In today\u2019s meeting they will talk about future training plans, he said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said the attack on Kryvyi Rih is \u201cone more reminder of the war\u2019s devastating consequences to civilians\u201d. The Russian missile attack \u201ckilled nearly a dozen people and injured many more\u201d, he said, adding that recently people have had to ration water due to the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in Kherson. The war was at a \u201ccritical and historic moment\u201d, he told the Ukraine defence contact group at Nato HQ in Brussels. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is about to make his opening remarks in Brussels. Ukraine said it intercepted one cruise missile and 20 drones overnight. But it said three other missiles struck \u201cindustrial installations\u201d in the Dnipropetrovsk region in Ukraine\u2019s centre-east, reports AFP. Meanwhile, the Moscow-installed governor of Crimea said Russian forces had downed nine drones over its territory, without causing any casualties. It comes after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, claimed on Tuesday that his forces were inflicting \u201ccatastrophic\u201d losses on Ukrainian troops. Nato members are racing to complete a plan to provide long-term support to Ukraine, but are wrestling with now best to assure its security until it can join the military alliance, reports Reuters citing US and European officials. The plan is expected to be approved next month at the Nato summit in Vilnius. Tweeting from Nato HQ in Brussels, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, pledges continued support to Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d. He is due to deliver public opening remarks at the meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group later this morning. Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Center for Civil Liberties, has shared a picture of a \u201ccabinet with children\u2019s books\u201d from flooded Kherson, which she said had floated to the Odesa shore: Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric is \u201creckless and dangerous\u201d, the Nato secretary general has said. Speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato defence ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said Russia\u2019s behaviour is \u201cpart of a pattern\u201d which Nato has responded to. \u201cIf we want a just and enduring peace\u201d then Nato has to continue with its military support for Ukraine, he added. He said he expects Nato leaders to extend their defence spending pledges, but that he doesn\u2019t expect it to be agreed until the Nato summit in Vilnius next month. Speaking in Brussels, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said defence ministers meet today at a \u201ccritical time\u201d in a \u201cmore dangerous world\u201d. He said: Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive, what we see is fierce fighting. It\u2019s still early days but we also see that Ukrainians are making gains and that Ukraine is able to liberate occupied land. He highlights support Nato allies have been giving to Ukraine \u201cfor many many months actually makes a difference on the battlefield\u201d. They will be looking at how to sustain support in meeting today. \u201cThe war in Ukraine just demonstrates the need to stand with Ukraine\u201d and for continued support, he said. They also plan to strengthen defence spending. Today they will meet defence industry members and agree at the meeting \u201cnew capability targets\u201d to ensure sufficient ammunition which he said will be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than previously. \u201cUkraine needs many different types of support\u201d but focus will be on sustainment, he said during questions. Nato defence ministers are meeting in Brussels today. A doorstep statement by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is due to come shortly. Norway and Denmark have agreed to donate an additional 9,000 rounds of artillery to Ukraine. Norway will send shells and Denmark fuses and propellant charges, the Norwegian government announced. The Norwegian defence minister, Bj\u00f8rn Arild Gram, said: Ukraine has an urgent need for artillery ammunition. We have therefore decided to join forces with Denmark for a new donation, so that Ukraine receives the ammunition as quickly as possible. It is important that we continue to stand together in demonstrating our support of Ukraine. Norway will continue to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion forces as long as it is needed. The acting Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said Denmark would additionally donate 1,500 complete artillery rounds and 500 shells. The breach of the Kakhovka dam will not affect Russia\u2019s crop forecasts, the Russian deputy prime minister, Viktoria Abramchenko, has said, according to the state-owned news agency Tass. Hi, I\u2019ll be looking after the blog for the next few hours. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@theguardian.com The Australian government has rushed through special legislation allowing it to cancel Russia\u2019s lease on a site for a new embassy near the country\u2019s parliament, citing national security concerns. Prime minister Anthony Albanese promised to act \u201cquickly to ensure the leased site does not become a formal diplomatic presence\u201d. The Russian government took legal action after a decision in August to terminate its lease on a block of land in the capital, Canberra. On 31 May the Russian government won its case in Australia\u2019s federal court, which found the termination was \u201cinvalid and of no effect\u201d. Albanese told reporters in Canberra the government had \u201creceived very clear security advice as to the risk presented by a new Russian presence so close to parliament House\u201d. Australia\u2019s home affairs minister said \u201cthe principal problem with the proposed second Russian embassy in Canberra is its location. This location sits directly adjacent to Parliament House.\u201d The governor of Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region has shared images that are reportedly from the site of the strikes on Kryvyi Rih. Serhiy Lysak said that two industrial complexes were hit in overnight strikes on the city, injuring one person. While the damage was reported to be \u2018\u201csignificant\u201d, the city\u2019s mayor said the two enterprises that had been hit \u201chad nothing to do with the military.\u201d The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Japan is in talks to provide artillery shells to the US to bolster stocks for Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive against Russia. To date, Japan has only provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine. The report claims that Tokyo is considering supplying 155mm artillery shells \u201cunder a 2016 agreement that allows the Japan and the US to share ammunition as part of their longstanding security alliance.\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held talks earlier this month in Tokyo with Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada. After the meeting, Austin praised Japan for the nonlethal military support it has given Ukraine and said additional assistance would be welcome. In March, the EU\u2019s most senior diplomat warned that there would be \u201cdifficulties\u201d if western countries failed to reach a deal to replenish Ukraine\u2019s dwindling stocks of ammunition. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. The commander, Adam Delimkhanov, heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia\u2019s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya\u2019s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. Kadyrov, who has led Chechnya since 2007 and is a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that Delimkhanov was \u201calive and well and not even wounded\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian media, citing the parliamentary press service, said that Delimkhanov had been wounded in Ukraine. It followed rumours on Ukrainian social media channels that the Chechen commander had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. Oleksandr Vilkul, the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, has said that missile strikes on an industrial complex in the city caused \u201csignificant\u201d damage, but the two enterprises that had been hit \u201chad nothing to do with the military.\u201d Three missiles hit two industrial enterprises overnight, Vilkul said, adding that a fourth was shot down by air defences. Thank you to the employees of the enterprises who, after the announcement of the air raid alert, went to the shelter, because of which they remained unharmed \u2026 All important infrastructure, public transport, social and medical institutions [in] the city work stably.\u201d Vilkul said that at noon local time, a planned explosion would be carried out for \u201cproduction purposes\u201d. Odesa was reportedly targeted by Russian strikes overnight, after already enduring a deadly wave in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Ukraine\u2019s southern military command released a statement in the early hours of Thursday morning, saying Russia was attacking \u201cwith unmanned aerial vehicles\u201d \u2013 meaning drones \u2013 and there was \u201calso a threat of a missile attack\u201d, while advising residents to go to shelters. Officials later said that all 20 drones that attacked in the south were destroyed by air defence forces. On Wednesday, three people were killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on Odesa, Ukrainian forces said. Authorities said that air defences downed two of the Russian Kalibr cruise missiles launched on Wednesday morning, but the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. Ukrainian military officials said that Wednesday\u2019s attack on Odesa was \u201capparently aimed at the objects sought by the enemy in the area of logistics support for the defence forces.\u201d Russian cruise missiles hit two industrial complexes in the central city of Kryvyi Rih overnight, according to Serhiy Lysak, the region\u2019s governor. Lysak said the strikes caused significant damage, including broken gas pipelines. Fires broke out at enterprises, which rescuers have already put out.\u201d A 38-year-old man was injured in the attack and has been hospitalised. Military officials said that four cruise missiles were launched by Russia overnight. One of the missiles was destroyed by air defences, the rest hit industrial facilities in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Kryvyi Rih is located. It\u2019s the second time that Kryvyi Rih \u2013 Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s home city \u2013 has been targeted by Russian airstrikes this week. On Tuesday morning, at least 12 people were killed and many more were wounded after a missile struck an apartment block and a food warehouse in the city. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine, my name is Jonathan Yerushalmy. The central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has been hit by Russian airstrikes for the second time this week. Cruise missiles struck two industrial enterprises, the region\u2019s governor said. A 38-year-old man was injured in the attacks. Elsewhere, Ukraine\u2019s port city of Odesa was targeted by Russian airstrikes for the second day in a row. Users on Ukrainian social media reported hearing explosions and Ukraine\u2019s southern military command said that Russia was attacking \u201cwith unmanned aerial vehicles\u201d and there was also \u201ca threat of a missile attack.\u201d More on that shortly, first here\u2019s are the other key developments from the last 24 hours: Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west\u2019s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. \u201cThis is incredibly difficult,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare.\u201d Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the Ukrainian deputy defence minister described as \u201cextremely fierce\u201d fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. \u201cIt is still early days and we do not know if this will be a turning point,\u201d he said. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies quoted a senior official in Russia\u2019s nuclear industry as saying Grossi was likely to visit the plant on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to side with his top military commanders in calling for Russia\u2019s \u201cvolunteer detachments\u201d fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The order from Moscow had been seen as an attempt to rein in the Wagner mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, by incorporating them into the army. Western microchips and other components coming largely via China are being used to manufacture Russian cruise and ballistic missiles that are being launched at Ukraine, Kyiv has said in a presentation prepared for G7 members this week. The document calls for the world\u2019s leading economies to further tighten export controls. The Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. Adam Delimkhanov heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia\u2019s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya\u2019s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for \u201ccreating an extremist organisation\u201d, Reuters reported, citing the rights group OVD-Info.

Is a new puzzle game launched by the New York Times original, or does it have connections to a long-running BBC programme? Victoria Coren Mitchell, host of the BBC\u2019s Only Connect, floated the question on Twitter in response to the US newspaper\u2019s associate puzzle editor sharing its new game Connections. In the BBC programme, contestants are asked to solve a wall of 16 clues, grouping four sets of four seemingly unconnected things. The NYT game asks players to group four sets of four words with a common thread. On Twitter, Coren Mitchell and others were quick to draw comparisons to the popular British quizshow, now into its 18th series. \u201cDo you know this has been a TV show in the UK since 2008 ?!\u201d asked Coren Mitchell in reply to Wyna Liu, the paper\u2019s associate puzzle editor. \u201cIt\u2019s so similar I guess you must do?\u201d \u201cIf you need a hand at all, I\u2019ve written over 750 of these for Only Connect,\u201d wrote Mike Turner, a senior writer for Only Connect, who also drew comparisons to the Radio Times magazine which runs a similar game weekly. A former contestant of the show, Kat Brown, also chimed in: \u201cEr, I was on the TV show of this game just this year. The 18th season of this show.\u201d The New York Times has looked to the UK for inspiration before. In 2022, it acquired the blockbuster viral word game Wordle for an undisclosed seven-figure sum. It was originally created by Josh Wardle, who wrote the game to amuse his girlfriend. The Welsh software engineer, based in Brooklyn, said at the time that it didn\u2019t \u201cfeel great\u201d that the game had gone viral, making him feel a sense a responsibility to players.

Dame Sue Carr, an appeal court judge and former vice-chair of the Judicial Appointments Commission, will take up the position on 1 October, becoming the first woman in the role that dates back to the 13th century. Only two people \u2013 both women \u2013 applied for the job. An announcement on Thursday said King Charles had approved her appointment as \u201cthe lord chief justice\u201d, although there is doubt about what title she will take, given the lack of precedent. In an interview broadcast on Tuesday, the lord chancellor, Alex Chalk KC, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Law in Action that the new head of the judiciary would be able to choose her title. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s got to be a title that she is comfortable with,\u201d said Chalk. \u201cAnd, within reason, I think I\u2019ll probably be led by what she has to say.\u201d A judicial source said any decision or change to the title \u201cwill be not made in haste and are for a later date\u201d. Carr was educated at Wycombe Abbey school and read law at Trinity College, Cambridge. She was called to the bar in 1987, specialising in general commercial law, and was made a QC, aged 38, in 2003. Her judicial career began in 2009 in crime, when she became a recorder (part-time judge). She was appointed to the high court, Queen\u2019s bench division in 2013. Carr was the first female high court judge to sit in the technology and construction court and the second to sit in the commercial court. She also sat on the investigatory powers tribunal between 2014 and 2016. She was appointed as a lady justice of appeal in 2020. She speaks French and German and is a keen musician, singing with the bar choral society and playing the piano. She is married with three children. The judiciary is attempting to increase the diversity of the profession. Women make up 35% of court judges, up from 24% in 2014, but the Law Society has estimated it will be another decade before they account for half of the judiciary, reflecting their prevalence in society. The proportion of women in senior court appointments is also lower than in more junior roles. Only one of the 12 supreme court judges is a woman. Applicants were told they were expected to serve for at least four years given the challenges of reducing the outstanding caseloads across jurisdictions and the drive for modernisation across courts and tribunals. Carr succeeds Lord Burnett, who is retiring at the end of September having taken up the position in 2017. The lord chief justice\u2019s main responsibilities are representing the views of the judiciary to parliament and government, the welfare, training and guidance of judges, discussing the provision of resources to the judiciary \u2013 which are allotted by the lord chancellor \u2013 with government and the deployment of judges and allocation of work in courts. The appointment is made by the king on the advice of Chalk and the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, following the recommendation of an independent selection panel."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6cf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/rammstein-sexual-assault-allegations-till-lindemann-berlin-investigated", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rammstein: sexual assault allegations against Till Lindemann to be investigated", "lead": "Berlin prosecutors say investigation against German singer is based on suspicion of abuse after concerts", "author": "Kate Connolly in Berlin", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:44:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114300", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ab713ba4652c4a5fa7d185b8dfb2b37fa420c4a3/0_69_3298_1979/500.jpg", "body": "Berlin state prosecutors have launched an investigation into sexual assault allegations against the lead singer of the German metal band Rammstein, Till Lindemann. The prosecutors confirmed to German media that the investigation was based on the initial suspicion of sexual abuse as well as drug-related activity. The announcement follows allegations made by a number of women that they were picked out to have sex with Lindemann at concerts. Shelby Lynn from Northern Ireland, who attended a Rammstein concert in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, told the BBC she suspected her drink had been spiked and that she had been \u201cgroomed for sex\u201d with Lindemann. She has said she did not have sex with the frontman. Lindemann, 60, has repeatedly denied the allegations through his lawyers, saying they were \u201cwithout exception untrue\u201d. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Berlin public prosecution\u2019s office said it had initiated preliminary proceedings against Lindemann \u201cover allegations relating to sexual offences and the distribution of drugs\u201d. Universal Music, which represents Rammstein\u2019s recorded music and publishing business, said on Thursday that it had suspended marketing and promotional activities for the band. \u201cThe accusations against Till Lindemann have shocked us and we have the greatest respect for the women who have spoken out so courageously in public in this case,\u201d the label said in a statement. Lynn, who was the first woman to make allegations against Lindemann, welcomed the investigation. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that our voices are finally being heard and being taken seriously,\u201d she told the newspaper Die Welt. She added that after Lithuanian police decided not to pursue the complaint and the denials made by Lindemann\u2019s lawyers, the decision of Berlin authorities to go ahead with an investigation \u201cmeans a lot to those of us affected by this\u201d. Lynn had contacted the Lithuanian police after a recent Rammstein concert there, and allegedthere had been a row backstage involving her and the singer, after she had rejected his attempts to have sex with her and he had reacted angrily. She also reported having gaps in her memory, and finding bruises on her body after the encounter. \u201cI am almost 100% certain that I was given drugs because I have never felt like I did,\u201d she said. On Wednesday, Lynn said she had appealed to Lithuanian police to rethink their decision not to pursue an investigation. In reaction to the allegations, Berlin authorities have announced that aftershow parties at three Rammstein concerts to take place in the German capital from mid-July are to be forbidden. Tickets to the concerts at the Olympic stadium, costing between \u20ac82.5o (\u00a370.68) and \u20ac12,980 for a seat in a VIP lounge, have sold out. There are so far no plans to cancel the concerts, according to authorities. Iris Spranger, Berlin\u2019s senator for the interior, said she would take an uncompromising stance over the running of the concerts. \u201cIn Berlin in the areas for which I am responsible, there will be no Rammstein band aftershow parties. \u201cThe accusations are so serious that I have no choice but to give the protection and safety of women absolute priority.\u201d Bahar Haghanipour, the women and equality spokesperson for the Green faction in the Berlin state parliament, appealed to the Berlin senate to ensure future concerts were governed by tighter safety rules in order to prevent attacks on women and other marginalised groups, calling the current security frameworks for such events \u201cstill far too lax\u201d. Music industry workers have also come forward in recent days, reporting that the incidents alleged to have taken place at Rammstein concerts were well known. One technical outfitter who works on Rammstein concerts said the room under the stage was even nicknamed the \u201csuck room\u201d by backstage crews. Aeneas Hohenadl, manager of the performance technician company Riggerwerk, told Die Welt the goings on behind the stage at Rammstein concerts were \u201can open secret\u201d. He said that included the alleged deliberate placing of women in \u201crow zero\u201d \u2013 directly in front of the stage \u2013 so they could later be recruited during shows as potential sex partners for Lindemann. Hohenadl, whose firm has worked indirectly with Rammstein at the Rock am Ring festival, has said he is no longer prepared to work with the band.

In a joint statement, the Cherokee Nation principal chief, Chuck Hoskin Jr, Morongo Band of Mission Indians chairman, Charles Martin, Oneida Nation chairman, Tehassi Hill, and Quinault Indian Nation president, Guy Capoeman, said: \u201cIt is also a broad affirmation of the rule of law, and of the basic constitutional principles surrounding relationships between Congress and tribal nations. \u201cWe hope this decision will lay to rest the political attacks aimed at diminishing tribal sovereignty and creating instability throughout Indian law that have persisted for too long.\u201d The statement added: \u201cBy ruling on the side of children\u2019s health and safety, the US constitution, and centuries of precedent, the justices have landed on the right side of history. \u201d Gary Batton, chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, also praised the ruling, saying in a statement that the Indian Child Welfare Act \u201cremains a critical part of protecting Native American heritage and tribal sovereignty. We are glad to see the supreme court recognized the important benefits of ICWA and allowed the law to stand.\u201d Deb Haaland, the secretary of interior and first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary for a US president, welcomed the decision, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a welcome affirmation across Indian Country of what presidents and congressional majorities on both sides of the aisle have recognized for the past four decades.\u201d President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris also hailed the ruling, with Biden saying:\u201cI stand alongside tribal nations as they celebrate today\u2019s supreme court decision. This lawsuit sought to undermine the Indian Child Welfare Act\u2013 a vital law I was proud to support \u2026 The touchstone law respects tribal sovereignty and protects Native children by helping Native families stay together and, whenever possible, keeping children with their extended families or community who already know them, love them, and can help them understand who they are as Native people and citizens of their tribal nations.\u201d Harris called the decision a \u201cvictory of tribal sovereignty and Native communities\u201d. The Democratic senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Indian affairs committee, also celebrated the ruling. \u201cScotus just validated what many have been saying for generations: the Indian Child Welfare Act is the gold standard of child welfare policy. This decision upholds the constitutionality of this law, respects tribal sovereignty, and protects the best interests of Indian children,\u201d Schatz wrote in a tweet. The American Civil Liberties Union also commented on the supreme court\u2019s ruling, saying: \u201cICWA is fundamental \u2013 it\u2019s a crucial part of tribes\u2019 right to govern themselves, and protects children from being forcibly removed from their family, tribe, and culture. Now we\u2019re calling on state governments to stand with Indigenous nations and incorporate ICWA into state laws.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6d1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/15/rugby-union-tom-wood-joins-premiership-commission", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Former England captain Tom Wood joins Premiership Rugby commission ", "lead": "A seven-person panel chaired by Nigel Melville will aim to improve the prosperity of the league, which has lost three clubs in nine months", "author": "Robert Kitson", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:29:33", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114336", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9dbdd8bb00c52c3ff2f7586bb5ad9641a8a37f89/0_200_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "Efforts to clear up the financial and administrative mess into which English rugby has fallen have formally begun with Premiership Rugby confirming the launch of a new sporting commission, including the former England and Northampton captain Tom Wood, to help improve the long-term prosperity of the league. Wood is among four independent figures from the world of sport and business on a seven-person panel chaired by Nigel Melville. The football executive Jane Purdon, the Ministry of Justice board member Mark Rawlinson and the financial services expert Carys Williams have all been appointed, with the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Simon Massie-Taylor, and its rugby director, Phil Winstanley, completing the list. The group will have the power to rule over crucial matters such as the future season structure, Premiership Rugby regulations and player workload, as well as impose sanctions in accordance with Premiership Rugby regulations. Crucially the aim is to make decisions independent of the clubs in a bid to deliver the best collective outcomes for the league. \u201cOur goal has always been to strengthen our governance and make internal decision-making more agile, whilst also bringing about greater independence to any contentious issues,\u201d said Melville. The past season has been a deeply concerning one for the English game, with three Premiership clubs collapsing financially in the past nine months. With the Rugby Football Union also preparing to hold its AGM on Friday evening, there is wider disquiet in the shires on a number of other issues, ranging from the union\u2019s financial outlook to the botched messaging around the imminent tackle-height trial in the community game. An official vote of no confidence has not been tabled but strong views are expected to be aired at the hybrid AGM, due to be held at the Royal College of Nursing. The shape and funding of the second-tier Championship is also the subject of increasing frustration, with no extra money yet forthcoming from the central pot and clubs increasingly concerned about the future. \u201cAnswers need to be forthcoming very soon about how to involve the second-tier professional game,\u201d said a club source. \u201cIf you don\u2019t those clubs are going to go the same way as three Premiership sides have gone in the past nine months. We\u2019re being asked to step up and be part of professional rugby on a shoestring. That just doesn\u2019t work. There will come a cracking point.\u201d The ripple effect following London Irish\u2019s collapse into administration is still continuing, with the highly rated flanker Tom Pearson confirming a move to Northampton. Another Exiles forward, Chunya Munga, has already joined the Saints with the young centre Will Joseph set to join Harlequins. Italy, meanwhile, have opted not to renew the contract of their head coach, Kieran Crowley, beyond this year\u2019s World Cup. The former New Zealand full-back has been building an increasingly impressive Azzurri side who beat Australia for the first time last year.

Everton missed their own deadline for an announcement on Kenwright\u2019s position, having stated at 5pm on Monday that \u201ca statement will be made about interim appointments and the future of the chairman in the next 48 hours\u201d. That accompanied the announcement that the chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, the chief finance officer, Grant Ingles, and the club legend Graeme Sharp, a non-executive director, had left their roles. Kenwright is expected to step down from a board that has stayed away from Goodison Park since January amid protests over their mismanagement. The original intention was for the 77-year-old to leave alongside Barrett-Baxendale, Ingles and Sharp but the Everton owner, Farhad Moshiri, wanted talks with Kenwright before he stepped down. Those talks are ongoing. The chairman still owns 1,750 shares in Everton (1.3% of the club) and, while he may want to sell before cutting ties with a club he first joined as director in 1989, Moshiri can remove Kenwright from the board regardless of any shareholding. The confusion over Kenwright\u2019s position and interim appointments could delay the proposed investment in Everton by the New York-based MSP Sports Capital. Given the clear need for improvements in a squad that has only just survived two relegation battles in succession, and this latest example of Everton\u2019s dysfunction, the supporters group #AllTogetherNow has urged Moshiri to take decisive action. The group, which represents several Everton fan organisations, stated: \u201cWe call for the immediate removal of the chairman of this football club \u2013 who has been the most unsuccessful chairman in our history. For the football club to move forward, and fans to unite, this without doubt has to happen. The protests will not cease and will only further intensify if you [Moshiri] allow \u2018Chairman Bill\u2019 to stumble on, continuing to fail in his position, despite clear evidence for a need for change. We ask you to respond without delay to this loyal fanbase, do not cause any further unnecessary hold up to a deadline that the football club\u2019s leadership team set out.\u201d Kenwright described the outgoing directors as \u201ca great board\u201d when their departures were announced on Monday. While work is advancing on an impressive new stadium at Bramley Moore dock, Moshiri is yet to secure the funding needed to complete the project. Everton face other financial problems, including the threat of legal action from Leicester, Leeds, Southampton and Burnley should they be found to have breached Premier League financial rules. Their former manager Carlo Ancelotti is also suing the club in London\u2019s high court. The #AllTogetherNow statement added: \u201cThat \u2018great board\u2019 have left us in a perilous financial position with constant poor decision-making, leaving the club in a dire situation with an FFP court case hanging over our heads. They have brought us zero trophies and two back-to-back relegation battles.

The NBA\u2019s two-time Most Valuable Player \u2013 an award he says he has \u201czero interest\u201d in \u2013 added more hardware to his resume, too, capturing the NBA finals MVP trophy. He\u2019s also managed to set the standard moving forward for the most low-key celebration by a star athlete. It started with his deadpan assessment in the dizzying aftermath on the court: \u201cThe job is done, we can go home now.\u201d It was followed by an exchange during his post-game news conference in which he revealed his true priorities. Asked if he was looking forward to the Nuggets\u2019 championship parade on Thursday afternoon, Joki\u0107 appeared worried his return to his hometown of Sombor, Serbia, would be delayed. The reason? To spend time with his family and return to his other passion: horse racing. \u201cYes, I need to go home. On Sundays, I have my horse racing,\u201d he told reporters. That reaction was unsurprising. As he told ESPN: \u201cBasketball is not the main thing in my life. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m good at.\u201d Joki\u0107, who could do no wrong on the court, further endeared himself to fans with his indifference to the traditional locker-room champagne shower. There was also the matter of his NBA finals MVP trophy. During the presentations on court, he seemed so uninterested with the trophy that he handed it to a bemused teammate, Bruce Brown, who did not appear to know what to do with it. He ultimately left in the room of longtime Nuggets equipment manager Sparky Gonzales and it had gone missing upon his return. Said ESPN\u2019s Malika Andrews: \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, I\u2019ve done a couple of these finals MVP interviews. You\u2019re the first one to come in without the trophy. Where is it?\u201d Joki\u0107\u2019s response: \u201cI really don\u2019t know. I left it in Sparky\u2019s room and it\u2019s not there anymore. So I don\u2019t know, but hopefully it can arrive in my house.\u201d Fortunately, Joki\u0107\u2019s trophy has since resurfaced and was in the center\u2019s possession when the Nuggets took over downtown Denver for their victory parade on Thursday afternoon. The 28-year-old brought his daughter, Ognjena, along for the ride. Her father was rather more animated that he had been in the past. \u201cThis is amazing.

In fact, it was the exact reverse. For the first time, a British former prime minister was found by his colleagues to have misled the House of Commons while he was in office. If Mr Johnson had not already done a runner from parliament, he would have rightly faced a 90-day suspension from it. But that does not make Thursday a dreadful day for democracy. On the contrary. It makes it a day of robust and necessary vindication of British parliamentary democracy against arguably its most unprincipled domestic enemy of modern times. The dreadfulness lay all along in Mr Johnson\u2019s conduct alone. The privileges committee report proves equal to its task. It took 14 months to compile and runs to 30,000 words and 108 pages. It was launched by an unopposed vote while Mr Johnson was still prime minister. The seven-strong committee was a mix of veterans and younger MPs. It had a Conservative majority, the two most senior of whom were celebrated Brexiters. The inquiry was conducted in a meticulous and fair manner. If the committee Conservatives had chosen to believe Mr Johnson\u2019s version of events in 10 Downing Street during the Covid emergency, and the assurances that he gave MPs about them, they had the votes to win out. Instead, the committee rejected his version unanimously. The only issue on which it was divided was whether to expel Mr Johnson altogether (it voted not to). Mr Johnson dismissed the report as \u201ccomplete tripe\u201d, \u201ca charade\u201d, \u201ca lie\u201d, \u201cpatently absurd\u201d and \u201ca deranged conclusion\u201d. Such language tells its own story. So does his misogynistic hostility towards the committee chair, Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman. In reality, though, the report was none of the things he claims. It benefits from a patient read. For the most part it is not personally hostile to Mr Johnson, though the tone hardens when it comes to his recent insults against the committee and its members, as a result of which the original suspension was increased. The report is sometimes too generous, assuming greater sensitivity on Mr Johnson\u2019s part to Covid regulatory issues than this lazy, dyed-in-the-wool narcissist seems capable of. There is also a legitimate argument in the report about whether the Commons process is consistent with natural justice. The committee concludes firmly that it is. On Monday, the Commons will debate the report. There will be a free vote. Less now rests on that than would have been the case if Mr Johnson had not scuttled his own parliamentary career last week. But it will still be a moment of real consequence for parliament, for politics and for the Conservative party in particular. Tory MPs face a choice. Do they stand with parliament or with Mr Johnson? Stand with parliament and some may risk a membership backlash in their constituencies. Stand with Mr Johnson and they help push the party back into the pit from which Rishi Sunak is struggling to extricate it. MPs of all parties must stand by the committee. By doing so, they will assert that rules matter, that parliament is more important than party and that standards in public life must be rigorous. Mr Johnson behaved as though the electoral system conferred untrammelled power on him to act as he chose, and to breach rules and conventions for his own advantage. He saw the Brexit vote and the 2019 election as a personal mandate, handing him a free pass to fob parliament off with lies and bluster \u2013 and to party while others worried and suffered. The diminishing of parliament was \u2013 and remains \u2013 absolutely central to his egotistical project. Parliament must now turn that around by irrevocably diminishing him."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6d5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/western-firms-snub-russian-davos-prestige-evaporates", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Western firms snub \u2018Russian Davos\u2019 as its prestige evaporates", "lead": "Annual event headlined by Vladimir Putin described as \u2018totally toxic\u2019 since full-scale invasion of Ukraine", "author": "Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:24:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114408", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d969e43e9a78c5d830ef7577b58109eece78fc7c/0_141_5223_3133/500.jpg", "body": "Western companies have almost universally shunned a self-styled \u201cRussian Davos\u201d event annually headlined by Vladimir Putin, in a stark symbol of Russia\u2019s international isolation more than 15 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. One former attendee of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) described an invitation to the forum as \u201ctotally toxic\u201d and compared it to being asked to join the annual reunion of Spectre, the criminal organisation run by James Bond\u2019s archenemy Ernst Blofeld. When Putin gives his plenary speech on Friday, the person said, the \u201cmost popular seats will be the ones in the back of the room\u201d. Stands at the event now promote opportunities to invest in territories of east Ukraine that have been occupied by the Russian army. Far-right activists including the philosopher Alexander Dugin have been given time on stage. And foreign visitors who do attend have been urged to bring dollars and euros in cash because of banking prohibitions on foreign credit cards. Some Russian companies and prominent businessmen are also snubbing the event, as its prestige and networking opportunities have evaporated. They include Yandex, Russia\u2019s largest tech company, as well as a number of well-connected businessmen. \u201cThey think that it\u2019s useless and expensive,\u201d said Alexandra Prokopenko, a former central bank official who had written about this year\u2019s forum as a \u201cPotemkin village\u201d. \u201cThere are lots of things to do on top of SPIEF, so it\u2019s not worth it to travel to St Petersburg and meet all the people there if it is not profitable for their business.\u201d Prices to attend or buy a stand at the event were \u201cskyrocketing\u201d, she said, at the same time as foreign delegations and other networking opportunities were disappearing. One sign of the forum\u2019s diminished state was that Igor Sechin, the chief executive of the state oil company Rosneft, was unable to attract any leading energy figures for his annual session. \u201cFive years ago, everyone wanted access to SPIEF because everyone was there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a great opportunity for networking. Right now it\u2019s useless. Who are they going to network with? They can meet each other at government meetings, they can just meet in Moscow.\u201d An aide to a Russian oligarch not at this year\u2019s forum wrote that his boss \u201chas not been particularly interested in attending [SPIEF] for the last couple of years and wasn\u2019t really planning to go to last year\u2019s either\u201d. The event is seen as important to Putin, whose presidential administration and security services authorise the prospective guest list for the annual forum months before it takes place, three people confirmed to the Guardian. Organisers have sought to avoid mentioning Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, while painting an image of the Russian economy as resistant to sanctions from the west. Still, the war in Ukraine has loomed large over SPIEF, with speakers promising rewards for destroyed western-made tanks used by Ukrainian armed forces. To replace western delegations, Russia has courted officials from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, India and China. Optimists in government admitted the forum was diminished but claimed they could make up for the loss of their relations with the west by focusing on the Middle East and other regions. \u201cOf course, colleagues say things are different than before, that is obvious,\u201d said an official at a state financial institution, who was attending SPIEF for the second time. \u201cBut you have to adapt to the new realities. We have to look for new partners, the UAE is a big focus and we have a lot of meetings with them, discussing new projects and investments. I would say the atmosphere is normal, not very depressing. People don\u2019t talk much about Ukraine.\u201d But many others, Prokopenko said, believed the forum had become an exercise in self-delusion. \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s quite difficult to pretend that you can continue business as usual in a country with a hot war in Ukraine and a war with the west,\u201d she said. This year, a preliminary list of invitees included the Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, the Financial Times reported. But when that list was published, Schmidt and other prominent businesspeople denied they would attend. When Putin makes his annual keynote speech, he will be joined on stage only by the president of Algeria. The Financial Times has reported that shortly before this year\u2019s forum, Putin signed a confidential decree that gives the government extraordinary powers to buy western assets in the country at a considerable discount, effectively paving the way for nationalisation of foreign companies. It is a far cry from the forum before 2014, when multinationals and Russian companies would vie for expensive partnerships or hold flashy parties featuring pop stars including Sting to prove they were committed to the Russian market. \u201cYou had to be there to show you were a serious player in the market,\u201d said the former attendee. \u201cYou had all of the multinationals falling over themselves to be as visible as possible on the programme, in as many sessions as possible, saying all the right things that Russian government people like to hear. So it was a real competition, everyone had to be there.\u201d Foreign companies became more cautious after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the person said, but continued to try to be \u201cas visible as possible for the Russians, and as invisible as possible for the westerners\u201d. But since the outbreak of the war, he said, any western interest dried up, and many Russians come just to show they are not skipping the event. \u201cNow, they\u2019re just there to check the boxes,\u201d the former attendee said."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6d6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/15/vermont-man-dies-jail-murder-mother-fishing-trip", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vermont man dies in jail ahead of trial for murder of his mother on fishing trip ", "lead": "Nathan Carman was accused last year of fraud and first-degree murder in the death of his mother, Linda Carman", "author": "Edward Helmore", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:20:33", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114426", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/51363efed2ad2d8586031773da07aafa82b3999d/0_103_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "Nathan Carman, a 29-year-old Vermont man who was set to go on trial for the murder of his mother during a 2016 sea fishing trip off Rhode Island, has died in jail, prosecutors said in court papers on Thursday.

NBC5, a Vermont affiliate, said Martin Mannella, an attorney, \u201csaid Carman and his legal team were looking forward to going to trial in October and having his story told in court\u201d, adding that Carman \u201cwas confident that he would be vindicated with an acquittal\u201d. Mannella told NBC5 he had \u201cno indication\u201d Carman could kill himself. Carman, of Vernon, Vermont, was accused last year of fraud and first-degree murder in the death of his mother, Linda Carman of Middletown, Connecticut, a killing he was alleged to have carried out \u201cwillfully, deliberately, maliciously, and with premeditation\u201d. In an eight-count indictment, prosecutors alleged that Carman planned his mother\u2019s death in order to obtain an inheritance. He was also suspected, though never charged, of shooting dead his grandfather, John Chakalos, in Windsor, Connecticut, in 2013, as part of a $550,000 insurance swindle. The indictment said Carman arranged the 2016 fishing trip with his mother and planned to kill her, then report to authorities that the boat sank and his mother disappeared. On 25 September 2016, eight days after sailing from Rhode Island, Carman was found in an inflatable raft off Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts. His mother was never found and is presumed dead. Prosecutors alleged Carman altered the boat, a 31ft vessel named Chicken Pox, to make it more likely to sink. The killing of his mother is alleged to have taken place \u201cwithin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d. Carman, who was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, denied doing anything to intentionally make the boat unseaworthy. He told the US Coast Guard that when the boat filled quickly with water, he swam to a life raft and called for his mother but never saw her again. During a hearing on an $83,000 insurance claim, which was denied, Carman was asked if he had warned his mother the boat was sinking. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the boat was going down until I was in the water,\u201d Carman said. \u201cI treated my mother like a passenger. She was more of a problem than a solution.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6d7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/fossil-fuel-lobbyists-will-have-to-identify-themselves-when-registering-for-cop28", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fossil fuel lobbyists will have to identify themselves when registering for Cop28", "lead": "Campaigners have heralded the move as a victory for transparency, making polluting industries more accountable", "author": "Fiona Harvey Environment editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:19:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114443", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/17f6a88aa8f0f2c7253f84627cafaefada9f59de/0_237_5072_3042/500.jpg", "body": "Fossil fuel lobbyists will have to identify themselves as such in registering for the UN Cop28 climate summit, making polluting and carbon-intensive industries more accountable at the annual talks. The move by the UN to require anyone registering for the summit to declare their affiliation was heralded as a victory for transparency by campaigners who have been increasingly concerned at the growing presence of oil and gas lobbyists at climate talks. Scott Kirby, a campaigner from Youngo, which represents youth campaigners at the UN climate talks, said: \u201cWhen young people see the number of fossil fuel lobbyists present at UN Framework Convention on Climate Change conferences, it makes us question the ability this process has to solve the biggest challenge threatening our futures. This is why we welcome the step to increase transparency of observer interests in the talks.\u201d Many campaigners said the change to make potential conflicts of interest more apparent should be only a first step towards excluding fossil fuel companies from the talks, or from key parts of them. Hwei Mian Lim, of the Women and Gender Constituency, said: \u201cWe can only meaningfully tackle the climate crisis when we kick big polluters out. Fortunately, we have the real solutions, including gender-just climate solutions, and have the power in collective feminist movements to prevent untold suffering, in particular among women and girls in the global south. \u201cThis is strengthened with weeding out the undue influence of big polluters that seek to undermine climate action. Cop28 is our best chance to start implementing them and we must do so in the most gender responsive, and effective and impactful way.\u201d The change came as nations wrapped up nearly two weeks of talks in Bonn, where officials tried to lay the groundwork for Cop28, which starts on 30 November. The event will be held in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer, and chaired by Sultan Al Jaber, who is head of the UAE national oil company, Adnoc. The company is planning a large expansion of its production capacity, and last year it sent scores of executives to the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. Al Jaber attended the Bonn talks for two days last week and spoke only briefly in public. He said: \u201cThe phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable. The speed at which this happens depends on how quickly we can phase up zero-carbon alternatives, while ensuring energy security, accessibility and affordability.\u201d He failed to give an assurance that a phase-out of fossil fuels would be on the official agenda at Cop28, despite a concerted push by many developed and developing countries for its inclusion. The UAE Cop28 presidency has insisted it is up to all the countries represented at the talks to make decisions on the agenda. Progress was slow at the Bonn talks, where countries had been hoping to clear away minor technical issues so heads of government could come to Cop28 to make the bold political decisions needed to put the world on track to meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Officials could not even agree an agenda for these preliminary talks. For most of the fortnight, the adoption of an official plan for the Bonn talks was delayed by an impasse between developing countries, which are frustrated that promised financial assistance has not been forthcoming, and rich nations that wanted the focus to be on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, put the blame squarely on rich governments. \u201cThe Bonn climate conference laid bare the glaring hypocrisy of wealthy nations, showcasing a remarkable indifference to the struggles of developing countries,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: without honouring their financial pledges \u2013 directly tied to their historical role in driving the climate crisis \u2013 these affluent nations lack the moral authority to exert pressure on poorer countries. Developing nations face the monumental task of eradicating poverty, fostering green development, and coping with escalating climate disasters. They deserve unwavering support, not undue pressure.\u201d Eventually, with only a day\u2019s negotiations left, the impasse was resolved so that progress made during the talks could be officially recognised. Poor countries are hoping for further progress on climate finance from a conference expected to be attended by more than 50 world leaders in Paris next week, hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Reform of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions will be on the agenda, and countries will be expected to come forward with new ideas on how to mobilise the trillions needed for developing countries to shift their economies to a low-carbon footing and prepare for the impacts of the climate crisis. Left unresolved at Bonn was the question of which country would host next year\u2019s summit, Cop29. It is the turn of the eastern group, which comprises Russia and former eastern bloc countries in Europe and central Asia. Tensions over the Ukraine war have riven the group, and within eastern European countries there are rivalries and feuds. Bulgaria is one candidate, but a highly placed European source told the Guardian that the country\u2019s delegation had failed to attend EU coordination meetings at Cop27. The controversy looks unlikely to be resolved soon, and a decision could be put off to the end of Cop28."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6d8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-another-migrant-tragedy-pieties-are-not-enough", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on another migrant tragedy: pieties are not enough | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Europe\u2019s attempts to insulate itself from a global crisis risk making a desperate situation worse", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:19:31", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114461", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/251b8480289ab6b7f08081381bfbc65c59b48a74/920_317_4609_2765/500.jpg", "body": "According to survivors, the fishing boat carrying mainly Afghan and Pakistani migrants towards Italy capsized almost instantaneously on Wednesday. At least 78 people are known to have died, but the true number may be much higher. Hundreds of people were packed into the inadequate vessel, which foundered 50 miles from the Greek coastal town of Pylos. In Greece, political parties suspended pre-election campaigning, and three days of mourning have been declared. But there is a reason why the doomed boat was travelling on the open sea, in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean. Migrant boats are taking bigger risks and making longer journeys to avoid the patrols and illegal pushbacks documented in Greece. During his campaign to be re-elected prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis made political hay by channelling Trumpian motifs and promising to extend a border wall with Turkey. As this week\u2019s tragedy illustrates, draconian deterrence measures do not stop irregular migration; they force desperate people to contemplate still more dangerous actions. But it is not only Greece that should take stock. Throughout Europe, governments are disingenuously claiming that the erection of high walls and barbed-wire fences, and the palming off of responsibility for asylum seekers to third-party countries, can be construed as a moral act. \u201cBreaking the people smugglers\u2019 business model\u201d has become the justification for a Fortress Europe strategy to insulate some of the world\u2019s richest societies from the consequences of global crises. Drivers of forced displacement \u2013 conflict, the climate emergency, attacks on human rights and economic insecurity \u2013 have become features of the 21st-century geopolitical landscape. But the new Europe, increasingly influenced by the radical right, is busily outsourcing its conscience via dubious deals. On Sunday, the EU outlined a potential agreement with Tunisia\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kais Saied, in which the north African country will receive economic aid in return for ramping up border control and facilitating repatriations from Italy. Mr Saied recently promoted a conspiracy theory that black African migrants are being deployed as a threat to Tunisia\u2019s Arab-Muslim culture \u2013 leading to violent attacks on sub-Saharan refugees. Neither this, nor the appalling abuse of migrants held in neighbouring Libyan detention camps funded by Italy, appears to have given the EU pause for thought. In fact \u2013 in accordance with the wish of the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni \u2013 the rules on \u201csafe\u201d non-EU destinations for applicants denied asylum were watered down last week. Britain, of course, still plans to summarily dispatch irregular migrants to Rwanda, in contravention of international law. This week, the UNHCR reported a record 19.1m rise in forced displacements year on year. Europe, to its lasting discredit, is largely leaving the world\u2019s poorer countries to cope with the fallout. But without more safe and legal routes to European countries, a very small proportion of these people will try to reach the continent somehow. And as was the case this week, some will die in the attempt. A change of approach and a change of heart is needed. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One ally of the former prime minister said they expected Bernard Jenkin, the most senior Tory on the committee, which said Johnson misled parliament in denying any lockdown-breaking parties, could be a particular focus in his Harwich and North Essex seat. It remains to be seen, however, whether there is much remaining appetite in the Conservative party at large, and especially in the parliamentary party, for Johnson-backing sabotage in advance of a vote on the report on Monday. In the hours after it was published, saying the former prime minister would have been suspended from the Commons for 90 days if he had not stepped down as an MP last week, a series of supporters condemned the findings as unfair, excessive and biased. \u201cThey just don\u2019t realise the extent of anger they have created, and that will be manifested,\u201d one Johnson backer said. However, such comments came entirely from existing and diehard Johnson supporters, many of whom had been given or promised honours by the former prime minister. The conclusions will be put to a free vote of MPs on Monday, which will prove the key test of how much support Johnson still has on the Tory benches. With the vote expected to be subject to just a one-line whip, making attendance optional, it seems likely a number of Conservative MPs will simply miss it altogether. Penny Mordaunt, the Commons leader, told MPs as she announced the timetable that her advice was that they should \u201cread the report ... make their own judgments about it, and take the task that is our privilege to do seriously and soberly\u201d. But with opposition parties set to turn out en masse to back the motion, which can be amended, even some Johnson supporters said they expected it to pass. \u201cInevitably Boris will lose the vote because you have the whole of the opposition against him, but you also have the Boris haters in the Conservative party,\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former cabinet minister who was knighted in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list, told Sky News. One of the first to condemn the report was Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and key Johnson ally, who has vowed to resign as an MP amid a row over whether she was wrongly denied a peerage in his honours list. Dorries said the report was \u201cquite bizarre\u201d, warning Tory MPs who voted to endorse it that they would face repercussions, also singling out Jenkin for criticism. \u201cAny Conservative MP who would vote for this report is fundamentally not a Conservative and will be held to account by members and the public. Deselections may follow. It\u2019s serious. MPs will now have to show this committee what real justice looks like and how it\u2019s done.\u201d Brendan Clarke-Smith, a Johnson loyalist elected in his 2019 landslide, tweeted that he was \u201cappalled at what I have read and the spiteful, vindictive and overreaching conclusions of the report\u201d, adding that he would vote against the findings on Monday. Simon Clarke, another former minister, and also knighted by Johnson, said: \u201cI am amazed at the harshness of today\u2019s report by the privileges committee. I believed Boris before and I believe him today. This punishment is absolutely extraordinary to the point of sheer vindictiveness, and I will vote against this report on Monday.\u201d James Duddridge, an MP who served as Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary for some of his time in No 10 and was previously knighted by him, likened the committee\u2019s verdict to medieval punishment. \u201cWhy not go the full way, put Boris in the stocks and providing rotten food to throw \u2026 at him,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMoving him around the marginals, so the country could share in the humiliation. History will hold Boris in higher regard than this committee. I thank him for his service.\u201d Other support for Johnson came from Michael Fabricant, also knighted in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list, who told the BBC that when the former PM gave evidence to the committee, some members \u201cwere pulling faces, were looking heavenwards, were indicating they didn\u2019t agree with what Boris was saying\u201d, indicating preconceived bias. Jake Berry, also previously knighted by Johnson, suggested his removal as an MP was an attempt by \u201cthe blob\u201d to distract from soaring mortgage rates. Andrea Jenkyns, who was made a dame in the resignation honours, tweeted a photo saying: \u201cI\u2019m backing Boris.\u201d Zac Goldsmith, the former Tory MP made a peer by Johnson, condemned the length of the proposed suspension, tweeting: \u201cThis is so obviously ridiculous (&amp; vindictive). If they\u2019d been clever, they would have recommended a 9-day ban.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6da", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/15/uk-post-covid-plan-will-not-keep-public-safe-expert-tells-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK post-Covid plan will not keep public safe, expert tells inquiry", "lead": "David Alexander of UCL says new framework merely \u2018an attempt to tinker with the system\u2019", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:12:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114499", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fd91e12cac6826faef83dbd82aec7ac6a882a8aa/0_84_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Experts in national disaster preparedness have warned that the UK\u2019s post-pandemic resilience plan requires \u201cwholesale, radical rewriting\u201d and said the government was failing to keep the public sufficiently safe. Bruce Mann, former director of the Cabinet Office civil contingencies secretariat, told the Covid-19 public inquiry that changes called for in the new framework, published by Rishi Sunak\u2019s government in December 2022, were \u201ctoo slow\u201d and it was \u201calmost silent on resourcing\u201d. Mann told the inquiry that \u201cthe overall preparedness for the pandemic was inadequate\u201d, and said the national flu pandemic plan was known to be deficient from 2017 onwards. Oliver Dowden, deputy prime minister, published the plan in December 2022, claiming it would \u201cstrengthen the underpinning systems that provide our resilience to all risks\u201d, including wars, pandemics, cyber-attacks and the climate crisis. But David Alexander, professor of risk and disaster reduction at University College London, told the inquiry: \u201cThe bottom line is: do you think the British government within the limits of his competency keeps the public safe? My answer to that is no, or not sufficiently.\u201d Alexander described the new plan as \u201can attempt to tinker with the system rather than radically approach it with a new view\u201d. He criticised it as \u201cvery top-down, despite the absolute need for organisation at the local level\u201d, and said it relied \u201cheavily on the military and I think that is a very bad thing\u201d. The two experts were giving evidence on the third day of the inquiry into the UK\u2019s preparedness for the pandemic that struck in January 2020. Their joint report concluded it should have been clear, after the 2016 Cygnus flu pandemic planning exercise and a review of the 2009 swine flu outbreak, that the health and social care sectors were likely to be overwhelmed. The criticism of current and former planning comes before Dowden\u2019s evidence on Wednesday as the chair, Lady Hallett, continues hearings into the pandemic, which claimed at least 226,977 lives in the UK. David Cameron, the former prime minister, will become the first politician to give evidence under oath when he is sworn in on Monday, followed on Tuesday and Wednesday by the former and current chancellors, George Osborne and Jeremy Hunt. The short amount of time allocated for their cross-examination was described as \u201calarming\u201d by lawyers for the bereaved. Cameron is scheduled to appear at 11am in a session that usually runs until about 1pm. However, Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care, must also give evidence in that period, which suggests Cameron may not be questioned for much more than an hour. \u201cPoliticians are well equipped to fend off critical questions and it takes time to pierce their armour,\u201d said Elkan Abrahamson, the lawyer representing the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group. \u201cWe have grave concerns that the time limits will allow the slick politicians to escape accountability for their actions.\u201d The senior Conservatives are expected to be questioned about the impact of austerity on the readiness of health systems and public health from 2010 onwards. \u201cIt is frustrating they will spend such little time under oath when their austerity policies left the UK so underprepared for the pandemic,\u201d said Nathan Oswin, Trades Union Congress Covid inquiry lead. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the resilience framework was developed in consultation with experts and was widely welcomed. \u201cIt represents a significant shift to ensure resilience is a \u2018whole of society\u2019 endeavour,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have already made significant progress in improving resilience. This includes an improved way of assessing future risks, the successful first national test of the national emergency alerts system and a new biological security strategy which will keep the UK public safe from threats including extreme weather and new diseases. A new cabinet committee dedicated to resilience will continue to drive this progress.\u201d The inquiry continues."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6db", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/jun/15/capturing-the-golden-hour-a-photography-tour-of-london-with-anthony-epes", "primaryCategory": "guardian-masterclasses", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Capturing the golden hour: A photography tour of London with Anthony Epes", "lead": "Learn to see and photograph the city in new ways with the fine art photographer Anthony Epes", "author": "", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:04:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114516", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5e4fde7ce6455913bae7b8e61c4481d64bc258a6/0_72_1067_640/500.jpg", "body": "Book now Anthony Epes has travelled the world, from the mesmerising landscapes of northern Vietnam to the depths of the Sahara Desert, capturing their spirit on camera.

In an analysis of what the report means for Johnson, Pippa Crerar writes: It has long been Johnson\u2019s instinct when faced with trouble to double down, deflect, deny \u2013 and to attack. It is why he is claiming that the committee report with its \u201ctrumped up\u201d charges has dealt the \u201cfinal knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination\u201d. He still cannot see that his response throughout to the Partygate affair has made his situation worse. It could have turned out very differently for Johnson, for the Tory party and for the country, if he had accepted responsibility from the start. But that would go against every one of his instincts. He has run head first into reality and found himself out of frontline politics, out of parliament and out of favour. And while it is always unwise to write off Johnson, his chances of once again staging a frontline political comeback now look vanishingly remote. Pippa\u2019s full analysis is here. Boris Johnson\u2019s supporters have reacted with fury to the privileges committee\u2019s finding that he misled parliament, with some making open threats that Tories who vote to endorse the report could face deselection by their members. And here is Peter Walker\u2019s summary of what the report says. In its report the privileges committee says Boris Johnson could be the subject of a fresh inquiry if it turns out that he submitted WhatsApp messages to the Covid inquiry that he withheld from Harriet Harman and her colleagues. In what was interpreted as a bid to embarrass Rishi Sunak and No 10, who are resisting demands from the Covid inquiry for it to get access to unredacted WhatsApp messages from minister if No 10 thinks they are irrelevant, Johnson told the Covid inquiry it could see all his messages. In its report, the privilges committee says it only received \u201ca limited number\u201d of WhatsApp messages from Johnson. In a footnote it goes on: We note that Mr Johnson has recently undertaken to supply the Covid public inquiry with a large number of his personal WhatsApp messages. This contrasts with his highly restrictive release of such messages to us. If it transpires from examination of the WhatsApp messages supplied to the Covid inquiry that there was relevant material which should have been disclosed to us either by Mr Johnson or the Cabinet Office, this would be a serious matter which the House might need to revisit. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group says Boris Johnson should never be allowed to stand for public office again. Its spokesperson David Garfinkel said in a statement: This is another grim reminder that whilst families like mine were saying goodbye to our loved ones over Zoom, the same prime minister that failed us so badly in the first place was breaking his own rules so he could have a party and a laugh. Johnson has shown no remorse. Instead he lied to our faces when he told us that he\u2019d done \u2018all he could\u2019 to protect our loved ones. He lied again when he said the rules hadn\u2019t been broken in Number 10, and he\u2019s lied ever since when he\u2019s denied it again and again. It\u2019s an utter tragedy that Johnson was in charge when the pandemic struck and he should never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again. His fall from grace must serve as a lesson to other politicians to act with honesty and to serve the public as a whole \u2013 that is the only positive that can come from this. Twenty per cent of people think Boris Johnson did not get a fair hearing from the privileges committee, a YouGov poll suggests. Almost half of voters think he did get a fair hearing, and the rest don\u2019t know. Among Conservative supporters, 40% think he did not get a fair hearing, the poll suggests. The poll also suggests that the notional 90-day suspension proposed by the committee is seen as not harsh enough by three time as many people (45%) as the number seeing it as too harsh (15%). In an interim report published in March, the Commons privileges committee said that its inquiry would focus on whether Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate and, if so, whether \u201cthat was inadvertent, reckless or intentional\u201d. After Johnson gave evidence in person, it was obvious that the committee would conclude, at the very least, that Johnson misled MPs by being reckless. But it was much less clear whether it would conclude he did so intentionally, because to prove someone lied, it is necessary to know what they were thinking, and whether they knew they were saying something untrue. Dominic Cummings (see 7.47am) and others have said Johnson does not really distinguish between truth and lies anyway. Donald Trump is much the same. But the committee has concluded that Johnson deliberately misled MPs. Here are some of the arguments it makes to defend this conclusion in its report today. Johnson must have known his interpretation of what was allowed under the Covid guidelines was false, the committee says. In paragraph 117 on page 36, it says: We think it highly unlikely on the balance of probabilities that Mr Johnson, in the light of his cumulative direct personal experience of these events, and his familiarity with the rules and guidance as their most prominent public promoter, could have genuinely believed at the time of his statements to the house that the rules or guidance were being complied with. We think it just as unlikely he could have continued to believe this at the time of his evidence to our committee. We conclude that when he told the house and this committee that the rules and guidance were being complied with, his own knowledge was such that he deliberately misled the house and this committee. Johnson\u2019s is now misrepresenting the significance of what he said in the Commons, the committee says. In paragraphs 181, 182 and 183, starting on page 52, it says: The problem with Mr Johnson\u2019s attempts to portray his assertions to the house [that the rules were followed in No 10] as narrow in scope is that this interpretation is directly at odds with the overall impression members of the house, the media and the public received at the time from Mr Johnson\u2019s responses at PMQs \u2026 The impression the house would have taken and, we conclude, would have been intended to take, from Mr Johnson\u2019s repeated references to assurances was that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive, and to be given great weight. In fact, as we have seen, the only assurances that we can be certain were given to Mr Johnson were arrived at in haste based on a press \u201cline to take\u201d, were not subject to investigation before either session of PMQs, and did not emanate from senior permanent civil servants or government lawyers but from two media advisers and were based only on their personal recollections. Although Mr Johnson claimed several times to have been given the assurances \u201crepeatedly\u201d, in evidence to us he scaled down that claim by arguing that by \u201crepeatedly\u201d he had meant \u201con more than one occasion\u201d (so possibly only twice). Mr Johnson\u2019s attempt in his evidence to us to claim that his assertions at PMQs were narrow in scope amounts to ex post facto justification and was clearly not the message he intended to convey at the time. As an ex post facto justification, it is false. Johnson was so reckless as to whether the truth was being told that this amounted to being deliberately misleading, the committee says. In paragraph 201 on page 59, it says: His personal knowledge of breaches of the rules and guidance, combined with his repeated failures pro-actively to investigate and seek authoritative assurances as to compliance issues, amount to a deliberate closing of his mind or at least reckless behaviour. We find it highly unlikely that Mr Johnson having given any reflection to these matters could himself have believed the assertions he made to the house at the time when he was making them, still less that he could continue to believe them to this day. Someone who is repeatedly reckless and continues to deny that which is patent is a person whose conduct is sufficient to demonstrate intent. Many aspects of Mr Johnson\u2019s defence are not credible: taken together, they form sufficient basis for a conclusion that he intended to mislead. It is generally assumed that there will be a division on Monday after MPs debate a motion to approve the privileges committee report. Reports like this normally go through on the nod, but some Conservative MPs have already said or indicated they are going to vote against. (See 1.44pm.) At the end of a debate, the speaker calls a vote by acclamation (\u201call those in favour, say aye\u201d), and all it takes is one or two MPs to shout \u201cno\u201d loudly enough for a division to be called. But, in an interview with Radio 4\u2019s the World at One, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Boris Johnson supporter and former business secretary, suggested that a division may not in fact take place. Any vote would be a \u201cformality\u201d, he said, because \u201ca small number of Tory Boris haters\u201d would vote with the opposition. But he also said: \u201cIt may not come to a vote.\u201d Given the pressure on Tory MPs to vote against the report (see 11.32am), it would be surprising if the Johnsonites did not force a vote. And yet, any division might just show how few supporters Johnson has in the parliamentary party. Most Tory MPs would probably choose not to vote at all, but the motion would get through with opposition backing. Just as Johnson decided to walk way from the privileges committee process last week, his supporters could decide to boycott the Commons vote on the supposed grounds it was \u201cunfair\u201d. And it would suit the Tory whips for no division to take place, because that would prevent endless rows breaking out in Conservative associations over whether MPs voted for or against. The debate is the main business scheduled for Monday. But on Mondays the Commons does not start sitting until 2.30pm, and any debate would not start until 3.30pm at the earliest. From the government\u2019s point of view, the less attention it gets the better, and so it would not be surprising if some lengthy and dull ministerial statements gets scheduled for Monday, and perhaps some urgent questions too, pushing the start of the debate back by a couple of hours or so. The byelections in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency, and in Selby and Ainsty, Nigel Adams\u2019s constituency, will take place on Thursday 20 July, the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope reports. One of the oldest cliches about Boris Johnson is that it is never safe to rule out his making a comeback. The polling firm Savanta has published the results of a snap poll today that suggests, following the publication of the privileges commtitee\u2019s report, almost half of voters think his political career is over. But 40% of people do not agree, the poll suggests. And more than half of people who voted Tory in 2019 don\u2019t think his career is over, according to the survey. The Commons privileges committee report makes it clear that it is being particularly harsh towards Boris Johnson because of the way he responded to its inquiry. In a list of five reasons justifying the proposed 90-day suspension, if he had remained an MP, only one relates to what he orginally told MPs about Partygate, three relate to his response to the investigation, and one relates to what he told the committee when he gave evidence to it. (See 9.18am.) The committee says that attacks on its integrity amount to contempt of parliament, and that Johnson is an offender in this regard. It says: [Johnson] stated that the committee had \u201cforced him out [\u2026] anti-democratically\u201d. This attack on a committee carrying out its remit from the democratically elected house itself amounts to an attack on our democratic institutions. We consider that these statements are completely unacceptable. In our view this conduct, together with the egregious breach of confidentiality, is a serious further contempt. The committee criticises Johnson for, among other things, calling it a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. It does not criticise other MPs who have used similar language, but it says it is going to address this matter in a further report. In paragraph 14 it says: From the outset of this inquiry there has been a sustained attempt, seemingly coordinated, to undermine the committee\u2019s credibility and, more worryingly, that of those members serving on it. The committee is concerned that if these behaviours go unchallenged, it will be impossible for the house to establish such a committee to conduct sensitive and important inquiries in the future. The house must have a committee to defend its rights and privileges, and it must protect members of the house doing that duty from formal or informal attack or undermining designed to deter and prevent them from doing that duty. We will be making a special report separately to the house dealing with these matters. The committee does not say it will be naming other offenders in this regard, and proposing sanctions. But that might be an option for the committee. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, is one of the most prominent MPs who has denigrated the committee in this way. Although his language today has been more moderate, in the past he has described the committee as a kangaroo court, and on the day it took evidence from Johnson he posted a joke tweet making the same point. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says that Boris Johnson is a liar, and that Rishi Sunak should call an early general election. At Holyrood Humza Yousaf accused Boris Johnson of \u201cbetraying the people of the UK\u201d during first minister\u2019s questions. During questions about delays to road improvements across the Highlands, Yousaf accused Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross of trying to \u201cdodge\u201d the scandal. Yousaf said Johnson was \u201cnot just lying to the House of Commons, but betraying the people of this country and of the UK\u201d. He went on: When they couldn\u2019t visit a loved one, when they couldn\u2019t attend funerals of loved ones, Boris Johnson was breaking the rules and having parties in Number 10. Yousaf said that Ross \u201cbacked Boris Johnson to the very hilt\u201d and later called on the Scottish Conservatives to apologise for backing Johnson and for all their MPs to vote for the report when it\u2019s brought to the Commons. Speaking to media after FMQs, Ross said the report was \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cvery thorough\u201d. Ross was one of the first senior Tories to call for Johnson to quit in the wake of the revelations, but later revised his position after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He said he would support the committee\u2019s recommendations and called on fellow MPs to accept that the committee was doing the job asked of them. He said: Not everyone will agree with the outcome of their deliberations but it was the parliament as a whole who asked for this. Any MP found to have deliberately misled parliament is guilty of a grave incident and for a former prime minister that is even worse. Ross also described Johnson\u2019s behaviour in presiding over parties while people were dying and unable to visit sick relatives as \u201cunforgivable\u201d. The privileges committee\u2019s findings on Boris Johnson \u201cis in danger of making the House of Commons look foolish\u201d, the former business secretary Jacob Rees Mogg has said. In an interview with GB News, the Johnson ultra-loyalist slammed the inquiry\u2019s report, which he said contained \u201cno real sanction\u201d, while its recommendation that Johnson be suspended for 90 days was \u201cmerely trying to make a point\u201d. Rees-Mogg said the report had failed to address Johnson\u2019s allegations that \u201cmost of the members of the committee\u201d had already expressed deeply prejudiced remarks about the former prime minister\u2019s guilt before they had seen the evidence and they should have recused themselves. He said: Chris Bryant behaved absolutely properly and recused himself [from the committee\u2019s investigation] because he had prejudged it. Harriet Harman did not and the problem with that is that the chairman of committees is extremely influential and important. The first draft that goes to the committee to vote on is prepared by the chairman of the committee and that level of power or authority of influence is one that needs to be exercised by somebody who has not judged the case before the committee. And I think this is a fundamental flaw, which undermines all the work of the committee. I think if you look back over the history of parliament, parliament sometimes makes great mistakes when it tries to stand on its dignity. I think that this report is in danger of making the House of Commons look foolish. Rees-Mogg was referring to some tweets posted by Harman in April 2022, including one in which she commented, seemingly approvingly, on an Alastair Campbell tweet saying Johnson and other ministers lied repeatedly about Partygate. Another question from a reader. I note that in the minutes it was a 2-4 split on whether the committee would recommend Boris Johnson be expelled from the house. If that had gone the other way, would that be the harshest sanction placed on an MP in modern times? It depends how you define modern. The last MP expelled from the Commons was Garry Allighan, a Labour MP who was expelled in 1947 because he had sold information about private Labour meetings to journalists, and then lied about it, and blamed others, when investigated by the privileges committee. Boris Johnson\u2019s supporters in the parliamentary Conservative party have been speaking out against the privileges committee\u2019s report. They are a minority in parliament \u2013 a very small minority now, it appears \u2013 but they have not gone quiet. Here are some of their comments. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, says any MP who votes for the report is \u201cfundamentally not a Conservative\u201d and will be at risk of deselection. This report has overreached and revealed it\u2019s true pre determined intentions. It\u2019s quite bizarre. Harman declared her position before it began. Jenkins, the most senior MP on committee attended an ACTUAL party. Any Conservative MP who would vote for this report is fundamentally not a Conservative and will be held to account by members and the public. Deselections may follow. It\u2019s serious. MPs will now have to show this committee what real justice looks like and how it\u2019s done. And here are some more comments from Johnson allies. From Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary: I think [the committee] have come to conclusions that are not fully supported by the evidence. I think their fundamental judgment is wrong because I don\u2019t think he deliberately misled parliament. From Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary: From Brendan Clarke-Smith: From Paul Bristow: From Mark Jenkinson Here is a question from a reader. Is the privileges committee unanimous in its findings? i.e. Did all the Tory MPs on the committee agree with the non-Tory? Is it a requirement that all MPs on a committee should agree with the final outcomes/opinions? There are seven MPs on the committee and none of them have dissented from the report, and so in that sense it is unanimous. But, as the minutes reveal (on page 103 of the report), at a meeting on Tuesday, where the final version was agreed, the SNP MP Allan Dorans proposed an amendment to the final paragraph. Instead of it saying that if Johnson were still an MP they would be recommending a 90-day suspension, he wanted it to say that if Johnson were still an MP, they would be recommending his expulsion from the Commons. In a vote on the amendment, the Labour MP Yvonne Fovargue also backed the idea. But they were outvoted by the four Tories on the committee, Andy Carter, Alberto Costa, Sir Bernard Jenkin and Sir Charles Walker, who stuck with the 90-day proposals. Harriet Harman, the Labour chair, did not vote (which is normal practice for a committee chair, unless a vote is tied). Downing Street has rejected call\u2019s for Boris Johnson\u2019s honours list to be rescinded in the light of the privileges committee\u2019s report. Asked about this proposals, the PM\u2019s spokesperson told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: When it comes to honours, that\u2019s a longstanding convention. The prime minister has abided by convention, that\u2019s not going to change. The spokesperson also said there were \u201cno plans\u201d either to force Johnson to repay the money spent by the government on his legal advice during the privileges inquiry (the Labour proposal \u2013 see 11am) or to remove his allowance as an ex-PM (the Lib Dem proposal \u2013 see 10.06am.) On the allowance, the spokesperson said: These arrangements are fairly longstanding \u2013 it\u2019s not a personal salary or allowance, it\u2019s the reimbursement of expenses for office and secretarial costs. The Commons vote on the privileges committee report on Boris Johnson will take place on his birthday, Michael Savage from the Observer reports. He will be 59. Downing Street won\u2019t say whether Rishi Sunak will be in the Commons on Monday for the vote on the privileges committee report, John Stevens from the Mirror reports. He suspects Sunak might discover a diary appointment elsewhere. Alongside its main report, the privileges committee has this morning published a short document with additional evidence and material, not previously published, that it relied upon when coming to its conclusions. The new material includes this written submission from a No 10 official who explains how Covid guidance was regularly ignored in Downing Street in 2020. There was a culture of \u201cnot adhering to any rules\u201d, they say. Staff were even warned, before they went outside the front door, not to go outside in groups because outside No 10 they would be expected to observe social distancing. The privileges committee report does not actually say that Boris Johnson \u201clied\u201d to MPs. But it says he \u201cdeliberately misled\u201d MPs (see 9.13am), which would match the definition of lying to most of us. But Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, has used the term. She told the BBC: Boris Johnson is not only a law breaker but he\u2019s a liar \u2026 He needs to apologise for what he\u2019s put the public through \u2013 he won\u2019t though because Boris Johnson never accepts responsibility for what he does. Harry Cole, the political editor of the Sun, has also spoken to a \u201csenior Tory\u201d who thinks colleagues who vote for the privileges committee report risk being deselected. Speaking to MPs during questions on next week\u2019s business, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said MPs should not be subject to pressure ahead of Monday\u2019s vote. My advice to all [MPs] is, having had the committee carry out the work we asked them to do, is to read the report, is to make their own judgments about it, and take the task that is our privilege to do seriously and soberly. And members should use their own judgment on that. I can confirm that the motion before us will be votable, it will be amendable, and it is house business, and so I am expecting a free vote. And I know also \u2026 these are difficult matters for the house. We have to look at the evidence, we have to look at the report. But we are talking about people who are friends and colleagues. It will be a painful process and a sad process for all of us, the tasks that we face on Monday. But all of us must do what we think is right, and others must leave us alone to do so. Mordaunt was referring to supporters of Boris Johnson who are denouncing the privileges committee report on social media and some of whom seem to be suggesting that Tory MPs who back the report could be subject to deselection. This is from David Campbell Bannerman, a former Tory MEP who now chairs the Conservative Democratic Organisation, a new group pushing for more grassroots democracy in the party. It is widely seen as a closet \u201cbring back Johnson\u201d campaign. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs that there will be a free vote on the privileges committee\u2019s report. The motion (to accept the report, and its recommendations) will be amendable, and it will be the main business on Monday. Labour says Rishi Sunak must give MPs the chance to approve the privileges committee report. The shadow leader of the Commons, Thangam Debbonaire, has issued this statement. The evidence in this report is damning and the conclusions the committee came to are clear. Boris Johnson is a lawbreaker and a liar. Rishi Sunak must now confirm the government will follow precedent and give the house the opportunity to approve the report and endorse the sanctions in full. Rishi Sunak\u2019s weakness means he has never stood up to Boris Johnson. This report makes it even more inconceivable that the prime minister approved Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list just a week ago, as part of some sort of grubby deal rather than waiting for this report and saying \u2018no\u2019 to his former boss. Sunak has already indicated that MPs will get a vote. (See 8.13am.) We should get confirmation when we get the statement on next week\u2019s business in the Commons, in the next few minutes. Debbonaire said Johnson should also be asked to repay the \u00a3245,000 of taxpayers\u2019s money spent funding his legal support during the inquiry. She said: Rishi Sunak is so out of touch he thought it was right that taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned money fund Boris Johnson\u2019s ongoing lies to the public. Given the findings of the committee, Rishi Sunak should demand Boris Johnson pays back every penny. My colleague Henry Dyer says there are two other examples of MPs being told they should be suspended for more than 90 days in recent times. (See 10.17am.) In 2012 the Commons standards and privileges committee said Labour\u2019s Denis MacShane should be suspended for 12 months for falsifying his expenses, but he resigned as an MP before the Commons approved the punishment. And in 2014 Patrick Mercer, a Conservative, resigned as an MP after the Commons ruled he should be suspended for six months for lobbying. Labour\u2019s Keith Vaz also faced a six-month suspension. But he did not serve this in full because an election was called soon after the punishment was imposed, and he stood down. The SNP says the privileges committee report is damning not just for Boris Johnson, but for the whole Conservative government. In a statement Mhairi Black, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader at Westminster, said: This report is utterly damning for Boris Johnson and this arrogant Tory government, and it underlines why Scotland needs to escape Westminster control with independence. Johnson may have left parliament but his toxic legacy continues - with yet another out-of-touch Tory prime minister imposing Brexit, cuts and attacks on devolution against Scotland\u2019s will. In its report the privileges committee says there is no precedent of a prime minister being found to have deliberately misled the Commons, as Boris Johnson is found to have done. It says: We have concluded above that in deliberately misleading the house Mr Johnson committed a serious contempt. The contempt was all the more serious because it was committed by the prime minister, the most senior member of the government. There is no precedent for a prime minister having been found to have deliberately misled the house. He misled the house on an issue of the greatest importance to the house and to the public, and did so repeatedly. He declined our invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the house was truthful. His defence to the allegation that he misled was an ex post facto justification and no more than an artifice. He misled the committee in the presentation of his evidence. A reader asks: Is 90 days\u2019 suspension unprecedented? Almost, but not quite. If Boris Johnson were still an MP, and if he were suspended for 90 days, it would be the second longest suspension since 1979. The only one longer was the six-month suspension imposed on Keith Vaz in 2019 for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation. This Commons library note includes a table setting out all the suspensions imposed on MPs since 1979. UPDATE: Two other MPs have faced suspensions of six months or more, but resigned instead. See 10.51am for more details. The Liberal Democrats are calling for Boris Johnson to be stripped of the \u00a3115,000 annual allowance paid to all former prime ministers in the light of today\u2019s report. In a statement, Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, says: This damning report should be the final nail in the coffin for Boris Johnson\u2019s political career. It is completely unprecedented for a former prime minister to be found to have been a law-breaker and serial liar, who treated the public and parliament with total disdain. Rishi Sunak must cut off Johnson\u2019s ex-prime minister allowance to stop him milking the public purse for his own personal gain. Anything less would be an insult to bereaved families who suffered while Boris Johnson lied and partied. Boris Johnson\u2019s team is now circulating a six-point analysis purportedly explaining why the privileges committee report is flawed. It does not seem to be available online, so, for the record, here it is. 1) This is a kangaroo court. The committee has been a kangaroo court from the outset and, as Lord Pannick KC has repeatedly pointed out, it has acted as judge and jury in its own case in a way that is contrary to all legal practice. 2) The committee has contradicted the police\u2019s own findings \u2013 setting itself above the law. The committee has been so desperate to convict Boris Johnson that it has now said that all workplace events \u2013 thank yous and birthdays and motivational meetings \u2013 were illegal. That is insane, and has no basis in the law. The committee\u2019s view is contradicted by what the Metropolitan police themselves found \u2013 the police said that Boris Johnson did not break the rules by attending the farewell events. 3) The committee claims to know exactly what Boris saw at certain times and dates despite there being no evidence for this \u2013 as if the committee were inside his head. It has been driven to claim that it knows what Boris Johnson saw with his own eyes, and that he \u201cmust have known\u201d that the event on December 18 2020 was illegal because he \u201cmust have seen it\u201d as he went up the stairs to his flat. This is just crazy. The committee has no idea what was going on or what Boris Johnson saw. In fact, he saw nothing that struck him as being remotely untoward. The committee is just making things up. 4) If Boris Johnson must have known this was illegal, others did too \u2013 the committee\u2019s logic is that dozens of other figures also knew. The committee\u2019s entire argument is that Boris Johnson \u201cmust have known\u201d that events were illegal. This is rubbish. If Boris Johnson must have known, then what about Rishi Sunak, Simon Case, Sue Gray and all the other senior figures who were roving the corridors of Downing Street? Why didn\u2019t they know? 5) The report uses sleight of hand by mischaracterising Boris\u2019s statements. The committee continually twists what Boris Johnson said in the house, claiming that he was offering general comments when he was in fact talking about specific events. 6) How is this process fair \u2013 especially given allegations that committee members were at rule-breaking events? If all thank-yous and birthdays were illegal, then how does Sir Bernard Jenkin justify his attendance at his wife\u2019s birthday party, where the rules seem plainly to have been broken? In paragraph 95, on page 31 of the report, the privileges committee says that in May the government gave it new evidence relating to 16 events at Chequers or No 10 where lockdown rules may have been broken. This information came from Boris Johnson\u2019s diaries, which were being reviewed by lawyers preparing material for the Covid inquiry. The committee says it was told the entries were \u201cproblematic\u201d and that this was \u201cbased on an assessment by Government Legal Department as to events/activities which could reasonably be considered to constitute breaches of Covid Regulations\u201d. The committee says it asked Johnson about these events. Johnson\u2019s lawyers said: Each event was lawful for one or more of the following reasons: the gathering was reasonably necessary for work purposes; the gathering took place outside; the rule of six applied at the time; the linked household provisions applied; the linked childcare provisions applied; and/or emergency assistance and/or care/assistance was being provided to a vulnerable (pregnant) person. The committee says it has no evidence to disprove this, and that it decided not to investigate futher. But it says that, if it were to turn out that Johnson\u2019s explanations were not true, then he might have committed a further contempt. Mr Johnson has provided, under a statement of truth, explanations of the 16 events referred to in the recent material submitted to us by the Government. We have no evidence conflicting with his account. We do not wish to incur the further delay to our inquiry that would result from a detailed investigation of these events, and therefore we treat Mr Johnson\u2019s explanations as prima facie true. If for any reasons it subsequently emerges that Mr Johnson\u2019s explanations are not true, then he may have committed a further contempt. Boris Johnson has issued a 1,700-word rebuttal to the committee. It reads more like a Telegraph column than a legal document, and it amounts to a wholesale, and bitterly angry, rejection of what the committee is saying. Here are some of the key points. Johnson says the report is \u201ca charade\u201d, and that some of its arguments are \u201ca load of complete tripe\u201d. He says: I believed that we were working, and we were: talking for the main about nothing except work, mainly covid. Why would I have set out, in the Chamber, to conceal my knowledge of something illicit, if that account could be so readily contradicted by others? Why would we have had an official photographer if we believed we were breaking the law? We didn\u2019t believe that what we were doing was wrong, and after a year of work the Privileges Committee has found not a shred of evidence that we did. Their argument can be boiled down to: \u2018Look at this picture \u2013 that\u2019s Boris Johnson with a glass in his hand. He must have known that the event was illegal. Therefore he lied.\u201d That is a load of complete tripe. That picture was me, in my place of work, trying to encourage and thank my officials in a way that I believed was crucial for the government and for the country as a whole, and in a way which I believed to be wholly within the rules \u2026 This report is a charade. I was wrong to believe in the Committee or its good faith. The terrible truth is that it is not I who has twisted the truth to suit my purposes. It is Harriet Harman and her Committee. He says that the publication of the report is \u201ca dreadful day for democracy\u201d and that it is part of a \u201cprotracted political assassination\u201d. He says: This is a dreadful day for MPs and for democracy. This decision means that no MP is free from vendetta, or expulsion on trumped up charges by a tiny minority who want to see him or her gone from the Commons. I do not have the slightest contempt for parliament, or for the important work that should be done by the Privileges Committee. But for the Privileges Committee to use its prerogatives in this anti-democratic way, to bring about what is intended to be the final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination \u2013 that is beneath contempt. He says that he genuinely believed that leaving events he attended at Downing Street were justified under the Covid rules. The committee says he ignored the fact that social distancing rules were not being followed, and that, when he claimed in-person leaving dos were allowed at the time, he was in effect rewriting the rules after the event. (See 9.13am.) Johnson claims this is wrong. He says: I knew exactly what events I had attended in Number 10. I knew what I had seen, with my own eyes, and like the current PM, I believed that these events were lawful. I believed that my participation was lawful, and required by my job; and that is indeed the implication of the exhaustive police inquiry. The only exception is the June 19 2020 event, the so-called birthday party, when I and the then Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined in circumstances that I still find puzzling (I had lunch at my desk with people I worked with every day). So when on Dec 1 2021 I told the House of Commons that \u201cthe guidance was followed completely\u201d (in Number Ten) I meant it. It wasn\u2019t just what I thought: it\u2019s what we all thought \u2013 that we were following the rules and following the guidance completely \u2013 notwithstanding the difficulties of maintaining social distancing at all times. The committee now says that I deliberately misled the House, and at the moment I spoke I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events. This is rubbish. It is a lie. In order to reach this deranged conclusion, the Committee is obliged to say a series of things that are patently absurd, or contradicted by the facts. He defends his belief that in-person work leaving dos were allowed during lockdown. He says: They say that I must have known that the farewell events I attended were not authorised workplace events because \u2013 wait for it \u2013 NO SUCH EVENT could lawfully have taken place, anywhere in this country, under the Committee\u2019s interpretation of covid rules. This is transparently wrong. I believed, correctly, that these events were reasonably necessary for work purposes. We were managing a pandemic. We had hundreds of staff engaged in what was sometimes a round-the-clock struggle against covid. Their morale mattered for that fight. It was important for me to thank them. He accuses Sir Bernard Jenkin of rank hypocrisy. He says: The Committee cannot possibly believe the conclusions of their own report \u2013 because it has now emerged that Sir Bernard Jenkin attended at least one \u201cbirthday event\u201d, on Dec 8 2020 \u2013 the birthday of his wife Anne \u2013 when it is alleged that alcohol and food were served and the numbers exceeded six indoors. Why was it illegal for me to thank staff and legal for Sir Bernard to attend his wife\u2019s birthday party? The hypocrisy is rank. Like Harriet Harman, he should have recused himself from the inquiry, since he is plainly conflicted. He dismisses the committee\u2019s suggestion that he must have known a party took place in the No 10 press office on 18 December 2020 because he walked past it. See paragraph 83, on page 28 of the report. Commenting on it, Johnson says: Perhaps the craziest assertion of all is the Committee\u2019s Mystic Meg claim that I saw the Dec 18 event with my own eyes. They say, without any evidence whatever, that at 21.58pm, on that date, my eyes for one crucial second glanced over to the media room as I went up to the flat \u2013 and that I saw what I recognised as an unauthorised event in progress \u2026 First, the Committee has totally ignored the general testimony about that evening, which is that people were working throughout, even if some had been drinking at their desks. How on earth do these clairvoyants know exactly what was going on at 21.58 \u2026 It is a measure of the Committee\u2019s desperation that they are trying incompetently and absurdly to tie me to an illicit event \u2013 with an argument so threadbare that it belongs in one of Bernard Jenkin\u2019s nudist colonies. Their argument is that I saw this event, believed it to be illegal, and had it in my head when I spoke to the House. On all three counts they are talking out of the backs of their necks. If I did see an illegal event, and register it as illegal, then why was I on my own in this? Why not the Cabinet Secretary, or Sue Gray, or the then Chancellor, who was patrolling the same corridors at the time? Jenkin is, or at least in the past used to be, a naturist. The committee says, if Boris Johnson were still an MP, it would recommend a suspension for 90 days. It says that last week it was set to recommend a suspension for more than 10 sitting days, enough to trigger the recall election process. But it says it increased the hypothetical punishment in the light of his statement on Friday night, attacking the committee and its draft findings, which itself was \u201ca very serious contempt\u201d. Johnson is now an ex-MP, and so a suspension punishment can no longer apply. But the committee says Johnson should not be entitled the pass normally given to former MPs allowing them access to parliament. In its summary the committee says: The question which the house asked the committee is whether the house had been misled by Mr Johnson and, if so, whether that conduct amounted to contempt. It is for the house to decide whether it agrees with the committee. The house as a whole makes that decision. Motions arising from reports from this committee are debatable and amendable. The committee had provisionally concluded that Mr Johnson deliberately misled the house and should be sanctioned for it by being suspended for a period that would trigger the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015. In light of Mr Johnson\u2019s conduct in committing a further contempt on 9 June 2023, the committee now considers that if Mr Johnson were still a member he should be suspended from the service of the House for 90 days for repeated contempts and for seeking to undermine the parliamentary process, by: a) Deliberately misleading the house. b) Deliberately misleading the committee. c) Breaching confidence. d) Impugning the committee and thereby undermining the democratic process of the house. e) Being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee. We recommend that he should not be entitled to a former member\u2019s pass. And this is what the committee says in its summary about why it thinks Boris Johnson deliberately misled MPs about Partygate. We considered the nature and extent of Mr Johnson\u2019s culpability in misleading the house. In coming to the conclusion that Mr Johnson deliberately misled the house, we considered: a) His repeated and continuing denials of the facts, for example his refusal to accept that there were insufficient efforts to enforce social distancing at gatherings where a lack of social distancing is documented in official photographs, and that he neither saw nor heard anything to alert him to the breaches that occurred. b) The frequency with which he closed his mind to those facts and to what was obvious so that eventually the only conclusion that could be drawn was that he was deliberately closing his mind. c) The fact that he sought to rewrite the meaning of the rules and guidance to fit his own evidence, for example, his assertion that \u201cimperfect\u201d social distancing was perfectly acceptable when there were no mitigations in place rather than cancelling a gathering or holding it online, and his assertion that a leaving gathering or a gathering to boost morale was a lawful reason to hold a gathering. d) His own after-the-event rationalisations, for example the nature and extent of the assurances he received, the words used, the purpose of the assurances, who they came from, the warning he received about that from Martin Reynolds (his principal private secretary) and his failure to take advice from others whose advice would have been authoritative. His view about his own fixed-penalty notice (that he was baffled as to why he received it) is instructive. We came to the view that some of Mr Johnson\u2019s denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the Committee and the house, while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth. This is what the report summary says about what the committee concluded. We established that Mr Johnson: a) had knowledge of the Covid rules and guidance. b) had knowledge of breaches of the rules and guidance that occurred in No 10. c) misled the house: i) when he said that guidance was followed completely in No 10, that the rules and guidance were followed at all times, that events in No 10 were within the rules and guidance, and that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times when he was present at gatherings. ii) when he failed to tell the house about his own knowledge of the gatherings where rules or guidance had been broken. iii) when he said that he relied on repeated assurances that the rules had not been broken. The assurances he received were not accurately represented by him to the house, nor were they appropriate to be cited to the house as an authoritative indication of No 10\u2019s compliance with Covid restrictions. iv) when he gave the impression that there needed to be an investigation by Sue Gray before he could answer questions when he had personal knowledge that he did not reveal. v) when he purported to correct the record but instead continued to mislead the house and, by his continuing denials, this committee. d) was deliberately disingenuous when he tried to reinterpret his statements to the house to avoid their plain meaning and reframe the clear impression that he intended to give, namely i) when he advanced unsustainable interpretations of the rules and guidance to advance the argument that the lack of social distancing at gatherings was permissible within the exceptions which allowed for gatherings, and ii) when he advanced legally impermissible reasons to justify the gatherings. The Commons privileges committee report in Boris Johnson has now been published. It is here. There are not a lot of Tory MPs willing to publicly defend Boris Johnson any more, but one of them is Sir Michael Fabricant, and on the Today programme he gave an interview suggesting the privileges committee was biased against Johnson. Asked if he trusted parliament to judge Johnson, Fabricant replied: I trust parliament but of course I\u2019m not so sure that I trust the privileges committee. Why do I say that? I actually sat in while Boris Johnson gave evidence. Now, you\u2019ve got to understand that the committee sits in a quasi-judicial role. It\u2019s there to dispassionately make a judgment. I looked at the members of the committee. Some of them behaved in a totally proper way. Others were pulling faces, were looking heavenwards, were indicating they didn\u2019t agree with what Boris was saying. You know, I was quite shocked actually by the behaviour of some of the members of the privileges committee. On the subject of bias, Fabricant was then asked by the presenter, Nick Robinson, if he thought there was a link between his willingness to repeatedly defend Johnson and the fact that Johnson ensured he got a knighthood in the resignation honours published last week. Fabricant said he thought this topic would come up. But, in his reply, he implied that the knighthood was nothing to do with his pro-Johnson media appearances. He told Robinson: You know, I\u2019ve served the people of Lichfield for 31 years. I\u2019ve been on the government or opposition front benches for about nine years. I helped save, when there was an issue over tax, the National Memorial Arboretum. I helped move HS2 from going by a housing estate. A number of people have said that they are surprised it took so long. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons defence committee, has criticised Boris Johnson for the way he attacked Sir Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative member of the privileges committee, last night. Ellwood said that if Johnson had complaints about the process, he should have stayed on as an MP, and made a statement in the chamber, instead of resigning. Ellwood told Sky News: If Boris Johnson is unhappy with the committee\u2019s findings, or indeed anybody on the committee, the personalities and so forth, he could easily have made a personal statement in the Commons \u2013 that\u2019s the process \u2013 and presented his arguments prior to a full vote from the house, because it will be for the house to determine whether they support this publication or not. He\u2019s chosen to abandon all those possible avenues of approach and quit parliament in its entirety. Now coming late in the day and saying \u2018I\u2019m unhappy with this individual\u2019, this isn\u2019t the process of somebody I believe is going to win the argument. Ellwood also said he hoped the Johnson \u201cpantomime\u201d would soon end. He said: Johnson\u2019s confidence stemmed from the huge support he received from the party base. He was loved by members across the country but this is changing before our very eyes. There\u2019s now disappointment, even anger that the party, the activists are left to pick up the pieces \u2026 The longer this public pantomime drags on, the more Boris loses support from a once very loyal base \u2026 the more the prime minister\u2019s plans and vision which was starting to gain traction are overshadowed, the public actually want us to get back to politics. Rishi Sunak was on visit in Harrow this morning, where he witnessed an immigration raid. Asked about the privileges committee report into Boris Johnson, he said he had not seen it yet and that it would not be right to comment. Asked if he would give an interview later, after he had had time to read it, Sunak replied: You are talking about a report that I haven\u2019t seen and that no one else has seen. It wouldn\u2019t be right to comment on it in advance of it coming out and being published. These are matters for the House of Commons, and parliament will deal with it in the normal way that it does. The reference to parliament dealing with this report \u201cin the normal way that it does\u201d suggests that ITV\u2019s Robert Peston was right yesterday when he said that the government will table a motion asking the Commons to approve the privileges committee report, and that a plan to instead have a debate on a motion just saying the Commons has noted the report has been dropped. Sunak was also asked if he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d by Johnson\u2019s interventions in the past week. He replied: No, I\u2019m just getting on with delivering for the country. Good morning. In a post on his Substack blog last year Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser in No 10 and the strategist who did as much as anyone to help him win the 2019 general election, before he resigned and devoted his efforts to bringing Johnson down, wrote this about Johnson\u2019s relationship with the truth. He rewrites reality in his mind afresh according to the moment\u2019s demands. He lies \u2013 so blatantly, so naturally, so regularly \u2013 that there is no real distinction possible with him, as there is with normal people, between truth and lies. He always tells people what they want to hear and he never means it. He always says: \u2018I can\u2019t remember\u2019 when they remind him and is rarely \u2018lying\u2019. Johnson misled MPs when he told them that the Covid rules and guidelines were followed in No 10 at all times. But last year, as the Partygate scandal was engulfing his administration and before he stood down, the Commons voted to get the privileges committee to conduct an investigation into whether he had done this deliberately (ie, lied), or at least recklessly. Today we will get its report. Advance stories suggest the verdict will be grim. Yesterday the Times said the privileges committee would conclude that Johnson \u201cdeliberately misled parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal\u201d. This morning the Financial Times says it will say he \u201ccommitted \u2018multiple\u2019 contempts of parliament\u201d. We\u2019ll be able to read it for ourselves very soon, because it is due out at about 9am. Because of the role he played in Brexit (many people think the leave campaign would have lost if he had not been leading it), Johnson has been one of the most consequential prime ministers of the modern era. Today\u2019s report will significantly shape how he is remembered. As Aubrey Allegretti reports, last night Johnson launched a fierce attack on one of the committee\u2019s Tory members, accusing him in effect of hypocrisy. Today we will be focusing almost exclusively on the report, and reaction to it. It is due out soon and later, during business questions in the Commons after 10.30am, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, is expected to give details of when MPs will debate the report.

So any individual who finds themselves either having a great series or a great individual performance, that will never be forgotten.\u201d There have been many Ashes when it has been hard to find anything on which both teams agree but as they prepared for action to start at Edgbaston on Friday there was one thing both captains insisted was true: that their side is capable of beating any other. \u201cIf we play to the capabilities we know we\u2019re capable of then I know we are able to beat any team,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cI know that\u2019s a big statement in itself, but I think what we\u2019ve done over the last year, we\u2019re able to say that.\u201d Meanwhile Pat Cummins, his Australian counterpart, said that having won the World Test Championship final last week this was \u201ca moment in time where you look back and say that our best is as good as anyone else\u2019s in the world\u201d. Though Ashes series are rarely underhyped, the success both teams have enjoyed since Australia\u2019s 4-0 win in 2021-22 cast English Test cricket into crisis makes this the most anticipated encounter in recent memory. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much talk about it in the last 18 months,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cWe\u2019re pumped that it\u2019s here. This one in particular seems like it\u2019s just got a little bit more on it, the whole cricketing world stops for a month to put their attention on this series. We\u2019re lucky we\u2019re in the middle of it.\u201d This series has been certainly the focus of England\u2019s attention for some time. \u201cToday has been the most relaxed the group has felt, because we start tomorrow,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cEvery day that we edge closer to the start of the series we\u2019ve been wishing it starts tomorrow and now that day is finally here. It\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d One of the greatest achievements of Stokes and the England coach, Brendon McCullum, has been to remove the fear of failure. \u201cWe want to leave here 1-0 up,\u201d Stokes said on Thursday, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the end of the world if we don\u2019t.\u201d So there is no ambition to inflict on their opponents the kind of humbling that they themselves endured on their last visit to Australia? \u201cAll I want is for the team to go out there and keep pushing the boundaries of what we\u2019ve achieved so far,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cAs long as we can stay true to that then I will be a happy and proud captain, regardless of the result at the end of the series.\u201d Stokes described his decision to call Moeen Ali out of retirement after Jack Leach\u2019s lumbar fracture as \u201ca stomach and heart feeling, rather than my brain\u201d \u2013 but it is the feeling in his knee that has been the key topic of discussion. For the third consecutive day he bowled in training at close to full pace, and emerged from the experience feeling sprightly enough to leave the ground in search of further exertions, with a golf bag on his shoulder. \u201cThe last three days have been really good for my confidence,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cI\u2019ve bowled every day and been able to run in with more intensity day by day, so I have got myself in a good position to be able to bowl.\u201d In recent years Stokes\u2019s fitness has often prevented him reaching the level he so memorably showed at Headingley in 2019, but he feels he might be ready to reach those heights again. \u201cObviously every time I am on the field that is what I want to do, but my body was stopping me from doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have done is put myself in a place where I feel much more capable of being able to do that. I\u2019m not going to speak too soon \u2013 who knows where I could be in two weeks\u2019 time? \u2013 but hopefully I don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6de", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/milli-vanilli-documentary-tribeca-film-festival", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018People thought they knew the story\u2019: the rise and fall of Milli Vanilli", "lead": "A revealing new documentary takes an inside look at the most infamous lip-syncing scandal in pop music history", "author": "Adrian Horton", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 17:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114569", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d10e7a05191fcc79da59246d13ff84c7e7c35a69/0_80_3643_2187/500.jpg", "body": "You could argue that, at least in the realm of pop music, the year 1989 belonged to Milli Vanilli. The German-French pop duo, formed barely a year earlier by the German producer Frank Farian, had already barnstormed through European charts with their first single Girl You Know It\u2019s True. The song hit the US airwaves in March with stratospheric impact. Their debut album sold over 8m copies and spawned three No 1 singles; it stayed in the top 10 for the rest of the year. Young fans, predominantly women, screamed along to Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan\u2019s tight choreography and blatant eye candy \u2013 long braided hair extensions that swung freely when they danced, come-hither stares, chiseled abs, shoulder pads and spandex shorts, incredible energy and incredibly 80s dance moves. \u201cIt was literally anonymity for these guys \u2026 and then superstars \u2013 the biggest pop duo in the world,\u201d said Luke Korem, the director of a new documentary on the duo that premiered this week at the Tribeca film festival. All of that was overshadowed, and then swept into the dustbin of pop history, by disgrace. By the time Milli Vanilli accepted the Grammy award for best new artist in February 1990, many in the music business suspected something was afoot. That November, Farian revealed in a press conference that Pilatus and Morvan never sang on any of their recordings, and lip-synced their performances. The ruse torpedoed the act \u2013 radio stations stopped playing their songs, fans destroyed their records, and the Grammys rescinded their award for the only time in history. Pilatus and Moran attempted to rebrand as \u201cRob and Fab\u201d with their own vocals, but sold mere thousands of records. Milli Vanilli became cultural shorthand for hubris (Pilatus once compared the duo favorably to Elvis and the Beatles) and ignominious deceit. And that was that. The popular narrative of Milli Vanilli \u2013 that Rob and Fab lied about their talents and misled their fans and should suffer the consequences \u2013 was swift, vindictive and enduring. And, as the documentary argues, incomplete and misdirected at the two public faces of a much larger operation. \u201cPeople thought they knew the story, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d Morvan told the Guardian on the eve of the documentary\u2019s premiere. Milli Vanilli the documentary offers a brisk account of a spectacular rise and fall, primarily in the words of Morvan, a musician and artist now living with his wife and four children in Amsterdam. (Pilatus fell into drug addiction in the years following the scandal, and died of a suspected overdose in 1998, a day after leaving a rehab clinic, at the age of 32; an interview recorded about 45 days before his death provides the bulk of his story in his own words.) Raised in Paris to parents from Guadeloupe, Morvan decamped to Munich at 18, where he met Pilatus, a breakdancer, at a party. They were, as Morvan recalled, the only dark-skinned people they knew in Munich. They were great dancers and enthusiastic emcees, barely making ends meet. And they both wanted to be stars. A brief stint as backup dancers and a shaky demo led to a meeting with Farian, a decorated producer who scored several global hits in the 1970s with the Eurodisco group Boney M. (Farian did not participate in the film.) Like Milli Vanilli after them, Boney M were a distinctly Farian, smoke and mirrors construction: frontman Bobby Farrell, a Black Aruban dancer, lip-synced over other vocals, often Farian\u2019s, though the arrangement was met with little backlash when it became public knowledge in 1978. Farian signed Morvan and Pilatus to a multi-album contract when they were 21 and 24 respectively. According to Morvan, the two had no understanding of the terms, let alone the possibility of lip-syncing. They needed money, and Farian was a hitmaker. \u201cWe were so naive that when the contract was put on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was never really implied, like, hey, go read that. There was no management, there was no protection. There were golden records on the wall, so that was enough.\u201d Months later, Farian informed Morvan and Pilatus that they would not sing on their debut single as Milli Vanilli. Morvan says they were pressured into the ruse, on pain of paying back their record contract; Ingrid Segieth, Farian\u2019s former secretary and lover, claims they agreed easily. Either way, the track was a hit \u2013 fame and fortune at a near-viral pace \u2013 and Milli Vanilli \u201cembraced the lie\u201d, as Morvan recalls in the film. Several other figures in and around the business of Milli Vanilli attest to Farian\u2019s scheme and the music industry\u2019s participation \u2013 if not in the plotting, then in keeping the open secret once the profits rolled in. There\u2019s Brad Howell and Charles Shaw, the Black American singers viewed as less telegenic by Farian, who provided the real vocals on Milli Vanilli\u2019s records and grew frustrated with the lack of credit. \u201cDowntown\u201d Julie Brown, who emceed for the duo on their US MTV arena tour, recalls the night in July 1989 when a malfunctioning vocal track almost derailed Milli Vanilli at the peak of their fame. Former executives at Arista, the record company which handled the duo\u2019s business in the US, claim that everyone up to and including the company\u2019s president, Clive Davis, knew about the lip-syncing months before the Grammys. (Davis does not appear in the film; in footage from 2017, he denied any knowledge of the lip-syncing.) \u201cI found it surprising when people would just run the other way still,\u201d Korem said when I brought up Davis\u2019s denial. After 30 years, he said, he still encountered some reticence to reveal who knew what, and when. \u201cI think the reason they do that is because of what happened to Rob. I think there\u2019s a lot of guilt and shame, and it\u2019s very tragic.\u201d Pilatus\u2019s death hangs over the film\u2019s second half, as the tide turned rapidly on Milli Vanilli from phenomenon to punchline. In one remarkable scene, the pair host a press conference to address the scandal. Morvan sits near silent, shock blooming on his face in real time. Pilatus spars, both apologizing and justifying their work with Farian to escape poverty and achieve stardom. \u201cDid you ever live in the projects?\u201d he asks a white journalist righteous with indignation over the lie. \u201cWe had no money. We wanted to be stars.\u201d The journalist near implores: \u201cYour talent would get you out!\u201d Someone off-camera remarks: \u201cSpoken like a true white boy.\u201d As the music critic Hanif Abdurraqib puts it in the film, unspoken in much of the vitriol \u2013 there were over a dozen class-action lawsuits by disgruntled fans accusing the duo of fraud and racketeering \u2013 was an undercurrent of racism: \u201cMilli Vanilli, to be clear, had a largely white audience. So a part of the betrayal that was felt was, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I listened to these Black guys singing these songs and it really wasn\u2019t them.\u2019\u201d The issue, as the film frames it, was not that Morvan and Pilatus had culpability, but that they shouldered the entire scandal alone. \u201cDo they deserve to be called out on some level?

Anger at the fiasco united the opposition and the government\u2019s own backbench MPs on Thursday after the release of a review into the project, which has been running for 12 years. It emerged this year that the troubled \u00a35.5bn programme, which was already six years late, would not be ready until the end of the decade. However, as army personnel restarted training this week on the vehicles, a defence minister told parliament that the review made for \u201cdifficult reading\u201d. It highlighted a \u201cnumber of systemic, cultural and institutional problems across several areas,\u201d the defence minister James Cartlidge said. Originally intended to enter service in 2017, the programme has been repeatedly delayed, with problems including noise and vibration that have injured soldiers testing the vehicles. The lessons learned review, which was produced by Clive Sheldon KC and published on Thursday, said it found no evidence of misconduct by any individual or anything that would require disciplinary action. However, it found that \u201ca number of errors of judgment\u201d were made and that \u201c\u2018optimism bias\u2019 infected some of the thinking of senior individuals\u201d.

This report starkly reveals in exquisite, agonising detail just how massively bureaucratic and broken the MoD\u2019s procurement really is.\u201d He called for \u201croot-and-branch reform of how we buy military commitment\u201d and said the \u201ctaxpayer and our armed forces deserve no less\u201d. The Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, Tobias Ellwood, said that Ajax was a case study of how not to do procurement. \u201cAjax\u2019s journey has been miserable \u2026 Something very, very serious has gone wrong,\u201d he said. Cartlidge said that the Household Cavalry had been undergoing standard army field training on Salisbury Plain in Ajax vehicles since Tuesday. \u201cFocused on individual and crew training, this step marks the restarting of British army training on these sophisticated vehicles, and I hope underlines that this project really has turned the corner,\u201d So far 44 vehicles have been delivered, while there is an \u201cend goal\u201d for 589 vehicles to be fully operational by 2029, he said."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6e0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/15/wales-running-more-since-world-cup-rob-page-euro-2024-qualifying", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New-look Wales running more since World Cup exit, claims Rob Page", "lead": "Wales are reaping the benefits of having a more athletic squad, according to their manager", "author": "Ben Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:48:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114606", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0bf8ec00773af5c9181564f98a1817e32e364c9a/0_233_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Rob Page believes Wales are reaping the rewards of evolving into a more athletic side since exiting the World Cup with a whimper.

The animals were raised in captivity at a wildlife park in the Cairngorms as part of a breeding programme run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which is expected to release up to 60 cats into the wild over the next three years. It is the first time a predatory mammal such as the wildcat has been officially released in the UK, and if successful will increase calls for Eurasian lynx to be introduced in Scotland \u2013 more than 1,000 years after they were hunted to extinction. The captive breeding programme was set up after Scotland\u2019s wildcat population was on the cusp of being declared genetically extinct in the wild in 2019 because of habitat loss and interbreeding with feral domestic cats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature said the wild population was \u201cno longer viable\u201d. It estimated as few as 30 were living in the wild in Scotland. \u201cThe number of wildcats is too small, the hybridisation too far advanced and the population too fragmented,\u201d it said. Although the cats, which feed on mice, voles and rabbit, have been carefully acclimatised using animals raised in captivity in the Cairngorms, ecologists still worry they face major survival challenges. Local people including gamekeepers, who may fear wildcats could eat grouse and pheasant chicks, have been educated about wildcat living habits. The project has also heavily monitored feral and domestic cats in the release area, with 100 camera traps locating cats, which are then trapped and if necessary vaccinated and neutered to avoid hybridisation with wildcats. The wildcats have been released in the Cairngorms national park wearing satellite tracking collars so they can be carefully monitored and supervised. Dr Helen Senn, the project leader and head of science and conservation programmes for the RZSS, said that eventually wildcats raised or trapped on mainland Europe could be included in the release scheme. \u201cWe hope that this project will pave the way for the full recovery of Scotland\u2019s last remaining native cat species,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, life is tough for wild carnivores and the sad reality is that some of the wildcats that we release will not survive due to threats such as road traffic. Their survival is contingent on their individual behaviour in a new environment. \u201cHowever, we also know that inaction will result in extinction. As human activity is responsible for the wildcat\u2019s decline, we have a responsibility to take action now to protect one of our rarest and most threatened mammals.\u201d Francesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, the government conservation agency, said the project sat within a wider mosaic of species reintroduction and rewilding projects. \u201cA huge amount of work has laid the ground for these wildcat releases, and we\u2019re proud to have played our part in that. Our research shows that wildcats are facing extinction in Scotland, which makes conservation translocations like this a vital tool for the species\u2019 recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cThe newly released wildcats will face significant challenges as they seek to establish themselves, so it\u2019s crucial we continue to do everything we can to give them the best chance to survive, and thrive, in Scotland.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6e2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/ukraine-pilots-trained-f-16-jets-nato-russia", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ukraine pilots being trained to fly F-16 jets, says Nato", "lead": "Move follows months of debate in Washington,  as Ukraine reports success in its counteroffensive", "author": "Daniel Boffey in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:32:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114641", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/22925a1824d5984b76a00af9b38778ab68d53d62/74_102_3682_2210/500.jpg", "body": "Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato\u2019s secretary general has revealed, as Kyiv claimed further incremental progress in its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said that the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. \u201cThe fact that training has started provides us with the option to also decide to deliver the planes and then the pilots will be ready to fly them,\u201d the former prime minister of Norway said as he arrived at a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels. The development follows months of internal debate in Washington over the risks of Ukraine deploying F-16s to attack targets on Russian territory and potentially escalating the conflict. The US has control over the jets\u2019 re-export from any country that has them in its arsenal. As recently as February the US president, Joe Biden, declined Ukrainian requests for the lightweight fighter aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, is understood to have subsequently given firm commitments that the planes would be used only to target Russian forces within Ukraine. It will still take months to train Ukraine\u2019s pilots, who will have previously flown mainly in Soviet-standard aircraft. Ukraine does not yet even have runways suitable for F-16s should Nato allies agree to provide the hardware. Kyiv has in recent days warned that its long-anticipated counteroffensive is running into Russia\u2019s air and artillery superiority. Despite those challenges, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said on Thursday that progress in its counteroffensive was being made, with Ukraine regaining control over 4o sq miles (103 sq km) since the weekend. Ukrainian forces were said to have pushed 2 to 4 miles into formerly occupied lands. Hromov told journalists that his troops had benefited from the provision of MiG-29 planes from Poland and Slovakia and claimed, without providing evidence, that Russian soldiers were deliberately inflicting wounds upon themselves to avoid battle. Hromov said: \u201cThe Ukrainian army has gained considerable experience and skill on the battlefield this year, and we are ready and will continue to fight until the complete liberation of our own territories, even with our bare hands. With heavy weapons from our allies, this will happen faster.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s army is said to have advanced by 2 miles near the village of Mala Tokmachka in the Zaporizhzhia region and by up to 4 miles near a village south of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said: \u201cThere is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front]. The enemy is pulling up additional reserves and is trying with all its might to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces.\u201d Stoltenberg said western hardware was making a difference in the fighting. Moscow has widely disseminated video footage of US Bradley armoured vehicles and German-made Leopard tanks being hit by Russian fire. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Ukraine retained sufficient firepower for the battle to come. \u201cI think the Russians have shown us that same five vehicles about 1,000 times from 10 different angles,\u201d he said. \u201cBut quite frankly, the Ukrainians still have a lot of combat capability, combat power. \u201cThis will continue to be a tough fight, as we anticipate it, and I believe that the element that does the best in terms of sustainment will probably have the advantage at the end of the day.\u201d The US chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said it was too early \u201cto put any estimates\u201d on how long the Ukrainian counteroffensive would last. He said: \u201cThis is a very difficult fight; it is a very violent fight and it will likely take a considerable amount of time and at high cost.\u201d Russian military bloggers have claimed as many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike by a US-made Himars rocket system earlier this week, although Ukrainian officials declined to comment. Beyond the provision of fighter jet training, it has been announced in Brussels that the US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark were sending \u201chigh priority\u201d air defence equipment including hundreds of missiles to Ukraine and that the delivery would be completed within weeks. Last month, it emerged the UK had already delivered multiple Storm Shadow cruise missiles, giving Ukraine\u2019s defence a new long-range strike capability. That move had prompted threats from the Kremlin and earlier this week Belarus\u2019s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, engaged in further nuclear sabre-rattling as he announced that Russian tactical warheads would be relocated to Belarusian territory. Stoltenberg said the situation was being monitored but that it did not appear to be a significant move. \u201cWe are, of course, closely monitoring what Russia is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, we haven\u2019t seen any changes in the nuclear posture that requires any changes in our posture\u201d. He added: \u201cRussia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric and messaging is reckless and dangerous. Russia must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u201d Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, arrived in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia to assess the risks to Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear power plant following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. The dam\u2019s reservoir provides the cooling water for the plant. After his inspection, Grossi said measures had been taken to stabilise the situation but he added that inspectors would stay at the facility, in a sign of the concerns the visit had raised among officials at the UN\u2019s atomic watchdog."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6e3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/15/boris-johnson-debacle-look-afresh-house-of-lords", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "One good can come from the Boris Johnson debacle: the will to look afresh at the House of Lords | Norman Fowler", "lead": "We should consider whether PMs should have such power to shape the upper chamber, says former lord speaker Norman Fowler", "author": "Norman Fowler", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:26:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114659", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7848bd413fdfb32c2d5c1fc04ca839679827c2d7/0_313_5754_3453/500.jpg", "body": "It was the autumn of 1989. I had been a member of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet for the past 10 years and it was time to move on. In putting this to the prime minister in her office in Downing Street, I was deluged with kind remarks\u2013 but then came a response I had not envisaged. \u201cI know you want to stay in the Commons, but if you want to go to the Lords then that is entirely possible.\u201d I repeated my desire to stay in the Commons, where I had been for 20 years. But just before I left, she returned to the alternative. \u201cYou can go to the Lords if you change your mind.\u201d It was not until 10 years later that I was appointed to the Lords, alongside Michael Heseltine and on a party list of William Hague\u2019s. I had a second chance, which was more than was offered my former colleague John Nott, who had been defence secretary during the Falklands. He had refused a peerage, quite rightly, to pursue a business career, and inexplicably was never offered it again. I tell this story to illustrate both the capriciousness of the Lords\u2019 appointments system and the power of the sitting prime minister, whether there is a resignation honours list or not. Indeed, the wonder is that prime ministers consider such a list necessary. A prime minister can simply take their own decision to reward loyalty \u2013 or tuck away an awkward customer in the Lords, where it is hoped they will do less damage. Boris Johnson has at least done us all one great favour with his departing honours list. He has put reform of the Lords firmly back on the political agenda. For more than a decade, the government has resolutely ignored the case for change. Now, a part of that case has been set out in technicolour. Even after all the pruning of the past few months, we still have a position where seven new peers are to be added to a house that is already more than 800 strong \u2013 and added to by a man who has been judged to have misled the very parliament he is increasing. If I was still in the cabinet, I would argue the time has come for a fundamental review of the Lords along the lines of a royal commission. There are at least three questions that need to be settled and, hopefully, debated by the parties in the election. First, in an appointed house, is the public interest served by giving the prime minister such a pivotal position in making appointments? We should remember that a peerage is not just an honour, it is a door to the legislature. It enables the new peer to take part in all the debates on all the bills that the government provides, and vote on them. Second, there is a wide consensus that the appointed house is too large. When I was lord speaker, I set up an all-party committee in 2016 to review the position. Their unanimous finding was that the number of peers should be reduced to 600. Had the government accepted that proposal we would be near that total today, but, of course, it was content to sleep on. The third question is the most fundamental. Should we move from an appointed house to an elected, or at least partly elected, one? A royal commission would be entirely the right body to help settle that. The argument for an elected house has always been strong. It is self-evidently more democratic and gives representation to all parts of the kingdom in a way that the present house does not. I confess that, as a new member of the Lords in 1991 , I harboured an ambition for my role to develop to become one of the first members of an elected upper house. Over 20 years later, that outcome seems as far away as ever. More than that, there does not seem any appetite in the government to try to get the present appointment-based system to work better. If there is another government with a more radical agenda for the Lords, I hope those ministers who have resisted moderate reform will reflect that they have no one to blame but themselves.

In the lawsuit, filed in a US federal court in Tennessee, Musk is cited as having said copyright \u201cgoes absurdly far beyond protecting the original creator\u201d and \u201coverzealous\u201d application of copyright laws \u201cis a plague on humanity\u201d. \u201cThis statement and others like it exert pressure on Twitter employees, including those in its trust and safety team, on issues relating to copyright and infringement,\u201d argues the suit brought by the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association on behalf of firms including Sony Music Publishing, BMG Rights Management and Universal Music Publishing Group. Since Musk bought the company late last year, two of its trust and safety officials, Yoel Roth and Ella Irwin, have left. At the heart of the claim lies the fact that Twitter has not paid for a blanket licence allowing its users to upload copyrighted material, unlike most of its competitors including TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat. As such, it accuses the platform of having an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d over rivals. This year, the New York Times reported that talks at Twitter to license that material, ongoing since 2021, had stalled over the $100m price tag and fallen apart since Musk bought the site. A list of 1,700 songs is included in the court filing, with the plaintiffs claiming that each had been uploaded by \u201cspecific users who had already been identified in multiple earlier notices\u201d. In each case, it says, Twitter \u201cdid not expeditiously remove or disable access\u201d. \u201cTwitter\u2019s policies demonstrate that Twitter views itself, not the law, as the arbiter of what content is permitted on the Twitter platform,\u201d the case argues. \u201cDespite claiming to take down tweets in response to an infringement notice within hours or minutes, Twitter routinely waits much longer before acting, if it acts at all,\u201d it adds. \u201cThere are thousands of instances where Twitter waited 30 days or more to remove or disable access to the content identified.\u201d The lawsuit asks for a $150,000 statutory penalty for each one of the thousands of violations. Twitter users have noticed the lax enforcement of the company\u2019s own policies. This year, users began posting entire movies to the platform, initially in two-minute chunks and then, as upload limits were increased, in hour-long segments. One user posted the Super Mario Bros Movie, while it was still in cinemas, to the platform, and received almost 10m views in just two days. Musk acquired Twitter for $44bn last October, but under his reign its value has tumbled. According to one of the only remaining independent shareholders in the company, the asset manager Fidelity, it is now worth barely a third of that. Fidelity revalued its holdings in the company, now officially called X Holdings Corp, from $20m last year to just $6.6m now, a reassessment that would value the entire operation at less than $15bn.

We\u2019re now living, after all, in an age in which three separate generations of Spider-Men share screen time; when Patrick Stewart wheels his way into a different Marvel continuity, teasing a full mutant takeover to come; and when, in this week\u2019s The Flash, Michael Keaton throws on the cape and cowl again, ready to save a DC universe that bears little resemblance to the Gotham City he occupied three decades ago. It\u2019s a brave new world of franchises colliding with each other \u2026 even if, as of right now, the crossovers mainly involve variations on the same characters, played by different actors. The multiverse, that far-out notion that there are countless parallel versions of our reality, is how Disney, Warner Bros and Sony have narratively justified this new strategy \u2013 the way they\u2019ve each turned the whole history of superhero cinema into one big sandbox. The Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse introduced the idea to multiplex audiences, even as it only hinted at the crowd-pleasing possibilities of pulling old characters (and the stars that brought them to life) into the blockbuster present. Since then, Marvel has gone all in on the gimmick, building three present and forthcoming \u201cphases\u201d of its multi-year franchise plan around the existence of other dimensions. Cross-town rival DC appears to be following suit: if the ghoulish beyond-the-grave CGI cameos of The Flash\u2019s third act are any indication, the company will soon be using the multiverse as license to reboot its whole line of costumed heroes. It\u2019s easy to see why this idea appeals to studio executives and audiences alike. It\u2019s the natural evolution of the \u201cshared universe\u201d, the immensely popular practice of building franchises within franchises, so that the characters of separate movies can sometimes cross paths \u2013 superheroes assembling into supergroups, Godzilla fighting King Kong, Universal monsters capering together through a Dark Universe. (OK, so not all of these epic Hollywood meet-and-greets came to pass.) But the multiverse negates the need for years of set-up. Theoretically, studios can now cut straight to the dopamine hit of Avengers: Endgame without making a bunch of other movies first, because they\u2019re drawing on a library of pre-existing movies and already beloved characters. Likewise, for viewers, multiverse stories combine the excitement of a big team-up with the nostalgia rush of a legacy sequel. No wonder it\u2019s a popular approach. But is it sustainable? How long exactly can Hollywood strip-mine its own past in this particular way? So far, multiverse movies have succeeded through a potent combination of surprise and novelty. Audiences didn\u2019t expect to see Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield back in the red tights, and they certainly never expected to see them together; Spider-Man: No Way Home broke the innate rules of reboot culture, suddenly suggesting that multiple versions of a popular character could coexist. It was a neat trick, but is it repeatable? Maguire and Garfield showing up, in brief clip form, in the recent Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has inspired some applause \u2026 but nothing like what greeted their appearances in No Way Home. Been there, clapped at that already. Make no mistake, applause is what these multiversal blockbusters are chasing, predominantly. They even have a tendency to pause for it. Most of them, so far, have looked at the literally endless possibilities of the multiverse \u2013 the notion of an infinite number of other realities \u2013 and mainly seen the opportunity to flash a familiar face in front of moviegoers like a pair of jangling keys. Last year\u2019s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness successfully secured Stewart\u2019s Professor Xavier, a godfather of the modern superhero movie, only to reduce his involvement to the final float of a cameo parade. Likewise, while it\u2019s fun to see Keaton back in the biggest role of his career, The Flash doesn\u2019t do terribly much with his Batman, content to supply him with a couple of old catchphrases. And once you\u2019ve brought these famous figures back, there\u2019s inevitably going to be less excitement about seeing them again; it\u2019s the event-movie equivalent of those big rock-star reunion tours, which tend to sell a little less in their second and third legs than they do during the first few dates. There are plenty of other characters, of course. We\u2019ll probably see a good number of them in Marvel\u2019s forthcoming Secret Wars, four years from now, which is already heavily rumored to be the studio\u2019s eventual attempt at a multiversal Endgame \u2013 a stab at achieving the apotheosis of this trend of yanking yesterday\u2019s favorite heroes out of the vault and back into action. But it\u2019s not an undrainable pool of people audiences will be excited to see again. Will they cheer for Ben Affleck\u2019s Daredevil? How about, back across town, Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s Steel? The risk of this fundamentally referential approach to franchising is twofold. The shock and the thrill will wear off eventually. At the same time, collapsing the boundaries between separate series threatens to diminish the appeal of individual ones; are audiences coming to prefer the quick, exhaustible sting of recognition \u2013 of having their memory jogged \u2013 above all else? No Way Home, at the very least, does a little more than just stare through a portal into the past. It plays on the actual dramatic stakes of old movies \u2013 on our past relationships to these ghosts of aborted franchises. The film\u2019s smartest choice is to give Garfield\u2019s Peter Parker an actual arc, resolving the emotional cliffhanger of his second Amazing Spider-Man. For the multiverse to sustain itself, studios might stand to take the right lesson from that movie\u2019s success, and learn from the opportunity for closure it capitalized on. There\u2019s only fleeting, superficial success to be found in treating intellectual property like props, or in assuming that a character\u2019s presence alone is enough. Then again, Hollywood could (and probably will) just push this strategy past Endgame to a logical endpoint. How long before Oswalt\u2019s prophecy comes true, and the walls separating one fantasy world from another completely collapse? Is a title fight between Darth Vader and Thanos far off? These days, no time is too long ago and no galaxy so far away that a bridge to both can\u2019t be built."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6e6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/15/wildfire-smoke-midwest-air-quality-minnesota-wisconsin-canada", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US midwest braces for smoky skies as Canadian wildfires rage on", "lead": "Air quality alerts issued in Minnesota and Wisconsin with winds expected to blow airborne pollution from Ontario blazes south", "author": "Erum Salam", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:23:47", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114710", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/08eaac2cbfefdda0818dba051c541cdb972674bb/0_202_3968_2380/500.jpg", "body": "The smoke-filled skies seen across US cities last week are set to make another appearance, as Canadian wildfires rage on and winds are bringing the airborne pollution south and again triggered fears over risks to health.

On Wednesday at the annual SBC conference in New Orleans, representatives also known as \u201cmessengers\u201d upheld an executive committee decision to expel the California-based Saddleback megachurch and Fern Creek Baptist church, a smaller congregation in Kentucky. The votes were overwhelming. For Saddleback church, 9,437 voted for expulsion while 1,212 voted against. For Fern Creek Baptist, the votes were 9,700 to 806. Saddleback, established in the 1980s by the influential pastor and author Rick Warren, stirred controversy in 2021 when Warren ordained three women as pastors, in contradiction of the SBC statement of beliefs. Warren announced his retirement and transferred his leadership role to Andy and Stacie Wood. While Andy Wood leads the church as head pastor, his wife functions as a \u201cteaching pastor\u201d and occasionally preaches. According to the SBC beliefs: \u201cWhile both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by scripture.\u201d Fern Creek Baptist has been led by Linda Barnes Popham since 1993. Both churches were deemed to \u201cnot be in friendly cooperation\u201d with SBC beliefs, reported Baptist Press, the self-proclaimed official news service of the denomination. Warren accused people of wanting to \u201ctake the SBC backward\u201d, the New York Times reported. \u201cThere are people who want to take the SBC backward \u2026 Some people want to take it back to the 1950s \u2013 that is their golden age for the church, the 1950s, when basically white men rule supreme, and the woman\u2019s place is in the home, and there is not a lot of diversity,\u201d he said at a news conference. Popham told CNN on Thursday the expulsion felt like a divorce but added: \u201cOn the other hand, there is something liberating and freeing, being bound no more to the traditions and opinions and the power of those in leadership in the Southern Baptist Convention.\u201d The denomination also voted this week to amend its constitution to enshrine its ban on female pastors. The amendment approved on Wednesday updates the constitution to state that SBC churches must \u201caffirm, appoint or employ only men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by scripture\u201d.

For the previous 30 years, she had been an outstanding, ferocious presence in theatre and on screen, a leading light of the Royal Shakespeare Company in its most radical phase, and as memorable in film comedies with George Segal and Walter Matthau as she was in more tempestuous movies by Ken Russell. She never had to prove a point about her politics: she was known for having concerns rather than ideas, and these were rooted in her background of working-class poverty, and her belief that the arts had both a higher purpose and a responsibility to educate and inform. It is extraordinary that, at the height of her fame in the 1980s, she appeared in London stage productions of ambitious, difficult plays by Botho Strauss, Eugene O\u2019Neill, Jean Racine, Bertolt Brecht, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Howard Barker. She evinced an uncompromised intelligence, and a scrubbed beauty that had nothing to do with makeup or vanity. She was always strong, never sentimental, with a great aptitude for sarcasm and sourness. She was impatient with frivolity, except when it came to working with Morecambe and Wise. She first appeared on the great comedy duo\u2019s TV show in 1971 as Cleopatra in a typically tawdry, but hilarious, cod-classical sketch \u2013 \u201cAll men are fools and what makes them fools is having beauty like what I have got\u201d \u2013 and returned on four of their subsequent Christmas shows. Jackson was as fearless in sending herself up as she was in going for the jugular on stage; she was totally without affectation. She did not think much of her looks, having been \u201can archetypal spotty teenager who suffered the tortures of the damned because I wasn\u2019t like those girls in the magazines\u201d, and she never tampered with her imperfectly aligned teeth; for her legion of admirers, such honesty redoubled her sensuality. And there was a deep-seated unhappiness about her that she could always turn to dramatic advantage. \u201cWhen I have to cry,\u201d she once said, \u201cI think about my love life. And when I have to laugh, I think about my love life.\u201d The American director Charles Marowitz said: \u201cIt was always the sense of being close to elemental forces that accounted for Glenda\u2019s fascination; the knowledge that she is capable of manifesting those potent inner states, that in most of us remain contained or suppressed.\u201d She was born in Birkenhead, then in Cheshire, now in Merseyside, the eldest of four daughters of Harry Jackson, a bricklayer, and his wife, Joan (nee Pearce), a cleaner, moving soon afterwards to the coastal village of Hoylake. Her family was distinctly matriarchal, a fact compounded by the absence of Harry for six years during the second world war, serving on minesweepers. Glenda was educated at Holy Trinity Church of England primary school in Hoylake and West Kirby grammar school for girls, where she became, by all accounts, sullen and introverted. She did badly in her exams and, aged 16, took a job in the local Boots pharmacy, a stultifying experience. A developing interest in the cinema, a school visit to see Donald Wolfit as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice at the Liverpool Empire, and a brush with amateur dramatics led her to audition for Rada in London in 1954; she began studying there in January 1955, financed by a discretionary award from Cheshire education committee. She was one of the first wave of students going against the grain of the old-style \u201cfinishing school\u201d Rada in the wake of the arrival of Albert Finney, Peter O\u2019Toole and Alan Bates. On graduating, she acquired an agent, the redoubtable Peter Crouch, and worked in repertory theatres in Worthing and Hornchurch, making her London debut in All Kinds of Men at the Arts theatre in September 1957, followed by a six-month season at Crewe, where she met and married the stage manager, Roy Hodges. Further seasons at the Dundee Rep and the Lyric Hammersmith led to a West End debut in Bill Naughton\u2019s Alfie (transferring from the Mermaid) as one of John Neville\u2019s girlfriends. Peter Brook bowed to the insistence of his colleague Marowitz in hiring Jackson for the RSC\u2019s notorious Theatre of Cruelty season at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda) in 1964, an experimental project using improvisation based on the theories of the mad genius Antonin Artaud, and other psychological exercises, leading to \u201cclub\u201d performances (to bypass censorship by the lord chamberlain\u2019s office): in one of them, Jackson was stripped naked and dressed in prison clothes while a report on Christine Keeler (of Profumo affair notoriety) was read out; she was later transformed into Jackie Kennedy. In an intense few seasons with the RSC between 1964 and 1966, she secured her reputation for danger and pent-up savagery in Brecht\u2019s masterpiece Puntila, Peter Weiss\u2019s The Investigation (playing all the female witnesses at Auschwitz, with Penelope Keith), and the David Warner Hamlet; her electrifying Ophelia had all the qualities needed, said Penelope Gilliatt in the Observer, to play the title role. Most controversially, she appeared in two landmark Brook productions (both later filmed by him), Marat/Sade (1965), in which she played a psychotic Charlotte Corday, whipping the bath-bound Marat with her long hair; and US (1966), a quietly enraged, inquisitive response to the Vietnam war, and how we might deal with it on our own doorstep. She was one of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters (alongside Avril Elgar and Marianne Faithfull) in William Gaskill\u2019s fine production of Edward Bond\u2019s translation at the Royal Court in 1967, and then her film career (which had started in Lindsay Anderson\u2019s This Sporting Life, with Richard Harris, in 1963) really took off: she won two Oscars before she even set foot in Hollywood, for her brilliant performances in Russell\u2019s DH Lawrence fantasia Women in Love (1969), and Melvin Frank\u2019s delightful romcom A Touch of Class (1973), revealing an unsuspected talent for bitchy high comedy as a divorced fashion designer in a hectic affair with Segal. These years can now be seen as the pinnacle of her career: an amazing performance over six different episodes of Elizabeth R (1971) on BBC television, ageing from 16 to 69, ending with a parched, cracked face, and two Emmy awards in the US; another Russell histrionic special, The Music Lovers (1971), in which she famously writhed naked on the floor of a train compartment to the sounds of Tchaikovsky; yet another take on the Virgin Queen in a recreation of Friedrich Schiller\u2019s fictional encounter between Elizabeth and her cousin Mary Stuart in Charles Jarrott\u2019s Mary, Queen of Scots (1971), opposite Vanessa Redgrave; a tranquil wartime drama in Michael Apted\u2019s The Triple Echo (1972), based on an HE Bates novel; and a finely poised Lady Hamilton in James Cellan Jones\u2019s Bequest to the Nation (1973) by Terence Rattigan. That film reunited her with Peter Finch, with whom she had starred in John Schlesinger\u2019s pioneering, grown-up look at bisexuality in Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), written by Gilliatt. Jackson, in fine fettle as a divorced businesswoman, shared her beefcake lover (Murray Head) with Finch\u2019s conflicted gay doctor. Two stage performances, in Jean Genet\u2019s The Maids at Greenwich in 1974, with Susannah York, and Henrik Ibsen\u2019s Hedda Gabler, directed by Trevor Nunn at the RSC in 1975, were also filmed. Jackson\u2019s Hedda was so withering and scornful, you wondered how she had lasted one night of the honeymoon, let alone six months. Hedda\u2019s volatility and confusion carried through to Jackson\u2019s private life as she embarked on a tempestuous affair \u2013 it would last six and a half years, on and off \u2013 with the show\u2019s lighting designer, Andy Phillips (who had been an electrician on the Marat/Sade at the RSC). This ended her marriage to Hodges and propelled her through a couple of indifferent Hollywood romcoms (House Calls with Matthau in 1978, Lost and Found, with Segal again, in 1979) and a mixed bunch of stage shows, one of which, Bond\u2019s version of the Jacobean masterpiece The White Devil at the Old Vic in 1976, signalled both the launch and instant demise of a Jackson/Phillips production company. There was some respite in two touchingly modulated performances on the West End stage, as the poet Stevie Smith in Hugh Whitemore\u2019s Stevie (1977), in which she projected an aching sense of loneliness; and as a teacher trapped in a dull marriage in Andrew Davies\u2019 Rose (1980). In between these two, she returned briefly to the RSC in 1978 to play Cleopatra directed by Brook, another disaster. First, the announced Antony, Stacy Keach, was replaced at the last minute by Alan Howard, and the chemistry simply was not right (although Jonathan Pryce was a superb Octavius). Brook insisted on a chamber production with cushions on the vast Stratford stage; although Jackson\u2019s crop-haired Queen of old Nile was a mercurial majesty in orange kaftans, the tragedy never did justice to its own poetry. At this point, with her Hollywood status in decline \u2013 briefly revived, later, with a misfired but interesting Robert Altman movie of Christopher Durang\u2019s Beyond Therapy (1987) and another, less good, Russell go at DH Lawrence, The Rainbow (1989) \u2013 she unexpectedly surfaced in 1982 in the West End as Eva Braun, Hitler\u2019s mistress, in Robert David MacDonald\u2019s witty conversation piece Summit Conference (first seen at the Glasgow Citizens in 1978). Her involvement with, and admiration for, the Citizens theatre under Giles Havergal and Philip Prowse led to her final decade of outstanding theatre work: in London, she appeared in Strauss\u2019s Great and Small (1983) and O\u2019Neill\u2019s five-hour Strange Interlude (1984), both directed by the Citizens alumnus Keith Hack, before linking with Prowse on a sensational Ph\u00e8dre at the Old Vic; this tumultuous performance was the Cleopatra that went missing and certainly her most terrifying work since Marat/Sade. Then, as a ferociously authoritarian widow shutting up her five daughters in an Andaluc\u00edan village, she led the Spanish director N\u00faria Espert\u2019s wonderful revival of Lorca\u2019s The House of Bernarda Alba (translated by David MacDonald), alongside Joan Plowright, at the Globe (now the Gielgud) in 1986. From this glorious platform, facing new challenges, she was ready for anything. But the world was changing. The roles, too, were drying up. She had no intention, she said, of hanging around to play the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet: \u201cLife\u2019s too short.\u201d Her biographer, the Labour MP Chris Bryant, said that until Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, Jackson had not regarded herself as a political actor, in the way Jane Fonda or Redgrave did. She had long been a Labour party member, and gave time and energy to single-issue campaigns, such as human rights, Oxfam and abortion. She considered standing for parliament. Her last hurrah was a typically ebullient and uncompromising performance as the Renaissance painter Galactia in Barker\u2019s Scenes from an Execution at the Almeida in 1990 (she had first played the role on radio in 1984), followed by Prowse\u2019s revival of Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage and Her Children at the Citizens in Glasgow (seen briefly at the Mermaid); she was loud, brassy, wolfish, pugnacious, resilient and scornful \u2013 \u201cGod help her opponents in the House of Commons, should she get there,\u201d I wrote at the time. Although her friend Neil Kinnock, the then Labour leader, tried to dissuade her from standing in 1992, on the grounds that she was a great actor first and a Labour party member second, he acknowledged her determination and swung his electioneering machine behind her. Despite the overall Labour debacle in losing to John Major, she achieved a swing of twice the national average, proving, in her early career at Westminster, as popular a new \u201ccelebrity\u201d MP as were Sebastian Coe and Gyles Brandreth on the Tory side. In 1997, re-elected in the Tony Blair landslide, she served briefly as a junior transport minister, but she became an increasingly critical voice on her own side, especially over the Iraq war. She was rarely heard in the Commons, but always remained a highly popular constituency MP and was as much a fixture upstairs on the No 24 bus, in her trademark red overcoat, shuttling between her Kentish Town surgeries and parliament, as were Michael Foot and Frank Dobson. Constituency boundaries were redrawn for the 2010 general election, Dobson taking over many of Jackson\u2019s voters in the safe seat of Holborn and St Pancras, while she was left to fight a tough losing battle, it seemed, for Hampstead and Kilburn; doughty to the last, she held on, after a recount, with a dangerously slight majority of just 42 votes. She left politics and made a surprise return to acting in 2015, making waves in a BBC Radio 4 series based on the novels of Emile Zola. Then the sucker punch: an 80-year-old King Lear at the Old Vic in 2016, scowling and raging her way through the pitiless storm, a great performance, impressive in its range, stamina and bravery. She returned to Broadway in Edward Albee\u2019s Three Tall Women in 2018, winning a Tony award, and reprised her Lear in New York in 2019. Latterly she played an elderly grandmother with dementia to perfection in a BBC television drama, Elizabeth Is Missing, winning a third Emmy, and she completed an onscreen reunion with Michael Caine \u2013 she had appeared with Caine and Helmut Berger in Joseph Losey\u2019s The Romantic Englishwoman, written by Tom Stoppard, in 1975 \u2013 in Oliver Parker\u2019s The Great Escaper, about a war veteran in Hove escaping a care home to attend a D-day landings anniversary. Jackson was appointed CBE in 1978. She is survived by her son with Hodges, Daniel, and two grandchildren. Michael Coveney Julia Langdon writes: Glenda Jackson\u2019s politics were informed primarily by the considerable poverty of her childhood. It made her a traditional socialist and one who was prepared to stand up for her personal beliefs, irrespective of any official Labour party line. She had joined the party aged 16, fostered an ambition to become a social worker and, despite her considerable early celebrity on stage and screen, had a number of walk-on parts in the periphery of politics from the middle of the 1970s. A republican and an active feminist, she believed in human rights for anyone, anywhere. Her particular concern was for homeless people, and she campaigned for a wide range of causes and charities. She was also an internationalist, actively helping the African National Congress during the fight against apartheid and, having been devastated by a personal visit to Ethiopia during the 1986 famine, she explored working for Voluntary Service Overseas. She was vocal and opinionated, making her a highly attractive potential parliamentary candidate for the Labour party. She resisted a number of early invitations, notably to succeed Denis Healey in Leeds East, but was selected shortly thereafter in 1989 for the Tory-held Hampstead and Highgate constituency. Having never previously attended any local Labour party meeting, she was chosen from a shortlist of four women on the strength of the powerful personal manifesto she gave her audience amounting to a repudiation of the policies of the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. She won the seat comfortably in 1992 and held it thereafter in the ensuing four general elections. After boundary changes when the seat became Hampstead and Kilburn in 2010, she had the closest election result in England with a majority of just 42. In her maiden speech, Jackson challenged the traditional perception of the residents of Hampstead as mainly comprising the well-heeled chatterati and pointed out that the largest single group in her constituency were pensioners, the majority of whom were on social benefits. She swiftly repudiated any idea that her appearance on the Commons\u2019 benches might import a touch of stardust or glamour, presenting herself instead with a scrubbed face as a serious and busy backbencher with a job to do, a performance that proved a serious disappointment to the parliamentary sketchwriters. She voted for Tony Blair as Labour leader in 1994 and he appointed her as a shadow transport spokeswoman in 1996 and as the transport minister with responsibility for London after the 1997 election victory. She remained in post for two years but then resigned to stand unsuccessfully for selection as the potential Labour candidate in the first London mayoral election, having been identified as someone who could defeat the renegade Ken Livingstone. Thereafter she became a highly visible backbench MP who exercised her freedom to speak out in defence of her beliefs, particularly if they ran contrary to those of the Labour government. During the rows involving the Militant tendency in the early 1980s, she had denounced the policies of that organisation as \u201cself-indulgent crap\u201d. Now she used the full force of her rhetoric to denounce the Blair government\u2019s war in Iraq. After the 2005 election she threatened to stand against Blair as a stalking horse candidate for the Labour leadership to try to force his retirement as prime minister. In 2011 she announced she would not contest the next election on the grounds of her age, and she stood down in 2015 after 23 years in the Commons. \u2022 Glenda May Jackson, actor, born 9 May 1936; died 15 June 2023 \u2022 This article was amended on 16 june 2023.

But on a new-build street half a mile or so away from the sprawling site, a rather more low-key but nonetheless heartwarming event was taking place involving the festival\u2019s founder, Michael Eavis, and the television presenter and ex-footballer Gary Lineker. Lineker was wielding a spade in order to plant a snowberry tree \u2013 as Eavis beamed away \u2013 to mark the end of a project to build 52 rented social homes just outside the festival\u2019s perimeter fence in the Somerset village of Pilton. Though he will always be best known for the festival, Eavis said that, actually, his Maggie\u2019s Farm development, conceived to ensure local people aren\u2019t driven away by soaring rural property prices, was his proudest achievement. \u201cPilton is really important to me,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cIt\u2019s where I was born, where I have lived man and boy, where I have brought up my family, and, of course, it has been home to the festival for more than 50 years now. \u201cWith rural house prices so often out of reach for local people, these houses give villagers, most of whom are working families who live around here, the opportunity to live here for the rest of their lives at a social rent. \u201cI started to build these houses 30 years ago. Of all the things I\u2019ve done in my life this is the one I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d Lineker, a Glastonbury fan who was last at the festival in 2019 when Stormzy headlined, said he had been chuffed to be invited to plant the tree on a small park called Athelstan\u2019s Meadow (Athelstan is Eavis\u2019 first name). \u201cI think housing is a big issue in the country at the moment,\u201d Lineker said. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019ve got real housing issues around the country and rents are going through the roof. We all see a lot of homeless people but we\u2019re also talking about people with good and important jobs \u2013 like teachers. Rents are soaring and they can\u2019t afford them. \u201cHere rents will stay low. Nobody is going to be able to sell their properties. It\u2019s such a great initiative that if it was to be copied everywhere else it would make such a difference.\u201d Asked if the government should be doing more, Lineker said: \u201cThey should be. Everyone recognises that we have a housing issue. There\u2019s a lot of wealthy people in the country that perhaps would like to help, maybe we could give them tax breaks. But the government needs to do their bit. The housing crisis is going to be [a] big issue going ahead whoever\u2019s in power. They could learn a lot from this.\u201d Lineker said Eavis\u2019s work on social housing should be celebrated: \u201cIt shows a real generosity and kindness of spirit. It would be nice to see if it could be replicated. The government needs to find ways to encourage more people to do this kind of thing. It makes sense. Let\u2019s hope for more of the same elsewhere. I think it\u2019s an extraordinary achievement.\u201d The latest homes are built on land Eavis has given to the Guinness Partnership, one of the largest affordable housing and care providers in England. Stone from the Eavis farm has been used to clad the homes. They have been built on the brand new Margaret Bondfield Close, named after the British Labour party politician, trade unionist and women\u2019s rights activist, who was born in Chard in Somerset. The new road sits within Maggie\u2019s Farm, echoing the politician\u2019s name and nodding to the Bob Dylan song of the same name. Lineker \u2013 who conceded that his digging skills were not a strongpoint \u2013 was helped by Eavis\u2019s grandchildren. Neighbours from other already occupied homes and Glastonbury helpers came out to look, some wearing football shirts for the occasion. Annie, 23, who works in a school, said it was a wonderful place to live. \u201cWe love our neighbours. I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere else. The kids play outside. It\u2019s safe; it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d House prices in the rest of the village are eye-watering. A two-bedroom cottage is on the market for \u00a3450,000; rental property in the area is hard to find. \u201cWe feel so comfortable here,\u201d Amber, 26, an administrator, said. \u201cWith house prices as they are we wouldn\u2019t have a chance of buying or renting around here.

And that\u2019s before the rise of streaming video potentially increases that workload many times over. So it\u2019s no surprise that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), which classifies films in the UK, is turning to artificial intelligence to try to lighten the load. A new partnership with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division seeks to teach an AI model to identify and tag \u201ccontent issues\u201d such as bad language, dangerous behaviour, sex and violence, to save time when classifying a film or other video content. The board insists that the AI system isn\u2019t intended to do away with the work of its professional compliance officers, with another four hired recently. Instead, it saves time, cutting the amount of work required by as much as 60%. \u201cWith the exponential growth of online content over the last few years, we\u2019re investing in these new products and the development of scalable solutions to improve our service by making the guidance we provide even more useful to families. Although in its infancy, we\u2019re confident that this project will bring added value to the wider industry by bringing down the cost of classification in the future,\u201d said David Austin, the board\u2019s chief executive. Some aspects of the classification system, such as bad language, are fairly easy to automate. Others, like nudity, have become more possible in recent years with the progress of machine vision technology. But some categories the BBFC needs to highlight, such as dangerous behaviour or sexual violence, are harder to teach an AI to look out for. The next phase of the project will see AI systems trained to determine and assign international age ratings, in conjunction with the tagging tool. Ultimately, the idea is that streaming services will be able to get age ratings for their content for multiple territories at once, with the goal of driving down the cost of classification in the future. The BBFC\u2019s work has been controversial in the past. Financially, the board relies on distributors for its funding, and they are paid for each minute of screen time they classify. That led to \u201cPaint Drying\u201d, a 10-hour film of a freshly painted wall shot by film-maker Charlie Shackleton in 2016. The project was funded by Kickstarter, with Shackleton promising to make the film as long as he could afford to do so. (In the end, \u00a35,936 was raised, and all the money after Kickstarter\u2019s cut was sent straight to the BBFC.) Due to its length, Paint Drying, which was submitted as one 310GB video file, was assessed by the board\u2019s compliance officers over two consecutive days. Counterintuitively, though, the AI system would be unlikely to have helped speed things up: with no content issues to note at all, the film was passed on its first viewing, and given a U rating indicating that it had \u201cno material likely to offend or harm\u201d."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ec", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/15/supreme-court-american-indian-child-welfare-act-civil-rights-", "primaryCategory": "law", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US supreme court upholds protections for Native American children", "lead": "Children will continue to be protected under law preventing removal from their tribal communities for fostering or adoption", "author": "Ed Pilkington in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:53:49", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114881", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bdeaa8db317decea526b4d0bc504eb50ec463273/0_231_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "The US supreme court has ruled that Native American children can continue to be protected under federal law against being removed from their tribal communities for fostering or adoption, rejecting a petition from a white couple who argued that the provision was a form of racial discrimination. The supreme court\u2019s decision upholds decades of federal law that gives Native Americans and tribal members preference in the adoption or foster care of Native American children. By a vote of 7 to 2, the justices rejected the challengers\u2019 claim that the requirement was a form of unconstitutional racial bias against non-Native Americans. The case ultimately pitched the Brackeen family of Texas against the interior secretary, Deb Haaland, for the US government. It amounted to a victory for hundreds of tribal groups. They had united to call for a retention of the law which requires Native children to be placed as a priority within their own extended families, tribes or other Native communities. They argued that the status quo was essential for the survival of tribes themselves. The decision preserves the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a 1978 law that has helped stabilize Native American families and uphold tribal sovereignty. Congress passed the legislation to end a longstanding practice in the US of removing many Native American children from their families and placing them with non-Native Americans. At the time the law was enacted, up to 35% of all Native American children were removed in states with large Native American populations. The ruling, Haaland v Brackeen, was written by the conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett. She was joined by three other rightwing justices and their three liberal-leaning peers, with Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissenting. The seven-strong majority swept away all of the challenges to the ICWA that had been presented to the court by the state of Texas and the family petitioners who had argued that the law overrode the right of states to control family law. Barrett wryly commended the \u201ccreative arguments\u201d brought by Texas, but roundly dismissed them. \u201cThe bottom line is that we reject all of petitioners\u2019 challenges to the statute, some on the merits and others for lack of standing,\u201d she wrote. She added that the supreme court had already recognised \u201cCongress\u2019s power to displace the jurisdiction of state courts in adoption proceedings involving Indian children\u201d, and called the claim that to do so was unconstitutional \u201ca nonstarter\u201d. Tribal leaders hailed Thursday\u2019s decision as an important win. An alliance of Native American representatives, including Chuck Hoskin of the Cherokee Nation and Charles Martin, chairman of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, said in a statement that the ruling was \u201ca major victory for Native tribes, children, and the future of our culture and heritage\u201d. They added that they hoped it would \u201clay to rest the political attacks aimed at diminishing tribal sovereignty and creating instability throughout Indian law that have persisted for too long\u201d. Joe Biden also praised the court for keeping in place a \u201cvital protection for tribal sovereignty\u201d. The president said that looming over the decision was \u201cour nation\u2019s painful history. In the not-so-distant past, Native children were stolen from the arms of the people who loved them \u2026 all with the aim of erasing who they are as Native people and tribal citizens.\u201d The constitutionality of the ICWA was challenged by a white Texas couple, Chad and Jennifer Brackeen, who had wanted to adopt a Navajo child against the will of the Navajo Nation. The couple petitioned the court, arguing that the law\u2019s requirement that an adoptive home should at first be sought within the child\u2019s own Native community was a form of racial discrimination. About 486 tribes and 59 regional tribal organizations filed supporting briefs to the supreme court arguing that the ICWA should be upheld. They argued that the legislation was in the best interests of Native children and that for the purposes of this law, Native Americans should be regarded not as a racial group but as a political class with their own sovereign status. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that overturning the ICWA would put \u201cthe very existence of tribes in jeopardy\u201d. Experts warned it could also cast into doubt hundreds of treaties drawn up between US and state governments and sovereign tribal entities. Both Thomas and Alito delivered dissenting opinions. In his long dissent, Thomas accused the majority on the supreme court bench of running roughshod over \u201cthe normal limits on the federal government\u2019s power to regulate state child custody proceedings \u2026 when the child involved happens to be an Indian\u201d. The law at the center of the new ruling was devised as a response to the widespread 19th-century practice by the US government and individual states of removing children from Native American families in an effort to assimilate them into white American culture. The Bureau of Indian Affairs created 350 boarding schools designed to \u201ccivilize\u201d the children. By the 1920s more than eight out of 10 Native American children of school age were placed in such boarding schools where they were harshly punished, ill-fed and badly educated. The practice continued into the 1970s when up to 35% of Native children were still removed from their families. The new ruling sounds a more cautious note from the rightwing justices who now control the majority on the nation\u2019s most powerful court. Last June in Oklahoma v Castro-Huerta they took a more aggressive stance, setting aside a precedent that had been standing since 1886 and as a result giving states the ability to prosecute non-Natives for crimes committed against tribal members on their reservations."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ed", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/my-mentor-glenda-jackson-tulip-siddiq", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "My mentor Glenda Jackson taught me to be a rebel with a cause | Tulip Siddiq", "lead": "I will miss her powerful oratory, independent spirit and strong sense of social justice \u2013 she fought for her constituents and ignored the party whips", "author": "Tulip Siddiq", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:50:48", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114903", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0896b1829dcc122881551c74ef516ada14362d72/0_65_1172_703/500.jpg", "body": "I first met Glenda Jackson in 2003. I was a young, impressionable university student and she had come to speak at our local Labour party meeting. The hot topic of the day was the war in Iraq. Glenda was unashamedly against the war and wasn\u2019t mincing her words about Tony Blair. She was under a huge amount of pressure to vote for the war, but she told us that her conscience wouldn\u2019t allow her to do so. It has been two decades but I clearly recall Glenda impressing us with her powerful oratory, her independent spirit and her strong sense of social justice. It was a theme throughout her political career for 23 years as my local MP for Hampstead, and the example she set as a good constituency MP inspired me. I remember rebelling against the Welfare Reform bill when I had only been an MP for a few months and overhearing the Labour whips \u2013 who are responsible for party discipline in parliament \u2013 groaning and muttering that they had another Glenda on their hands. I rang Glenda that evening to tell her what the whips had said and she burst into a series of expletives and told me never to listen to them! After the local Labour meeting was over, I nervously approached her. I remember feeling intimidated by this woman who had won two Oscars (but hadn\u2019t bothered to turn up to receive them because she thought awards were a waste of time). What struck me immediately was her lack of affectation. Anyone who knew Glenda wouldn\u2019t describe her as warm. She was blunt, efficient and called a spade a spade. But she had no pretentions and no ego, and that\u2019s highly unusual in politics as the subsequent 20 years of work in local politics and parliament has taught me. Glenda took a keen interest in me when I said I was studying literature and asked what books I was reading. She told me that books had dominated her childhood. American writers such as Sinclair Lewis had made a huge impression on her along with other authors who were putting forward the case for a politics that represents and supports the working class. Glenda became more and more animated as she described how she read constantly and was a regular fixture at her public library. She reminisced about seeing a B-movie called A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as a schoolgirl and remembering the plot exactly \u2013 a girl who lived in a very poor part of Brooklyn and worked her way alphabetically through her local library. Glenda was always very proud of her working-class roots and referenced growing up in poverty frequently, but she never asked for sympathy or praise. When she told me that she had been lucky to \u201csomehow\u201d get a place at Rada, I had to hold back a smile \u2013 I knew you needed more than just luck to land a place in the most prestigious acting school in the world, but it wouldn\u2019t have been Glenda\u2019s style to boast about it. Though Glenda was always civil towards me, I wouldn\u2019t say we were particularly close. It was only after I became the Labour candidate for Hampstead and Kilburn in 2013 that I started to get to know her properly. About a year after I was selected, one of her office aides whispered to me that I had won her respect because, in her words, I \u201cworked bloody hard\u201d. With that encouragement, I felt brave enough to ask her why she embarked on a political journey when she had the glitz of Hollywood at her fingertips. After telling me off thoroughly because \u201cHollywood is not glamorous, it\u2019s hard work\u201d, she told me that she had not known any MPs when she first came to parliament in the early 1990s with a group of people from the arts world. It was for a meeting in the House of Lords and there was a big argument about funding for the arts. In Glenda\u2019s words: \u201cGod \u2026 they were all very parsimonious. I suddenly felt so ashamed that I had never set foot in the Houses of Parliament before. I\u2019m turning up here and saying that something needed to be done but this is only the first time I\u2019ve been here. I needed to do something.\u201d Glenda was not someone who could just sit at home and enjoy retirement. She felt she needed to work, which is why she went back on stage after she left politics in 2015. However, she did tell me that she was happy to do lots of acting because she enjoyed it, though putting on makeup and dressing up was \u201can absolute pain in the backside\u201d. That sentiment summed up Glenda \u2013 someone who didn\u2019t care about appearances but cared about the quality of her work, whether it was fighting for her constituents or playing King Lear. Glenda was a woman in love with social justice, a politician with a touch of class, the queen of Hampstead and my inspiring mentor. I will miss her and so will our local community."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6ee", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/colombia-police-swallow-money-extortion", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Colombian police officer in hospital after swallowing extorted banknotes", "lead": "Grey-faced officer pleaded his innocence after anti-corruption police allegedly caught him in the act of extorting businessman", "author": "Luke Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:46:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114922", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/44860bc52b4b7e08595cf4e7b8ec9a2876d9240b/0_306_4140_2483/500.jpg", "body": "A Colombian police officer has been admitted to hospital after swallowing a wad of banknotes he extorted from a businessman.

It is fuelling worries that the UK could be heading for a rerun of last autumn\u2019s turmoil, when the September mini-budget sparked chaos in the financial markets and led to thousands of mortgage deals being pulled and repriced sharply upwards. The average new two-year fixed rate was 4.74% on 23 September, the day of the mini-budget, but by the start of November it had climbed to 6.47%. In the months that followed, rates gradually fell back as markets stabilised \u2013 until they were spooked once again by a smaller than expected drop in the UK inflation rate at the end of May. The data reflected rapid movement in the market as banks and building societies continued to withdraw available home loans, often at very short notice, before returning with higher-priced fixed-rate deals. Lenders are using repricing to limit the number of new customers before rates rise again, while remaining competitive. The Bank of England meets on Thursday next week, when it is expected to lift the base rate from the current 4.5% level, with some investors predicting a rise to as much as 5%. HSBC has increased its lending rates twice in the past week. Coventry building society\u2019s broker arm is launching more expensive deals on Friday. Speaking to ITV on Wednesday evening, Carney, who led the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, predicted there would be no let up for several years. \u201cOne of the things that governments in the UK and Canada elsewhere have to get used to now is that they are going to be paying higher rates of interest for their debt for the foreseeable future. \u201cNot just measured in 12 months, 24 months, but actually, the big tectonic shifts in the global economy mean that we are likely to have higher longer-term interest rates for a period.\u201d On Thursday morning, the money markets were predicting interest rates could be near 5.75% by the end of this year. However, Laith Khalaf, the head of investment analysis at the platform AJ Bell, said \u201ca few hawkish comments from the Bank of England, or some more ugly inflation data, could easily tip those expectations up to 6%\u201d. Money market movements were \u201cundoubtedly bad news for anyone taking out a mortgage at the moment\u201d, Khalaf said, but last September\u2019s widespread market panic after a disastrous mini-budget under the then prime minister, Liz Truss, \u201chasn\u2019t set in. Not yet, in any case.\u201d Thursday\u2019s typical 5.92% rate for a new two-year fixed home loan means someone taking out such a deal now faces paying \u00a3936 more a year than someone who signed up to an equivalent deal at the start of May, when the figure was 5.26%, based on a \u00a3200,000 mortgage. The extra payment soars to almost \u00a34,000 a year when compared with someone who took out a typical two-year fix priced at just over 3% in May last year."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6f0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/rufus-norris-national-theatre-stepping-down", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rufus Norris has made the National Theatre more diverse \u2013 on both sides of the curtain | Michael Billington", "lead": "The director, who has announced he is stepping down, should be credited for opening up the organisation and steering it through the Covid crisis.

Rufus Norris, who has announced he will be stepping down in 2025, was no exception. His dream was of a theatre that, in its repertoire and its audience, reflected our multicultural society and that embraced new writing. In that sense his mission has been successfully accomplished. The only question is whether, in the process, the classical canon has been neglected. Early in his tenure I confronted Norris with the issue and suggested we were being starved of the great classics. He replied that not only was new work his prime concern but also he wanted to achieve gender parity in the National repertoire: something that was impossible if you relied heavily on a male-dominated classical past. We should credit him with opening up the institution to genuinely diverse audiences: I have never forgotten the thrill of sitting at shows such as Small Island, \u201cMaster Harold\u201d \u2026 and the Boys and Inua Ellams\u2019s Nigerian-set version of Three Sisters. Norris also did something else important. I remember the late Anthony Howard, asked for an instant assessment of Harold Wilson\u2019s achievement when he resigned as prime minister, said: \u201cHe kept the show on the road.\u201d The same might be said of Norris. He inherited many good things from his predecessor, Nicholas Hytner, such as the NT Live broadcasts. He also ensured that the National has played during his tenure to 88% capacity. But Norris, like everyone else, had to cope with the Covid crisis and he made sure the organisation kept ticking over, through raids on the archive for streaming, as well as a radical new Romeo and Juliet film, staged without an audience but with a wealth of inventive camerawork. Norris steered the institution through a major crisis, launched a number of innovations such as NT Collections, making world-class theatre available to schools, and promoted a green agenda. He also directed a number of good productions, including Small Island, Carol Ann Duffy\u2019s Everyman and Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s Mosquitoes. Whenever I met him in recent years, however, he was either embarking on or returning from fundraising missions abroad, and I began to wonder whether any director of the National Theatre should have to spend so much energy acting as a salesperson. The big question is who will succeed Norris in 2025. London, for the past week, has been abuzz with rumours that Indhu Rubasingham, who has worked many times at the National and who recently resigned as director of the Kiln theatre, is a favoured successor. I would also guess that the hat of Josie Rourke, who successfully ran the Donmar and who has lately directed Dancing at Lughnasa in the Olivier, will be in the ring. If he is interested I imagine that Rupert Goold, who has made the Almeida London\u2019s most consistently exciting theatre, would be a contender. But, whoever takes over, Norris has ensured one thing: that the National cannot ever go back to being an exclusively white enclave on either side of the footlights. Top five shows during Norris\u2019s tenure 1. Small Island (2019) A dazzling version of the Andrea Levy novel capturing the trials, as well as the tenacity, of the Windrush generation leaving Jamaica for surly, sodden Britain. 2. The Lehman Trilogy (2018) Epic account, played by just three actors and directed by Sam Mendes, of the rise and fall of an immigrant family who become a symbol of western capitalism. 3. Death of England (2020) Roy Williams and Clint Dyer addressed issues of class, race, family and nationhood in a one-man play blisteringly performed by Rafe Spall. 4. The Flick (2016) Annie Baker\u2019s amazing play was nominally about changes in cinema technology but really about the lost souls in a Massachusetts movie house. 5. Barber Shop Chronicles (2017) Inua Ellams\u2019s play exhilaratingly crossed time zones and countries to explore the arguments and anecdotes of African barber shop culture."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6f1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/15/stolen-body-parts-harvard-medical-school", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Four indicted over \u2018appalling\u2019 theft of body parts from Harvard Medical School", "lead": "Morgue manager Cedric Lodge and his wife Denise allegedly took \u2018heads, brains, skin, bones and other human remains\u2019", "author": "Edward Helmore in New York and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:11:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.114975", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a07344f78fcd2fbd700517d958446578e66c0ecd/0_200_6000_3602/500.jpg", "body": "The manager of the morgue at Harvard Medical School and three other people were indicted for allegedly selling human body parts stolen from the school and a morgue in Arkansas, according to a federal complaint. Cedric Lodge, 55, formerly manager of the morgue for the Anatomical Gifts Program at Harvard Medical School, in Boston, is alleged to have stolen organs and other parts of cadavers between 2018 and 2022, and with his wife, Denise Lodge, 63, to have sold the remains online. Lodge, the government contends, stole \u201cheads, brains, skin, bones and other human remains \u2026 and removed those remains from the morgue in Massachusetts and transported them to his residence in New Hampshire\u201d. Lodge is alleged to have allowed two others named in the indictment, Katrina Maclean, 44, owner of Kat\u2019s Creepy Creations, a store in Peabody, Massachusetts, and Joshua Taylor, 46, to enter the morgue and choose what to take. In one instance, prosecutors said, Maclean \u201cagreed to purchase two dissected faces for $600\u201d. Investigators also say Maclean shipped human skin to another defendant in Pennsylvania and \u201cengaged his services to tan the skin to create leather\u201d. Taylor allegedly sent more than $37,000 to Denise Lodge for body parts stolen by her husband. In one transfer in November 2020, Taylor sent $200 with a memo that read: \u201cbraiiiiiins\u201d. The defendants are alleged to have coordinated by cellphone and social media, and sometimes to have \u201cshipped remains through the United States Postal Service\u201d. Gerard Karam, US attorney for Pennsylvania, said: \u201cSome crimes defy understanding.\u201d Karam added: \u201cThe theft and trafficking of human remains strikes at the very essence of what makes us human. \u201cIt is particularly egregious that so many of the victims here volunteered to allow their remains to be used to educate medical professionals and advance the interests of science and healing. For them and their families to be taken advantage of in the name of profit is appalling. With these charges, we are seeking to secure some measure of justice for all these victims.\u201d In a statement titled \u201cAn abhorrent betrayal\u201d, the Harvard medical school deans George Daley and Edward Hundert called the alleged actions \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d. \u201cWe are appalled to learn that something so disturbing could happen on our campus \u2013 a community dedicated to healing and serving others,\u201d the deans said. Harvard said it was working with authorities to figure out which donors may have been affected and has set up a webpage for donor families in light of the news. The maximum sentence on the charges concerned is 15 years in prison. Denise and Cedric Lodge both made initial court appearances on Wednesday in federal court in Concord, New Hampshire, and were each released on personal recognisance bail. They declined comment as they left the courthouse.

On Thursday morning, he tweeted: \u201cMy dad taught me that you get to choose your battles, and I am choosing the biggest one of my life. I\u2019m running for president.\u201d The tweet was accompanied by a video of Suarez out for a run. Ahead of a speech at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California, the Cuban American mayor, 45, also spoke to ABC News. \u201cI think I have a different message,\u201d he said, claiming to have \u201cimplemented generational change\u201d, touting his experience leading a major city and winning election and re-election by large margins. Suarez will be an outsider in a crowded field dominated by two other Florida men: Donald Trump, the twice indicted former president, and Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor. Trump leads most polling averages by more than 30 points. The former vice-president Mike Pence leads the rest of the pack, way back. Asked what he thought of Trump\u2019s indictment in Miami this week on 37 federal charges relating to his handling of classified materials, Suarez tried to dodge the question, saying the city had avoided \u201canarchy\u201d around Trump\u2019s court appearance. Pressed, Suarez said Republicans thought there \u201cisn\u2019t an equal administration of justice\u201d. Quizzed again to say what he thought of Trump\u2019s behaviour, Suarez said he would have turned over documents, as Trump refused to do, but also tried to link the case to an investigation of documents retained by Joe Biden. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on these kinds of matters,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cBut I do want to say this, that this conversation is not a healthy conversation. We should be talking about the issues the Americans care about.\u201d Suarez insisted he was not running against Trump, but \u201cagainst Joe Biden\u2019s America\u201d. The New York Times noted an ad buy in early voting states charging Biden with failing to control crime. The paper also referenced an FBI investigation that could damage Suarez\u2019s run. \u201cMr Suarez is little known outside his state, and he is facing emerging allegations of influence-peddling on behalf of a real estate development company,\u201d the Times said. The editorial board of the Miami Herald said \u201c$10,000 monthly payments [Suarez] received from a developer for consulting work \u2013 while serving as mayor\u201d, while \u201csmall potatoes compared to Trump\u2019s legal problems \u2026 look like a conflict of interest\u201d. The board also asked: \u201cIs being president really Suarez\u2019s goal?\u201d In two terms, the paper said, the mayor had \u201cturned himself into a tech-bro hero, cryptocurrency cheerleader and conservative cable news staple. \u201cHe likes the glitz and star power that come with running a city that\u2019s transforming into a technology and financial hub. That attention seems to have convinced him he can run for president.\u201d The Herald also noted Suarez\u2019s history of departing from Republican orthodoxy \u2013 he voted against Trump twice \u2013 and his ability to represent the Hispanics Republicans need to attract. Suarez told ABC he would pledge to support Trump if he won the nomination, adding: \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate who\u2019s Hispanic in both parties. I think that\u2019s incredibly important because 20% of the country is made up of Hispanics that are trending Republican.\u201d Citing the case of Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020, showed strongly and is now US transportation secretary, the Herald said Suarez might really be aiming to win a cabinet post. The paper said: \u201cSuarez will have to define himself on the national stage and show Republican voters \u2013 many already smitten with Trump or, to a lesser degree, DeSantis \u2013 who he really is. Is he the hip moderate or the rightwing Biden baiter? \u201cIf Suarez truly is seeking the biggest political prize in the free world, he\u2019ll first have to make a powerful case that he\u2019s the better choice for the nomination. That said, he might end up with a really neat consolation prize.\u201d Suarez was elected mayor in 2017 with 86% of the vote, and re-elected four years later with a still healthy 78%. With his city at ground zero of the climate emergency, he has broken with many Republicans\u2019 views and considers rising seas and global temperatures \u201ca real crisis\u201d facing the planet. He has championed the Miami Forever bond, investing $400m of taxpayers\u2019 money in projects to counter sea level rise and other consequences of the climate crisis, including increasingly prevalent flooding. The whiff of scandal, however, is likely to cling as primary season approaches. On Wednesday, the Republican US congressman Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a former mayor of Miami-Dade county, said Suarez \u201chad a snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d of winning. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any business running for president. He has never established himself as having the capacity to run anything in his life,\u201d Gim\u00e9nez told the Miami New Times.

Mr Justice Spencer appeared to be choked with emotion when addressing the mother of the murdered teenager, Tomasz Oleszak, 14, a \u201cbeautiful boy\u201d who was killed by the knife fanatic Leighton Amies in a Gateshead park in October. In passing a life sentence at Newcastle crown court, with a 12-year minimum term, the judge said Amies \u201crelished\u201d having a knife that night, which he had taken from his kitchen at home. When he shouted \u201cI\u2019ve wetted your boy\u201d at a group of teenagers after he had stabbed Tomasz, the judge said this was done \u201ctriumphantly\u201d. An emotional witness statement from Tomasz\u2019s mother, Kamila Wisniewska, was read out in court.

She said he was popular, respectful and hated violence. The judge paid tribute to Tomasz as he addressed his teenage killer in the dock: \u201cThis was the beautiful, exceptional, gifted boy whose life you, Leighton, brought to an end.\u201d Amies, then just 14, stabbed Tomasz deep in his chest after he was followed by a group of boys. The judge accepted Amies was not the instigator of the incident, but added Tomasz was blameless, and said the group who had followed Amies must live with the knowledge their \u201cstupidity\u201d led to his death. \u201cHowever, the principal responsibility lies with you in taking the knife with you,\u201d the judge told Amies. After Amies was found guilty in April, the judge lifted a ban on the media identifying the defendant owing to the seriousness of the crime and as a deterrent to teenagers carrying knives. It has now been revealed that Amies was excluded from his primary school for threatening to stab a teacher, and from secondary school for arson when he set fire to a plastic window. He had an interest in knives, as demonstrated by images police found after his arrest, the court heard. Amies had made educational progress since he had been held in secure accommodation, and his reading age had increased from 10 to more than 13 years old, the judge said.

Since the International Organization for Migration (IoM) launched its missing migrants project in 2014, an estimated 27,000 people trying to reach Europe have been recorded as dead or disappeared while trying to cross the Mediterranean. More than 21,000 of those deaths have occurred on the so-called central Mediterranean route from Libya or Tunisia north to Greece or Italy, a crossing that can take several days and is often made in unseaworthy, dangerously overloaded boats. Most migrants to Greece now cross from Turkey, either reaching the eastern Greek islands by boat or crossing the Evros River along the land border \u2013 and their number has fallen sharply since Athens stepped up sea patrols and built a border fence. Because the trek up to western or northern Europe from Greece also involves an often arduous crossing of the Balkans, many migrants now seek to bypass Greece. Instead, the vast majority now head for Italy, which has recorded 55,160 \u201cirregular\u201d arrivals in Europe so far this year \u2013 more than double the number in 2022 \u2013 mostly from Ivory Coast, Egypt, Guinea, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The central Mediterranean route is, meanwhile, becoming deadlier. According to an IoM report in April, at least 441 people drowned making the crossing between January and March this year, the deadliest three-month period since 2017. A further 600 who attempted the crossing in April and May are known to be dead or missing, bringing the total this year to at least 1,039 before Wednesday\u2019s deaths. The real figure, given that many sinkings are never recorded, is believed to be far higher. The IoM has pointed the finger \u2013 although without naming names \u2013 at some Mediterranean governments, where state-led search and rescue (SAR) operations have been delayed and NGO-operated vessels obstructed. Italy has imposed severe restrictions and even impounded humanitarian vessels, while Greece faces multiple allegations that it pushes people back to Turkey, illegally preventing them from claiming asylum, something Athens has consistently denied. Overall, the number of people trying to reach Europe remains well down on its 2015-2016 peak, thanks in part to a 2016 EU deal with Turkey and a much-criticised 2017 arrangement with Libya that in effect outsources rescues to the Libyan coastguard. But the number is climbing \u2013 and with anti-immigration sentiment and political pressure on the rise across the continent, the question remains one of the EU\u2019s biggest problems, with member states profoundly divided. Southern \u201cfrontline\u201d states have long borne the brunt; wealthier northern \u201cdestination\u201d states are often reluctant to share the burden; and hardline central and eastern ones (such as Hungary and Poland) have refused to accept any such refugees at all. After years of bickering, EU leaders last week announced a breakthrough in negotiations for a new migration and asylum pact, including charges of \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,200) a head for member countries that refuse to host refugees. The bloc agreed that member states, rather than the EU as a whole, would determine which countries were considered \u201csafe\u201d for migrants turned away because they were ineligible for asylum, giving member states greater individual flexibility. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has also said the bloc was considering providing more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3850m) in aid for Tunisia to rescue state finances and help deal with its migration crisis. Many critics, however, argue that little genuine progress has been made on creating safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to Europe, with too much recent emphasis on restricting asylum applications and criminalising SAR activities. \u201cEvery lost life is a tragedy,\u201d Maria Clara Martin, UNHCR\u2019s representative in Greece, said on Thursday. \u201cThese deaths could have been avoided by creating more safe means of entry for people forced to flee conflicts and persecution.\u201d Gianluca Rocco, the IoM\u2019s head of mission in Greece, said it was \u201curgent to have concrete and coordinated action from states to save lives at sea, and to reduce dangerous journeys by increasing safe and regular migration routes\u201d. The underlying causes pushing so many to come to Europe \u2013 war, natural disasters, the climate crisis, poverty, inequality and food insecurity \u2013 will not be going away anytime soon."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6f5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/16/ten-controversial-gas-tenements-in-queenslands-channel-country-surrendered-by-origin-energy", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Origin Energy surrenders 10 controversial gas tenements in Queensland\u2019s channel country", "lead": "Company gives up 10 of its 11 leases in the area amid concern about potential impacts of fracking", "author": "Ben Smee", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.115048", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/77d8ae4da931d50787292f8f3be3eaa33f9cc146/0_70_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "Australia\u2019s largest energy company has surrendered 10 controversial gas tenements in Queensland\u2019s channel country, as the state government embarks on long-delayed consultation over environmental protections for the sensitive Lake Eyre-Kati Thanda basin.

The potential for fracking to occur near area\u2019s wild rivers, which snake towards Lake Eyre-Kati Thanda after periods of inland rainfall, has been the subject of longstanding tension between Queensland\u2019s environmental and resources authorities. In 2020, Guardian Australia revealed that an independent scientific panel had recommended a ban on fracking in the area but the report had been made secret and ultimately ignored. The following year, environmental groups revealed the Queensland government had quietly approved applications from Origin that could lead to the extraction of fossil fuels across 225,000 hectares of the channel country. The long-stalled push for environmental safeguards has frustrated many locals, including agricultural groups. Earlier this month, the government announced it would release draft protection options for consultation. The announcement came less than a week after Origin finalised the handback of its leases on 26 May. The company had said last year it was reviewing its position in the area, but it was speculated at the time that it might look to sell the leases. The state government said it would not release the areas again \u201cduring the 12-week consultation period\u201d. \u201cThe department will continue to work with Origin Energy on the last remaining lease,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAs no on-ground works had been undertaken by Origin Energy in those areas, no remediation works were required. \u201cThe Queensland government is committed to ensuring the protection of the Lake Eyre Basin\u2019s streams and watercourses is balanced with economic development of the region.\u201d Nick Holliday, a grazier and spokesperson for the Lock the Gate Alliance, said the group hoped the \u201cvictory is permanent\u201d and that the state declared a total ban on oil and gas development on the floodplains. \u201cMore than half a million hectares of channel country flood plains remain under petroleum tenements, owned by companies like Santos,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cOrigin didn\u2019t give up on these tenements out of charity \u2013 it did so because in a decarbonising world, fracking for fossil gas in a place as remote as far western Queensland makes less and less commercial sense.\u201d \u201cQueensland\u2019s unique desert river systems remain under threat until the Palaszczuk government formally bans oil and gas development on the floodplains.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6f6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/the-last-daughter-review-one-womans-tender-and-uplifting-search-for-the-truth", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Last Daughter review \u2013 one woman\u2019s tender and uplifting search for the truth", "lead": "Documentary follows stolen generations member Brenda Matthews\u2019 search for her white foster parents", "author": "Luke Buckmaster", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.115066", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b1304ab21c851bde715c2fcb1d47e238bfc1c469/294_0_3598_2160/500.jpg", "body": "The inherently fragmentary nature of memories is a difficult thing to visualise, but The Last Daughter\u2019s co-directors, Brenda Matthews and Nathaniel Schmidt, do a fine job of it in this tenderly crafted documentary. Imagery throughout the film is tuned to the testimony of Matthews, a Wiradjuri woman and member of the stolen generations who was removed from her biological family when she was very young. She was placed in the custody of white foster parents who raised her in a loving home for five years before being directed to return her to her Aboriginal family. This created, in the long run, a large gap in her understanding of her past. Matthews\u2019 first memories were of growing up in a white family but where did they go? Why did they leave her life? Adapted from Matthews\u2019 memoir of the same name, The Last Daughter is a very personal detective story, at times very sad but underscored with a rich humanitarianism that makes it spirited and uplifting. Endeavouring to bring together both sides of her narrative and her family \u2013 Aboriginal and white \u2013 the film joins a canon of productions (including documentaries such as Zach\u2019s Ceremony and dramas such as Mystery Road) that grapple with the difficulties of reconciling Indigenous cultures with a postcolonial society, with its Judeo-Christian foundations and genocidal past. Most productions about the stolen generations understandably and necessarily focus on the people removed from their homes. The Last Daughter also provides insight into the foster parents, who took on caring for a child with the noblest of intentions. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning We meet Matthews\u2019 white foster parents, Mac and Connie, who wanted to help children who \u201cneeded a home and weren\u2019t as fortunate as we were\u201d, as Connie puts it. Mac recalls what it felt like when a clearer picture emerged of the personal and societal implications of their fostering. \u201cWe thought we were the heroes,\u201d he tearfully recounts, \u201cbut we ended up being the villains \u2026 to deprive a mum of her child.\u201d For most of The Last Daughter, Matthews and her former foster parents are visually disconnected: they don\u2019t share the frame, which builds a desire to see them unified. Matthews\u2019 mother, Nana Brenda, who had all seven of her children taken away, understandably has mixed feelings about her daughter\u2019s desire to track them down and reconnect 40 years later. Her journey reveals many things, including that the reason authorities gave for Matthews being adopted out in the first place \u2013 that her father was an alcoholic \u2013 was a lie. The point is made, without the film needing to directly state it, that systematic and institutionalised racism is to blame for what happened, and that same system continues to oppress Indigenous people today. Early in the runtime the directors harness the symbolic potential of doors, which can be powerful in visual storytelling. Doors can represent passage from one world into another (The Wizard of Oz), or the act of escaping entrapment (the end of The Truman Show); in The Last Daughter, the opening of a door symbolises accessing or unlocking a distant memory. The film loops back to vision of a slightly ajar door, opening gradually as the camera inches ahead, two young girls in a light-filled room on the other side. Again this connects with Matthews\u2019 narration; in particular, her reflections on how she \u201calways had dreams of houses and doorways and hallways and hiding places\u201d. There\u2019s also the mystery of the person Matthews describes as her \u201clittle white sister\u201d, whose presence is carefully and sporadically visualised. She appears via vague, poetic glimpses that dance on the edges of the film, like a beautiful, benevolent spirit, sort of there and sort of not. The Last Daughter also uses more conventional documentary forms, including talking heads, observational footage and re-enactments. The latter are tastefully staged, with large portions of the frame blurred out \u2013 an obvious choice, perhaps, to depict subjects looking through the fog of their past, but certainly highly effective. They also visually express how our minds may forget the periphery details of long-ago events, we can vividly recall how we felt; the reason those moments are rooted in our psyches. There\u2019s lots to appreciate here, story and subject-wise, as well as texturally and aesthetically. The Last Daughter gracefully shows how old wounds can be healed and how distant memories can come back into colour and focus.

A week after a pall of wildfire smoke turned New York City\u2019s skies into a shade of apocalyptic orange, leaders in the US government and east coast states are wrestling with how to keep residents safe from the significant health risks. In California and elsewhere, there are plans offering advisories to wear masks above certain levels of pollution, trigger interventions to help vulnerable people such as the elderly, and issue warnings to the public to stay indoors on smoky days. The incomprehension over the worst ever day for toxic wildfire smoke in recent US history, which obliterated safe clean air thresholds and forced people to don masks outdoors, was summed up by Eric Adams, New York\u2019s mayor, who admitted that the city was not primed for the sort of event more usually seen in California. \u201cThere is no blueprint or playbook for these types of issues,\u201d Adams said, as Broadway shows shuttered, baseball games were called off and children were prevented from venturing to playgrounds. \u201cYou want to be as prepared as possible but there is no planning for an incident like this.\u201d Some have called for more fundamental reforms of bedrock clean air laws that were designed years before it was apparent that global heating is causing more frequent and larger wildfires, sending plumes of smoke dangerous to cardiovascular and respiratory health thousands of miles away. The smoke from wildfires in Canada that shrouded New York, Washington DC and other US cities eventually unfurled as far as Norway. Under standards first set in the 1970 Clean Air Act, wildfire smoke is considered an \u201cexceptional event\u201d that doesn\u2019t count towards a state\u2019s attainment of national benchmarks for pollution set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The oil industry, as well as states, argued that wildfires were essentially random natural events outside the purview of clean air regulators. But with wildfires now threatening to erase much of the progress in cleaning up the US\u2019s air from toxins expelled by cars and heavy industry \u2013 a study released this week found that the amount of land burned in California wildfires has increased fivefold since the 1970s, and it\u2019s predicted to jump by as much as 50% by 2050 \u2013 that approach is being called into question. Last year, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, a body that provides independent scientific advice to the EPA, wrote to the agency to argue that wildfires are \u201cnot natural\u201d, can be partly controlled and should be incorporated into allowable levels of particulate matter, or PM, the microscopic debris given off in smoke and other sources of combustion. \u201cGiven the potential for significant adverse health events, it may be time to reconsider the current approach to excluding the high PM exposures from wildfire events in design values,\u201d the panel wrote. Bob Perciasepe, a former acting administrator of the EPA, said it would be a \u201cgood idea\u201d for the agency to require plans from places such as New York to deal with wildfire smoke, potentially including the scaling down of other sources of pollution to offset bad smoke days, but that state regulators could only do so much to counter an extreme event like last week\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing anyone could do in New York to solve the problem of fires in another country \u2013 you can\u2019t fine a forest,\u201d Perciasepe said. \u201cIn places like California you can do more, like manage the power lines that often cause these big fires. States out east could declare a public health state of emergency and remove trucks from the road, but they\u2019d have to balance whether this would have any measurable impact on the sort of event we saw,\u201d he added. \u201cLast week was just sort of overwhelming. Would the economic impact of shutting everything down outweigh any environmental benefit? That is what would have to be considered.\u201d Wildfire smoke is made up of a cocktail of irritants, including gaseous pollutants like carbon monoxide and hazardous air pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Most concerning, it can include pollution particles known as fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which are so minuscule they can enter the bloodstream when breathed in. The smoke can create an array of health problems, including shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing and eye irritation, especially for at-risk groups. Air quality regulators from US east coast states have been badgering their counterparts on the west coast for advice on how to craft better responses to wildfire smoke days since last week, according to Miles Keogh, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. Keogh said that he was dismayed to see people walking around Washington DC without a mask during the smoke emergency\u2019s peak there and said cities and states needed to do more to ensure the public wasn\u2019t just getting its information \u201cfrom people on TikTok\u201d about what do during such extreme situations. \u201cEverywhere should have a response plan now. We needed to have one before this. This isn\u2019t a new normal \u2013 it\u2019s a new abnormal, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaces without wildfires will need to communicate with those in the west and start taking their ideas. These sort of wildfire smoke events are orders of magnitude worse than the usual pollution levels.\u201d While there appears to be little prospect of amending clean air laws to more closely include wildfire smoke, or much hope of stemming its growing impact as the world heats up, environmentalists argue that the EPA could still do more to reduce other sources of air pollution. In January, the agency proposed tightening the air quality standards for PM2.5. Green groups have complained that the new standard doesn\u2019t go far enough to reduce harm to communities and should be strengthened further in light of the growing threat of wildfire smoke. \u201cWith climate change now driving down our air quality, it makes it all the more important for the EPA to set stringent health standards for particulate pollution,\u201d said Matthew Davis, vice-president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cIf you\u2019re exposed to spikes in wildfire smoke, it\u2019s important that the day-to-day exposures are lower to start with. This really is a wake-up call for people across the east coast that this isn\u2019t a west coast thing any more \u2013 anyone at any time can be hit by what we saw last week.\u201d A spokesperson for the EPA said the agency was \u201ccommitted to protecting public health when wildfire events occur and communities are faced with the adverse impacts of smoke\u201d and is working to provide better real-time monitoring and warnings when conditions worsen."}, {"_id": "648c584d51ac33b515b4a6f8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/16/i-look-forward-to-hearing-from-you-by-nick-bhasin-review-madcap-hollywood-satire", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I Look Forward to Hearing from You by Nick Bhasin review \u2013 madcap Hollywood satire", "lead": "While it has moments of brilliance and a Clickhole-esque wit, this debut novel is more often swallowed by its own snark", "author": "Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:40:45.115101", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4258a34b516e26368d85948987243029ceb60154/0_0_2500_1500/500.jpg", "body": "The year is 2002 and Hector Singh, an aspiring screenwriter in his late 20s, has moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dreams. He is mixed Indian and Puerto Rican, though he considers himself post-race \u2013 after all, it\u2019s a meritocracy, isn\u2019t it? Hector has written his own scripts but gets put to work as a writers\u2019 assistant on a bland TV drama, Coming Holm, about a white woman trying to get her life back together by running for mayor in her washed-up home town. He is also dealing with his mother\u2019s sudden death but he pushes the grief aside to not only survive but thrive in Hollywood. Sydney-based US expat Nick Bhasin\u2019s ambitious debut novel, I Look Forward to Hearing from You, is a madcap satire of the screen industry and the very act of writing, from inflated egos to the messy politics of the workplace. It\u2019s a distinctive and daring piece of work but, while it has moments of pathos and brilliance, the novel more often is swallowed by its own snark. Each chapter begins with a fake quote from a celebrity or notable writer: \u201cThe life of a writer is pure torture,\u201d from the pen of Judy Blume. Or \u201cWhat is success? Is it fame? Is it wealth? Yes.\u201d from Clint Eastwood. These pithy snippets recall the #TheySaidWHAT series on Clickhole \u2013 in fact it all feels very now, including conversations about diversity, body positivity and appropriation, which makes the fact it is set in the early-aughts seem unconvincing. Celebrity and pop culture are mercilessly skewered, sometimes in wickedly funny ways: Eminem sings a song for a film called Hip Hop Hobo; Angelina Jolie stars in I, Refugee. Bhasin \u2013 who has worked in film and TV production in the US \u2013 has concocted perhaps hundreds of fake films, TV shows and loglines, often taking aim at the shallowness of the industry. (Speaking about a show called My One Black Friend, a character muses, \u201cBlack people really don\u2019t like My One Black Friend. White people? They love it.\u201d) He clearly has a deep knowledge and begrudging love for pop culture, but the effect of this unyielding avalanche of satirical references is that their impact gradually dulls, and it eventually becomes more grating than humorous. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Bhasin\u2019s brand of satire recalls another Australian debut, Siang Lu\u2019s excellent 2022 novel The Whitewash, which took the form of an oral history about the rise and fall of a fictional Asian-led film in Hollywood. Both novels blend fact and fiction to create hyperreal parallel universes that reveal the industry\u2019s complicity in perpetuating white supremacy. But Bhasin takes that surrealism to another level. Hector\u2019s reliance on antidepressants blurs the lines between reality and his increasingly manic imagination, exacerbated by an absurd coyote infestation in the city and his imaginary primate friend \u2013 a literal monkey on his back. The protagonist\u2019s professional and interpersonal relationships become more unhinged as the narrative unfolds and he unravels. When Bhasin does bring in actual reality, it is to illustrate what is probably already obvious to the reader. Reflections about real-life actors such as Raquel Welch and Rita Hayworth, who anglicised their names to make it in Hollywood, drive Hector to slowly accept that being post-race isn\u2019t possible in a world where race very much still dictates people\u2019s lives and opportunities. His experiences in the workplace, where he is subject to constant racism, eventually wear him down. One of Hector\u2019s maladaptive coping mechanisms is binge eating, which couples with intrusive thoughts. He is faced by two opposing groups \u2013 Fat Acceptance and Fat Panic \u2013 rallying for body liberation and espousing fatphobic beliefs, respectively. These two sides represent the character\u2019s battle with internalised fatphobia (Bhasin has written in the past about his own struggles with body image) but it\u2019s the latter that win out most often in this novel, as Hector expresses constant revulsion at what he perceives to be the grotesqueness of his body \u2013 which is really just described as being large. While it provides an honest window into the character\u2019s self-loathing, and his perception of weight gain as a personal moral failing, Bhasin\u2019s relentless negative physical descriptions do begin to feel gratuitous. Hector refers to himself as a \u201chippo\u201d; looking in the mirror at his fat moving, he reflects that it\u2019s \u201cone of the most hideous things I had ever seen in my life\u201d. At another point, he thinks, \u201cI\u2019d rather have had fucking hands for feet and feet for hands than jiggly titties.\u201d Similar to the onslaught of jokey references, more restraint would have communicated the character\u2019s struggle just as effectively, without veering into potentially harmful or triggering territory. Scenes detailing Hector\u2019s grief are the novel\u2019s strongest points \u2013 a moment in which he discovers his mother\u2019s secret ambitions and love for film is profoundly moving, revealing a side of her he had never known or had access to, due to the expectations of immigrant mothers to put their dreams aside. Hector dials his dead mother\u2019s number just to hear her voicemail. In these moments, the character\u2019s deep sorrow is fully rendered and he becomes much more real and sympathetic; Bhasin\u2019s narrative voice softens enough to let the reader into the true heart of the story, which stands in contrast to the acidic tone of the rest of the book. While the latter illustrates the self-defensive mechanisms necessary to survive as a minority in the cut-throat film world, a greater balance in tone would have made for a more satisfying arc. Hector is a strange and unreliable narrator but, when Bhasin lets the character\u2019s emotional walls down, there\u2019s a fragile, beautiful sense of humanity underneath. More often, though, the satire and self-defence is laid on so thick that it\u2019s almost suffocating. Welcome to Hollywood.

I want a designated time and place for relaxation. I want to declare my independence at check-in and be carried away slowly on a conveyer belt, draped in a sarong. I would like to be pampered to death on a luxury cruise like David Foster Wallace in his story A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again. I\u2019m tired enough that the existential despair would be lost on me. Five to seven days of fresh towels and organised fun sounds like paradise. My last proper holiday with my partner, Sam, was in 2015, pre-kids. We bicycled through Mexico City and ate pig\u2019s head soup at tiny stalls on street corners. We stayed in a hotel where you could smoke in the elevator and the pool had a 10-metre unsupervised diving board. We finished the trip in a hut on the cliffs of Mazunte, where we slept for eight days in bed, on beaches and in hammocks; waking for mid-morning micheladas and huevos rancheros. In the evenings we would descend the cliff face to the sleepy town, where we ate Argentinian barbecue from an outdoor kitchen crowded with stray dogs, watching the sun set. We slept like we had never slept before or have since; deep and long to the sound of the Pacific Ocean. There were no kids clubs or chicken nuggets or inflatable pool toys. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back with our kids if or when have them,\u201d we said dreamily on the sand, watching a small child carrying a squid out of the sea. \u201cWe\u2019ll be adventurous parents. If we stay for a few months or more we\u2019ll get a great deal on accommodation. Our kids will speak Spanish! And we\u2019ll pick it up, eventually.\u201d We had our first child in 2016 and our second a year later. We shared our plans to go to Mexico loudly in the beginning. We loved the way the words sounded to our friends who didn\u2019t have kids. The way it affirmed everybody\u2019s secret hopes that becoming parents didn\u2019t really need to change your life all that much. Over the months, as the toddler-baby reckoning consumed our souls, going away for fun became a twisted paradox. Beach bags became stuffed with nappies and wipes and bottles and fruit goo and eczema salves that I\u2019d spend half the time Googling, breathing shallowly at the thought of my baby\u2019s possibly \u201cthinning\u201d skin. We were still going to Mexico but only to prove a point. We were adventurous parents. The children were two and three at the time. We planned the trip with pits in our stomachs, like horses being walked into a bullring. By the time Covid arrived, I had been home in a dressing gown for four straight years. I was quietly relieved when international travel was banned. It meant we could cancel our Mexico plans and never speak of them again. The kids are school-age now. They can brush their teeth and put on shoes. They can entertain each other. The screams from the bath are often screams of joy. We\u2019re ready for a holiday. But now I have nothing to prove. My sense of pride has been conveniently obliterated. I want a resort with chicken nuggets and the option to join a conga line around the pool. I called a travel agent and shared my desire for the getaway equivalent of a partial lobotomy. Suzette suggested eight days in an all-inclusive international resort franchise with trapeze lessons for the kids. It sounded perfect. Then she said it would cost $11,936. \u201cSorry?\u201d I said. \u201cIncluding flights!\u201d Suzette said. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2013 I made porridge for lunch today.\u201d \u201cI see \u2026 Would you consider a cruise?\u201d \u201cA cruise?\u201d \u201cYes. You could go on an all-inclusive cruise for closer to $3,000,\u201d she said, \u201cPlus flights to and from Sydney.\u201d \u201cA luxury cruise? Like in the first bit of Triangle of Sadness?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d There\u2019s a reason international mega-cruises are popular with old people and parents with young children: we\u2019re budget-conscious and very, very tired. The online reviews of Suzette\u2019s suggested cruise weren\u2019t great. They listed cold showers and stubborn sewage smells and swimming pools akin to human soup. There\u2019s also the cruise industry\u2019s grave environmental impact to consider. If the surviving marine life could talk the reviews would be more scathing still. At this stage we\u2019re considering a week at home with margaritas and unlimited heater time.
