The MoneySavingExpert.com founder told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that he had previously highlighted a \u201cmortgage ticking time bomb\u201d. He continued: \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that time bomb is now exploding.\u201d Lewis was speaking around the time that Moneyfacts reported that the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage now cost 6.07%, the highest since November. Mr Lewis said that if interest rates are going to be high over three or four years, people are going to have to readjust their finances. He said he could not see a mortgage rescue package being brought in, as the whole point of higher interest rates is to leave people with less disposable income. Lewis also criticised the UK banks for not making it easier for struggling borrowers to take payment holidays, temporarily reduce the amount they pay in, or to switch to interest-only loans. Lewis said he gave his views during a mortgage summit held by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt last year, explaining today: \u201cAnd what I was suggesting in that meeting is, first of all those things need to be made reversible, so you know that if you can do it temporarily you can go back without a problem. That isn\u2019t the situation. \u201cAnd second, they need to look at minimising the impact on people\u2019s credit scores, because that puts people off taking a form of action, it scares them that they\u2019re going to be disenfranchising themselves from other forms of borrowing for six years, but again, that hasn\u2019t happened. \u201cSo the ultimate result of that mortgage summit was a tiny bit more communication to borrowers.\u201d Investors have been racing to add to bets on higher UK interest rates over the past few weeks, almost fully pricing in a surge to the highest level in two decades. Bloomberg explains: Markets now are betting rates rise at least a quarter point on Thursday, to 5% by August and almost 6% by February. Rates at that level would send mortgage rates further into territory the BOE has identified as painful for households, with more than 1 million required to refinance loans at significantly costs this year. Not every analyst believes UK interest rates will rise as high as 6%. Mohit Kumar of investment bank Jefferies predicts rates will peak at 5%, half a percentage point higher than today. Kumar explains: Our view is driven by the impact of BoE hikes on the mortgage market and the housing sector, which would constrain the BoE. The view is also driven by the fact that we believe that monetary policy on its own would be ineffective in controlling inflation, unless accompanied by support from the fiscal policy. BoE hikes will have limited impact on inflation, hence in our view, there is a need of fiscal support. The cost of fixed-rate mortgages may continue to rise, unti the markets see signs that UK inflation is falling steadily. Nicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at broker John Charcol, explains: My worry is that things may well get worse before they get better, while we expect inflation figures [on Wednesday] to come down the anticipation will be they in line with market forecasts. If not, markets will be pricing in higher base rates over a longer period of time. We also have the MPC meeting on Thursday which will also play a part in market reaction following the governors\u2019 comments. Markets need stability and a positive outlook for the future, once we have this in our sights this is when we will see swaps reduce and start to see fixed rate pricing come down. Homeowners need to understand that sub 2% rates aren\u2019t the norm and should not be used as a benchmark of where rates will return to in the future. A mortgage is a long-term commitment which ultimately means you must take the rough with the smooth. Despite the cost of living crisis, demand for cruises for the older-50s is holding up well. Saga has reported that its load factor (which measures how full its cruise ships are) is already 79% for the current financial year, up from 72% at this time last year. Underlying profits is expected to be well ahead of the prior year, with Saga\u2019s River Cruise and Travel businesses on track to return to profitability. Euan Sutherland, Saga\u2019s CEO, says: \u201cFour months into the financial year, we have continued to build on the momentum in our Cruise and Travel operations, while making further progress in our growth agenda through the development of our newer businesses. Year-end underlying profit is expected to be well ahead of the prior year. \u201cWe have taken strong bookings for our ocean cruises with a load factor that is ahead of the same point in the prior year, and our River Cruise and Travel businesses are on track to return to profitability in line with previous guidance. Buy-to-let mortgage rates have also risen again. Moneyfacts reports: The average 2-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.40%. This is up from an average rate of 6.30% on the previous working day. The average 5-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.29%. This is up from an average rate of 6.23% on the previous working day. There are currently 2,525 buy-to-let mortgage products available. This is up from a total of 2,515 on the previous working day. Average two-year fixed mortgage rates in Britain have jumped to their highest since late November, as the turmoil in the mortgage market continues. Data provider Moneyfacts report that the average two-year fixed mortgage rate has risen to 6.07% this morning, up from 6.01% yesterday. At the start of May the average was 5.26%, but it has been rising steadily higher as financial markets have anticipated further rises in UK interest rates \u2013 possibly to 6%. The average cost of five-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 5.72% from 5.67%, which is the highest since early December. There are also fewer mortgages on the market, too. Moneyfacts reports there are 4,641 residential mortgage products available today, down from 4,683 on Monday. Investors are still repricing their expectations for the Bank of England base rate, after the very strong employment data last week [showing faster wage growth], reports Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank. Reid says: One particular milestone from yesterday was that for the first time since the mini-budget turmoil, overnight index swaps were pricing in a 6% [Bank of England] base rate as more likely than not by the close, and not just on an intraday basis. This positioning comes ahead of a pivotal few days for UK macro, since we\u2019ll get the May CPI [inflation] release first thing tomorrow, and then the Bank of England\u2019s latest policy decision on Thursday, where another 25bp hike is widely expected. The UK economy could fall into recession if the Bank of England lifts interest rates as high as some investors expect. New analysis from Bloomberg Economics show that Britain could tip into a shallow recession if the Bank of England pushes its benchmark lending rate to 6% Currently, the money markets indicates there\u2019s a slightly greater than evens chance that BoE base rate hits 6% by February 2024, up from 4.5% at present (with a rise to 4.665% expected on Thursday). Bloomberg has calculated that, if rates hit 6%, GDP would shrink by 1.4% in 2024. \u201cOur own view is that the pricing is probably overdone,\u201d Dan Hanson, an economist at BE, wrote in a note published Tuesday. Hanson adds: \u201cBut if this tightening cycle has taught us anything, it\u2019s not to underestimate the persistence of inflation. The BOE may judge a significant slump is what\u2019s needed to prevent the inflation psychology in the UK from becoming embedded.\u201d Because more people are on fixed-rate mortgages than a few decades ago, it will take longer for previous increases in interest rates to impact households Hanson writes: \u201cWith that in mind, we think there\u2019s a significant risk of a downturn later this year \u2014 even on our relatively dovish policy view. If rates were to climb to 6% the slump would be even deeper. In the financial markets, Britain\u2019s short-term borrowing costs have nudged up to a 15-year high. The yield (or interest rate) on UK two-year government bonds rose to 5.088% this morning, a day after hitting 5% for the first time since 2008. These two-year bonds are used to set mortgage prices, and are rising as the markets anticipate further increases in UK interest rates. The more vulnerable segments of society have been hit particularly hard by persistent inflation, points out Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. Total spending on UK supermarket\u2019s \u2018own label\u2019 value ranges has rocketed by 41% compared to last year, Kantar\u2019s monthly data shows. This means the value section of the market has been the fastest growing segment every month since June 2022. The proportion of products sold for \u00a31 in UK supermarkets, has almost halved in a year from 9% to 5%. That\u2019s a big shift, reports Kantar, who argue that the cost of living crisis is discouraging retailers from riced products at \u2018round-pound\u2019 points. They explain: Traditionally, \u2018round-pound\u2019 prices have been attractive to shoppers, who find them easier to relate to and practical as well with no leftover change. But, with retailers eager to offer value and cash buying less popular, \u00a31.25 has emerged as an increasingly important price point. It now vies with \u00a32 as the second most popular price for a grocery item. Aldi was the fastest growing UK retailer in the 12 weeks to 11 June, as cash-squeezed households flocked to discount suprermarkets. Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 24.6%, giving it a new record market share of 10.2% \u2013 up from 9% a year ago Lidl grew its sales by 23.2%, and now has 7.7% of the market. UK supermarkets hiked prices of some summer favourites last month, such as icecreams and BBQ food. Fraser McKevitt, Kantar\u2019s head of retail and consumer insight, says: The increased cost of staying cool will have come as a shock for many, with like for like prices on ice cream up 20% and mineral water up 17%. The barbecue spread has equally been hit. Fresh sausage prices have risen by 16% while fresh burgers increased by 13%, showing how grocery price inflation is continuing to hurt consumers at the till. Newsflash: Food price inflation across Great Britain has eased, but prices are stil rising at a painfully high pace. Annual grocery inflation dropped to 16.5% for the four weeks to June 11, analysts at Kantar have reported, the lowest level recorded in 2023. That\u2019s a fall from the 17.2% recorded a month ago, and below the record 17.5% recorded in March. But this still means supermarket prices are rising much faster than wages, or the wider measure of consumer price inflation (which was 8.7% in April \u2013 we get May\u2019s figure tomorrow). Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cThis is the lowest rate of grocery price inflation we\u2019ve seen in 2023, which will be a relief to shoppers and retailers. \u201cBut prices rising at 16.5% isn\u2019t something to celebrate and it\u2019s still the sixth highest monthly figure in the past 15 years. \u201cPrice rises are now being compared to the increasing rate of grocery inflation seen last summer, which means that it should continue to fall in the coming months, a welcome result for everyone.\u201d First-time buyers are being hit by a drought in mortgages, as lenders pull back from offering home loans for those with small deposits. The number of products for borrowers who need to borrow 95% of the value of their home has dropped by over 40% over the past year, the Financial Times reports. They explain: According to data provider Moneyfacts, there were 199 products on offer over the weekend for would-be buyers looking to borrow up to 95 per cent of the value of the property, down from 347 at the start of June 2022. The average interest rate on a two-year fixed 95 per cent loan-to-value mortgage jumped by more than 3 percentage points to 6.49 per cent over the same period, while for five-year products it rose more than 2 percentage points to 5.8 per cent. \u201cThe constant rate changes and ongoing market uncertainty is causing havoc,\u201d said Aaron Strutt, director at Trinity Financial. \u201cFirst-time buyers are struggling to access mortgages, especially if they have smaller deposits.\u201d A glimmer of good news \u2013 the input production costs of UK food and drink manufacturers have fallen for the first time since April 2016. This provides optimism that future food price inflation will ease, reports Lloyds Bank, athough they fear it will be \u201csome time\u201d before this feeds through \u201cif at all\u201d to on-the-shelf food prices. Food and drink producers benefited from a drop in commodity prices last month, with the prices of vegetable oils, cereals and dairy products falling on the global markets. The cost of shipping, and energy, both eased in May too, helping to reduce cost pressures. But, Lloyds Bank\u2019s UK Sector Tracker found that salary inflation is the \u2018stickiest\u2019 element pushing up prices. Annabel Finlay, managing director for Food, Drink and Leisure at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: \u201cThis drop breaks sustained rises in production costs for food and drink manufacturers, which have been among the sharpest of any sector monitored by the Tracker. \u201cIf production costs continue to fall, whilst welcome, it will still take some time before we see the benefit in terms of shelf prices. This is, in part, due to the long-term nature of contracts between the manufacturers and retailers, as well as the broader segments of the production chain. \u201cWith the continued risk of future disruption to supply chains that could mean input costs rising again, food and drink manufacturing companies should continue to review their supply relationships and optimise their working capital to help shield against any market shocks and build ongoing resilience.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze is rocking the property sector, driving up cost for tenants and mortgage-owners alike. With rents rising faster than wages, the average UK tenant is now spending more than 28% of their pay before tax on rent, figures compiled by property portal Zoopla shows. That means people are spending more of their wages on rent than at any other time in the last 10 years. Average rents for new lets have also risen, Zoopla reports \u2013 jumping 10.4% in a year. With wages only growing by 5.7% during 2022, it has become harder for people to afford places. In April, rent in London was 13.5% higher than a year ago, in Scotland it was 13.1% higher, and the North West of England saw a 10.5% increase. Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, said there was signs of financial \u201cstress\u201d for tenants, particularly those on low incomes. Donnell adds: \u201cThe impact of higher rents is not uniform with those on low incomes bearing the brunt, with increasing signs of stress.\u201d Those looking to remortgage also face more stress, given the recent increases in borrowing costs. Yesterday, the cost of the average two-year fixed rate mortgage hit 6% for the first time since December, but the government is resisting calls to help struggling mortgage-payers. TSB has became the latest lender to pause sales of some of its mortgages, by removing some products at 4pm yesterday. Also coming up At 8am we discover if food price inflation eased in the last month, when market research group Kantar releases its latest assessment of the grocery market. Investors are digesting an overnight rate cut in China overnight. The People\u2019s Bank of China has cut its one-year and five-year loan prime rates 10 basis points each (0.1 percentage point), as Beijing tries to stimulate its economy.

I\u2019m reading that they will try and get the full quota (98 overs) in from the moment play commences. Are overs not deducted on a proportionate basis (as I believe has always been the case?) Some people were saying England upped the tempo yesterday to put overs back into the game, but if no overs are lost, that would render the tactic unnecessary.\u201d The good thing about playing cricket in England is that the sun sets late. So I see no reason why we won\u2019t get a decent amount. Now how many exactly remains a mystery. I\u2019d be astounded if we get 98 in. And yes, I think England\u2019s breezy batting (and even their first innings declaration) had something to do with the weather. Unless I\u2019m mistaken this rain is a little late. Thanks everyone for the messages. If you\u2019re bored of my natter can I recommend this outstanding piece from my mate, James Wallace: Cricket balls and Holocaust survivors. I promise you\u2019ve never read anything like it before: \u201cDaz, Dazza, Dazzy McDazface\u201d Those are more appropriate for a Darren, than a Daniel, but I\u2019m loving your energy Hugh Maguire. \u201cI\u2019m not going to offer anything other than frothing excitement for todays play. There\u2019s going to be plenty more whatiffery as the day pans out for both sides whatever the outcome. I\u2019m back with the OBO mistress Hope. Though I\u2019ve swiped right on Expectation. I think Hope knows and today may end up with both or neither.\u201d Little expectation here. Let me ask the group a question\u2026 How many overs do Australia need to knock these runs off? Good to get some Aussie correspondence. Here\u2019s Gervase Greene from Sydney\u2019s eastern \u2018burbs: \u201cAs to the \u2018whole Bazball thing\u2019, sorry to be so prosaic: surely they are playing that way because the previous approach didn\u2019t work? Which is why it\u2019s a brilliantly sensible strategy. Please leave out all the blather evoking slow-motion running across a windswept beach to a Vangelis soundtrack (anyone for unbranded merch?). England are all about winning, and this is a way of - just maybe - of getting close to that again. Which is fair enough.\u201d Right you are Gervase. They hit rock bottom playing a placid brand of cricket and they reverted to what served them so well in the white ball game. What\u2019s more, they have the batters to score at 4.5 an over. It\u2019s exciting and bold, but it also makes cricket sense. Should Australia be chasing a smaller target? If they do fall short (either with a loss or a draw) will they rue the firm wagging of England\u2019s tail? Geoff Lemon says so which means it must be true: I\u2019ve just been alphad by Ronald Glover: \u201cHi Dan, how about \u201cFourth Dan\u201d for you? After (Google tells me) the other Dans who write for the Guardian (Sabbagh, Boffey, and Harris). Powerful but sadly also unintentionally dismissive.\u201d \u201cHi Daniel. Really looking forward to this afternoon - surely no chance of an Aussie win now given the time and conditions?\u201d It\u2019s looking that way, Andrew Bennett. \u201cWatching the highlights of the back end of yesterday\u2019s action led to a very important question re the travelling Australian fans and their colour coordinated outfits. \u201c(a) There appears to be both a yellow and dark green option - what does each mean? Are they different fan clubs or supporter organisations? And (b) how do they organise themselves into very neat blocks of each colour in the stands? Doesn\u2019t seem to be any mixing of greens and yellows, but with random amounts of English/neutral/other fans in between each row?\u201d \u201cAll very important stuff, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree.\u201d Absolutely! These are deeply important questions and I have no answers. Chalk them down to life\u2019s mysteries. No play before 1.10pm BST / 10.10pm AEST. Sad news folks but we\u2019re going to have to keep the chat going for some time. Lunch will be taken at 12.30pm BST with no play til then. Forecast is better this afternoon but a draw now looming large. What does Nathan Lyon do in his hotel room? I\u2019m going to regret typing these next words, but now I really wish I knew. Always good to get a line from inside the room. Here\u2019s my colleague, Luke McLaughlin: \u201cI\u2019ve heard more than one pundit opine that if England win, all of Stokes\u2019s decisions during the match will be vindicated, and if Australia win, then the same becomes true of Cummings. Surely this is a vast oversimplification? \u201cAnyway, England\u2019s main lessons from this remarkable Test match must be: 1) Bazball shouldn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK to toss wickets away cheaply. 2) Foakes must play, Bairstow stays as a batsman. I do worry that the fact Bairstow is a lovely lad, and very popular within the team, means he gets too much leeway with his keeping.\u201d That\u2019s the nature of elite sport, innit? Pep Guardiola pointed out that he won the treble because a striker missed a header from three yards out. If that went in, would Pep be a fraud? No. But we deal in binary results. Makes for good chat though, doesn\u2019t it? I agree with your second point. If England lose I bet they\u2019ll be kicking themselves for a few soft dismissals. \u2018Dan-ster\u2019. I like it. Loads of chat about YJB and Foakes: Timothy Sanders from Leeds: \u201cI think Barney is right, that \u2018it would be progressive, not regressive, to bring Foakes into this team\u2019, in line with England\u2019s philosophy of how to play Test cricket. If it\u2019s about having fun, taking twenty wickets, and showing the paying public your very best skills, then surely the practical application of Bazball means picking your very best wicketkeeper? I say go with Foakes as the way for this team to live its values. Then they just have to decide on the best 5 from the 6 batters!\u201d Stephen Brown who has offered \u2018Big Dan\u2019 as a nickname: \u201cFor me, Foakes should be in the team. Having a very good wicket keeper vs a good wicket keeper can be worth having another batter who averages 40-50 in the team. And who wouldn\u2019t want to add that? So the question becomes, who do you leave out? Weirdly, I\u2019d say the person underperforming their playing role in the team the most over the last year might actually be Stokes. But we can\u2019t exactly drop him and let him captain from the touchlines. Which means the solution is probably to let Bairstow open. Ducket has more runs as an opener under Stokes than Crawly despite playing half the games, so he should probably be given the first shot of opening alongside Bairstow.\u201d Joe Roberts: \u201cIf it is true that Bairstow must be in the side due to last year\u2019s heroics, it is also true that Crawley has done very little to justify his place in this side, having contributed very little to the success over the last 12 months. Not to mention that Foakes has been a vital part of that success, not just with the gloves, but with the bat as well, and surely warrants the same treatment as Bairstow.\u201d Tom Nolan: \u201cCrawley out for Foakes with YJB opening? Won\u2018t happen after Crawley\u2018s first innings knock here but seems a logical way to get Foakes and Bairstow into the same side.\u201d Geoff Wignall with a another whacky idea: \u201cMy new solution would be someone with sound defensive technique yet capable of serious aggression who isn\u2019t scoring many in his current slot: one Ben Stokes.\u201d Foakes for Brook? To be honest, I hadn\u2019t considered that. But Richard O\u2019Hagan makes an intersting point that has got me thinking: \u201cI know that this will be controversial, but I think you have to choose between Bairstow and Brook. Brook came into the side as the replacement for the injured Bairstow and from a batting perspective they are probably on a par with one another, save that YJB is vastly more experienced. But at the same time the runs that England have conceded as a result of Bairstow\u2019s rustiness with the gloves could well be the difference between winning and losing this Test, as they pretty much negate his contribution with the bat. For my money Foakes has to play and one of those two has to stand down if England are to have any chance of winning this series.\u201d Let\u2019s not forget that Foakes is still a brilliant batter. Sure he doesn\u2019t have the firepower of Brook or Bairstow, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s a mug with the willow. And if Ali plays (finger blister permitting) they still have the punch in the lower order. Email gremlins fixed: I wasn\u2019t aware that the link to my email was broken. Should be sorted now. If you\u2019ve been trying to get in touch but haven\u2019t done so, please try again. This is a really, really long email from Simon in Cornwall. But with nothing going on, I\u2019ll share it in it\u2019s entirety with my two cents between each paragraph (yes, paragraph, strap in): \u201cI have a question about the reverse ramp. How does the batter decide that that is the shot they are going to play? It seems that they get into position for the shot so early that it can\u2019t be based on the trajectory of the ball - does the batter decide before the ball is bowled that they are going to play that shot, and just commit? I get that you wouldn\u2019t play it against an unpredictable spinner, and that you need some kind of predictability in the bowlers style - is there maybe some subtle thing in finger position or wrist action that makes the batter know it is a good shot selection? Or is it just hit and hope?\u201d It has to be premeditated. Bowlers like Boland who put it on the same spot over and over again are particularly susceptible to being ramped. A lot of hit and hope for sure. \u201cI\u2019d also like to say something about Bazball. I think something that hasn\u2019t been mentioned much is Ben Stokes\u2019 struggles with mental health, and the fact that it seems to me that Bazball is an attempt by Stokes to take the parts of the game that may cause a player to struggle, and just\u2026..remove them. Many elite sportspeople have suffered badly in this arena, and not just cricketers - see \u2018The Edge\u2019, about the 09-13 England team, but also Nick Kyrgios, Mark Selby, Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, and god knows how many others from years gone by.\u201d Oh, Bazball is therapy. Or so said Barney Ronay in this wonderful piece. \u201cThe reason I have so much respect for this style of play is that it seems to me that after taking brave decisions to protect his own wellbeing over the years, Stokes has developed a style that extends this protection to his whole team. Stokes has a greater understanding of his teammates, and of the nature of leadership and sporting ambition than any leader I can think of, and this goes far beyond \u2018finding a way to win\u2019. Stokes has taken bold, innovative steps to protect, nurture and develop the whole person, not just their skills and sporting qualities, knowing full well that, coincidentally, this is how you get the best out of them.\u201d Bold, innovative, daring, carefree. That\u2019s why it' has captured so many people, win or lose. \u201cIts interesting that the list of athletes I mention who have publicly struggled with their mental health are all proponents of individual sports (tennis, snooker, gymnastics, swimming), and this is the first example I know of where the thinking has been extended to a team sport. I see Gareth Southgate doing something similar, but in a gentler and less bold way, and the results there are fairly clear too. As someone who has had some pretty loopy mental health over the years, I can not tell you how much I respect what Stokes (and BmcC) is doing.\u201d Mate, thank you for opening up. I reckon a lot of people reading this right now will relate. \u201cThe way England are playing will ripple outwards and change the way test cricket is played, and more importantly how it is perceived that it SHOULD be played, maybe even save the format from a spiral of stagnation and diminishing gate receipts as everyone rushes to whizzier formats, leaving a trail of broken and forgotten players who gave their all but failed in some way that comes to define them forever. I adore the man, and in true Bazball style, wish with all my heart that he stays true to his new methods through the whole series, even if it means we lose every test. It feels more important than that, to me.\u201d Even football is hooked! \u201cI understand that this isn\u2019t how a lot of fans feel - the \u2018win at all costs\u2019 mentality is irresistible to a sports fan, even if that cost is the health and wellbeing of the very players they revere. Bazball reminds us all that athletes are people, and that people do their best work when they love what they are doing, are given freedom to express themselves and are respected for doing so. Bazball, to me, isn\u2019t just a cricketing ideology, it\u2019s not a cricketing tactic, and its certainly not the new-age, man-feeling, bro-vibes rubbish it can so easily be dismissed as. Its an affirmation of the humanity at the heart of cricket, of sport, and of competition, and I hope it lasts forever. Or at least til the end of the fifth test.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget that England were rubbish before Bazball. This is not simply the unshackling of players but also a cohesive strategy to get the best out of a talented group. It\u2019s daring and brave, but also calculated (even if it doesn\u2019t always seem that way). Thank you for a brilliant mail. I really enjoyed that. \u201cHi Dan. Looking forward to a cracking day\u2019s play!\u201d Me too, Damian Johnson, let\u2019s hope we get enough of it. \u201cRegards Bairstow/Foakes, YJB is allowed one bad game I would say, and horses for courses, Foakes stays in contention for tours in Asia or the driest of dry wickets. \u201cIf he were to come in, any of the top 3 should be under pressure and this includes Pope who never seems to be mentioned despite a highly mediocre record, especially against the big boys. Don\u2019t get me wrong, cracking looking batter but he never seems to be under any pressure - is this a Surrey thing!?\u201d Hmmm. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a Surrey thing. If that was the case then Foakes would be playing. Pope is class. No doubt about that. I saw him score a coming of age ton against South Africa in Gqeberha. He\u2019ll be alright in the long run. But you\u2019re right. A few more failures and some serious questions will need to be asked. YummyBear has become our official weather correspondent. And yup, all fingers, toes and limbs crossed. Oh man. I\u2019m watching the Sky feed and it looks really grim. I take back what I said earlier and I\u2019m now with Will Southworth. Will be incredible if they get out there in time to finish the game. How frustrating! But, if they do, one team in particular will fancy it. Oh dear\u2026 So advantage England. Especially as Warner is in the shed. But hey, Head can give it a whack too. How many overs do you reckon Australia will need to fancy having a go? I loved this piece by Barney from last night. And would love to know what you think about the Bairstow-Foakes debate. For my money, Young JB has to play. He\u2019s just so destructive with the bat. But there\u2019s no question Foakes is the outstanding keeper in the country. Does that mean Duckett drops out? But then who opens? Should Pope make way? Ludicrous! There are no easy answers in the epoch of Baz. Granted this was 20 minutes ago, but it\u2019s not looking great. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get plenty of cricket. We just won\u2019t start at 11. Has it only been four days? At the risk of heaping more hyperbole on top of a narrative oozing with the stuff, this has already been an almighty contest that has packed more action than most series. It began on a road and saw Joe Root unfurl a sumptuous century before the bucket-hatted Ben Stokes declared on the first day. Then Usman Khawaja batted and batted and batted until he was given a sweary send-off by Ollie Robinson. Did it cross the line? Have these lines ever existed? Are the Aussies now the meek ones in this ancient relationship? Root attempted a reverse scoop from the first ball of day three. Pat Cummins was outstanding. Nathan Lyon picked up a four-for. Moeen Ali\u2019s finger fell apart. Stuart Broad did Stuart Broad things and now, as we begin this final day of an epic battle, Australia need 174 runs and England need seven wickets. There are echoes of 2005 and the narrow two run win for England that helped ignite the greatest Ashes in living memory. If the past four days are anything to go by, we might have a contender to that particular title. My name is Daniel, but in this Bazball age you can call me Dan, Danny Boy or frankly any other whacky nickname you like (please don\u2019t make me regret that). There\u2019s rain about in Birmingham but all the journos on the ground reckon we\u2019ll have play after a slight delay. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re getting a result. Of that I\u2019m certain. If you fancy dropping a line please do. Email or Twitter. You know the drill. Strap in folks. This is going to be a good \u2019un."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331954", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/20/mel-stride-boris-johnson-partygate-report-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson: cabinet minister won\u2019t say if he thinks former PM returning to the Commons is unacceptable \u2013 UK politics live", "lead": "Work and pensions secretary Mel Stride urges Tories to move on from Partygate report after abstaining from vote", "author": "Andrew Sparrow", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 10:10:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.172851", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/afcc3b746e7a52f3ebaf249b373f17fc30492684/0_246_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Here are some of the main points from Oliver Letwin\u2019s evidence to the Covid inquiry so far. Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, said there should be a senior minister in government with sole responsibility for resilience, including preparing for pandemics. Letwin was responsible for resilience, but he had many other responsibilities too. He told the inquiry: Actually there really ought to be a minister solely devoted to resilience at a senior level. Asked if anyone had ever had this role, he replied: There hasn\u2019t, as far as I\u2019m aware and I think that is an error. I came to that view very gradually but by the end of my time I was pretty convinced that we ought to have, and had I remained in situ I would\u2019ve tried therefore to move to a model, where somebody took that position. Letwin also said that having a junior minister doing this job would \u201cachieve nothing\u201d because the resilience minister should be senior and close to the prime minister. Letwin said the high turnover of ministers and civil servants responsible for resilience was a \u201cdisaster for the country\u201d. He said the ministers and officials should receive training for dealing with civil emergencies, and he said there was a need for \u201ca system that keeps both ministers and officials in post long enough so they can use the training\u201d. He said: I\u2019m pretty certain that the entire structure of the civil service means that you can\u2019t really make progress in a career without going through endless different jobs one after another, which I regard as a disaster for the country, particularly disastrous in the case of things that have very long lead times and where learning from experience is critical. Oliver Letwin, who as Cabinet Office minister was responsible for resilience in David Cameron\u2019s government, has been giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. George Osborne is on later. ITV\u2019s Anushka Asthana has been tweeting on Letwin\u2019s evidence. George Osborne, the former chancellor, will be giving evidence to the Covid inquiry later this morning. The inquiry is focusing at this stage on how prepared the UK was to deal with a pandemic, and Osborne will be questioned about the impact of austerity. He has submitted a 38-page witness statement to the inquiry. It has not been published in full yet, but the committee has released one page from it, because it was cited during the hearing yesterday, and in it Osborne claims that that his austerity measures, which he describes as \u201ccutting the deficit\u201d, had a \u201cpositive\u201d effect on the country\u2019s ability to withstand Covid. He says: Reducing the deficit and placing debt as a percentage of GDP on a downward path was also essential to rebuild fiscal space to provide scope to respond to future economic shocks. A responsible approach to repairing the UK\u2019s public finances following the financial crisis was essential. I have no doubt that taking those steps to repair the UK\u2019s public finances in the years following the financial crisis of 2008/09 had a material and positive effect on the UK\u2019s ability to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. Scotland\u2019s first-ever recall petition for a sitting MP opened this morning following the suspension of Margaret Ferrier from the House of Commons, PA Media reports. PA says: From 9am, voters in Rutherglen and Hamilton West will have the chance to sign a petition to recall their MP from Westminster. If 10% of the electorate choose to do so \u2013 some 8,113 people out of 81,124 \u2013 then a by-election will be triggered. Despite pressure to resign from her seat since breaching coronavirus rules, Ferrier remains the MP, now sitting as an independent. She urged voters not to sign the petition, saying her constituents are her \u201ctop priority\u201d. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, has said that Shaun Bailey should consider turning down the peerage he was given in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list because of his attendance at a Partygate event. Ben Quinn has the story here. Good morning. MPs voted last night, by 354 votes to 7, to accept the privileges committee report saying that Boris Johnson deliberately misled them about Partygate, but even though he is now out of parliament, and condemned as a liar in a report actively endorsed by more than half of the Commons, he is still having a corrosive impact on Tory politics. That was illustrated this morning when Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, gave an interview to the Today programme. Stride said that he accepted the conclusions of the privileges committee report, but that he had doubts about the severity of the notional penalty applied (a 90-day suspension, if Johnson had still been an MP), and so that is why he was one of the 225 Conservatives who did not vote. But it was after that, when the Johnson questions kept coming, that Stride started to struggle. Stride admitted that he did not know what Rishi Sunak thought about the report. Sunak did not vote yesterday, and Stride defended this, saying the PM was busy. He said: What I do know is I know that he had some long standing engagements yesterday, including with the Swedish prime minister and the Jewish Care event in the evening. Stride said Sunak did not express a view before the vote, because he did not want to influence MPs on something that was not a goverment matter, and Stride defended this. Stride said he did not know if Sunak thought, as he did, that the proposed punishment was too harsh. But he said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Sunak would answers questions on this in due course. Stride refused to say that he thought it would be unacceptable to return as a Conservative MP. He said he wanted the party to move on: I think really the caravan has got to move on from Boris Johnson, with respect. But, when asked if he thought it would be acceptable for Johnson to return, he said: I can\u2019t read the future. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me to come on your programme and start speculating on the future. Asked again if he would find Johnson acceptable as a Tory colleague in the future, he replied: I\u2019m not going to be drawn in speculating on the future of Boris Johnson. Stride failed to defend Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list in its entirety, suggesting that it might be right for Shaun Bailey, the former Tory mayoral candidate, to refuse his peerage. Bailey\u2019s peerage is in jeopardy because, just a week after it announced, the Mirror released a video of a Tory \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d party he attended that is being investigated by the police as a potential breach of lockdown rules. It was organised by Bailey\u2019s campaign team. Asked if he agreed that Bailey\u2019s peerage was in question, Stride said he did not want to prejudge the investigation. Asked if Bailey definitely would become a peer, Stride declined to say. Asked if he accepted that the Johnson honours list had not been good for the party, Stride said: I think its down to Boris Johnson who he put forward. Alastair Campbell, the former Labour spin doctor who hates Johnson, and most of the Conservative party too, is about the last person you would consult for an objective view. But this tweet does give a sense of quite how much difficulty Stride was in dealing with these questions. In the debate yesterday Penny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, suggested Johnson was responsible for the \u201cdebasement of our honours system\u201d. Eventually we will get on to some political news that isn\u2019t about Johnson. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning; Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10am: Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. Later in the morning George Osborne, the former chancellor, will give evidence. 11.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 11.30m: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 3pm: Peers vote on Commons amendments to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. 4pm: David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, speaks at Best for Britain\u2019s Trade Unlocked.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office said drones attacked the Kyiv region in several waves, with the air alert lasting for over four hours. Several commercial and administrative buildings and some private houses were damaged, it said. The energy ministry said debris from falling drones damaged electricity lines in the Kyiv region and also in the Mykolaiv region in the south, cutting off electricity for hundreds of residents. Air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said in a radio interview that it was simply not possible for air defence systems to cover all of a country as large as Ukraine. An unspecified critical infrastructure facility was hit in Lviv, which is about 70 km (43 miles) from the border with Nato member Poland. As a consequence some tram routes were altered during the morning rush hour, officials said. \u201cThey hit a critically important facility. There were three hits,\u201d said regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy. Russia\u2019s defence minister has threatened \u201cimmediate strikes on decision-making centres\u201d in Ukraine if western-supplied long-range weapons are used to strike at Crimea. The ministry of defence statement from Sergei Shoigu said an attack on Crimea with Himars and Storm Shadow missiles would constitute an attack \u201coutside the zone of the special military operation\u201d and would mean \u201cthe full involvement of the United States and Great Britain in the conflict\u201d. Russia illegally seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine is in negotiations with western arms manufacturers to boost production of weapons, including drones, and could sign contracts in coming months, a Ukrainian minister told Reuters. Sergiy Boyev, the deputy minister for Strategic Industries in Ukraine, said Kyiv was in talks with manufacturers from Germany, Italy, France and eastern Europe about them producing weapons in Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of the interior has stated that four settlements and 818 houses remain flooded on the right bank of the Dnipro in Kherson. Authorities in Mykolaiv reported some flooding remains in their region too. One person has been killed in Kherson this morning as a result of Russian attacks. Russia has issued an appeal for staff at Ukrainian embassies around the world to defect to Moscow. In a statement, Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service said \u201cWe appeal to the employees of Ukrainian diplomatic missions and representative offices of state bodies abroad. If you feel responsible for the fate of your Motherland, ensuring peace and stability in Europe and are under pressure from the criminal Kyiv regime leading Ukraine to a national catastrophe, come to Moscow, where you and your loved ones will be guaranteed safety.\u201d Russian state-owned media reports that Ukraine struck the occupied settlement of Nova Kakhovka with \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones, injuring three people. Russia\u2019s security forces, the FSB, have claimed to have detained a Ukrainian national in the Kabardino-Balkaria region on suspicion of espionage. Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, two weeks into the Ukrainian counteroffensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 soldiers. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Monday Ukraine must prepare itself for a \u201ctough duel\u201d but that \u201cthe biggest blow is yet to come\u201d. Separately she said that Russia had concentrated a significant number of units in the east, including air assault troops, but that Ukrainian forces were preventing their advance. She described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d. Russia\u2019s defence minister has threatened \u201cimmediate strikes on decision-making centres\u201d in Ukraine if western-supplied long-range weapons are used to strike at Crimea. Russia illegally seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. The ministry of defence statement from Sergei Shoigu says an attack on Crimea with Himars and Storm Shadow missiles would constitute an attack \u201coutside the zone of the special military operation\u201d and would mean \u201cthe full involvement of the United States and Great Britain in the conflict\u201d. In the statement, Shoigu said: According to our information, the leadership of the armed forces of Ukraine plans to strike at the territory of the Russian Federation, including Crimea, with Himars and Storm Shadow missiles. The use of these missiles outside the zone of the special military operation will mean the full involvement of the United States and Great Britain in the conflict and will entail immediate strikes on decision-making centres on the territory of Ukraine. Shoigu also claimed that Russia has repulsed over 200 attacks from Ukraine in recent weeks. He said: Since 4 June, the armed forces of Ukraine have launched 263 attacks on the positions of Russian troops. Thanks to the competent and selfless actions of our units, all of them were repulsed, the enemy did not achieve his goals. Ukraine claims to have retaken at least eight settlements during that period of time, and advanced the front in Zaporizhzhia region by several kilometres. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that one person has been killed in Kherson this morning as a result of Russian attacks. It cited the head of the regional authority, Oleksandr Prokudin. It posted to its Telegram news channel for the region: Russian troops attacked Kherson in the morning. A 27-year-old man died. Houses, a kindergarten, a school and a service station were hit by Russian shells, as was a team of doctors who went to help the Kherson people. The doctors were not injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters is carrying some more comment from Ukrainian sources about the overnight Russian drone attacks on the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office said drones attacked the Kyiv region in several waves, with the air alert lasting for over four hours.

In a statement, Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service said: We appeal to the employees of Ukrainian diplomatic missions and representative offices of state bodies abroad. If you feel responsible for the fate of your Motherland, ensuring peace and stability in Europe and are under pressure from the criminal Kyiv regime leading Ukraine to a national catastrophe, come to Moscow, where you and your loved ones will be guaranteed safety. State-owned news agency Tass quotes director of the service, Sergey Naryshkin, saying \u201cthe consequences of the steady degradation of the internal political and socio-economic situation in Ukraine, as well as the repressive methods of managing the state apparatus implemented by the Kyiv regime, are increasingly affecting the personnel of Ukrainian missions abroad.\u201d The service claims that \u201cLarge-scale purges are being carried out in the foreign establishments of Ukraine, aimed at identifying employees disloyal to Kyiv and ensuring their early return to their homeland.\u201d Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Finland\u2019s newly elected parliament on Tuesday voted in favour of National Coalition Party leader Petteri Orpo to become prime minister, as widely expected, ushering in a right-wing government and ending Social Democrat Sanna Marin\u2019s rule, Reuters reports. Finland formally joined Nato in April, having applied to become a member of the alliance after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares as 1,340km (832 mile) border with Russia, the longest of any EU member. This image sent to us over the news wires shows smoke rising over the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. An unspecified critical infrastructure facility was hit in the city, which is about 70 km (43 miles) from the border with Nato member Poland. As a consequence some tram routes were altered during the morning rush hour, officials said. \u201cThey hit a critically important facility. There were three hits,\u201d Reuters reports regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said. There has been some comment on social media, including from Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun, about the appearance of Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi wearing a baby Yoda insignia from the Star Wars series The Mandalorian. Ukrainian forces on Tuesday struck the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region with drones and three civilians were wounded, the Tass news agency reported, citing the local Russian-imposed authorities. Reuters reports that the authorities claim \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones were used. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of the interior has stated that four settlements and 818 houses remain flooded on the right bank of the Dnipro in Kherson. Russia\u2019s state-owned news agency Tass reports that security forces have detained a Ukrainian national in the Kabardino-Balkaria region on suspicion of espionage. It quotes the FSB saying: In the city of Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkar Republic, [the FSB] stopped the illegal activities of a 44-year-old citizen of Ukraine suspected of espionage. It was established that the detainee, acting on the instructions of the security service of Ukraine, collected and handed over military information to a foreign intelligence officer. The investigation continues. If found guilty, espionage charges carry a term of between ten and 20 years in jail in Russia. Here is an overnight summary of developments in Ukraine as reported by Suspilne on its official Telegram channel: At night, the Russian Federation released 35 \u201cShahed\u201d attack drones over Ukraine \u2013 32 of them were shot down. Anti-aircraft defence operated in most regions, but the main direction of the attack was Kyiv region. In the Kyiv region non-residential structures and several private houses were damaged by debris. There were no casualties or injuries. In Lviv, there were three hits on a critically important object. There was a fire. People were not injured. Due to shelling, the routes of three trams in the city were changed. Zaporizhzhia and its suburbs were fired at with seven S-300 missiles at night: they damaged agricultural property and equipment and one of the recreation areas. There were no injuries or damage to residential buildings. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that yesterday Russia shelled 19 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region, and that one person was injured in Orikhiv as a result. It cited the local authority. Zaporizhzhia is one of four Ukrainian regions that the Russian Federation claimed to annex late last year. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Western powers will only protect Ukraine\u2019s multibillion-dollar postwar recovery if they agree a unified strategy to make aid conditional on clear progress on combating judicial corruption, reinstating the obligation on Ukrainian public officials to declare assets and ensuring all recovery finds can be digitally traced, according to an authoritative report from the German Marshall Fund. The US thinktank\u2019s proposals, matching calls from Ukrainian civil society and G7 ambassadors in Ukraine, reflect a concern that donors have not yet assembled a strategy to ensure how recovery funds can be monitored in a country that has made progress in tackling capture by oligarchs since 2014 but still has many unreformed institutions. The report, published before the UK government-led Ukraine recovery conference takes place in London, argues that Ukraine is fighting a two-front war to defeat Russia and to permanently embed the rule of law. Members of Ukrainian civil society feel they have been sidelined at the conference, which will be dominated by the private sector and international politicians. The leader of Russian mercenary group Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is involved in yet \u201canother deliberate effort to undermine the authority of the official military authorities,\u201d in Russia, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence writes in its latest intelligence update. On Monday, \u201cPrigozhin said that he was expecting a reply from the Russian MoD regarding a \u2018contract\u2019 of his own drafting which he had delivered to the ministry three days before,\u201d the MoD said. \u201cThis follows the MoD\u2019s own ultimatum to Wagner and other \u2018volunteer formations\u2019 to sign contracts with the MoD by 01 July 2023. \u201cAlthough the content of Prigozhin\u2019s document has not been made public, the act of him delivering it raises the stakes, and is highly likely another deliberate effort to undermine the authority of the official military authorities. \u201cPrigozhin\u2019s tone towards the MoD has become unambiguously confrontational. The MoD almost certainly sees this as deeply unfortunate at a time when it is grappling with Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive.\u201d Prigozhin has been feuding with the Russian military for months, accusing it among other things of failing to provide enough ammunition to his forces. The dispute reached new heights this month when a Russian commander accused Wagner of kidnapping and torturing his soldiers. More from the most recent ISW analysis, which writes that Russian sources have claimed that a car carrying a Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official exploded in Simferopol, occupied Crimea on Sunday. It reports: Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov claimed that the gas tank of the assistant to the Zaporizhia Oblast occupation deputy prime minister, Vladimir Epifanov, exploded, injuring Epifanov and two other passengers. Rogov claimed that the cause of the explosion is unknown but that unspecified actors inspected the gas tank on June 17, implying possible sabotage. Interestingly, the ISW appears to contradict Biden\u2019s assessment of the risks posed by Russia\u2019s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. In its latest analysis, the US think tank writes: ISW has long assessed that Russia will likely keep tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus in order to consolidate de facto control of Belarus but maintains that this deployment is extraordinarily unlikely to have battlefield impacts in Ukraine. A European Union report will this week say that Ukraine has met two out of seven conditions to start membership negotiations, two EU sources have said according to Reuters, with the bloc\u2019s executive set to highlight progress made despite the war triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion. The news agency reports: In a highly symbolic move, the EU granted Ukraine formal membership candidate status a year ago \u2013 four months after Russia, Kyiv\u2019s Soviet-era overlord, attacked the country amid its efforts to pursue integration with the West. But the EU set seven conditions \u2013 including on judicial reform and curbing endemic corruption \u2013 to launch accession negotiations. Ukraine has called for talks to start this year. The executive European Commission\u2019s report is a milestone in that process, which supporters of Ukraine\u2019s quest for swift EU accession hope will culminate in a decision by the bloc\u2019s 27 member countries in December to start the talks with Kyiv. Two senior EU officials who were briefed on the report, which has not been made public, said Ukraine has met two of the criteria by now. One of the officials said these related to judicial reform and media law, and added that the focus in the report was on the positives. \u201cThere is progress. The report will be moderately positive,\u201d said the person, who spoke under condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s not about embellishing reality but recognising progress, there have been prominent anti-corruption cases to name, for example.\u201d Ukraine has in recent months gone after several cases of high-profile corruption, including detaining the head of its Supreme Court over a suspected $2.7 million bribe. Beyond stronger anti-graft efforts, other criteria include reforms to Ukraine\u2019s Constitutional Court and law enforcement, anti-money laundering measures as well as laws to rein in oligarchs and safeguard rights of national minorities. Russia\u2019s mercenary Wagner group is calling for people aged 21 to 35 with a \u201cgaming background\u201d to join it as drone specialists as it seeks to expand its recruitment pool following heavy losses, the Institute for the Study of War notes in its latest update on the conflict. The group\u2019s recruiters are posting messages on social media platforms, the thinktank said citing Russian opposition outlet Verstka, which reported that recruits needed no previous experience. The ISW also pointed to an audio intercept posted by Ukraine\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR), in which a Russian soldier discusses a new Wagner recruitment campaign launched due to heavy battlefield losses. \u201cThe new Wagner recruitment campaign reportedly advertises training with well-prepared instructors, health and life insurance, modern equipment, and guarantees that all recruits will receive all promised payments,\u201d the ISW wrote. US president Joe Biden says the threat of Russian president Vladimir Putin using tactical nuclear weapons is \u201creal\u201d, days after denouncing Russia\u2019s deployment of such weapons in Belarus. Reuters reports: On Saturday, Biden called Putin\u2019s announcement that Russia had deployed its first tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d. \u201cWhen I was out here about two years ago saying I worried about the Colorado river drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Biden told a group of donors in California on Monday. \u201cThey looked at me like when I said I worry about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons. It\u2019s real,\u201d Biden said. Last week, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said his country had started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons, some of which he said were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The deployment is Russia\u2019s first move of such warheads \u2013 shorter-range, less powerful nuclear weapons that could be used on the battlefield \u2013 outside Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia launched attacks across Ukraine overnight, including on the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv, close to the border with Poland. Kyiv\u2019s military administration said Moscow had launched a drone attack in the early hours of Tuesday, warning residents to find shelter, in a post on the Telegram messaging app. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The administration later said the city\u2019s air defences had detected and destroyed about two-dozen Iranian-made Shahed drones in the \u201cmassive air attack\u201d. It was the second drone attack on the city since the beginning of the month, it said. In Lviv, a piece of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d was hit and set on fire, the city\u2019s military administration said, but there were no injuries. Earlier, the city\u2019s mayor, Andriy Sadovy reported explosions in Lviv and the surrounding area. It was not clear if the explosions came from air defences or from missile strikes. Air raid alerts also sounded in Zaporizhzhia, the Kyiv Independent reported, noting that the southern city has been heavily targeted by Russian artillery over the past few days. The situation in the city was \u201cstable\u201d despite a \u201ca restless and noisy night\u201d the head of the city council, Anatoly Kurtev, later said on Telegram. No injuries were reported and there was no damage to residential buildings while all utility systems were working as normal, he said. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Moscow launched raids across Ukraine overnight, with Kyiv reporting drone attacks while explosions were also reported in the western city of Lviv and in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia. There were no immediate reports of casualties but authorities in Lviv said a piece of critical infrastructure was set on fire. US president Joe Biden meanwhile warned that the possibility that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons was \u201creal\u201d. \u201cWhen I was out here about two years ago saying I worried about the Colorado river drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Biden told a group of donors in California. \u201cThey looked at me like when I said I worry about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons. It\u2019s real,\u201d Biden said. Other key developments: Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, two weeks into the Ukrainian counteroffensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 soldiers. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukraine must prepare itself for a \u201ctough duel\u201d but that \u201cthe biggest blow is yet to come\u201d. Separately she said that Russia had concentrated a significant number of units in the east, including air assault troops, but that Ukrainian forces were preventing their advance. She described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, a settlement on a heavily fortified part of the frontline near the most direct route to the country\u2019s Azov Sea coast, Maliar confirmed. It brings the tally of settlements liberated in the past two weeks up to eight, with 113 sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny urged his supporters to begin a broad campaign against Moscow\u2019s actions in Ukraine as he went on trial on new charges of extremism that could keep him behind bars for decades. In a statement posted on social media by his allies, Navalny declared that the decision to close his trial was a sign of fear on the part of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had asked China\u2019s government to be vigilant about private companies that may be providing Russia with technology that could be used against Ukraine, although he said he had seen no evidence Beijing was providing lethal assistance to Moscow. \u201cWith regard to lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine, we and other countries have received assurances from China that it is not and will not provide lethal assistance to Russia for use in Ukraine,\u201d Blinken said in Beijing. The British government announced plans to tighten its sanctions policy against Russia, including introducing legislation to keep assets frozen until Moscow has agreed to pay compensation to Ukraine. The new measures will require any individual who has been designated under the sanctions to disclose assets held in Britain. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed his country\u2019s need for long-range weapons and pushed for tougher sanctions on Russia in a phone call with Rishi Sunak. The British prime minister said the UK was firmly behind Ukraine and that \u201csmall steps forward will bring success\u201d. A photograph of a car apparently laden with explosives parked at the top of Ukraine\u2019s Kakhovka dam shortly before it gave way has been said to offer further evidence Russia was behind the bombing. A Ukrainian special forces communications official told the Associated Press he believed the car was there to stop any Ukrainian advance on the dam and to amplify a planned explosion originating in the machine room. Kyiv has accused Hungary of barring access to 11 Ukrainian prisoners of war whom Russia handed over to the EU country, which has maintained ties with the Kremlin during the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cAll attempts by Ukrainian diplomats over the past few days to establish direct contact with Ukrainian citizens have not been successful,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cEssentially they are being kept in isolation.\u201d Nato leaders will not issue a formal invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, said although he added leaders would discuss how to move Ukraine closer to Nato. He also warned against accepting a frozen conflict in Ukraine in return for an end to the war and \u201caccepting a deal dictated by Russia\u201d. The Kremlin said Russia\u2019s decision to decline UN help in areas of Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was motivated by security concerns and \u201cother nuances\u201d. Ukraine deputy minister for strategic industries Sergiy Boyev told Reuters at the Paris airshow that Ukraine was in talks with arms manufacturers in Germany, Italy, France and eastern Europe to boost output of weapons, including drones, and possibly manufacture them in Ukraine. \u201cWe are in very detailed discussions with them. And we are certain that we will have the contracts agreements signed within the next few months,\u201d Boyev said. A military attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a report by the Swedish military has said, stressing the importance of its swift entry into Nato. The report entitled Serious Times did not single out Moscow for instigating a potential attack but rather said Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and China\u2019s mounting influence in Asia and the world were responsible for rising insecurity."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331956", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/20/royal-ascot-2023-day-one-st-jamess-palace-stakes-and-more-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Royal Ascot 2023 day one: St James\u2019s Palace Stakes and more \u2013 live", "lead": "Race-by-race coverage, tips and reaction on the Royal Meeting.

Ascot, unlike Cheltenham, pushed their royal meeting into the weekend with its first Royal Ascot Saturday in 2002 and that was an immediate success. But five days of high-class racing make this a marathon (a Queen Alexandra Stakes if you like) not a sprint (a King\u2019s Stand) and it\u2019s key to pace yourself. The first thing we need to know is what effect the 10mm of rain overnight and this morning has had on the ground. But we won\u2019t know the details of the going until near to midday apparently which is, er, frustrating. \u201cWe anticipate an ease in the going but it is too early to say what it will be before the rain we\u2019ve had has properly soaked in,\u201d reported clerk of the course Chris Stickels. \u201cWe had 10mm, or just under, and most of that came in the heavy shower this morning, which came just after we originally walked the track. We\u2019ll let that rain settle in and the ground will be reassessed by midday at the latest.\u201d We\u2019ll get you the details as soon as we get them. Good morning and welcome to Ascot racecourse, where the weather forecast is a little iffy and the track has already soaked up around 10mm of rain since midnight, but around 40,000 racegoers in their finest gladrags are due to arrive imminently for day one of Royal Ascot 2023. The track\u2019s official weather and going webpage will be generating plenty of traffic this morning, while Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, has recently issued an update on the ground via Twitter. \u201cThe going will be reassessed at midday after 10mm of rain has just fallen,\u201d Stickels said. \u201cThe current going description is good-to-firm in the straight and good, good-to-firm in places on the round course, but this will be updated once that rain has soaked through and we\u2019ve have a chance to reassess the track.\u201d Despite the softening conditions underfoot, the first-day racegoers could be said to be smart in more ways than one. This is the only day of the five-day meeting which stages three Group One events \u2013 the Queen Anne Stakes, the King\u2019s Stand Stakes and the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes \u2013 and yet, year after year, it is fourth out of five in terms of attendance. Only tomorrow\u2019s card \u2013 which features the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes, often the highest-quality race of the entire meeting \u2013 pulls in fewer racegoers. Baaeed and Coroebus were both odds-on for the Queen Anne and St James\u2019s Palace respectively 12 months ago, but the shortest-priced favourite on the first day this year is Vauban, in the Copper Horse Handicap at the end of the card, at around 13-8. On the Flat, it does not get much better than this. One rider, inevitably, will be the centre of attention as the meeting gets underway. Frankie Dettori is Mr Ascot, and a double on Inspiral and Chaldean would get his final royal meeting off to an explosive start. His first-day book of rides, in fact, may well turn out to be the best of his week, and now also includes a \u00a31.1m juvenile after vGivemethebeatboys, a big fancy for the Coventry Stakes, was knocked down for a seven-figure sum at the Goffs London Sale on Monday evening. Bookies will be braced for a Frankie charge on the first afternoon, although Ryan Moore, who is just four winners behind Dettori in third place on the all-time list at the meeting, is a very warm favourite to end the week as the top jockey. William Buick, champion on the Flat for the first time last year, is also very much in the conversation, as is Oisin Murphy, whose suspension in 2022 meant that he did not get a chance to defend the title that he won for the first time in 2021.

Mike Reiss told BBC Breakfast communication was also lost during his dive down to the Titanic. Reiss said: \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic just because I know the logistics of it. And I know really again, how vast the ocean is, and how very tiny the craft is. He added: \u201cSo the idea is, if it\u2019s down at the bottom, I don\u2019t know how anyone\u2019s going to be able to access it, much less bring it back up. \u201cThere is a hope that it\u2019s at, or near, the surface. \u201cI did three separate dives. I did one dive to the Titanic and two more off the coast of New York. \u201cEvery time they lost communication and again, this is not a shoddy ship or anything.\u201d The search is being led by the US Coastguard 1st District, which is based in Boston, Massachusetts, where it is currently 5.30am. Who is the British billionaire explorer missing at sea? Hamish Harding, 58, is one of the five missing with the OceanGate Expeditions vessel, which was reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Harding is the chair of the private plane firm Action Aviation. His wife is called Linda, and he has two sons named Rory and Giles, as well as a stepdaughter named Lauren and a stepson, Brian Szasz. As a student, he left Cambridge with a degree in natural sciences and chemical engineering. Harding is an aviator, holding an airline transport pilot\u2019s licence and business jet type ratings, including the Gulfstream G650. He is also a skydiver, was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2022, and is a trustee of the Explorers Club. He also previously worked with the Antarctic VIP tourism company White Desert to introduce the first regular business jet service to Antarctica. Harding has made many trips to the south pole and, in 2016, accompanied Buzz Aldrin, who became the oldest person to reach the south pole at 86. He also went into space last year with Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin company. Harding is the current holder of three Guinness world records, relating to his work as an adventurer. In 2019, he was commended for the fastest circumnavigation of the Earth via both poles. As part of a crew of eight astronauts and aviators in a Qatar executive Gulfstream G650ER ultra-long-range business jet, Harding led the mission to mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. He achieved the feat in 46 hours, 40 minutes and 22 seconds. In 2021, he achieved the greatest distance covered at full ocean depth and the greatest duration spent at full ocean depth. Alongside Victor Vescovo, Harding dove in a two-man submarine to the lowest point in the world\u2019s oceans, the deepest point of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep \u2013 a depth of about 36,000 ft. What can be done to find it? US and Canadian aircraft are searching the area, as well as large ships, but the hunt was \u201ccomplex\u201d because crews do not know if the vessel has surfaced, meaning they must scour both the surface and the ocean depths, said Rear Admiral John Mauger, first district commander of the US Coast Guard, overseeing the search-and-rescue operation. Concannon said officials were working to get a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that can reach a depth of 6,000 metres (about 20,000ft) to the site as soon as possible. These ROVs are dropped over the side of a vessel, to which it is connected by a \u201cumbilical cord\u201d that enables a pilot to operate its thrusters and also relay data in real-time from its sonar and camera systems. However, the amount of wreckage of the Titanic on the ocean floor means it could take time to discern what is debris and what is the Titan. The search teams do at least have a starting point; the vessel\u2019s position would have been tracked until the moment contact was lost. The company\u2019s managing director, Mark Butler, told the AP: \u201cThere is still plenty of time to facilitate a rescue mission, there is equipment on board for survival in this event,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re all hoping and praying he comes back safe and sound.\u201d What might have gone wrong? It is too early to say what has happened but experts have offered several of the most likely scenarios, from becoming tangled in wreckage of the Titanic, to a power failure or an issue with the sub\u2019s communications system. The wreckage of the Titanic, which lies about 3,800 metres (12,500ft) down on the ocean floor is surrounded by debris from the disaster more than a century ago. \u201cThere are parts of it all over the place. It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Frank Owen OAM, a retired Royal Australian Navy official and submarine escape and rescue project director. Contact was lost one hour 45 minutes into the Titan\u2019s trip, suggesting the crew may have been close to, or at, the bottom, says Owen. The Titan has a maximum speed of three knots, but would be slower the deeper it goes. In the case of becoming tangled, or a power or communications failure, the Titan would be equipped with drop weights, which can be released in an emergency, creating enough buoyancy to take it to the surface. The Titan has an array of signals, lighting, reflectors and other equipment it can use once on the surface to attract attention. Another scenario is that there has been a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, said Alistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at University College London. \u201cIf it has gone down to the seabed and can\u2019t get back up under its own power, options are very limited,\u201d Greig said. \u201cWhile the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\u201d Chris Parry, a retired rear admiral with the British Royal Navy, told Sky News a seabed rescue was \u201ca very difficult operation\u201d. \u201cThe actual nature of the seabed is very undulating. Titanic herself lies in a trench. There\u2019s lots of debris around. So trying to differentiate with sonar in particular and trying to target the area you want to search in with another submersible is going to be very difficult indeed.\u201d What is the Titan sub and what can it do? The Titan is a research and survey submersible that can carry five people, usually a pilot and four \u201cmission specialists\u201d who can include archaeologists, marine biologists or anyone who can afford the experience as a tourist. Made of \u201ctitanium and filament wound carbon fibre\u201d, the 6.7-metre (22ft) craft weighs 10,432kg (23,000lbs), equivalent to about six average-size cars, and is capable of diving to depths of 4,000 metres (13,120ft) \u201cwith a comfortable safety margin\u201d, according to operator OceanGate. It uses four electric thrusters to move around, and has a battery of cameras, lights and scanners to explore its environment. OceanGate says Titan\u2019s viewport is \u201cthe largest of any deep diving submersible\u201d and that its technology provides an \u201cunrivalled view\u201d of the deep ocean. It uses Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite technology to communicate, though it is unclear if it was the cause of the loss of contact. OceanGate tweeted last week: \u201cWithout any cell towers in the middle of the ocean, we are relying on @Starlink to provide the communications we require throughout this year\u2019s 2023 Titanic expedition.\u201d It has a 96-hour bottled oxygen supply, as of roughly 6am Sunday local time, according to David Concannon, an adviser to trip operator OceanGate, which would in theory last until Thursday morning . However, that limit would be affected by the breathing rate of those inside the craft, especially if there are tourists onboard with limited diving experience. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the search for the submersible vessel Titan that went missing during a voyage to the Titanic shipwreck. Rescue teams are continuing the search for Titan which went missing with British billionaire Hamish Harding among the five people aboard. Harding, is the chair of private plane firm Action Aviation, which said he is one of the mission specialists on the five-person OceanGate Expeditions vessel reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Sulaiman Dawood have been named as two of the other people on the submersible in a family statement. The other two passengers have been widely reported as being French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet and OceanGate chief executive and founder Stockton Rush. It is understood there were 96 hours \u2013 four days \u2013 worth of oxygen supply on board which would have started on Sunday morning.

While the tributes have mostly come from within the literary world, he had a huge impact upon modern culture as a whole \u2013 including video games. McCarthy\u2019s work reshaped the way that the world looks at the post-apocalyptic genre, a flavour of fiction that video games have long called home. And Rockstar\u2019s western opus Red Dead Redemption vividly recalls the Border Trilogy \u2013 particularly the twisted figure of Dutch van der Linde. The developers of The Last of Us have specifically cited The Road as a key influence, and it\u2019s easy to see why Naughty Dog drew upon McCarthy\u2019s parent-child journey across a post-apocalyptic America to inform their own. While the main thrust of the game\u2019s story fits neatly into Joseph Campbell\u2019s monomyth, it is the nihilism and bleakness of The Road that determines its mood. Both feature ruined worlds, full of marauders and cannibals, and Joel\u2019s sickness parallels the Man\u2019s fading condition in the novel. Both endings are bleak, the horrors of the world swallowing characters up bodily and mentally. Where McCarthy\u2019s writing bubbles with coarse, descriptive language, that detail is manifested in the ruined locales of The Last of Us. Consider the passage from The Road, describing the \u201ccharred ruins of a library where blackened books lay in pools of water. Shelves tipped over. Some rage at the lies arranged in their thousands row on row\u201d; these are scenes we walk through in Joel\u2019s shoes time and time again. A rather blunt reference to The Road can also be found in Fallout 4, another post-apocalyptic game series, when players come across a child named Charlie wandering the wasteland with Clinton, her father; she talks about the death of her mother and the possibility of getting a dog, her childlike questions juxtaposed with the harsh and unforgiving world around her. Post-apocalyptic games existed long before McCarthy\u2019s novel, of course, but the mood of The Road is reflected in almost every post-apocalyptic video game you could mention since 2010 or so, from 2012\u2019s forgotten survival game I Am Alive to Season 1 of Telltale\u2019s The Walking Dead. In the former, the unnamed protagonist hunts for his family, while the latter\u2019s relationship between Lee and Clementine echoes the dynamic between The Road\u2019s two protagonists. Rockstar\u2019s Red Dead Redemption duology, meanwhile, is often strikingly reminiscent of McCarthy\u2019s Border Trilogy, which tells the story of two 20th-century cowboys coming to terms with the modern world and the final death rattles of the old west, where ranches are seized by the government to become homes for the US\u2019s expanded military. Here, too, Rockstar\u2019s naturalistic devotion to depicting the dying beauty of the American west echoes McCarthy\u2019s pages-long descriptive detail. The mud and dust of the old west sticks to John Marston and Arthur Morgan like glue; players must clean their guns regularly to keep their weapons in good condition; the contents of every drawer are rendered believably. Blood Meridian may never have been explicitly cited as a reference for the Red Dead Redemption, but elements of its nihilistic depiction of the wild west shine through. Judge Holden, the antagonist of Blood Meridian, is a hulking brute, possibly inspired by a real person. Holden masks his brutality with intelligence: he\u2019s well-versed in philosophy, law, languages, and the sciences. Yet his true nature, however much he disguises it, is bloody and revolting. Red Dead\u2019s character of Dutch van der Linde is a modern interpretation of Holden, a charismatic man with contradictory beliefs of enlightenment philosophy and primitivism, combined with a hedonistic appreciation for the finer things in life, be those cigars or opera. As Holden holds John Joel Glanton\u2019s scalping gang together in Blood Meridian with a mixture of threats and charisma, so too does Dutch control his men. Neither character is a stranger to the impulsive brutalisation of innocents. Throughout Blood Meridian and Red Dead Redemption 2, right up until their bloody conclusions, goals change, issues spring up and countless murders are committed \u2013 yet the gang never reach their goal. There is always more, just one more big score, another possible way out. It\u2019s no coincidence that both works end in the death of their protagonist. McCarthy\u2019s wild west was redolent with death, destruction, and meaninglessness, alongside its naturalistic beauty; Rockstar\u2019s wild west is the same, diverging from the more romanticised depictions often found in cinema. To quote the Judge: \u201cThis desert upon which so many have been broken is vast and calls for largeness of heart but it is also ultimately empty. It is hard, it is barren. Its very nature is stone \u2026 Drink up. The world goes on.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s legacy has pervaded all culture. His novels were landmark reads for the generation that is now leading game development, and echoes of their nihilism, intimacy, and sense of destiny will be present in video games for years to come."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331959", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/20/quiz-robo-dogs-lethal-video-games-and-vr-time-travel-can-you-tell-real-life-from-black-mirror-episodes", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Robo dogs, lethal video games and VR time travel: can you tell real life from Black Mirror episodes?", "lead": "Take our quiz to see if you can distinguish between fact and eerily prescient Netflix fiction.

The criticism came in a letter signed by nearly 300 news organisations, including the Society of Editors, Foreign Press Association (FPA), News Media Association, Reporters Without Borders and the European Association of News Agencies. \u201cWe believe that a fundamental tenet of a free and democratic society is allowing journalists \u2013 from all over the world \u2013 to freely report on matters of public interest,\u201d it says. \u201cWe have not found any comparable charges in any other country in the world, let alone in any other democracy.\u201d No other British political party charges for press accreditation, but a fee was introduced last year by the Tories. The charge of \u00a3137 for each journalist\u2019s application is being justified by the party on the basis that it is necessary to address the \u201ctens of thousands of pounds\u201d cost of security checks for people accrediting but not turning up. The cost of accreditation for the conference, which will be held in Manchester over the course of four days at the start of October, will rise to \u00a3880 for journalists who apply after the end of July. The letter continues: \u201cThis decision sets a dangerous precedent for countries all over the world who will use this decision to justify financial and other barriers to media scrutiny of the political process.\u201d It is signed by media organisations from countries including the US and France, Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. Andrew Moger, the chief executive of the News Media Coalition, a group of international news agencies and publications focused on press freedom, said that asking journalists \u201cto contribute to the funds of a political party\u201d through an administration fee was at odds with ministers\u2019 claims to back \u201ca thriving press sector and press freedom\u201d. A Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cA modest charge was introduced last year to discourage over-accreditation by some media outlets. At one recent conference, several thousand people who applied for free media accreditation failed to collect their passes, generating large amounts of paper and plastic waste. \u201cIn previous years, police security checks for non-attenders have cost the party tens of thousands of pounds.

Dhillon most recently made headlines when she signed on to represent Carlson in a gender discrimination lawsuit he and Fox News face from former producer Abby Grossberg. She also acted as an attorney for Donald Trump and former Project Veritas head James O\u2019Keefe, who in 2021 sued Twitter for banning him. Last November, Dhillon was able to mount a serious challenge to Ronna McDaniel for chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Archived snapshots of her campaign\u2019s official website touted endorsements from elected officials such as Gaetz and conservative media figures such as Carlson, Ingraham and Jack Posobiec. Her growing profile proved a huge advantage. Since becoming an RNC committeewoman for California in 2016, she made hundreds of appearances in conservative media, predominantly Fox News. From 2019, these appearances were often based on lawsuits sponsored by that non-profit she helms, the Center for American Liberty (CAL), and aimed at rightwing bugbears like Covid restrictions, leftist street protesters and gender-affirming healthcare. The Guardian has found that at least $1.32m has been transferred from the CAL to her law firm, Dhillon Law Group, in a move one charity expert described as \u201cproblematic\u201d. Additionally, state and federal filings show Dhillon takes a $120,000 salary from CAL for a two-hour work week. Meanwhile, the non-profit has entered into a close relationship with a well-heeled rightwing foundation whose financial generosity has been matched by a seat on the non-profit\u2019s board. CAL was founded in 2018, initially under the name Publius Lex, by California lawyers with extensive connections to Republican politics and rightwing legal organizations, according to state and federal filings. All of the founding members are still officers: president Jason Clark; treasurer Lee Cheng; secretary Christopher Hage; with Dhillon as CEO. A fifth founding member, Christopher Marston, is a Virginia-based Republican lawyer whose work includes non-profit compliance and who is listed as an officer for a wide array of organizations. Publius Lex received little public attention until mid-2019, when Dhillon offered full-throated support to Andy Ngo, the far-right media performer and provocateur who was filmed being punched and doused with milkshakes in downtown Portland that June. Ngo\u2019s alleged assault became the focus of intense coverage in rightwing media: Dhillon either accompanied Ngo or was billed as his representative in eight appearances on Fox News alone in the following two months. This helped cement Dhillon as a Fox News regular. In the three years following her 2016 debut on the network, she appeared as a guest on the network 70 times. In the three years beginning in 2019, the year she began advocating for Ngo, she appeared on Fox News 200 times, according to broadcast transcripts published by Nexis. She appeared most often on Tucker Carlson Tonight and The Ingraham Angle. Days after Ngo\u2019s assault, on 5 July 2019, Dhillon in effect relaunched the non-profit in a Twitter thread, writing that \u201cthe first cause Publius Lex will take up will be to advocate legally for Mr Andy Ngo, a journalist viciously assaulted in Portland by Antifa thugs\u201d and directing supporters to a since-deleted crowdfunding page for Ngo\u2019s legal expenses on the Publius Lex website. That crowdfunding effort was successful: it shows up as a donor-restricted asset of $104,380 in the organization\u2019s 2019 tax return, the first filed under its current name, CAL. But another single-donor contribution of $500,000 contributed far more to CAL\u2019s 2019 haul of over $690,000, a figure more than 20 times what they had raised in their first year. In CAL\u2019s published returns, the identity of that donor is redacted, but a separate tax return from the Adolph Coors Foundation that year reveals a grant of $500,000 to Publius Lex, which was among the foundation\u2019s largest grants to any single recipient that year. The Coors Foundation was established in 1975 by the heirs of the Colorado brewing magnate Adolph Coors II, and it has continued that family\u2019s history of supporting rightwing causes. The foundation and the spinoff Castle Rock Foundation \u2013 which operated between 1994 and 2011 \u2013 have given significant funding over decades to rightwing activist organizations including the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), the State Policy Network and the Federalist Society, along with donations to community groups in Colorado. On its website, the foundation says its aim is to educate Americans about \u201cthe wisdom of the free enterprise system, traditional Judeo-Christian values and the rule of law\u201d. The half-million donation in 2019 was just the start of the Coors Foundation\u2019s largesse. Subsequent IRS filings indicate a $400,000 grant to CAL in 2020; $300,000 in 2021; and a 2022 filing published this week by ProPublica\u2019s Nonprofit Explorer shows a further $200,000 contribution. The running total of $1.4m is a significant chunk of the $7m lifetime income CAL reported as of 2021. By 2020, according to CAL filings, the Coors Foundation chief executive, Carrie Coors, Tynan \u2013 the great-granddaughter of Adolph Coors II \u2013 had a seat on an expanded CAL board. The Guardian emailed detailed requests for comment to Carrie Coors Tynan, Harmeet Dhillon, and the board president, Jason Clark. None responded directly, but CAL\u2019s executive director, Mark Trammell, emailed a response to the questions sent to Dhillon. On Tynan\u2019s board seat, Trammell wrote: \u201cAll board members are subject to the organization\u2019s conflict of interest policy\u201d, and \u201cthere is no conflict of interest in having the CEO of a grantmaking foundation that supports an organization also serve on its board\u201d. \u201cRather, it is both ethical and a best practice for board members to also financially support their nonprofits,\u201d Trammell continued. Non-profits must distinguish between program expenses \u2013 those made in pursuit of its mission \u2013 and expenses incurred by fundraising efforts and administration costs. Legal fees are a program expense for CAL, as is executive compensation. In 2020, Dhillon Law was listed as the largest single contractor in CAL\u2019s 990 IRS filing, receiving $814,714 in legal fees, which was over 45% of all program expenses that year, and 30% of its total expenses of almost $2.8m. In 2021, Dhillon Law received $507,469 in fees from CAL, making it the second highest earning contractor. Dhillon began receiving a $120,000 annual salary without increasing her two-hour weekly commitment to the organization, according to that year\u2019s 990 filing. Together, then, Dhillon and her law firm were taking just over 37% of CAL\u2019s program expenses that year. On Dhillon\u2019s weekly time commitment as reported to the IRS, Trammel wrote that \u201cthe 2021 Form 990 should show Ms Dhillon working 40 hours per week. That correction will be made shortly through an Amended Form 990.\u201d Trammell added that CAL is \u201cgoverned by a Board of Directors, and Ms Dhillon\u2019s compensation is set by disinterested board members. Ms Dhillon has no control over what salary the board pays her for her extensive CEO services, and the board has the authority to hire or fire the chief executive officer position.\u201d Dhillon\u2019s position as CEO in a non-profit whose biggest contractor is Dhillon Law Group is a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d, according to Joan Harrington, a fellow at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at the Santa Clara University, and an expert on non-profit law and ethics. Harrington added that non-profits can navigate this, and that \u201cthe board can accept conflicts of interest if they are brought to the board\u2019s attention annually\u201d. But another ethical problem \u201cthe board can\u2019t fix\u201d, Harrington said, is the issue of compensation. Several sources, including Charity Navigator\u2019s 2016 CEO compensation study, put the amount of Dhillon\u2019s annual salary roughly in line with expectations for the organization\u2019s fundraising. Harrington said non-profit boards can also approve high salaries, and so avoid tripping IRS rules about \u201cexcessive compensation\u201d. With her law firm being paid so much by CAL, Harrington said, and the law firm\u2019s own financials hidden from public view, \u201cwe don\u2019t know all the ways she is being compensated as CEO.\u201d Trammell, the executive director, wrote on the extensive use of Dhillon Law that \u201cthe organization\u2019s day-to-day legal operations are managed by me, its executive director\u201d, adding, \u201cI select the law firms the Center for American Liberty partners with on its public interest litigation.\u201d Trammell also wrote: \u201cWe select law firms based on their expertise, geographical location, and interest in representing our clients at nonprofit legal rates.\u201d But Harrington added that \u201ctransparency protects donors, and this is not a transparent situation\u201d. With Dhillon acting as CEO and legal contractor, running cases sponsored by the non-profit, and making Fox News appearances in both guises, Harrington said: \u201cIt looks like Dhillon Law and the non-profit are overlapping to the extent that its hard to tell the difference.\u201d \u2022 The headline and standfirst were amended on 20 June 2023 to better reflect the text of the article. An earlier version included reference to Harmeet Dhillon taking a $120,000 salary for a two-hour week; while these figures are reported from official filings, the article also notes a representative for CAL saying there was an error in the 2021 Form 990 and that it would shortly be corrected to show Dhillon working a 40-hour week."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033195c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/20/share-your-experiences-of-short-daytime-naps", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Share your experiences of short daytime naps", "lead": "We would like to hear about whether daytime napping helps you feel refreshed or less productive afterwards", "author": "Guardian community team", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 09:23:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173021", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d61d2e50ddab480472fd96b1fd8137f5824daee7/0_448_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "Researchers have suggested that short daytime naps may delay shrinkage of the brain and help protect its health as it ages.

Sudan has been gripped by violence since two rival generals went to war against each other in April. The Commons foreign affairs select committee is conducting an inquiry into Whitehall\u2019s anticipation of the crisis and the level of support provided to British citizens trapped in Sudan. In a letter sent to the Africa minister, Andrew Mitchell, released on Tuesday, the UK Atrocity Prevention Working Group, which encompasses a variety of charities and civil society organisations, said the Foreign Office had pursued an over-optimistic agenda of \u201cdemocracy first\u201d in Sudan. The letter says the Foreign Office failed to heed repeated written warnings that the UK\u2019s systems, capabilities and policies towards Sudan lacked a focus on atrocity prevention. The accusations are due to be elaborated upon at a select committee hearing on Wednesday. The letter\u2019s signatories warn that, if left unchecked, the current cycle of violence could become worse than the genocide that started in 2003 in Darfur, which left 300,000 people dead and displaced 2.5 million. The letter says: \u201cAs violence broke out in April, the [Foreign Office\u2019s] Sudan team had in place no expertise on the dynamics of atrocity violence; no system of urgent alarm raising; no risk assessment process to monitor the distinct indicators of mass violence; were receiving no central guidance on how to prepare for increasingly likely scenarios that could lead to violence and mass atrocity; and undertook no training to help plug even in a very modest way these skills and systems gaps.\u201d The signatories point to warnings as far back as 2019 that a rush to elections without commensurate democratic institutions in Sudan following the revolution that toppled the longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir risked repeating mistakes in Myanmar, where premature assumptions were made about disarmament and preparedness for genuine representative institutions. \u201cFor the past four years, the government and other members of the international community have failed to recognise and respond to Sudan\u2019s continuing trends of violence and risks of mass atrocity crimes,\u201d the letter says. \u201cInstead, priority has been given to democratisation, normalising relations with, and propping up the very actors complicit in the Darfur genocide \u2013 laying the foundation for the devastation and violence we have seen explode over the past nine week.\u201d The working group says it held regular meetings with the Foreign Office\u2019s Sudan team but \u201cobserved no tangible change in policy, resourcing, or strategy\u201d. \u201cIn our last meeting with the Sudan country team in April 2023, just 10 days before violence in Khartoum began, we shared concerns of growing instability and were told the transition process was being viewed with \u2018cautious optimism\u2019. \u201cThis optimism stood in sharp contrast with the already escalating mass atrocity violence in Sudan\u2019s peripheries, including Darfur, now marking its twentieth anniversary since the internationally recognised start of the genocide. This also stood in marked contrast to what our partners were being told about the risk of a military confrontation in Khartoum itself \u2013 many individuals and activists chose to leave the capital days or even weeks before 15 April 2023. In a supporting statement, the Sudanese civil society group Waging Peace, which is part of the working group, said: \u201cRepeated warnings to prioritise justice and accountability for the perpetrators of historic and current mass violence and genocide were not heeded \u2026 HMG must hold their hands up for getting policy on this country wrong.\u201d Dr Kate Ferguson, the co-director of another member of the working group, Protection Approaches, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s lack of preparedness led to a botched evacuation process where British nationals and Sudanese to whom the UK government owes a responsibility were left in chaotic limbo and the opportunities to help mitigate violence to prioritise protection of vulnerable people across Sudan were missed. Even the most fundamental lessons of Afghanistan have evidently not been learned.\u201d The Foreign Office has recently been taking a lead on atrocity prevention and Mitchell has been an enthusiast for that approach to foreign policymaking. However, he has only been in position for just over a year."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033195e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/australian-government-seeks-urgent-legal-advice-on-double-dissolution-over-housing-bill-stand-off", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australian government seeks urgent legal advice on double dissolution over housing bill standoff", "lead": "Labor used question time to pile pressure on the Greens, accusing them of caring more about retweets than rentals", "author": "Paul Karp Chief Political Correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 09:07:52", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173057", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3e48914ed2bf68fa5de566de5d33cd6b71b3a6d2/0_275_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "The Albanese government is seeking urgent advice from the solicitor general about reintroducing the Housing Australia future fund bill, a move that may accelerate its use as a double dissolution trigger. The fate of the bill establishing the $10bn future fund has been in limbo since the Coalition and Greens voted in the Senate to delay it until 16 October, which the Labor deputy Senate leader, Don Farrell, has said the government regards as a failure to pass it. On Tuesday Labor piled pressure on the Greens to pass the bill, using question time to go on the attack. The Greens are still holding out for a a freeze or caps on rent rises. Treasurer Jim Chalmers charged that the Greens were seeking to campaign on the issue rather than boost housing supply, telling parliament they cared \u201cmore about retweets than rentals\u201d and \u201cmore about TikTok than housing stock\u201d. Housing minister Julie Collins refused to commit to bring the bill back in October, telling reporters in Canberra the government was \u201clooking at all of the options in terms of delivering on our housing agenda\u201d. In Labor\u2019s caucus, Anthony Albanese accused the Greens of a \u201cjuvenile student politics approach\u201d to the issue. He said that continually deferring a bill is the same as blocking it, and the government is seeking advice on that point. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Failure to pass a bill is the first step to a double dissolution. If, after three months, the bill passes the House of Representatives and is rejected by the Senate again the government gains the option of using it to trigger a full house and Senate election. The Greens believe Monday\u2019s decision to defer the bill was not refusal to pass the Haff bill, and that it is fair to wait until October to see further progress on renters\u2019 rights at national cabinet. The Greens also believe the Senate would have to agree to bring the bill back sooner, with no advantage to be gained by the government because 16 October is the soonest a new version could pass the lower house after the three month gap to establish a double dissolution trigger. The Haff bill sets up a $10bn future fund to invest and pay out earnings of at least $500m a year to invest in social and affordable housing. Asked if the government would continue to try to pass the bill, Albanese told ABC Brisbane: \u201cWe think this is good policy. It will result in 30,000 additional \u2026 affordable or social housing units built over the next five years.\u201d \u201cAnd it is quite remarkable that people who say they support increased levels of investment in social housing are blocking this measure, both the Greens party and the Liberal and National parties in the Senate.\u201d Albanese noted that on Saturday he had announced a further $2bn of direct funding for social housing, a concession welcomed by the Greens, who argued on Monday and Tuesday it proved their stance had been effective. \u201cWe know that a lack of supply is the big issue that needs to be dealt with, but we\u2019re getting advice at the moment from the solicitor general about a reintroduction of the bill on the housing Australia future fund because we think that is also a good policy and very necessary,\u201d Albanese said. On Monday Greens leader, Adam Bandt, criticised the government\u2019s handling of the bill, telling reporters in Canberra \u201cthey\u2019d rather tout this as a double dissolution trigger rather than negotiate and pass their own bill\u201d. Bandt said despite the double dissolution threat \u201cthe Senate has said it will consider this bill again and there is still time and space to pass this\u201d. The Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said the party could not \u201cturn to a renter and say \u2018hey we fought for the $2bn for social housing but when it comes to fighting for you we\u2019re just going to roll over\u2019 \u2013 no way\u201d. \u201cNo way.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033195f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/20/the-no-wash-movement-would-you-wear-underpants-for-a-week-without-cleaning-them", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The no-wash movement: would you wear underpants for a week without cleaning them?", "lead": "Do you need to wash your T-shirts after every wear?

This made him consider the time and energy that washing his clothes was costing him. \u201cIt was around the time we had our second kid, so I was totally overloaded with things,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything I can cut out of my life I see as a challenge, so laundry was just one less thing to do.\u201d He had already been doing less than many people \u2013 a load every week, or sometimes every two \u2013 but then he went for an entire year without washing his clothes in the machine. These days, Tim, a software engineer, does a wash every six months or so. \u201cSeeing as I don\u2019t have to go to the office any more, I don\u2019t really have a need for clean clothes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d On video calls, \u201cpeople only see me from my head up, and half the time I don\u2019t put my camera on anyway\u201d. He looks clean, if fashionably scruffy, when we speak over such a call. \u201cIf there\u2019s some important social event, I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ve got something nice to wear, but day to day it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d He still uses the washing machine to clean his children\u2019s clothes (and his wife still does hers), although he has cut down on that, too. \u201cThere\u2019s still loads of washing to do \u2013 that\u2019s part of the reason I don\u2019t do my clothes.\u201d It helps, he says, that he has quite a lot of clothes, but during the year-long abstention he got about two weeks\u2019 wear out of a single outfit. Tim cut down on socks by wearing sandals, including for much of the winter. \u201cI never have to wash socks any more, which was always the biggest problem.\u201d Did he at least wear clean underpants every day? \u201cYou can get pants to last a week,\u201d he says. How, I ask nervously, do you get a week\u2019s worth of wear out of pants? \u201cYou just have very low standards.\u201d Sometimes, he would wear swimming trunks as underwear \u2013 he would wear them in the shower, where they would get a wash, then they would dry quickly. Does he notice his clothes starting to smell? \u201cI do notice \u2013 and I change them. But you just don\u2019t need to wash them as much as people do.\u201d His wife occasionally says he smells, \u201cbut she generally doesn\u2019t mind too much\u201d. The no-wash movement started with hair \u2013 water was still in, but shampoo was out \u2013 and there are signs laundry could be next. As Vox put it in 2020, \u201claundry remains remarkably undisrupted\u201d. In the article, the writer Rachel Sugar pointed out that, in the US, apps and services that promise to take care of your washing have largely failed. Unlike other chores, such as cooking or grocery-shopping, which have either become aspirational or made easier to outsource by tech, \u201claundry defies the rules of lifestyle innovation and the promises of capitalism\u201d. No amount of expensive detergent brands or Instagrammable laundry rooms will change the fact that washing clothes is still a drudge. Perhaps, then, the answer is to step away from it altogether \u2013 or, at least, do a lot less. Denim fans were the first to popularise the no-wash trend for clothes. \u201cI don\u2019t wash any denim unless there\u2019s a disaster \u2013 you spill some milk on your jeans, or something,\u201d says Daniel, a teacher (who washes his pants after every wear). \u201cMainly, it gives you a better fade \u2013 the jeans age much better, they last longer. You don\u2019t need to keep spending money on jeans. It\u2019s better for the environment.\u201d Unwashed jeans don\u2019t smell, he insists. \u201cIf I\u2019ve been to a barbecue and there\u2019s a bit of a smoky smell, I might peg them out overnight to air.\u201d The climate crisis may finally have persuaded us to consider the environmental impact of hot washes, water usage and carbon-intensive detergents, while recent increases in energy prices have focused the mind on how much each load is costing us. \u201cI stopped washing my clothes as much during winter 2022,\u201d says Jenny, answering a call for readers to share their experiences of reducing their laundry. \u201cThe drivers for me were the rising energy costs, the effect on the environment and the inability to dry clothes easily inside. It occurred to me that I didn\u2019t need to wash clothes as often. Most clothes really only needed a freshen up.\u201d She took to spraying them with an odour-eliminating mist instead: \u201cThey are good as new. It is also much kinder to the fabric, so clothes last much longer.\u201d Ken, a retired university lecturer, says: \u201cWe used to wash our clothes about six times a week. Now, we do it just once a week. We use soap nuts [a type of small fruit that contains soap] and wash at 30C. I put the wash on overnight, so it uses cheaper electricity.\u201d He says he was motivated \u201cby the climate emergency\u201d. When it comes to what we wear, trying to choose more environmentally conscious clothing is increasingly mainstream \u2013 many of us buy less, or secondhand, or supposedly \u201cethical\u201d brands. But that is only the start, says Charlotte, who works in sustainability and fashion. \u201cPost-purchase washing has a really big impact. Cold washing, only washing when you need to, wearing things for longer \u2013 these are of equal, if not greater, importance from a consumer decision-making point of view than buying a \u2018sustainable\u2019 brand or more sustainable fibre.\u201d Charlotte gets 20 to 30 wears out of many of her clothes, such as trousers. Jumpers are washed perhaps twice a season. Marks and stains get spot-cleaned. \u201cAiring things helps, maybe sometimes steaming things,\u201d she says. She wears a sweatshirt to cook in to avoid staining more cherished clothes. She is from New Zealand, where she says it is normal to wash at low or cold temperatures. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of hot washing anything until I moved to the UK. It\u2019s a cultural thing.\u201d It is not just a sustainability concern \u2013 she wants to keep her clothes looking better. \u201cWashing really wears your clothes out,\u201d she says. Tom, a psychiatric nurse, has about four merino-wool sweaters that he wears on rotation for work. He has gone at least a year without washing them; two have never been washed. \u201cI might rinse them or sponge a stain off,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have a magical sort of repelling property; the wool doesn\u2019t pick up odours.\u201d He hasn\u2019t noticed them smelling. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has complained,\u201d he says. He is now such a fan of merino wool that he has started stocking up on shirts, as well as socks and underwear. The latter two get washed. After every wear? \u201cI can go longer,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m almost ashamed to admit, but let\u2019s say three or four days \u2026 In my trade, when somebody says something, you double it \u2013 if somebody says they only smoke one joint a day, they mean two or three.\u201d So he can go for a week in his woollen pants? \u201cYes, something like that,\u201d he says, laughing. Non-merino items get washed regularly \u2013 jeans, for instance, will be worn for a week. \u201cI feel that water is an important resource, so I try not to use as much as I could,\u201d says Tom. \u201cIt\u2019s also just pure laziness.\u201d His approach is a hangover from being poor in the past, he thinks, when he would have only one pair of trousers and no socks. \u201cIt\u2019s just a habit,\u201d he says, adding that he enjoys the asceticism of it. Habit is partly what explains others\u2019 low-wash lifestyles. \u201cI didn\u2019t live in a house with a washing machine between the ages of 19 and 39, so I did hand-washing and used launderettes,\u201d says Michele, a graphic designer and drummer. \u201cDuring that period, I either didn\u2019t have much money or much spare time.\u201d Clothes, she realised, could be worn many times, with an airing in between. \u201cI got used to not washing things after just one wear. Even when I finally lived somewhere with a washing machine, I was never tempted to get into doing washing daily or every other day.\u201d Her motivation is largely environmental, \u201cknowing that all the microfibres and detergents pollute our rivers, seas and wildlife. Manufacturers make money out of our fear of dirt and promote ridiculous levels of \u2018cleanliness\u2019 \u2013 and the planet is suffering.\u201d It is only relatively recently, says Rosie Cox, a professor of geography at Birkbeck, University of London and a co-author of Dirt: the Filthy Reality of Everyday Life, that we have taken domestic laundry for granted. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really complicated, technically. What happens inside your house is only because of big transformations: having running water, the invention of washing machines that fit in people\u2019s houses, being affordable.\u201d Only since the 1960s, she says, have a majority of households had a washing machine; now, it is close to 100%. The other element is how our clothes have changed. Essentially, they have become more washable. Before the second half of the 20th century, many garments were made from wool fabric. \u201cYou clean those by dry-cleaning them occasionally, but often you brush them, dab them, that kind of thing,\u201d says Cox. \u201cPeople would have owned fewer things and they would have been more durable.\u201d The advent of synthetic fibres and cheap manufacturing of fibres such as cotton \u201chappened at a similar point in time to when we started having washing machines\u201d, she says. So, clothes could be washed \u2013 and increasingly people had the machines to do so. What we consider to be clean is \u201cculturally, historically and socially specific\u201d, says Cox. \u201cIt\u2019s prevalent in our society to think of cleanliness in visual terms: Does it look clean? Are your whites white?\u201d This is why many of us, spotting a small mark that seems to tarnish an otherwise-clean garment, decide to toss the whole thing in the laundry basket. It is also why manufacturers push stain removers and brighteners. We also became concerned about smell \u2013 not just removing odour, \u201cbut putting other odour in. Today, we have all these things like scent boosters.\u201d Ryan, the father of a four-year-old in Fife, grew up in a house where his mother \u201cused to wash and iron everything religiously.\u201d He had always questioned it: \u201cYou just put something ironed on and it gets creased.\u201d Now that he is a father, he tries to make life as easy as possible. This means less laundry \u2013 and definitely no ironing. He doesn\u2019t go as far as others in terms of wears between washes \u2013 a T-shirt will get two or three outings \u2013 but he is doing less washing than he was. He has convinced his wife to cut down, too: \u201cShe wanted to wash our daughter\u2019s pyjamas after every wear.\u201d Alison, a stay-at-home mother in Glasgow, also grew up with a heavy laundry load. \u201cMy mum taught me to wash everything after wearing once,\u201d she says. \u201cShe ironed everything, too.\u201d Once Alison realised she could put worn clothes back in the drawer or cupboard \u201cwithout fear of contamination\u201d, she stopped counting how many times they had been worn. Her husband, who grew up in the countryside and had a much less stringent approach to laundry, took on the washing \u201cand made it the norm in our house\u201d. She worried that \u201cpeople would think I was dirty \u2013 and then I realised nobody notices. I think my mum would be horrified if I told her, but she doesn\u2019t notice. Why do all that work? It saves us money, is better for the environment and our clothes last longer.\u201d Amber, a marketing manager, has designated a drawer for worn-but-wearable clothes: \u201cI check for visible marks or any odours, and if there\u2019s nothing that makes it a problem to re-wear, I simply put it away again. I use the washing machine only once a week instead of most days.\u201d This year, Chet\u2019s washing machine broke down. He decided not to replace it. \u201cIt was an easy decision to live like I was in the 19th century and do clothes washing by hand,\u201d says Chet, an artist. \u201cI started out trying to wash on the same schedule as before, but quickly I realised it wasn\u2019t easily done.\u201d Washing gradually became less frequent; now, he does a monthly hand-wash. \u201cIt became clear that I didn\u2019t need to wash jeans or shirts, so it came down to underwear and socks. I feel sure that I don\u2019t need a washing machine ever again.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331960", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/nsw-to-urgently-consider-retrofitting-and-enforcing-seatbelts-on-buses-after-deadly-hunter-valley-crash", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "NSW to urgently consider retrofitting and enforcing seatbelts on buses after deadly Hunter Valley crash", "lead": "Minns government asks taskforce to examine enforcement of laws but experts say making drivers legally responsible will be difficult", "author": "Elias Visontay Transport and urban affairs reporter", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 09:00:25", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173093", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74c279ad06d53ef304fb3f590ba32ec038998148/1927_952_3641_2185/500.jpg", "body": "Retrofitting seatbelts to more buses and coaches, and better enforcing laws requiring passengers to wear them, are some measures under urgent consideration in New South Wales in the wake of the Hunter Valley bus crash. On Tuesday, the Minns Labor government announced it had instructed the NSW bus industry taskforce to look at \u201ca number of current concerns\u201d around safety management, seatbelt use and regulatory arrangements in the state. The government has specifically asked the taskforce to evaluate the state\u2019s program that has retrofitted seatbelts on school buses in regional NSW over the past 10 years and whether that process could be expanded to buses in other areas of the state. The taskforce will also examine the issue of enforcement of seatbelt laws. Currently, seatbelts are not mandatory on all buses in NSW. Many coaches and regional school buses are fitted with seatbelts, but commuter buses in cities that are also used for suburban school services don\u2019t have seatbelts as part of a vehicle design also aimed at allowing standing passengers. Additionally, while it is a requirement for everyone on board a bus fitted with seatbelts to wear them, drivers are not legally responsible for ensuring their passengers wear them, and experts have warned enforcement is a grey area. The taskforce will also look into whether any changes should be recommended to the Australian Design Rules for buses and coaches, which are the national standards for road vehicle safety. Safety management systems put in place by bus and coach operators, including driver training and fatigue management, will also be examined. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Labor government initially established the taskforce after coming to power in March to address industry issues such as a deterioration in services and driver shortages. In line with its newly expanded remit to consider safety, the government has now appointed Darren Lane, a long time safety expert who has previously advised government, to the taskforce to provide independent safety advice. The NSW transport minister, Jo Haylen, said: \u201cWhen tragic events like this happen, we need to look at what we can do to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again. \u201cWe know seatbelts save lives, but if there needs to be more enforcement around this issue put in place so something like this doesn\u2019t happen again, we will do it,\u201d Haylen said. The taskforce will report early safety findings by 31 July. The move comes after the parents of the groom whose Hunter Valley wedding ended in tragedy launched a call for stronger seatbelt laws in recent days. Prof Stuart Newstead, director of Monash University\u2019s accident research centre, previously told Guardian Australia it would be difficult to make drivers legally responsible for ensuring their passengers are all wearing seatbelts. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to monitor up to 60 passengers, and what\u2019s stopping them taking it off later?\u201d he said. Newstead pointed to seatbelt detection technology commonly installed in cars that warn when a passenger\u2019s seatbelt isn\u2019t fastened as something that could be adapted to buses. He also noted versions of interlock technologies in cars that mean vehicles cannot travel faster than 10km/h if a passenger isn\u2019t wearing their seatbelt. However, he said this could still place the driver in an awkward position. \u201cEven if there\u2019s an audible warning, what would happen? Would it stop the bus if one passenger set it off?\u201d Newstead also said automatic emergency braking if an imminent collision is detected, as well as automatic stability control, which corrects the trajectory a vehicle is travelling in to match the steering direction, and black box-like devices that ensure drivers travel at legal speeds could all be considered for buses and coaches. \u201cThe technology is there to be implemented immediately,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331961", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/20/australia-politics-live-humanitarian-visa-reserve-bank-interest-rates-philip-lowe-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-greens-housing-rent-caps-question-time", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Faruqi says housing fund standoff \u2018not about playing political games\u2019 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed", "author": "Emily Wind and (earlier) Amy Remeikis", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:57:25", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173110", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f1ac75eb1b8154da67bc19654c042f8b8a28020f/0_520_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "With that, we\u2019ll wrap up our live coverage of the day\u2019s news. Here\u2019s a summary of the main news developments: In the Senate, Jacqui Lambie claimed there was a \u201cculture of cover-up\u201d at the highest levels of the Australian defence force and said she had referred senior commanders to the international criminal court. During a Labor caucus meeting this morning, PM Anthony Albanese took aim at the Greens and Coalition for blocking the $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund bill, accusing them of a \u201cjuvenile student politics approach\u201d. The Greens\u2019 Mehreen Faruqi said the delay was \u201cnot about playing political games\u201d but about ensuring those living rough could \u201cbe assured a roof over their head\u201d. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has refused to apologise to Liberal MP Cindy McLeish for calling her a \u201chalfwit grub\u201d in state parliament, arguing he was defending a female colleague at the time. The Reserve Bank of Australia says its decision to increase the official interest rate in June rather than pause was \u201cfinely balanced\u201d and further increases would hinge on how developments at home and abroad affected the inflation outlook. On housing, Albanese was asked whether bringing almost 400,000 migrants into Australia last year is making the housing crisis worse. The prime minister said: Let\u2019s be clear about what happened last year. Whereas what normally happens is people leave the country and people come back to the country. What happened post-pandemic, of course, was that instead of students who finish their degree \u2013 for example, leaving, and the same number coming, just people came; no one was leaving because they weren\u2019t here beforehand. And indeed, the population that will be reached in 2025 was expected to be the population under the former government projections already in 2022. So this is a product, really, of what has happened with the opening up of our borders. And when you close your borders completely, as we did, you\u2019ve got to expect a short-term bounceback. We have a migration strategy. We expect that by targeting migration to Australia\u2019s need, the numbers in future will actually be lower than what was projected. To read more on this, we brought you this last week: Albanese clarifies that the Indigenous voice doesn\u2019t have veto power and would be an advisory group: Hamish Macdonald: If the voice disagrees with the government of the day on something, who has primacy there? Albanese: The government, absolutely. There is no right of veto of this. Parliament structure remains in place, it is not affected by any of this, and that\u2019s been made very clear \u2013 all this is is an advisory group. Albanese is asked if the Indigenous voice to parliament debate is confusing for those who don\u2019t actively consume the news. He says: People will focus over the coming months on this, but it\u2019s up to us to put forward the very clear arguments. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s come from Canberra. This has come from Indigenous people themselves \u2026 they decided that they wanted constitutional recognition that\u2019s been spoken about since last century, but not advanced - they want to constitutional recognition but they wanted it in a form where they got listened to \u2026 about the matters that affect them. This won\u2019t impact most Australians that directly that their lives at all, but it just might make a difference for the most disadvantaged group in Australian society. PM says it \u2018hasn\u2019t been parliament\u2019s finest weeks\u2019 Anthony Albanese is appearing on The Project tonight to speak on a range of issues, including the Indigenous voice to parliament and housing. When asked about the conduct in parliament during the past few weeks, the prime minister said: Certainly it hasn\u2019t been parliaments finest weeks. And certainly when it comes to senator [David] Van, I wasn\u2019t aware he was here in the first place and I would be comfortable if he never returned. Lambie says Marles misunderstood her on ICC Jacqui Lambie has released a statement saying that deputy PM Richard Marles has \u201cmissed the point\u201d around her claims made in the Senate today that she\u2019s asked for the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate senior Australian defence force commanders over their accountability for alleged war crimes. Earlier, Marles said the government was committed to implementing the Brereton report\u2019s recommendations \u201cfully and thoroughly\u201d. Lambie said in a statement: Unfortunately, one of the recommendations of the Brereton report is to grant senior command \u2018blanket exemption\u2019 from command responsibility and not investigate them. Subsequently, because [the chief of the defence force] undertook referrals arising from the Brereton recommendations, no higher commanders will be investigated. The deputy prime minister has granted these officers another free pass when it come to this matter. This is entirely inconsistent with the intent of the ICC. The deputy prime minister appears happy to ignore this. By filing of this matter with the ICC, I have ensured that current and former senior commanders of the ADF will finally be investigated. Guardian Australia has contacted Marles\u2019s office for further response to Lambie\u2019s additional statement. Cost clarity call as power link probe goes underground Environmental concerns and the bushfire risk posed by a critical link in the national electricity network will be aired in a new inquiry, AAP reports. The $3.3bn HumeLink is expected to become a crucial component in the national electricity market by allowing Sydney to draw more energy from southern NSW. But local communities are worried the overhead 500-kilovolt transmission line will significantly increase the risk of deadly blazes in areas still recovering from the Black Summer bushfires while also cutting through prime farmland. A parliamentary inquiry will now examine the feasibility of putting major transmission lines underground after a request from the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe. Independent MP Joe McGirr, whose Wagga Wagga electorate will host HumeLink, said that after years of discussion, the facts needed to be laid out on the table. If undergrounding is better for the environment \u2013 it reduces the fire risk, it\u2019s better for farmland \u2013 then we ought to know how much better, and are people prepared to pay a bit extra on their power bills to get that solution? Overwhelmingly, people are undergrounding in Europe and California. NSW is due to decommission three coal-fired power stations in the next decade, including Eraring in 2025. The loss of coal-fired power stations from the national grid made it essential HumeLink was completed by 2026, network operator Transgrid has said. But it has suggested a subterranean HumeLink would cost $11.5bn \u2013 more than three times the price tag for an overland network. Opponents from the group Stop, Rethink HumeLink say the figure is vastly exaggerated. Nostalgia alert \u2026 Nestl\u00e9 to stop making Fantales chocolates In sad news this evening, Nestl\u00e9 has confirmed that Fantales \u2013 the iconic chocolate covered caramels famed for movie star stories on the wrappers \u2013 will cease production next month. The decision follows declining sales and the need for significant upgrades to continue to make Fantales at Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Melbourne confectionery factory. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s confectionery and snacks general manager, Andrew Lawrey, said: We know our decision to stop making Fantales will be sad news for many people. Many of us grew up with Fantales and have fond memories of them. Despite the sense of nostalgia Fantales evoke, unfortunately people simply aren\u2019t buying them as often as they used to. In addition, our Fantales equipment needs significant investment. It\u2019s become increasingly difficult to get the parts we need to maintain it, and with declining sales, replacing it isn\u2019t viable. The last production of Fantales will be in mid-July, with Fantales available for sale while stocks last. All staff from the Fantales production line will move to other roles within the factory. Catch up on today\u2019s biggest headlines so far with this wrap from my colleague Antoun Issa: Where\u2019s Scott? The former British prime minister Boris Johnson has shared this photo from the opening of the International Democrat Union conference in London. Take a look to the left in the photo and you\u2019ll see who my eagle-eyed colleague Amy Remeikis spotted \u2013 former prime minister Scott Morrison. The Afternoon Briefing host Greg Jennett asked Mehreen Faruqi whether the debate over the housing fund bill is an isolated dispute with the Albanese government around housing, or whether it marks the beginning of the fracturing of progressive politics in the Senate. Jennett: \u2026 Which has provided I think a fair amount of stability since the Albanese government was formed. The Greens, David Pocock and occasionally others, it has all been harmonious. Is all of that under threat now? Faruqi: What this is about solely is about those people who are crying out for support and help. That\u2019s what this is about. This is not about playing political games, as Minister Jackson was talking about. This is really about making sure that people who are in a rental crisis, who can\u2019t afford a roof over their head, who are sleeping in cars, sleeping in caravans, who might be on the streets, actually can be assured a roof over their head. That\u2019s what this is about, and nothing more. Faruqi is asked why not lock in the Haff deal now as it is on offer federally, and leave it to the states to control rental lease legislation: We were being told by some people that we should agree to the Haff bill six months ago, and if we had agreed to that and we hadn\u2019t put pressure on the Labor government, this $2bn \u2013 which Labor kept saying they didn\u2019t have \u2013 would not have materialised. And this $2bn is a one-off. We think there should be a yearly spend of $2.5bn on social and affordable housing. She continues: We want [the federal government] to do a similar thing that they have done on the $2bn for building more homes, to do a similar thing and incentivise states and territories. Literally on the mainland it is wall-to-wall Labor ministers, so they can negotiate, come October, or even before that, they can sit down with the national cabinet and make sure that we do get a freeze on rent increases, we do get a cap on rents, and so that the renters who are really suffering, and many people are just one rent increase away from eviction. The Greens deputy leader, Mehreen Faruqi, is speaking on the ABC. She is asked about comments from the NSW housing minister, Rose Jackson, that Max Chandler-Mather and the Greens have not made a serious attempt to speak with the states on housing. Faruqi says: The Greens are very proud that they have put pressure on the Labor government and have campaigned with the community for months for a good result, because over the weekend, Labor committed $2bn right now to build community and affordable housing. With the Haff bill nothing would happen until 2024 and we will probably see the first homes built in 2025. So this money is four times the money than what the Haff bill would do, so I hope state ministers across the board are happy with that. Our housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, together with our state housing spokesperson, wrote to Minister Collins at the federal level and to all state housing ministers, and did ask them to do rent freezes, to cap rents, and to look at ending no-grounds evictions. They haven\u2019t got a response on that. In case you missed it earlier, the independent senator Lidia Thorpe brought a dozen members of the Blak sovereignty movement to parliament to speak on their reservations and opposition to the Indigenous voice. You can watch what they said below: Nampijinpa Price downplays the need for more senators for the NT and ACT Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was also asked for her thoughts on adding more senators for the territories. Yesterday, the joint standing committee on electoral matters tabled an interim report with a range of recommendations. The independent senator David Pocock recommended greater representation for the territories: Increase the baseline level of representation for the ACT and NT in the Senate to as close to half the representation of States as possible. Given the current number of Senators in each State, this would see the ACT and the NT each have 6 Senators. Terms should increase to six years and commence on 1 July following the election in line with the states. When asked about this in relation to the NT specifically, Price said: Look, I don\u2019t think it is necessary for a place like the Northern Territory. I think we are overgoverned as it is. I think Australians wouldn\u2019t like to see more of a representation of people within parliament as it is. Senator Pocock has a lot of issues belonging to a territory that I know that he highlights, but in the Northern Territory obviously our population doesn\u2019t speak to providing the opportunity for more representation, I don\u2019t think. Nampijinpa Price doubts politicians will be less vocal on voice debate The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, was just on the ABC speaking about the Indigenous voice to parliament. She was asked about commentary that the voice debate will now take a step away from politicians and instead move to grassroots campaigners: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case on either side of the debate, I think everyone\u2019s got a stake in this. She is also asked if she will play a role herself, leading the argument from the front? Absolutely. I have been very vocal about this prior to being appointed to this position. My concerns with the voice campaign, with the proposal, with the lack of detail, the lack of transparency around it, and obviously the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, herself, will no doubt be out there campaigning for the yes side as well. Government getting legal advice on housing bill, Albanese says Anthony Albanese has revealed the government is getting solicitor general\u2019s advice about reintroducing the Housing Australia Future Fund bill, a move that may accelerate its use as a double-dissolution trigger. Albanese told ABC Brisbane: We think this is good policy. It will result in 30,000 additional \u2026 affordable or social housing units built over the next five years. And it is quite remarkable that people who say they support increased levels of investment in social housing are blocking this measure, both the Greens party and the Liberal and National parties in the Senate. It comes on top of other policies that we\u2019ve had on the weekend. Of course, we\u2019re announced additional $2bn direct funding for social housing \u2013 $398m of that will go to the Queensland government. [Conditions] were agreed by all state and territory governments. It must be additional to existing funding arrangements which are there, that is, it\u2019s got to add to public housing stock. It can be either new builds or it can be renovating houses that currently are unoccupied because of issues of downgrading that they\u2019re just not up to scratch. It can be for spot purchases as well. It\u2019s all got to be spent within the next two years and it\u2019s providing as well on the work that the national cabinet\u2019s already been doing on improving planning laws, to improve housing supply. We know that a lack of supply is the big issue that needs to be dealt with, but we\u2019re getting advice at the moment from the solicitor general about a reintroduction of the bill on the Housing Australia Future Fund because we think that is also a good policy and very necessary. NSW housing minister wants talks with federal Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather The NSW housing minister, Rose Jackson, tells the ABC she hopes to sit down and talk with the Greens\u2019 Max Chandler-Mather on housing: I invite Mr Chandler-Mather to contact me. We talk a lot with the state Greens here in New South Wales and we do not always agree, this is not pretending there is some kumbaya moment where are all politicians are going to hold hands. \u2026 With the Greens in the state parliament that kind of cooperation \u2013 not always agreement \u2013 but dialogue is really open, and yet from the federal Greens we don\u2019t see any of that despite the fact that the states are explicitly responsible for rental regulation. To me, as someone who is directly involved in this work day in and out, they\u2019ve made no effort to seriously engage with us. \u2026 A big point I\u2019ll be making is OK, let\u2019s agree where we can, disagree when we can on rental reform, but that does not need to stop us getting the plans and the processes in place to deliver social and affordable housing. It is really frustrating when there\u2019s negotiations that hold up things that could be happening right now, just because of political posturing and I do get frustrated. Defence minister Richard Marles says he\u2019s taking advice on the claims made by Jacqui Lambie in the Senate earlier today that she\u2019s asked for the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate senior Australian Defence Force commanders over their accountability for alleged war crimes. Marles said he would meet with Senator Lambie tomorrow about her concerns, praising her \u201csignificant\u201d advocacy for the veterans community. The minister again reiterated that the allegations of war crimes raised in the Brereton report were \u201cappalling\u201d and committed to implementing its recommendations in full. Marles said this afternoon: Under the Albanese government, Australia is holding itself to account. He said that included ensuring accountability of senior military figures. Marles said he\u2019d take advice on whether the ICC would take up the case, but that the government was committed to implementing the report\u2019s recommendations \u201cfully and thoroughly\u201d. NSW minister \u2018so angry\u2019 at Liberals and Greens for blocking housing future fund debate NSW housing minister Rose Jackson is speaking on the ABC on the delay of the Haff bill yesterday. Earlier, she released a video on Twitter on the issue, talking particularly about the Greens\u2019 Max Chandler-Mather: This is what she said of the video: I\u2019m annoyed because it does have real consequences for us in New South Wales. We been having weekly meetings with our senior officials, preparing our bids for the first round of the Haff. No-one here in NSW is pretending legislation will solve all the problems we have, we know that we need to do more than that, but we have been putting a lot of effort into preparing our bids to get access to that funding, that desperately needed funding. \u2026I get pretty agitated [and] annoyed. We are really desperate in New South Wales, we have a lot of work to do and the shenanigans in Canberra to me are a distraction and they do have real consequences. Calls for Daniel Andrews to apologise for \u2018half-wit grub\u2019 remark Deputy leader of the Liberal party Sussan Ley has called on Victorian premier Daniel Andrews to apologise for comments he made in parliament today. Earlier, Liberal MP Cindy McLeish asked Andrews to apologise after he called her a \u201chalf-wit grub\u201d in parliament. Andrews immediately withdrew the comment, however in a ministerial statement said he wouldn\u2019t apologise: I will not be apologising for doing that ... I defended the member for Northcote, and I always will from your attacks. On social media this afternoon, Ley said: Can you imagine if a CEO of any company called a senior woman a \u2018half-wit grub\u2019? This is unacceptable behaviour in any workplace. Daniel Andrews must apologise, and he should reflect on whether it is time to move on from politics. Bus crash victims honoured in state parliament The victims of the NSW wedding bus crash have been formally honoured in parliament as a relief fund passes $600,000 and the parents of the groom call for stronger seatbelt laws, AAP reports. Premier Chris Minns moved for the upper house to extend its deepest sympathies to the families, friends and loved ones of those killed or injured in what he described as \u201ca profoundly tragic event\u201d. He told the house on Tuesday: The psychological scars of this event are significant. The tight-knit communities of Singleton, Cessnock and the surrounding towns are hurting even as they rally together, and we want to acknowledge their pain and honour their resilience today. Young paramedics who had been in the job for less than 12 months were among the first to arrive at the scene. Minns said: As is often the case with emergency service workers in regional NSW, more often than not you may well know someone who is in a crash or on the site of an accident. Minns said the government will listen to NSW Police and take on their findings, including any changes that could prevent a similar tragedy from happening again. The pledge comes after the father of the groom called for stronger seatbelt laws on Monday. Thanks to Amy for taking us through the day! I\u2019ll be with you for the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. Thanks for joining me I am going to hand you over to Emily Wind ahead of Richard Marles\u2019 presser \u2013 we will bring you that as soon as we can. Thank you to everyone who joined me today \u2013 keep checking back for updates and I will be with you early tomorrow morning for the second last day of the sitting. As always \u2013 take care of you Ax SA to get new court to hear cases involving Indigenous children The South Australian government has announced a new justice initiative, as AAP reports: A special court to hear cases involving Aboriginal children and a series of diversion and assistance programs are among a suite of measures to reduce the level of Indigenous incarceration in South Australia. The state government will establish an Aboriginal justice agreement to develop a collaborative approach to improve justice outcomes. It will also build a new community corrections centre at Port Augusta with culturally appropriate rehabilitation and reintegration spaces, develop a program to ensure Indigenous offenders are ready to return to the workforce upon their release, and establish a drug and alcohol treatment facility. In a two-year trial, a Youth Aboriginal community court in Adelaide will aim to address escalation points in the offending of young people and implement protective strategies to divert them away from a life of crime. Children aged between 10 and 13 and charged with minor offences will be specifically directed away from custody through a program of assistance, including short-term accommodation where no other suitable bail option has been identified. The government has allocated $25 million over four years to cover the initiatives. Two Gallagher questions For those asking, we checked and there were two questions to Katy Gallagher over whether or not she misled parliament in the senate today. (Not counting supplementaries) I forgot this was on this morning. Mostly because I don\u2019t care. Native title claim headed to high court The attorney-general Mark Dreyfus has released a statement: Today the commonwealth filed a special leave application in the high court in relation to a decision of the full court of the federal court in a native title compensation claim brought by the Gumatj clan in the Northern Territory (Yunupingu on behalf of the Gumatj Clan or Estate Group v Commonwealth of Australia [2023] FCAFC 75). I recognise the significant contribution that Yunupingu has made to First Nations land rights in Australia. Initiating this landmark case was one of many actions he took to build a better future for his people. This case raises important legal issues including very significant constitutional issues that go beyond the native title context. The application of these constitutional issues in the context of native title compensation is new and the federal court decision on 22 May 2023 represents the first time these issues have been judicially determined in that context. In my view it is appropriate that these critical issues be settled by the highcourt so that parties to this and future matters have clarity and certainty about the law in this area. Snap press conference Deputy prime minister Richard Marles has called a snap press conference for 3.50pm. It\u2019s in the house of reps courtyard, for building dwelling blog watchers. What else can the voice do? Stay tuned Andrew Giles gets a dixer on World Refugee Day and then question time ends. Two. More. To. Go. How low can we go? Will we ever find out if the voice will be able to re-write season three of Ted Lasso? Will the voice be able to bring back the Pollywaffle? Or more importantly, the original Milo chocolate bar? Stay tuned tomorrow to find out what else the Coalition doesn\u2019t understand about the voice. Who will make up the voice body and who will appoint them? LNP MP Llew O\u2019Brien gets a question for Linda Burney: How many people will make up the voice body, who will appoint them and how long will they be appointed for? Linda Burney: Can I thank you for that question. Can I repeat, in the second reading speech, of the attorney-general, he made it very clear that parliament subject to this constitution have the power to make laws in respect to magistrate leading to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice including its composition, functions, powers and procedures. Rookie error Tony Burke takes a dixer on industrial relations and same work, same pay, which is one of his most favourite topics, because no one in the parliament knows more about it than he does. He mentions a misleading ad and reads from a paper and then Dan Tehan makes a rookie error by asking Burke to table the document he was reading from (this is a trick to point out that the minister was reading from a prepared answer and the opposition tries to get them to table it to try and embarrass them and the minister usually says it is confidential and it is not tabled and omg no one cares about these parliament parlour tricks) But Burke is THRILLED to table the document. I would love to. I will table that and also table the script of the other ad which is also wrong. Which says- it means by law, more employers will have to pay employees with little experience. They are both wrong and they are both tabled. What is the future of the Bathurst motor races? Back to the non-government questions and Andrew Gee wants to know from Catherine King about the future of Bathurst. (the motor race, not the town, although they are sort of linked. Gee: Bathurst is home of motor racing in Australia. Every year the great race borrower draws hundreds of thousands of race-goers and a global viewing audience. Your department has pulled $12.5 million in grant funding for a second racetrack and won\u2019t allow an extension of the completion date or upgrades to the existing circuit. Will you agree to meet with me and the nayor of Bathurst to review this outrageous decision. King: Thank you very much and I thank the member for his question, I know he is very very passionate advocate for his community but of course, the Mount Panorama, and the Bathurst 1000, my brother goes every year \u2026 he has been going for a long time and I know, just how important it is. I am absolutely happy to meet with you, in fact, I spoke to one of the counsellors at the recent Australian council of local government from the Bathurst council about this very issue. I am happy to meet with a member about it. The facts of the members of this, the grant was announced almost three years ago, now. There has been significant problems with planning approvals for the second racetrack, and the council has informed us that it is unable to meet the deadline to build this racetrack by 2026. That is how long they have to actually get this done. The grant has been concluded because it not be delivered in the time required. What I do encourage is that the member and the council to do is to put in an expression of interest to the growing regions mind, a $300 million fund that opens on 5 July and I certainly welcome. I am sure an application, if a ghost application, from the Bathurst council for the project. I understand the council was seeking to move the funds to another project still at Mt Panorama, I understand, but the guidelines of the government of the community development grants would not have allowed that to happen. More questions \u2013 will the voice have power over our space program? We get another dixer, which gives us all a chance to ponder \u2013 will the voice have power over Australia\u2019s space program? After all, Indigenous Australians live under the sky. Will the voice have input into how much coffee I drink a day? Will the voice have influence over the Aria charts? I mean these questions we are hearing today really make you think. Will RBA pause rate rises next month? The Reserve Bank\u2019s minutes have kicked up a bit of dust today, and not just because they provided a hint it might be inclined to pause in rate rises next month. (See our report here). A bit of attention has focused on the RBA (belatedly) giving attention to companies as a cause for the high inflation. As the bank board noted, some firms were indexing prices to past inflation, thereby contributing to the ongoing inflation problem. That comment hadn\u2019t appeared in previous minutes - and was seized upon by groups including the Australia Institute as proof the RBA was finally admitting to a profit-price-spiral, and not the wages one it has been fixated about. There\u2019s definitely a lively debate about the extent companies exploit the cover of rising prices to tack on their own increases. (The New Yorker has a compelling piece on one US-based academic, Isabella Weber, who caused a stir by calling for price controls to limit impacts.) Expect more on this issue to come. It\u2019s worth noting, though, the RBA in same paragraph it cited the price indexing by companies also said a similar practice may be taking place for workers. \u201c[RBA board members] discussed the possibility of implicit indexation of wages to past high inflation and the potential for this to become widespread,\u201d the minutes notes. So it was the two combined - wages and company prices - that were creating \u201can increased risk that high inflation would be persistent, which would make it more difficult to keep the economy on the narrow path\u201d. We\u2019re not sure from the minutes what relative weight the board gave to these two \u201cdevelopments\u201d, but it\u2019s worth trying to understand the bank\u2019s thinking, and what it might do next. The dollar, meanwhile, has drifted even lower, losing about half a US cent after the RBA minutes\u2019 release. Rate cuts in China may also be contributing to that slide as investors start fretting more about the economic health of Australia\u2019s largest customer. This is about doing things differently Barnaby Joyce has a point of order on relevance: The question, that was no reflection on the minister, we hold the minister in high regard \u2026 these questions are going to the workings of people who were on her working group and how this voice will work and I asked the minister to be relevant. Paul Karp, who earlier heard Michael Sukkar yell out \u201csack him\u201d in regards to Thomas Mayo, says Sukkar can be heard saying \u201cit\u2019s about him, not about you\u201d. Tony Burke steps up to say, given the question was borderline, the precedent is to allow a bit more room in the answer. Burney returns to the question: To finish my answer, can I just say this? If anyone wants to have a discussion with me about this issue, I have been available. There is no way I can see where you have not conducted myself appropriately and respectfully. And at the end of the day, at the end of the day, this is about doing things differently so that we can move the dial on a national shame in this country. We are still going back and forth over whether or not the question is in order and if it is, whether it is Linda Burney\u2019s responsibility. In the end, Milton Dick says it is borderline and allows Burney to answer it. Burney: What we have in this nation is a group of people that are poorer, sicker, more incarcerated and die earlier than anyone else. The voice and referendum is about doing things differently to change those things. It is not about individual statements of people that are involved in this. I am not responsible for what other people say. I will tell you what I am responsible for it. I am responsible for what I say and what I do. And in every step of the way, and every step of the way, I have conducted myself with integrity. I have conducted myself properly. And I have conducted myself with honesty. I have embraced every single person in this parliament if they wish to participate. The working group has provided advice on a number of occasions, including to the leader of the opposition and the then shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs on two occasions. Do not use the ridiculous underhand notions that you are using because... (There are a lot of interjections here and Dick has to restore order after doing some 94A action). And so it goes on Nationals MP Kevin Hogan asks Linda Burney: Yes 23 director Thomas Mayo stated that we need the power of the constitution behind us so we can organise like we\u2019ve never organised before and that we need to keep going to maintain this momentum until we change the system and until we tear down the institutions. Does the minister agree with those statements? Tony Burke is on his feet: This question was framed quite differently than the previous one. This one does not go to the minister \u2018s responsibilities at all. Milton Dick: I\u2019m going to give you another chance to rephrase the question. I need to be clear that the minister is responsible for the working group, not the attorney-general. She is going to seek advice on that point. If she is not responsible for the working group, the question will have to be redirected. Peter Dutton is here to help: It might help you in your ruling to understand as I do the minister for Indigenous Affairs makes the appointment of people including Mr Mayo to the working group. The work is wholly within responsibility of the minister. The minister meets regularly with the working group have provided to support the work group and is funded as I understand by the Minister's department stop the cost of Mr Mayo and the others to travel around the country. On that basis, I put it to you it is within the minister\u2019s possibility. Long way from delivering on infrastructure type projects The crux of Tanya Plibersek\u2019s answer in all of that was: We\u2019re a long way from delivering on the infrastructure type projects. A long way from delivering on the 450 decalitres because so little was achieved under those opposite. About 80% of all water that has been recovered towards the Murray-Darling Basin Plan [took place when] we were last in government and since we have come back to government. We are working very closely with the Murray-Darling Basin state ministers. I am hopeful we will come to a resolution that delivers the plan in full. It is complex to do that because we story starting from a very poor launchpad left to us by those opposite. Sussan Ley interjects again and is formally warned. \u2018Cool it\u2019 Sussan Ley continues to interject as Tanya Plibersek gives her answer prompting Milton Dick to tell her to \u201ccool it\u201d. The chamber very much enjoys this. Independent MP for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie has a question for Tanya Plibersek and asks: Will the Government negotiate the Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2.0 to protect our river and environment? Paul Karp hears Sussan Ley say \u201cwe have a water minister who doesn\u2019t understand water\u2019\u2019 to which Plibersek returns: \u201cNot a lot of irrigators on the Gold Coast\u201d. Questions keep coming to Linda Burney Paul Fletcher jumps into the fray asking Linda Burney: Does the Minister have confidence in Thomas Mayo on the referendum working group when he referred to the powers that be as murderers and sees the voice is the first step towards reparations in conversation? (this is based on an article in the Australian) Tony Burke says it is outside of Burney\u2019s responsibilities, Fletcher says it\u2019s not and Dick allows it. Burney: I will say three things - the voice is about doing things differently. What we have been doing for many decades, despite the best will in the world, has clearly not worked. That is what I underlined yesterday would like expectancy, educational outcomes, housing, and employment. I spoke to an Aboriginal elder this morning, and she spoke about the moral authority that this would give her people. In relation to the issues that the voice is responsible for, I can only make this point. It does not have a capacity to fund anything. The Labor caucus met this morning to discuss the Voice constitutional alteration bill, and the stalled Housing Australia Future Fund bill. (The briefing was later in the afternoon, but with all that has been going on, we have only just got to it) The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, accused the Coalition of \u201copportunism\u201d over the referendum. He said the yes side had \u201ctremendous allies\u201d and the proposition to alter the constitution would make the country better as it was \u201call upside\u201d. Albanese talked down \u201cwild claims\u201d made by the no side, including Coalition senators who used a 4:15am sitting Friday evening into Saturday morning to complain about its impact on a Victorian road. Albanese also took aim at the Greens and Coalition for blocking the $10bn Haff bill. The PM said it would result in less supply, less investment and make the problem worse. He accused them of a \u201cjuvenile student politics approach\u201d. Albanese said that continually deferring a bill is the same as blocking it, and the government is seeking advice on that point. \u2018When they go low, we go higher\u2019 Sussan Ley interjects on relevance and says if Linda Burney can\u2019t answer the question she \u201cshould hand it over\u201d but she can\u2019t complete her sentence before the interjections start up. Milton Dick channels Chandler Bing and rules that Burney could not BE any more relevant and then tells the chamber to stop interjecting. Burney just has one thing to say (borrowing from Michelle Obama) I will say this to the parliament \u2013 when they go low, we go higher The voice will not give advice on parking tickets and other \u2018ridiculous \u2018matters, parliament told Milton Dick calls for order, again, gives everyone a warning to settle down and then asks Sussan Ley to repeat her question, which she does. Linda Burney: I can only repeat what I have already said and that is the voice will make representations that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That the voice will not run programs, it will not deliver funding, and it will not deliver the power of veto. The attorney-general has very clear in his second reading speech about specific matters to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs that treat Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differently to other people in matters relevant to the Australian community. I repeat that. It will deal with matters relevant to the Australian community, including general laws and measures that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am so pleased that the Member for Farrar has such a thorough idea of what those things are. I can tell you what the voice will not be giving advice on, it won\u2019t be giving advice on parking tickets, it won\u2019t be giving advice on changing Australia Day, it will not be giving advice on all of the ridiculous things that this side has come up with\u2026 More tricky voice questions Sussan Ley is back with what is becoming a one MP show \u2018a series of uncomfortable questions\u2019. This round is to Linda Burney: Will the voice be able to make representations to the chief of the defence force on military acquisitions or the location or operation of military base\u2026 There are a lot of interjections, and Milton Dick calls for order. Ley: The prime minister is laughing at me can I repeat the question? More questions on housing fund Amanda Rishworth is the next minister to contribute to the government\u2019s \u2018the housing Australia future fund; why the Greens are the worst ever\u2019 series of monologues. In all of this we still remain unclear on what the government plans to do with its legislation. Voice will have no power of veto Linda Burney goes on to say: Let me be clear, Mr Speaker. There will be no change to how the parliament operates. The voice will not run programs. The voice will not deliver funding. The voice will not have a power of veto. It will address issues that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differently. That\u2019s the Linda Burney version of COME ON. But it won\u2019t be the end of it. Voice not required to comment on every wall, policy or program Back in the federal parliament and Sussan Ley asks Linda Burney: Which policy area ,portfolio or government department would the voice not deal with? That follows yesterdays questions along these same lines. Burney responds in much the same way she did yesterday: In the second reading speech, the attorney-general said the primary function of the voice will be make provisions to the parliament and government about matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It would include matters specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and matters relevant to the Australian community, including general laws or measures which affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differently to other members of the Australian community. The voice will not be required to make a representation on every wall, policy or program. The voice will determine when to make representations by managing its own priorities and allocating its resources in accordance with the priorities of First Nations people. In addition, the provision we are putting to the referendum makes clear that the power of the parliament will not change. Andrews won\u2019t apologise The premier, Daniel Andrews, is now making a ministerial statement. He says he won\u2019t apologise for calling McLeish a half-wit grub in parliament despite withdrawing the comment. He says he was defending Northcote MP, Kat Theophanous, from \u201cattacks\u201d from the opposition: I will not be apologising for doing that ... I defended the member for Northcote, and I always will from your attacks. He\u2019s now spruiking the government\u2019s efforts to recruit extra health workers. \u2018Half-wit grub\u2019 First question of Victoria\u2019s question time today is from Liberal MP Cindy McLeish to the minister for women, Natalie Hutchins. McLeish asks: \u201cToday in Parliament, the premier referred to me as a half-wit grub. Under the Victorian government\u2019s gender equality strategy, all Victorian should be treated with dignity, respect and fairness. Is the premier\u2019s comment appropriate towards a woman in the workplace and in line with this strategy? Hutchins response: I stand by the premier in his commitment to gender equality in this state. This premier has done more for the equality of women than any single premier has done in the past. And I know that he has withdrawn his comment but he was also defending the good member for Northcote by an attack by those opposite. Housing minister Julie Collins is next up to bat the Greens for pushing the housing Australia future fund to October, so let\u2019s look at what is happening in the Victoria parliament for a moment. Why doesn\u2019t the government ban political donations from big contractors, PM is asked Independent MP for Curtin Kate Chaney has one of the crossbench questions and she asks: There is an unhealthy codependency between government contractors and political parties. On average, Australia\u2019s major parties are pocketing $430,000 a year from donations from the big four consultancy firms. In return, they have handed them contracts worth billions, one point for memorabilia last year alone. Will the government follow other OECD countries and ban political donations from significant government contractors? Anthony Albanese takes this one (but you know what he is going to say) (No) Albanese: The fact is what we have done as a government is to employ more public servants in order to reduce the reliance on contractors. That is what we have done. We are addressing these issues. Because what we understand is you have to rebuild the Australian public service. We understand that public service is an honourable profession. Understandably, Chaney has a point of order on relevance, given that her question was about political donations. But the preamble on government projects means Albanese can pivot the question anyway he wants and he does \u2013continuing to talk about the honourable public service and the move to return capability to it and reduce the use of contractors and consultants. Greens care more about retweets than renters, Treasurer says Jim Chalmers is up next in the \u201clet\u2019s slam the Greens over the Haff\u201d merry go round. Also Gen X and up seem very angry about TikTok and social media in general. Chalmers: What the Greens have shown in the Senate is that they care more about retweets than renters. They care more about TikTok than housing stock. When it comes to the crunch, with all of the flurry speeches and the rhetoric in their in this place, when actually came to the crunch, when the Greens had opportunity to work with the Labor government to build more social and affordable homes, or decide with the Coalition which sit opposite, they chose a coalition of cookers. More questions on the economy Michael Sukkar gets the next non government question and asks: Under this government, the cash rate is has risen 11 times from 0.35% to 4.1%. According to analysis from data, it rises further to 4.6%, repentance on the median price house will consume up to half of a typical family\u2019s before tax income. When will the prime minister come clean about the damage that his government is causing our country? So that is our new tagline from the \u2018compassionate team\u2019 that is the Coalition (that is what Peter Dutton told the party room people needed to see them as) After a dig at Angus Taylor not having asked the question, Albanese says: The economic circumstances that we inherited with the largest deficits of the World War II, and $1 trillion of that with little to show for it. Sluggish economic growth, productivity sliding backwards, the highest quarterly rise in inflation this entry was on their watch, 2.1%. Of course, interest rates started rising on their watch, on their watch. What they did when you had the highest inflation growth, of any quarter this entry and interest rates beginning to rise, what their response was to hand out a budget that just splash money everywhere. It made the fiscal situation worse. Indeed, put forward a budget that projected a $78 billion deficit. What we did was turn that around.\u201d It goes on, but you know what he says. Albanese blasts Greens on housing Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on the housing Australia future fund just so he can let loose at the Greens (and he does) Albanese: This isn\u2019t about renters, it is not about peoples in social housing, it is not about people in affordable housing, it is about them. They want the issue, not the outcome. They deal in protest, we focus on progress. They see issues to campaign on, we see challenges to act on. They want to build their profile, we want to build more homes. And I say to the Greens political party, there are more people involved in this venue. Understand who you are saying no to. You are saying no to people who are at risk of homelessness who are veterans, you are saying no to homes for women and children escaping domestic violence, you are saying no to Indigenous Australians in remote communities. Also, you are saying no to those housing groups who stood up before the Senate yesterday, calling for the act to pass. The community housing industry association said yes, you said no. National shelter said yes, you said no. Homelessness in Australia said yes, you said no. Everybody\u2019s home said yes, you said no. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait housing association said yes, you said no. The Master builders association said yes, you said no. It is time, it is time that you put aside this pettiness, put aside the politics and actually voted for more public housing. PM won\u2019t be a Qld fan on Wednesday night Anthony Albanese: I said to the leader of the opposition, you are the leader, you can get more than one question one day. Maybe next time divide it up and try not to mix energy policy, first-nations policy, constitutional change and everything else that is included, everything that was included in that. I am asked by the leader of the ppposition, he is a Queenslander. I am a fan of Queensland, Mr speaker, but I have to say to you, tomorrow night is not one of them. Tomorrow night is not one of them and I hope that NSW goes well. He then runs through a best of \u2013 power prices, the voice and help for pensioners. There is no messing about today \u2013 we are straight into it. Peter Dutton asks: Before the last election the prime minister said \u2018I won\u2019t run from responsibility. I would treat every crisis is a chance to blame someone else. I will shell up, step up, I will bring people together\u2019. Today, the prime minister refuses to take responsibility for surging power prices which will increase again on 1 July, it also refuses to provide basic detail on this definitive changes to our constitution. When will the prime minister come clean with the damage the government is causing our country?\u201d So, just an easy one then. Anthony Albanese thanks him for the \u201cwide ranging\u201d question \u2013 which means he is going to answer it as he wishes. The Greens treasury spokesperson Nick McKim has seized on a line in the RBA minutes which acknowledged that members (of the RBA board) spoke about \u201csome firms were indexing their prices, implicitly or directly, to past inflation\u201d. McKim said the \u201cRBA has finally admitted that corporations are making inflation worse by pegging price increases to high inflation.\u201d This follows my questioning of Dr Lowe at Senate Estimates about Telstra\u2019s decision to increase bills in line with CPI. Twelve interest rate rises in thirteen months have been the wrong response to the problem of corporate profiteering. The RBA is inflicting needless pain on renters and mortgage holders and is pushing the country towards a recession. And he also wants the government to step in and stop the interest rate rises: It is well past time for the Treasurer to step in and put a ceiling on interest rates.\u201d The government also needs to get on with tax and competition policy reform to rein in corporate profiteering.\u201d Calls for urgent action on rents This is what the NSW Housing minister, Rose Jackson, was responding to: Question time approaching It is MP airing of the grievances/stand up time (90-second statements) which means that question time is almost upon us. It will be the third last question time for almost six weeks. Which means things could go in any direction. Anger boils over after housing fund delay The NSW state Labor housing minister Rose Jackson has let her views on the delay of the Haff bill and \u201cthat Max Chandler-Smith guy\u201d (she means Max Chandler-Mather) be known: NSW cannabis caution scheme in need of reform In the New South Wales parliament, the state government has been urged to reform its cannabis cautioning scheme after findings that it was indirectly biased against Indigenous Australians. The scheme is designed to keep individuals out of the justice system for low-level cannabis offences, instead allowing police to use their discretion to issue cautions and direct recipients to treatment and support. But a report by the state\u2019s crime statistics bureau found cautions were far less likely to be given to Indigenous Australians, who were instead pursued through the courts. The bureau conducted the research following reporting in Guardian Australia. It found the eligibility criteria for cannabis cautions largely explained why they weren\u2019t being used for Indigenous Australians, creating a \u201cconcerning\u201d \u201cindirect bias\u201d against them. Jeremy Buckingham, an upper house member of the Legalise cannabis party, has just moved a motion calling on the government to reform the scheme and recognise: ...that without addressing factors which cause higher levels of Aboriginal involvement in the criminal justice system or amending the strict eligibility criteria, the cannabis cautioning scheme will likely remain inaccessible to a large proportion of Aboriginal people caught in possession of cannabis in New South Wales. Voice described as \u2018worthless\u2019 by Blak Sovereign Movement Returning to Lidia Thorpe\u2019s press conference. The independent senator brought a dozen members of the Blak Sovereign Movement to parliament house, all of whom expressed deep reservations and strong opposition to the proposed Indigenous voice. Including elders from across the nation (Tasmania to the Northern Territory, Western Australia to the ACT), some members of the group described the voice as \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201cthe voice of no choice\u201d. Several of the attendees were among those who joined Thorpe in walking out of the 2017 First Nations constitutional convention that led to the Uluru statement from the heart. Michael Anderson, a Euahlayi elder, laid down a bag of beads and a blanket as an \u201coffering\u201d, critical of Indigenous land dispossession. The land was taken from us for nothing, but we\u2019re not that greedy, so we\u2019re offering a blanket to King Charles and a set of beads to be taken back to England... a gift for the king, we\u2019re taking our land back,\u201d Anderson said. Other elders criticised the voice as \u201cbeads and blankets\u201d, claiming it would not help Aboriginal communities resolve issues around child separation, imprisonment, suicide and deaths in custody. This voice isn\u2019t going to help us,\u201d one woman told the press conference. Fred Hooper, a Murrawarri elder who walked out on the Uluru dialogues, called the voice \u201cmeaningless\u201d. Let them set up a sovereign truth and reconciliation commission right now, put it to parliament right,\u201d he said. Maternity leave recommendations should be adopted in full, union says The government will now consider the recommendations before releasing its response. The public sector union wants to see the recommendations taken up in full. Not just because it will aid the public service \u2013 but because it will help normalise conditions in the private sector as well. Melissa Donnelly, CPSU National Secretary said: We all know that the way Australian families approach caregiving and share parental responsibilities has changed over time, and it is vital that workplace rights and leave provisions keep up with those changes. These review recommendations would mean commonwealth parental leave provisions are better aligned with the realities of modern Australian families. By adopting these recommendations, the Albanese government would deliver commonwealth employees better flexibility to balance their work and family lives in a way that works for their own circumstances.\u201d Public sector union happy with review of maternity leave act The public service maternity leave act review has been released and the public sector union is happy to see some of the recommendations from the review including: 18 weeks of paid parental leave available to both parents; Six weeks additional paid pregnancy leave for the pregnant parent (bringing the total paid leave for a pregnant employee to 24 weeks); Parental leave entitlements to be extended to adoption, and the ability to cover foster care in enterprise agreements; Parental leave that can be used flexibly within 24 months including in single days, blocks or to facilitate part-time working arrangement. Parents may take the leave concurrently or at separate times; Continued access to full parental leave for the pregnant employee in cases of pregnancy loss from 20 weeks\u2019 gestation and one-week paid leave for pregnancy loss where miscarriage occurs between 12 and end of 19 weeks\u2019 gestation in addition to paid leave under the Fair Work Act; Superannuation to be paid on all forms of parental leave; Removal of qualifying service period for employees to access paid pregnancy or parental leave. Here is some more of the Blak Sovereign Movement press conference Senator Lidia Thorpe hosted today in Parliament House: Peter Dutton told a Coalition meeting today that his decision to expel David Van from the Liberal party room should send a \u201cclear signal\u201d Van has denied all allegations against him. He has said he will cooperate with any investigation and is \u201cdistressed\u201d he has not been afforded due process. The Coalition party room met on Tuesday morning, with the party leaders talking up cost-of-living pressures as usual. Dutton told his troops that cost of living should be the number one issue, claiming Labor\u2019s decisions were driving an economic downturn. Nationals leader David Littleproud said the opposition should be focusing on holding the government to account and presenting as a credible alternative ahead of the next election (which he expected within 18 months), criticising the decisions Labor was making. Dutton\u2019s address also urged colleagues to use the coming winter break to talk to their constituents and learn which issues they cared about, saying the opposition needed to present as a compassionate team. On the Van issue, Dutton said it had been a \u201cvery difficult\u201d decision, according to a party spokesperson who briefed media after the meeting. Dutton said that the circumstances of the allegations against Van had made his position inside the party \u201cuntenable\u201d. Van has denied wrongdoing, but has now quit the Liberal party and will sit on the crossbench, but has taken leave this week from parliament. He was critical of the party in a letter to Victorian president Greg Mirabella over the weekend, claiming he had been denied \u201cprocedural fairness\u201d. Contributions from Coalition members to the meeting included concerns about rising rents, people doing it tough, and the \u201cworking poor\u201d. One member was critical of the Housing Australia future fund, Labor\u2019s stalled housing plan, claiming the proposed 30,000 new social homes over five years \u201cwouldn\u2019t make a dent\u201d in the nation\u2019s shortages and issues. The party spokesperson said the party room was comfortable with Dutton\u2019s decision to expel Van. Senator David Van is on leave from parliament this week, but his move to the crossbench has been formalised by the Senate: Most Australians want PwC temporarily banned from getting government work, poll finds The Australia Institute have done some polling and found attitudes around PwC are not exactly positive. Four-in-five Australians (79%) want consulting firm PwC temporarily banned from receiving new government work, including nearly half who back a permanent ban, according to new research from the Australia Institute. Just 2% did not think PwC should be banned from government work, while 19% did not know or were not sure, according to the nationally representative sample of 1002 people between June 6 and 9, 2023. Of those surveyed, 45% thought the ban should be permanent while the remainder backed PwC being banned for at least some period of time, either less than two years (5%), between two and five years (12%), or between five and 10 years (16%). In the Victorian state parliament, Liberal MP Cindy McLeish has asked premier Daniel Andrews to apologise after he called her a \u201chalfwit grub\u201d in parliament. Andrews immediately withdrew the comment, made in parliament on Tuesday afternoon. But McLeish told reporters this was not good enough: I feel those comments were deeply offensive to me. But I probably wasn\u2019t surprised. Because this is a pattern of behavior we continue to see from the premier. A woman should not have to put up with that in the workplace. Opposition leader John Pesutto said the premier has to \u201cchange his behavior or leave the parliament\u201d: The premier needs to apologise to parliament and he needs to apologise to the Victorian people who expect all politicians who are honored with the right to serve in this house to do them the justice they deserve in terms of the very best behaviour. What we saw from the premier in the chamber just a few moments ago was a grudging withdrawal of his statement. He refused to apologise and he only withdrew when he was pressed to do it. So it wasn\u2019t even a genuine withdrawal. The premier has to change his behaviour or leave the parliament frankly. The latest on Labor\u2019s \u2018green wall street\u2019 Here\u2019s a bit more context on what Duniam\u2019s statement means. Labor\u2019s proposed nature repair market, which Tanya Plibersek once likened to a \u201cgreen wall street\u201d, is in trouble after the Coalition backflipped to oppose it and the Greens labelled the bill likely irreparable. The final fate of the bill won\u2019t be decided until after a Senate inquiry reports on 1 August, but the Coalition\u2019s backflip signalled in lower house debate last week sets up another Labor-Greens stoush over environmental legislation with underlying antipathy over the scheme of offsets for nature improvements. In March the Coalition party room resolved to support the bill in principle because it had proposed the same scheme in government, although it decided to seek technical amendments and reserve its final position until after the Senate inquiry. On 27 May the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told Guardian\u2019s Australian Politics podcast the bill was \u201cbasically verbatim our legislation\u201d, saying he was \u201cproud of the fact that it\u2019s stood the test of time, of a changing government\u201d. That\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m profoundly proud of, to have a world first that actually is going to improve our biodiversity on our farms around this country and beyond. But on 13 June, Littleproud said Labor\u2019s bill had \u201cdiverged far too far\u201d from the one the Morrison government introduced in February 2022, claiming it no longer is about \u201crewarding farmers for the stewardship of their land\u201d. Shadow minister says Labor\u2019s proposed biodiversity market will \u2018lead to considerable confusion\u2019 The shadow environment minister Jonathon Duniam has had some things to say about the nature repair market bill: In principle, we support the concept of a national biodiversity market. But Labor has gone too far \u2013 and injected huge complexity, and a range of risks, into their bills. Their approach will inevitably lead to a range of problems, particularly for farmers and other landholders. We always had concerns with the legislation, and intended to use the Senate committee process to fully explore these. As time has progressed, we\u2019ve heard more and more stakeholder dissatisfaction with the legislation \u2013 and it was therefore appropriate not to support it in the House of Representatives. In government, our bill for a biodiversity market was deliberately confined to agricultural land. By contrast, Labor\u2019s bills cover all land tenure and water. That is going to almost inevitably bring more stakeholders, and many different kinds of scenarios, into the marketplace \u2013 and lead to considerable confusion. Lidia Thorpe says Indigenous voice \u2018part of a colonial system that will continue to oppress us\u2019 Senator Lidia Thorpe is holding a press conference with members of the Blak sovereignty movement and has again demanded an audience with the king to discuss sovereignty issues with Australia\u2019s Indigenous people. Thorpe also expands on why she is opposed to the voice. This is about asserting our sovereign status in our country and the fact that we don\u2019t accept any colonial mechanism that will continue to control us which is what the voice ultimately is a part of. It\u2019s part of a colonial system that will continue to oppress us. It has no power, it will be controlled by the parliament. So we are here to say that we don\u2019t accept that. That is not good enough. And that we want to have a conversation with the so-called other sovereign who apparently lives in another country, and apparently he\u2019s named the king. So we want to have a conversation about sovereignty and what happened way back then, that decimated our people, that decimated our land. And that created stolen wealth for themselves. The ICC is a \u2018court of last resort\u2019, Lambie tells Senate Jacqui Lambie tells the Senate: An enormous amount of work has gone into this. I thank all of them for their contribution especially Dr Glenn Kolomeitz, veteran and lawyer. The law of command responsibility is a method of criminal liability where commanders have failed to do their duty. The international criminal court is a court of last resort. It isn\u2019t an easy task to get them to investigate. They can only do this if the state party, in this case Australia, has failed to investigate the high command for their breach of duty. Alexander Downer fought hard to get Australia to sign up to the international criminal court. I\u2019m sure he never considered that we would need the international criminal court because Australia was shielding its own military commanders from their accountability. But that is what has happened. Australia has in fact set up two systems of criminality, one for Australia\u2019s top military commanders, and another for commanders from the rest of the world. Jacqui Lambie tells the Senate: Evidence from multiple sources independent of the Brereton inquiry, including witness testimony before a civil defamation trial, said and I quote, \u2018The leadership knew. This went beyond patrols. This went up the chain\u2019 end quote. Some of these sources confirmed that the leadership knew for years about the allegations of unlawful behaviour, including an SAS patrol commander. The incident was reported all the way up the special forces chain of command. The former patrol commander says he was told by a senior officer that, and I quote, \u2018the regiment is bigger than an individual and the integrity of the regiment must come first. He informed me the regiment will handle this internally.\u2019 End quote. The former SAS patrol commander had one message everyone knew, everyone knew. And still our government is silent. Worse. They put the guy who gave the senior commanders a free pass the top job at a national anti-corruption commission. So this morning, we are taking action. We have filed with the prosecution with the international criminal court in The Hague, an article 15 communication. This asks to look at Australia\u2019s high commanders through the lens of command responsibility. Lambie tells Senate \u2018there will be no more throwing our diggers under the bus\u2019 Here is a bit more from Jacqui Lambie\u2019s Senate speech about the Australian defence force: Well, today I say enough. Enough is enough. There will be no more marking your own homework. There will be no more throwing our diggers under the bus. When the war crimes investigation was formed, Major General B Brereton ruled out investigating senior commanders and the previous government said \u2018oh yes sir, no worries\u2019. And what do you know, this government is following suit. Let\u2019s be quite clear here. The senior commanders have not been examined through the hardcore legal lens they have put our diggers through. When the chief of defence was asked in estimates if his command accountability review was an investigation he admitted that it was not. So I guess it was just another marking your own homework exercise. It seems that those who are most responsible are the least accountable. Rounding that out, Labor senator Anthony Chisholm says pretty much the same thing \u2013 they want a chance to go through the documents before making a decision. So the motion is denied, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the Senate is against what Jacqui Lambie wants to do \u2013 it just wants a chance to go through the documents before ultimately deciding whether they are in the public interest and can be tabled. Liberal senator Simon Birmingham has a similar view to Nick McKim \u2013 he wants to have a look at the documents before making any decisions on whether to support the suspension to table the documents. Birmingham: I would imagine that that if they are public documents and they serve the case that you are seeking to make Senator Lambie then we would be in a position in the next little while to grant leave, but we do just need long enough to actually have a glance at the documents. So we\u2019d have nothing but respect for the passion and focus that you bring to these issues. We don\u2019t always agree. But we certainly respect the approach that you bring and the conviction that you have attached to these matters. So we will not be supporting suspension at this time for the reasons that Senator McKim has outlined. But we certainly will give prompt consideration and indicate that we will come back to you and I would anticipate barring any problems with documents we see being in a position to grant that leave. The One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has stood in support of senator Jacqui Lambie\u2019s motion to table documents (we have not seen the documents, and it doesn\u2019t seem like many in the Senate have so I can\u2019t tell you what is in them). The Greens senator Nick McKim says he just received the \u201chundreds\u201d of pages of documents, but have not had a chance to go through them as yet. So they are not going to support the motion until they see what is in those documents. McKim: Even though we can\u2019t support the suspension, right here, and place it on the record that will engage with Senator Lambie. Now that we\u2019ve received those documents will engage with Senator Lambie and work with her on these issues. \u2018I feel embarrassed that Australia is in this situation,\u2019 Lambie tells Senate Jacqui Lambie continues, telling the Senate: Quite frankly, I feel embarrassed that Australia is in this situation. So I am helping the government today. I am giving you a second chance to get this right and fix this mess. She pleaded with the Senate to let her table documents. It is your turn. You are the government of the day. I want to see what leadership you have. So with a heavy heart once again, I\u2019m asking you to allow me to table these goddamn documents. Because higher command needs to be held responsible. Please allow me to table these documents. Jacqui Lambie has told the Senate that the senior brass in the ADF have not been investigated over the alleged war crimes. She tells the Senate: Let\u2019s be quite clear here. The senior commanders have not been examined through the hardcore legal lens. Lambie says she wants to see that changed: This morning we are taking action. Lambie says she has referred senior commanders to the international criminal court: We have filed the prosecution with \u2026 the international criminal court in The Hague She is asking them to \u201clook at Australia\u2019s High Command is through the lens of command responsibility\u201d. Jacqui Lambie is moving to suspend standing orders in the Senate. She tells the Senate: Yesterday I called on the government to acknowledge and take responsibility for the shocking lack of accountability at the top of our defence force. The government didn\u2019t support my call to admit that we have a problem and we have a massive problem, and I have been asking for a meeting with the minister of defence for months to talk about this, like the chief of the defence force and the top brass. The government is no doubt, hoping this will all just go away. They\u2019re hoping that Australians will forget that when alleged war crimes in Afghanistan were investigated, our senior commanders got a free pass while our diggers were thrown under the bus. Well, we don\u2019t forget. I won\u2019t forget. Lest we forget. There is a culture of cover-up at the highest levels of the Australian defence force. It is the ultimate boys\u2019 club. Ok the bells are ringing and there are just a few minutes before the parliament session begins for the day. Hope you are ready. The early response to the RBA\u2019s minutes is a small drop in the Aussie dollar\u2019s value against the US variety. It\u2019s lost about a fifth of a cent to trade recently at just under 68.3 US cents. We\u2019ll have May CPI numbers next week to give us more of a steer for the RBA board meeting on 4 July. In the meantime, here\u2019s the longer story: The Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to increase the official interest rate in June rather than pause again had been \u201cfinely balanced\u201d, and that further increases would hinge on how developments at home and abroad affect the inflation outlook. This assessment, contained in minutes of the RBA\u2019s 6 June board meeting released just now, may ease some of the expectation that the central bank will hike rates much further in coming months. At the June meeting, the bank lifted the cash rate 25 basis points to 4.1%, the highest level since 2012. The meeting minutes said: In taking the decision to increase interest rates again, [board] members acknowledged the considerable uncertainty regarding the outlook for household spending and the financial stresses facing some households. Members affirmed their determination to return inflation to target and their willingness to do what is necessary to achieve that. The RBA has hoisted interest rates by four percentage points in 12 moves over the past 13 months when it began its rate rise cycle during the May 2022 federal election. Critics have warned that the lagging effects of increases \u2013 banks can take a couple of months to pass changes on to borrowers \u2013 mean that the central bank was at risk of hammering demand too hard to knock inflation down to its preferred 2%-3% annual rate, sending the economy into a hard landing. Since the board meeting, though, the May labour market figures have been released. They showed the jobless rate falling unexpectedly to 3.6% from 3.7% in April, with more than 70,000 extra jobs added, or about four times more than market economists had forecast. The minutes indicate the RBA\u2019s main concern remains whether inflation will prove too persistent and will not slow to 3% by mid-2025 as it wants. Among the reasons for such stickiness in pricing were \u201csome firms were indexing their prices, implicitly or directly, to past inflation\u201d. There was also the possibility that wage increases were also being indexed to past high inflation and the \u201cpotential\u201d was there for such a trend to become widespread. These developments created an increased risk that high inflation would be persistent, which would make it more difficult to keep the economy on the narrow path\u201d sought by the RBA of cooling inflation without stalling the economy. The Aussie dollar was recently trading at 68.5 US cents. If it sinks, it may be because investors have pared back some of their expectations of RBA hawkishness. Let\u2019s see. The Australian Electoral Commission has told politicians to submit their yes and no essays for the Indigenous voice referendum by midnight on 17 July, for inclusion in the official information pamphlet sent out to all homes. The pamphlet, containing persuasive essays written by politicians supporting or opposing the referendum, will be sent out at least a fortnight before referendum day (which we\u2019re expecting in mid-October). The AEC says the brochure will be about 20 pages long, much shorter than previous referendums - because the last one in 1999 contained essays for two questions, and a full copy of the constitution. As we reported overnight, the AEC has written to all politicians giving them technical information on how the essays must be submitted. But the AEC and the law are silent on exactly how the essays should be written, meaning it\u2019ll be up to a process between politicians - with Pauline Hanson, Lidia Thorpe and the Coalition to fight to have their voices heard. \u201cThe AEC\u2019s role in this process is effectively to act as a post box \u2013 it\u2019s now the job of Members and Senators to draft Yes and No cases for us to distribute to each household,\u201d AEC commissioner Tom Rogers said. He said the AEC had \u201cno editorial role\u201d in the essays and would produce them verbatim, meaning they won\u2019t check them for fact or misinformation - and also warned politicians to \u201cbe precise and careful about their language and grammar\u201d. Rogers said the AEC would try to get the pamphlets sent out as soon as possible, but noted they\u2019d have to print about 12.5m copies. The pamphlets will be produced in 34 languages, including First Nations languages, and accessible copies will be reproduced via audio files and large print. Greens huddle to discuss housing and nature repair market bills The Greens party room met on Tuesday, discussing the housing Australia future fund bill, the nature repair bill and the joint standing committee on electoral matters report. On the housing fund, the Greens do not accept that the bill\u2019s delay is the first step in a double dissolution trigger, because the Senate did not fail to pass the bill. They also reject government claims this has resulted in less money for housing, citing the extra $2bn in funding pledged by Labor for social and affordable housing. On the Jscem report, which recommended spending and donation caps, the Greens are wary of Labor cherrypicking electoral reforms to suit their own partisan advantage. We\u2019ll have to wait to see government legislation first. The Greens are now in balance of power on the nature repair bill, after the Coalition backflipped on its earlier support for it. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, explained this in the lower house on 13 June. The bill\u2019s prospects are now extremely dim, because the Greens view it as irreparable. There are 20 odd bills for the Senate to deal with this week, but late sittings are not expected, just a shortlist to get through and truncated debate. The Albanese government has announced another $4.45m for the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, where military factions have been at war for months. The funds will be used to provide immediate life-saving protection and assistance, including food, water and emergency medical supplies, delivered through the International Committee of the Red Cross. The government says that it brings Australia\u2019s contribution to Sudan and related support in neighbouring countries to $10.45m. The Albanese government has announced $6.2m in funding to the Embrace Collective for their Embrace Kids program, which is designed to help children have healthier body image. Anthony Albanese announced the funding following a morning tea with Australian of the Year Taryn Brumfitt who leads the initiative along with international body image expert Dr Zali Yager. Albanese: Any parent with young children or teenagers knows just how much their kids are bombarded with images and expectations of bodies and the way that can impact how their child feels about themselves. Teaching kids to celebrate how amazing their bodies are is a powerful way to dispel some of the negative, harmful body image messages out there. Pauline Hanson pushes for people to prove they are Indigenous Yesterday Pauline Hanson continued her campaign to have an inquiry into \u201cIndigenous identity fraud\u201d with a motion in the Senate, which was supported by the Coalition. Hanson wants people to prove they are Indigenous. One of her issues seems to be the growing number of Indigenous people being recorded in the census: If you go back to the 1971 first census, there were just about 116,000 people who claimed to be Aboriginal on that census; by 1996, it was 265,000; and, in 2016, you were looking at around 250,000. Yet, in the last one, it had increased, from that time, 25.2 per cent, and the rest of the population had increased only eight per cent with immigration. So a lot of people are ticking the box. This is based on old, inflammatory attitudes that Indigenous people are given a golden ticket in this country \u2013 when we know the opposite is true. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage is personal. There is no requirement to enrol or carry a letter of confirmation as an Indigenous person in this country for a reason. And the reason is because white Australia did almost everything it could to wipe out Indigenous people from colonisation and beyond. Thousands of Indigenous children were stolen from their families and raised white and in many cases it was not until decades later that they, or their children, were able to recognise their Indigenous heritage. But it is also not true to say that anyone can claim to be Indigenous and then apply for the grants and things Hanson is so worried about. Government agencies and community organisations usually use a three-part \u201cworking definition\u201d for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage. These are: being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent identifying as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person being accepted as such by the community in which you live, or formerly lived. Royal Australian College of GPs urges better healthcare for refugees The Royal Australian College of GPs wants to see better healthcare support provided to refugees in Australia. 20 June is World Refugee Day and the RACGP has released an updated position \u2013 Health and wellbeing of people from refugee backgrounds and people seeking asylum must be a priority \u2013 which calls for: equitable access to healthcare, including full access to both federally and state funded health services for all people from a refugee background, including those seeking asylum support of the UNHCR\u2019s global strategy to end the detention of asylum-seekers and refugees and recognition that immigration detention and prolonged visa uncertainty causes physical and mental harm to people seeking asylum an evidence based national strategy to improve the delivery of healthcare to refugees and people seeking asylum across Australia. RACGP president Dr Nicole Higgins said it\u2019s about equitable healthcare: It\u2019s essential that refugees and people seeking asylum have access to high-quality healthcare. People from refugee backgrounds often have higher rates of long-term physical and mental health issues compared with other migrants, due in large part to hardships experienced during the refugee journey and the stressors of resettlement. People seeking asylum face additional stressors. There is significant evidence that demonstrates the adverse mental and physical health impacts of immigration detention and prolonged visa uncertainty on people seeking asylum. The RACGP endorses the UNHCR\u2019s global strategy to end the detention of asylum-seekers and refugees and calls for timely permanent settlement solutions for all those seeking asylum. ACF wants northern Australia infrastructure bill changed to prevent fossil fuel funding The Australian Conservation Foundation wants the Albanese government to amend the northern Australia infrastructure bill so it can\u2019t be used to finance fossil fuel projects. The ACF\u2019s Gavan McFadzean said: A financially and environmentally responsible government would stop handing out public money to the industries that are most responsible for harming our climate. Public money should be invested in projects that enable Australian communities to enjoy a safe climate future, not projects that facilitate more climate damage. The parties are beginning to finish up from their party room meetings. We will bring you those briefings very soon. Guardian readers will know that the transition from fossil fuels to renewables isn\u2019t going very smoothly. Yes, it\u2019s good to see 3.5m homes with solar panels and news that investments \u2013 at least as proposed \u2013 for new wind and solar farms are clogging the planning pipelines. However, the industry has been warning for a while that the pace of actual projects getting financial signoff has been slowing. Major projects, such as Snowy Hydro\u2019s 2.0 venture, are also struggling (as we covered at length here over the weekend). Add Daniel Westerman, head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, to the growing chorus of concern. This morning, he\u2019s telling an energy conference that there\u2019s an \u201curgent\u201d need for more investment. Coal-fired power stations now provide about 60% of the grid\u2019s power, and a third of that capacity is scheduled to exit by 2030. AEMO is modelling an exit rate at twice that as possible. (Some states, such as NSW, have been told to consider what the grid would look like with all coal gone by then in the state.) Anyway, for more on Westerman\u2019s worries, here\u2019s our article that\u2019s just gone up: Reserve Bank minutes from 6 June meeting to be released Later this morning we\u2019ll get the minutes from the Reserve Bank\u2019s 6 June meeting (two weeks seems a while to type them up). As always, we\u2019ll be looking to see what\u2019s different from the pared-down version that we got when the RBA lifted the official interest rate for the 12th time in 13 months. Ahead of the meeting, investors were betting that another 25 basis-point increase at the 4 July board gathering was about a 50:50 chance. We note also this morning that the weekly ANZ/Roy Morgan survey has consumer sentiment sinking again to a fresh three-year low. \u201cTime to buy a major household item\u201d jumped 5.1pts, though, partially offsetting the 7.6pt fall the week before \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t all bad news. Weekly inflation expectations were unchanged at 5.5%, but the rolling four-week measure was slightly higher: One thing the minutes won\u2019t capture is the jump in the Australian dollar of late, at least against the greenback. This morning, an Aussie dollar was worth US68.5c. Such levels haven\u2019t been consistently held since February, and might help ease inflation pressures since imports get a bit cheaper \u2013 assuming the dollar can hold on to the recent gains. Hints of more RBA rate rises to come will help that. The Australian of the year, Taryn Brumfitt is in Canberra today and will have morning tea with the prime minister and a few other members of cabinet. It is just a picfac though \u2013 which is an Australian press term for photos only (no press conference) The Greens say the government could work with the national cabinet in much the same way as they did for the energy intervention to get rent freezes through. The government said it had put renters\u2019 rights on the national cabinet agenda in April \u2013so now the Greens want to wait to see what is put forward by national cabinet before it moves on the Haff. Can the government do anything on rentals? Julie Collins: When it comes to rentals, as I said, we\u2019re adding to supply. We\u2019re dealing with commonwealth rent assistance. What the Greens are asking, we\u2019ve been very clear about. The commonwealth government does not have the power to do what they are asking. We\u2019ve also been very clear that all of the experts and all of the evidence says what they want won\u2019t actually work and will increase rents, not decrease rents. And of course, then you\u2019ve got the Liberal party who are trying to conflate where we are, and they would have had more migrants in Australia today than our government does. And we\u2019re getting on with the job. For the first time in more than a decade you\u2019ve got a federal government at the table when it comes to housing, working with other tiers of government, something we didn\u2019t see from the other side. Julie Collins unclear on whether Labor will bring back housing future fund legislation On the Nine network this morning, housing minister Julie Collins was no clearer on whether Labor would seek to bring back the housing future fund legislation in the future. We\u2019ve compromised all the way along. We\u2019ve added to our policies all the way along. We are focused on delivering homes on the ground. There are homes under construction today because of decisions that we have made as a government. What we have not seen is the same compromise from the Liberal and National party, who said that they supported future funds when they were in government. They now, apparently in opposition, no longer support them. And, of course, the Greens party, who block more houses than they ever actually build, whether it be at local, state or federal government level, they just keep blocking. Clearly, they don\u2019t want to compromise. What we want to do is get on with the job, and you saw us doing that with our announcement just last weekend. And we\u2019ll continue to get on with the job because, as you say, those Australians that are finding it difficult to get a safe, affordable place to call home are relying on us to get the job done. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do each and every day get more houses on the ground. We have a supply issue in Australia. We need more houses and we will get on with the job of building them. Universities Australia praises partnership with India The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, has told a conference in India the federal government is \u201curging\u201d Australian universities to continue scaling up surging Indian enrolments as the partnership enters a \u201cgolden era\u201d. Jackson is in India this week to deliver the keynote address at the 2023 Universities20 Conference alongside the Indian education minister, Dharmendra Pradhan. She told the conference education and research was \u201cat the heart\u201d of the two nation\u2019s strategic relationship. Minister Pradhan\u2019s visit to Australia last year clearly reinforced India\u2019s desire for this collaboration. And it has proven to be a pivotal point in the further strengthening of our relationship. I had the privilege of speaking directly with Prime Minister Modi in Sydney \u2026 and was very pleased to hear his strong emphasis on education as a fundamental economic and social connector between Australia and India. Jackson said Australia could \u201ccertainly help\u201d India achieve its ambition to educate 500 million students by 2035. This is Jackson\u2019s second visit to India this year, the first alongside the education minister, Jason Clare, who signed a mutual recognition agreement with his counterpart. A string of universities have jumped at the opportunity for collaboration, with Deakin University and the University of Wollongong announcing they\u2019d be the first institutions to establish campuses in India. The opportunity for Indian students to attend university in Australia will never not be there. This scale of interest is unprecedented, and we expect that it will keep growing. Our governments are urging us to do this. Medibank says it uses MoveIt to share information Yesterday we brought you the news that embattled consultancy firm PwC had been caught up in the hack of third-party file transfer company MoveIt, and now we can confirm that health insurer Medibank has also been caught up just months after its own cyberattack led to the information of millions of customers being stolen and posted on the dark web. A spokesperson said: We were advised by the vendor Ipswitch about some vulnerabilities discovered in MoveIt \u2013 a software system we use to share information with external parties \u2013 and have promptly applied all the vendor\u2019s recommended security patches. We continue to investigate and work closely with the vendor, and at this stage we are not aware of any of our customers\u2019 data being compromised. Medibank systems have not been impacted by the Moveit cyberattack. Still on the topic of the Victoria state conference, where Labor members voted for several housing initiatives include a levy on short-stay rentals, Andrews says \u201ceverything\u2019s on the table\u201d to improve affordability: The government is actively considering every element of our housing supply policy settings, planning all the way through to how we better partner with the private sector to get more and more housing built. Zoning and all of those issues are an important part of that. The short-term rental accommodation to Airbnb type issues, that\u2019s also on the table. He says the government\u2019s housing statement, to be released in the coming months will \u201crepresent one of the most profound shake-ups of all the settings that determine how much supply we have\u201d: Because that\u2019s what determines price, equity and decency, as well as creating a lot of jobs. I think it\u2019ll be one of the biggest shake-ups in that policy area for many, many decades. Daniel Andrews says he would not have supported Victorian Labor motion calling on Albanese government to recognise Palestinian state Daniel Andrews says he wouldn\u2019t have voted for a motion that passed Labor\u2019s state conference at the weekend, which called on the Albanese government to recognise a Palestinian state within the term of this parliament. He says he\u2019s a supporter of Israel, describing it as the \u201conly place in the region where women are treated equally\u201d: My position on Israel has been very, very consistent and clear. It\u2019s not always popular but it\u2019s my view and I won\u2019t change. Andrews also sought to distance himself from his Socialist Left faction, which moved the motion on Sunday: I haven\u2019t been to a faction meeting in 13 years and I\u2019m quite pleased about that to be honest. Victorian premier says Paul Denyer parole application not \u2018well handled\u2019 Back to Victoria for a moment and Daniel Andrews admits the parole application for serial killer Paul Denyer \u201chas not been particularly well handled\u201d and says the government is looking at changes to the law, as well as more support for families of victims of crime. While he said he has confidence in the Adult Parole Board, which last month denied Denyer\u2019s bid for release, he said families should have been supported better through the process: This is an incredibly difficult time and whilst I don\u2019t want to go into great detail about this particular matter, because it\u2019s not appropriate to speak in detail about what the parole board is done ... We don\u2019t want a situation where families who have been through unimaginable tragedy where there\u2019s really very little prospect of any prospect that the person is going to get out, laying awake at night, thinking that that person is going to be freed. Now that decision is not made until it\u2019s made but you can support people, you can inform people, you can try and be there for people and the system has had 30 years to get ready for this day. Sadly I don\u2019t think those families have been as well supported as they should have been. I\u2019ll take responsibility for that. And we\u2019re going to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen again. So the system needs to better engage with those families. Andrews said the government was looking at \u201cfurther constraining\u201d parole applications for people who have committed multiple murders: I think we can sensibly further limit the options that they have \u2013 not to be applying to the parole board every five minutes and potentially only the one application if you have refused to involve yourself in the rehabilitation programs that we think are central to you demonstrating that you are no longer at ongoing risk to Victorians. After the Greens successfully moved to shelve the housing Australia future fund debate in the Senate until 16 October, the government responded that it considered the bill to have failed \u2013 the first step in setting up a double dissolution trigger (not a guarantee one would happen \u2013 the government would have to pull it). The housing minister, Julie Collins, was asked about the future of the bill and said: We\u2019re looking at what we\u2019re doing, what options are available to us. You saw that last weekend when we announced our $2bn Social Housing Accelerator. What we want to do is get on with building homes. That\u2019s what the Australian people expect us to do, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Which doesn\u2019t exactly make anything clearer. Victorian premier says he has no plans to make cannabis legal for personal use Daniel Andrews says he has no plans to make cannabis legal for personal use, despite a coordinated push from Legalise Cannabis MPs in three states launched today: My position is the law as it stands now. He says work is ongoing to see if there is a way to allow medicinal cannabis users to safely drive: It\u2019s very, very difficult to reconcile both of those, so there\u2019s some work going on in that space, which is critically important, but I don\u2019t want barriers to people getting the care and treatment that they need and potentially getting the benefits from. Beyond that, as I said, sorry to disappoint you but I\u2019m not here to make any announcements about drug policy today. While we\u2019re on the topic of pandemics, Andrews has denied a report in the Sunday Age that his government is cutting future funding for the local public health units established during Covid-19: We\u2019re funding them at 60% of their Covid levels. That is a very substantial investment and they\u2019ll do important work not just with infectious diseases but with broader issues of public health, whether that be a Legionnaires outbreak, all the way through to all the way through to potentially more serious matters. So whilst this was stood up as a response to a one in 100 year event, their future is secure. Their funding is ongoing. But of course as with many things, the funding is not at pandemic levels because we are not in a pandemic anymore. Prof Margaret Hellard, from the Burnet Institute, says once the project is complete, its researchers will all be under the same roof for the first time: It will also provide a really important opportunity for clever young scientists who in my view to do what they do best \u2013 to be curious, to be innovative, and to be brave in their science. Having buildings like this quality labs and quality spaces both wet and dry labs allows that to happen. It\u2019ll help us quickly respond and fight the next pandemic ... But we can do better and pursue these things. It\u2019ll help us to end HIV, eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, to stop TB and malaria, and improve maternal and child health, both in our country and globally. The minister for medical research, Mary-Anne Thomas, is now telling reporters a bit more about the features of the facility: Some of the features of this magnificent building include a robotic biobank, which will enable the storage of biomedical samples, the Human Challenge Unit, which is one that I think is particularly exciting, and it\u2019s exactly what it suggests. It\u2019s about ensuring that we try in an ethical and safe way to really speed up that process ... from discovery to research to clinical trials ... and of course, high containment facilities because we\u2019re talking about live viruses here. And hats off to our scientists who work each day to examine, identify, and indeed, to code these viruses that are in our community. Daniel Andrews says Australian Institute of Infectious Diseases will be complete by 2027 The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is out in Carlton this morning, where the Australian Institute of Infectious Diseases will be built. The government first announced the facility during the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and has contributed $400m to its construction. About $250m has also been contributed by the University of Melbourne, the Doherty Institute and the Burnet Institute. Today, they\u2019re showing off renders of what the facility will look like. Andrews says the project will begin construction next year and will be complete by 2027, when it will house 1,000 scientists, students and researchers: We are fundamentally obliged to make the most of very challenging circumstances we all got through because we had a faith in science, we had a faith in each other and we were compassionate ... We really were so well served by that sense of connection between people that have never met each other, let alone a medical research and a public health community. That that really is a point of pride for not just our state but our nation and indeed beyond. So it just makes sense to double down and invest and make the most of all of those skills. And Josh Butler and Lorena Allam have looked at some of the tensions around who gets to contribute to the \u201cno\u201d pamphlet: Pauline Hanson and Lidia Thorpe will jockey with Coalition members to have their opinions on the Indigenous voice detailed in a 2,000-word essay from the no campaign, as politicians navigate an obscure process to write a pamphlet which will be sent to all homes for the referendum. The Australian Electoral Commission is writing to all politicians to give guidance on the essays, but tensions are already emerging as members and senators have to decide among themselves how to navigate competing ideas and write one argument for each side. If you haven\u2019t had a moment to read Lisa Cox\u2019s latest investigation, I hope you can make time for it soon: It is Tuesday, which means it is party room/caucus meeting day. Which means that things won\u2019t kick off in the parliament until midday. It is the last party room meeting until 31 July, so expect a bit more of a rah-rah than usual from the leaders. Aunty Pat Anderson, an Alyawarre woman and co-chair of Uluru Dialogue, was asked on ABC News Breakfast what she would say to people who want more detail on what the voice would look like (the parliament will decide that, if the referendum is successful). Anderson said: You know, in this kind of democracy, the one we have here in Australia, we vote on matters of principle. We have never gone to a referenda with all of the details \u2026 whatever was being voted upon, we go on matters of principle. There are nine principles that are out there for everybody to look at, and all of the details of how it\u2019s all going to work will be done after the \u201cyes\u201d vote. However, between now and when we do go to the polls, there will be enough information for the general public to make up their minds. As I said earlier, to make an informed decision. That\u2019s the task that we all have now. For the general public to inform themselves and for people like myself and everybody that supports us to talk to their members of their family, extended family, talk to their work colleagues, and all of their networks. So we all got a lot of work to do and a lot of talking to do over this next few months, but I believe there\u2019s time. But we have to, like, start now. Kerrynne Liddle says Indigenous voice \u2018untested\u2019 Liberal senator and Arrente woman Kerrynne Liddle was asked to explain on ABC radio RN Breakfast why, if she agrees with the need to Close the Gap and for more work to be done improving the lives of Indigenous people, she is against having something like the Indigenous voice enshrined in the constitution. Liddle said: I fail to understand why it needs to be in the constitution \u2026 If it\u2019s in the constitution, it\u2019s going to be there forever. What I\u2019m saying here is, this is untested, there is nothing like this anywhere else. And the proposition here is a no compromise position to put this into the constitution. And what if it doesn\u2019t work? We can\u2019t just simply take it out. We can\u2019t. It\u2019s not such an easy process to just modify. It\u2019s important that we actually had much more detail. Albanese says he\u2019d be \u2018comfortable\u2019 if David Van never returned to Senate Anthony Albanese is then asked about the past week of parliament and says: I\u2019m very concerned that if you are a woman wanting to come forward because of a sexual violence issue then you might be more reluctant. If you look at the coverage that\u2019s occurred. There\u2019s been something like 13% of sexual assaults in Australia reported to police and and that is a terrible figure. Asked if he understands why women don\u2019t come forward with their allegations, Albanese says: I think some of the commentary and looking at personal text messages and other stuff that\u2019s going on has been really regrettable \u2026 as well as not being legal, some of it as well. I think that people need to be treated with respect. Every woman should feel safe at work. And it\u2019s as simple as that. And our workplace hasn\u2019t been good enough in the past. We know because of the accusation that was made in 2019, about an alleged sexual assault in a minister\u2019s office, but also the revelations that ended up coming out of last week about allegations about the behaviour of one of the Victorian senators. David Van has denied all the allegations raised against him. Asked if he was aware of any rumours, Albanese says: No. I\u2019d never heard of him really. And I\u2019d be very comfortable if he never returned to the Senate. Van quit the Liberal party on Saturday and has taken leave from parliament this week. In a statement released on Saturday he has said he will cooperate with any investigation and said: I am utterly shattered by the events of the past days and stunned that my good reputation can be so wantonly savaged without due process or accountability. Voice referendum to be held between October and December: PM On the referendum date, Anthony Albanese says it will be \u201csometime between October and December\u201d. It is most likely going to be in October. But away from the AFL grand final Albanese says: People are a bit distracted on that day. But we will announce it plenty of time in advance. Albanese says Indigenous voice a \u2018sensible reform\u2019 So far the Anthony Albanese \u201cinterview\u201d on FM radio Melbourne KIIS FM is talking about how cold Melbourne is. (I would like to state for the record that I can not feel my fingers and my cats are doing their best to burrow under my skin it is so cold in Canberra.) The chat moves on to the referendum. Albanese says: It\u2019s always easier to get a no vote than it is to get a yes vote in a referendum \u2013 history tells us that that is the case. I think it\u2019s something like eight successful out of 48 so that\u2019s not a great strike right? But this is such a sensible reform. This is about recognising first Australians in our constitution. We should be proud of the fact that we share this continent with the oldest continuous culture on earth. And secondly, it\u2019s about giving them a voice on matters that affect them. So we know that if you\u2019re a young Indigenous person, you are more likely to go to jail than to university. That\u2019s not good. \u2026 I think there\u2019s an eight year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia, there are health gaps, there are infant mortality gaps, their housing gap. Independent Kooyong MP Dr Monique Ryan said the crossbench was distressed by the past week in parliament: I can speak for other members of the crossbench because we talk to each other after each question time because we found it distressing, and we wanted to stand to our feet and say that we felt it was conduct unbecoming parliament, and I think if we learn nothing from this, we have to decide as a society whether we want our parliament really to be dragging people who have gone through really difficult experiences through that sort of experience again. It wasn\u2019t ideal. It was \u2013 I actually felt it was shameful. Bridget McKenzie says Gallagher faced \u2018legitimate questions\u2019 Bridget McKenzie said there were legitimate questions to ask (in the Senate, the Coalition was still questioning Katy Gallagher yesterday) I think there were serious questions that needed to be asked in the face of a minister misleading the Senate and we asked questions about who knew what, when, what was done with that information \u2013 all very legitimate questions, and this issue, when it was last in parliament was pursued ferociously by the then opposition and I think we were very careful as we could be with our tone, but to also ask legitimate questions of the government and their ministers, not just around who knew what when but also around the swiftness of the compensation payment, why some evidence in that process was explicitly excluded, and that, you know, the substantial nature of it \u2013 all legitimate questions and the right thing to do. The Liberal senators Anne Rushton and Linda Reynolds were told two years ago what Gallagher knew and when \u2013 because she told them in a break from the Senate estimates hearing which the Coalition is using as the foundation of the \u201cGallagher misled parliament\u201d attacks. McKenzie said the Coalition was \u201cvery careful to make sure our tone was correct and that we were actually pursuing the issue, not the person\u201d. Asked if she could go back in time, knowing how the week played out, if she would play the week the same way, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie said: Yeah, absolutely. Bill Shorten says parliament created a \u2018depressing week for Australians\u2019 The NDIS minister Bill Shorten was a guest on Q&amp;A last night, where the panellists were asked about what was seen coming out of the parliament in the last week: I\u2019m afraid it was worse than shambolic. It was toxic. It is not how a lot of parliament is, but it certainly is not how it should be, so I suspect 100% of the MPs will probably realise when they got on the plane and left the building that it had been a really depressing week for Australians. There is a lot of good work going on, but a week like that and some of the actions overshadowed what a lot of us are trying to do every day, which is make Australia a better place and help Australians. Anthony Albanese is kicking of his media day with an FM radio show \u2013 this time KIIS FM. That\u2019s coming up in the next 30 minutes or so. Call for Parliament House to ban single-use coffee cups Hold onto your lattes: a Labor MP has called for Parliament House to ban single-use coffee cups, calling for a major change to the fuel that keeps federal politics running. We hope you haven\u2019t spit your soy flat white all over your phone or keyboard in shock, but Bennelong MP Jerome Laxale wants to see the heart of our democracy phase out single-use cups and instead transition to keep cups or mugs for all. Last night, the Parliamentary Friends of Waste and Recycling (yes, it exists) held an event for Plastic Free July. With contributions from environment minister Tanya Plibersek, Labor MP Libby Coker and Liberal Bridget Archer, a bunch of MPs signed a pledge to avoid plastic through next month, and will lobby more of their colleagues to do the same. Rebecca Prince-Ruiz, Plastic Free July\u2019s founder, said the shift couldn\u2019t just be to recyclable or compostable cups, because there aren\u2019t the facilities to manage them all - instead, she called for a greater uptake of reusable cups. But Laxale went even further in his idea, saying parliament should wind back single-use cups altogether. Parliament House has two main coffee sellers: the independent Aussies cafe, and venues run by the Department of Parliamentary Services. The first-term MP has done some digging, and says the DPS-run coffee outlets had sold some 280,000 coffees in this financial year \u2013 with about 252,000 of those being in single-use cups. \u201cIt\u2019s something I noticed when I became an MP. It\u2019s just a monumental amount, in an environment which a closed-loop system, or just using mugs, would work,\u201d Laxale said. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the bleary-eyed MPs and staffers in coffee queues this week to monitor the takeup of the idea. A very big thank you to Martin on this chilly Canberra morning \u2013 temperatures are currently below zero, which will make for some frosty politicians. Thank you for joining us on the third last sitting day before the big winter break. You have Paul Karp and Josh Taylor in Canberra and Amy Remeikis on the blog. It\u2019s a three-coffee morning. And if you have cats, bring them closer. Ready? Mortgage holders will be hoping for signs the Reserve Bank is at the end of its interest rate hiking cycle when the minutes from the last board meeting are released today, AAP reports. Australia\u2019s central bank opted to hike by 25 basis points at the June meeting, sending the cash rate above 4%. The RBA has lifted the official cash rate 12 times since May last year, choosing to hike at every meeting except April. The board will next meet on 4 July. NAB markets economist Taylor Nugent said the June rise was likely a close call and exactly how finely balanced the decision was would be telling. He hoped the minutes would reveal if the Reserve Bank board was really reacting to the incoming data on a month-by-month basis, or if it had instead lost confidence in returning inflation to target more gradually than some of its international peers. NAB economists are anticipating two more 0.25 percentage point increases to take the cash rate to 4.6%, with July and August the most likely months. Two senior RBA officials will also make public appearances on Tuesday. Deputy governor Michele Bullock is giving a speech about \u201cachieving full employment\u201d at an Ai Group event in Newcastle, and assistant governor Chris Kent is speaking on a panel on the ISDA/AFMA Derivatives Forum in Sydney. The government will today announce it is increasing Australia\u2019s humanitarian visa program, as part of Labor\u2019s election commitment to double the intake over time. There are currently 17,875 places in the 2022\u201323 humanitarian program, after the former government slashed the intake to 13,750, despite skyrocketing rates of displacement globally. The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, who will provide an update on the exact amount they are increasing the intake by later today, said that the government was working on delivering a humanitarian program that takes into account the \u201centire resettlement journey\u201d. With more people displaced worldwide than ever before, the Albanese Labor government is stepping up to play its part in the global resettlement effort in a considered and responsible way. We\u2019re delivering a humanitarian program that considers a refugee\u2019s entire resettlement journey, ensuring refugees can rebuild their lives with certainty and participate fully in Australian society. The minister will also be providing an update on how many resolution of status visas are being issued to temporary protection visa holders, with the government saying it is on track to convert most of them in 12 months. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day in politics and beyond. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the best overnight lines before my colleague Amy Remeikis comes along. Campaigners and lawyers have accused the authorities in Northern Territory of a \u201ctremendous injustice\u201d in allowing the major expansion of the gas industry in the Beetaloo Basin, a large area between Katherine and Tennant Creek that contains vast reserves of shale gas. In our top story this morning, Lisa Cox has been talking to people who feel let down by the Northern Land Council and are now appealing for help from the \u201cwhole world\u201d. A former council member, Janet Gregory, says she feels responsible for allowing the fracking agreements to go ahead but is now fully involved in the fight. The Australian government must reform the immigration system to get more migrants into suitable jobs as 286 occupations face shortages, according to new report from a consortium of migrant advocacy and service groups. Their suggested solutions include reviewing the right to work for people on temporary visas and reforming English language requirements. Also today there\u2019s an announcement due on Australia\u2019s new (higher) humanitarian visa intake. The Victorian government will consider introducing rent caps and new taxes on owners of Airbnbs and vacant properties to help ease pressure on renters, under a deal struck with the Greens in exchange for their support for the state budget. In an exclusive story, Benita Kolovos says the Greens extracted the concessions, which they hope will begin to curb the rapid rise in rental prices in Melbourne. And we\u2019re expecting the minutes from the most recent Reserve Bank meeting, to understand better why it put up interest rates yet again, and what the chances are of more pain for mortgage payers to come."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331962", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/20/30-acts-to-see-at-glastonbury-ragga-metal-y2k-rb-and-folk-legends-", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ragga-metal, Y2K R&B and folk legends: 30 acts to see at Glastonbury", "lead": "From big names including Arctic Monkeys and Kelis to must-see cult acts such as Yaya Bey and Vigro Deep, our music editors pick out the essential sets", "author": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas and Laura Snapes", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:46:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173128", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e1fb39379914d83077d5a6a65bfe660e1ca47fd1/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "Thursday Jyoty and friends Lonely Hearts Club, 19.30 A welcome addition to the lineup of stages last year was Lonely Hearts Club, which resembled a Miami beachfront art deco cinema after roughly four centuries of post-apocalyptic neglect, and hosted a dizzying array of high-speed dance. Just down the road from a stellar lineup at the new Levels stage \u2013 described by Glastonbury as an \u201copen air nightclub inspired by the crossover of architecture, lighting, and experimental musical artforms\u201d \u2013 this is the place to be for an unwise quaffing of your entire festival\u2019s booze rations on Thursday night, featuring a squadron of DJs including Lil Silva and Sbtrkt curated and hosted by Jyoty, who herself flings pop and rap a capellas through speed garage, dancehall and a huge swathe of the genre map. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Skindred Truth stage, 23.45 It\u2019s quite a rocking Glastonbury what with GN\u2019R, Royal Blood, M\u00e5neskin and \u2013 if rumours are to be believed \u2013 Foo Fighters on the Pyramid stage plus plenty more further down the bill, especially over at the annual Earache takeover in Shangri-La: Ho99o9, Alt Blk Era, Empire State Bastard (a supergroup with Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil) and most impressively Skindred, who after 25 years in the game are still one of the most admired on the heavy live circuit. Their blend of ragga with metal is the kind of thing that makes hipsters implode with snobbery but will electrify everyone else. BBT * * * Friday Star Feminine Band West Holts, 11.30 This group of teenage girls from Benin should be kept on a retainer by the festival and deployed throughout the weekend whenever gloom descends or morale flags. Their joie de vivre is potent and their lilting but polyrhythmic, danceable songs, filled with highlife guitars, meandering synths and massed vocals, are the kind that Glastonbury crowds adore. BBT Alabaster DePlume Park stage, 12.45 For when you\u2019ve accidentally overdone it on Thursday night, here\u2019s jazz shaman Alabaster DePlume ready with his soothing saxophone hum and reassuring mantras on the festival\u2019s prettiest stage. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you\u2019re precious\u201d is precisely what you need to hear when nursing a self-loathing-laced cider hangover. That said, the Manchester beatnik\u2019s recent shows have tended away from the spiritual and more towards spikier, more invigorating tones. Laura Snapes Yaya Bey West Holts, 13.00 Stick around after Star Feminine Band for this Brooklyn singer-songwriter who recorded one of 2022\u2019s best albums, Remember Your North Star: one second she\u2019s announcing her greatness, the next cringing at some faux pas or frailty, making for songs that have the comic beats and breezy appeal of a standup comedian. Spanning neo-soul, reggae, deep house, hip-hop and jazz with sun-coaxing melody in each mode, hers will be the kind of set that draws in every passerby. BBT Nemzzz Lonely Hearts Club, 19.00 Alongside the dance at Lonely Hearts Club is a crop of excellent semi-underground rap across the weekend, including Earl Sweatshirt, Kenny Beats, Strandz, Jeshi, Meekz, Finn Foxell and Nemzzz. The latter has tens of millions of streams for his frank, Manc-accented tracks, cast in atmospherically minimal trap and drill productions that allow plenty of space for his casually withering and faintly amused demeanour. BBT Fred Again Other stage, 20.30 Few artists are having as much of a moment as Frederick Gibson, the British dance producer whose UK bass tracks, infused with sonic flotsam including vocal samples and field recordings, have defined post-pandemic raving. With Royal Blood and Warpaint providing little competition on other stages, everyone under and many over the age of 28 will be here for sunset: surely a star-cementing moment. BBT Sparks Park stage, 21.15 With interest in the septuagenarian US duo invigorated by Edgar Wright\u2019s brilliant documentary, Ron and Russell Mael are having the time of their lives on their current touring run. It\u2019s effectively in service of this year\u2019s The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte, though the wide-ranging setlist is a reminder of just how many hits they\u2019ve had: The Number One Song in Heaven, When Do I Get to Sing My Way ... Ron remains doing his fantastically impassive bit at the keys; Russell skips around in a way that puts performers half his age to shame. Even if you\u2019re totally unfamiliar, if the idea of watching your two naughtiest uncles do cabaret appeals, don\u2019t miss them. LS Arctic Monkeys Pyramid stage, 22.15 For all that the headliners feel a bit stodgy and blokey overall, there\u2019s no doubt that Elton John will bring the house, sky and neighbouring herds of dairy cows down with a barnstorming headline performance on the Sunday, and while Guns N\u2019 Roses may not have quite enough big hits for a headline slot, the ones they do have are the stuff of Glasto euphoria. Arctic Monkeys, meanwhile are deep into a world stadium tour and in the form of their lives (though a laryngitis diagnosis now has fans worried). Alex Turner teeters on the edge of irony with his \u201cfrontman\u201d performance, all knowing croons and swagger, but there\u2019s a warmth and fun even as he does play with rock star tropes. New songs such as Body Paint and There Must Be a Mirrorball are muscular live, and older singalongs have more brawn than ever. BBT Hot Chip Woodsies, 22.30 It\u2019s easy to take Hot Chip for granted \u2013 almost 20 years after releasing their debut, they remain as consistent as ever \u2013 but it\u2019d be a fool who skipped out on seeing them play a big-tent headline set at Glastonbury, where they\u2019re always in their element. Here\u2019s the fun foil to their Domino labelmates\u2019 knowing performance on the main stage, plus a chance to dance to One of the Best Songs of All Time (says me), Over and Over. LS * * * Saturday Wunderhorse Woodsies, 12.45 Cantering up to indie\u2019s big league is this band fronted by Jacob Slater (who you may recognise from previous band the Dead Pretties or as Paul Cook in the Sex Pistols TV biopic). Debut album Cub last year was superb, with beefy blues-rock, pastoral Britpop, droning psych, and, in Teal, an all-timer that recalled Lou Reed at his best. BBT Hagop Tchaparian Stonebridge Bar, Saturday, 13.00; The Levels, Sunday, 13.30 Tchaparian played Glastonbury long ago in a totally different guise, as guitarist for post-Britpop band Symposium. Of late, though, he\u2019s been turning heads with a series of maximalist dance productions released on Four Tet\u2019s label, where live instrumentation recorded on the fly wherever he encountered it around the world \u2013 reedy pipes, pounding hand drums \u2013 is paired with pounding techno and garage. This globalised, welded-mutant sound is in some ways the sonic analogue to the knocked together metal sculptures of Joe Rush that dot the festival site. BBT Raye Pyramid stage, 13.15 Raye is stopping off in between dates supporting SZA on her UK tour, where she\u2019s been wowing crowds with her whopping voice and between-song charm. This Pyramid stage slot is a well deserved crowning for the British pop star, who argued her way out of her limiting major label contract to release her fantastic 2023 debut album, My 21st Century Blues (imagine the sort of angry, empowered pop music that Amy Winehouse might have made had things been different). It wasn\u2019t just a victory for her, but an argument for giving young women their artistic freedom and seeing what brilliance might emerge. LS Jockstrap Park stage, 15.15 Georgia Ellery and Taylor Skye make showtunes through a dark mirror; dubstep regurgitated by two conservatoire-trained brains; they clash medieval dankness with disco freshness, and somehow, it comes off as the greatest pop music never made before. As knotty as their music is, it\u2019s also the sort of thing that\u2019s going to sound radiant mid-afternoon on the Park stage. LS Erika de Casier Lonely Hearts Club, 16.15 The Danish producer couldn\u2019t be on a more appositely titled stage: her off-kilter Y2K R&amp;B, warped by strangeness and a debt to UK garage, trades in poised kiss-offs of the \u201cI\u2019m not angry, just disappointed\u201d variety. Hers will be a sophisticated set \u2013 no scrubs allowed. LS Richard Thompson Acoustic stage, 17.00 In one of those demonstrations of how Glastonbury is actually about 20 world-class festivals in one, the Acoustic stage alone is stuffed with quality folk-adjacent stars: Steve Earle, Gilbert O\u2019Sullivan, Paul Carrack, Rickie Lee Jones and Badly Drawn Boy among them. But standing out with a songbook of total pedigree and a voice of hair-prickling expression is Richard Thompson, who at 74 has a lifetime of stirring craft to draw from. BBT Central Cee Other stage, 20.45 This is the kind of set where you\u2019ll see people crowdsurfing holding crutches: pure pandaemonium will greet a British MC who has risen to real stardom, but who you sense will climb further yet. Performing live, his mic technique is on point even when negotiating tricky triplet-time drill, and given he\u2019s just dropped a whole EP with Dave and will probably still be top of the singles chart with their track Sprinter when he takes the stage, the latter MC is surely going to be one of the weekend\u2019s big guest appearances. BBT Vigro Deep Iicon, 21.30 The beautiful sound of amapiano \u2013 a South African dance subgenre built around bulbous bass, lugubrious tempos and an almost malevolent sense of forward prowl \u2013 has crept with sensual stealth into club culture in recent years. Vigro Deep is one of its best proponents, with productions that throb with bass and keep you perched on the edge of release. He\u2019s playing from the vast sci-fi head of the Iicon stage, making for a dramatic, cinematic start to your Saturday night. BBT Kelis West Holts, 22.15 Kelis was recently sampled (and then removed) from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance, and warped through Jpegmafia and Danny Brown\u2019s Fentanyl Tester \u2013 but here\u2019s a chance to see a true original in her undiluted form, as well as a legend receiving her flowers with a well deserved stage-headlining slot. That said, of all the Glastonbury clashes, the sharp end of Saturday night is particularly crushing: do you pick deliriously flossy attitude at Kelis \u2026 Lana Del Rey Other stage, 22.30 \u2026 rangy, unpredictable balladry with Lana\u2026 Christine and the Queens Woodsies, 22.30 \u2026 or gauzy, grief-stricken epics with Chris, fresh from the release of his five-star new album, Parano\u00efa, Angels, True Love? (At any rate, anything\u2019s better than Guns N\u2019 Roses caterwauling on the main stage.) LS Skepta b2b Jammer Arcadia, 00.00 There\u2019s a wealth of great back-to-back sets in the fire-breathing spider of Arcadia: pairs of DJs risking singed eyebrows including Floating Points and Daphni, Skream and Interplanetary Criminal, DJ Q and Yung Singh and the ultimate Glasto twosome, the Chemical Brothers. But most exciting is this meeting of two of grime\u2019s greatest figures, throwing down rowdy classics and presumably sparring on the mic. BBT * * * Sunday Cmat Woodsies, 12.30 Have yourself a lovely afternoon of country music on Sunday, starting with the brilliant emerging Irish pop star Cmat, whose dialled-up twang brings a grippingly manic edge to her hooky pop songs. And then \u2026 The Chicks Pyramid stage, 13.30 \u2026 dash to get back to the source, as the legendary country trio FKA Dixie Chicks kick off a very rare UK tour here. The pandemic meant they never got to bring over their excellent comeback album Gaslighter \u2013 their first in 14 years \u2013 so here\u2019s hoping for a set that splices old and new, as well as acting as something of a litmus test for the UK\u2019s ever-growing appreciation for country music. LS Charlotte Adig\u00e9ry and Bolis Pupul Park stage, 14.00 One of the most fun live shows going today, although one that comes with a quizzical side: the Belgian duo make utterly danceable electro-pop that satirises xenophobia, misogyny and racism, making you dance \u2013 then question your complicity. Their themes are serious, but they\u2019re delivered with such silliness and sarcasm that it\u2019s more like a brilliant lesson from an innovative teacher than a lecture, guaranteed to leave you buzzing. LS Speakers Corner Quartet West Holts, 15.30 This group put out their debut album this year \u2013 but have spent over 15 years getting there, having long backed spoken word and varied musical creativity at their Brixton jam sessions. Those brought them into the orbit of numerous luminaries, some of whom appear here \u2013 Kae Tempest, Shabaka Hutchings, Tirzah and more \u2013 to contribute to one of the most familial sets of the weekend where psychedelic soul, boom-bap beat and jazz mindsets fold around each other. BBT Toyah Willcox &amp; Robert Fripp Acoustic stage, 16.10 Having earned huge viral fame for their livestreamed performances that play out like the dinner entertainment at a swingers resort, pop\u2019s embarrassing parents come to Glastonbury for what will be a gloriously entertaining show. With a karaoke bar of hits now in their arsenal \u2013 from Heroes to Creep to Enter Sandman \u2013 expect mass singalongs, silly costumes and dextrous guitar theatrics. BBT Thundercat Park stage, 19.45 Three years since the excellent It Is What It Is, we\u2019re surely due a new LP from Stephen Bruner, the west coast bassist and producer whose chops are always offset by a magnetic breeziness. There\u2019s no better time for a dose of daydreamy funk virtuosity then when the sun starts to dip on Sunday night. LS Caroline Polachek Woodsies, 20.00 Arguably the most essential thing to see on this whole list. Having made her way from NY alt-poppers Chairlift into an ever-more spectacular solo career, she\u2019s on more indomitable form than Erling Haaland and HBO\u2019s drama team combined. Polachek has a Mariah-like mastery of her high vocal register, so piercingly, supernaturally pure that it really does feel beamed from the heavens, and her songs have complex emotional drama done with a big pop wallop. Go bask in greatness. BBT Phoenix Woodsies, 21.30 A fairly brutal clash against Elton John, but if you\u2019ve already caught his Goodbye Yellow Brick Road retirement tour, or your vibe is more chanson than chateau, the French pop-rockers never fail to deliver on euphoria, spectacle and giddy choruses that you think you know, then realise mid-mouthful that you have precisely no idea what frontman Thomas Mars is actually on about. Truly, \u201cwhere would you go with a lasso?\u201d LS"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331963", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/20/tina-turner-outfits-v-and-a-diva-exhibition-prince-elton-john-bob-mackie-singer", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Larger than life\u2019: Tina Turner outfits to star in V&A\u2019s Diva exhibition", "lead": "Immersive show includes talk by late singer\u2019s designer Bob Mackie as well as items worn by Prince and Elton John", "author": "Jess Cartner-Morley", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:44:48", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173147", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/952e76cd94838d6713931d54b33823a4863fcd4e/474_158_4329_2597/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cTina Turner was larger than life right up to the end,\u201d her friend Bob Mackie, the fashion designer and collaborator on her most famous looks, said this week before the launch of Diva, a blockbuster fashion exhibition at the V&amp;A in London, which features the late singer in a starring role. Asked to assess how today\u2019s divas match up with their predecessors, the 83-year-old designer, whose career spans designing for Lucille Ball and Doris Day to being a guest judge on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, seemed unimpressed. With the taste for provocation that led him to dress Cher in a Mohawk headdress for the 1986 Oscars, he pointed out that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first stage costumes were made by her mother, who \u201cused to say, \u2018I look at what Bob Mackie does for Cher\u2019\u201d he noted. Despite the phenomenal fashion firepower of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance tour, packed with one-off commissions from the world\u2019s hottest catwalk designers, Mackie was unmoved. \u201cThe clothes don\u2019t really show off the talent. It looks like Naomi Campbell doing a nightclub act,\u201d he shrugged. The Flame dress Mackie designed for Turner in 1977 is one of the highlights of the Diva exhibition, which opens on Saturday. Sinuous ribbons of red and gold sequins swing loose from a nude corset, designed to swish around Turner\u2019s thighs, creating an optical illusion that exaggerated the length and drama of each step as she danced. \u201cIt was kind of a cavewoman dress,\u201d remembered Mackie. \u201cIt didn\u2019t just hang there like an old Halloween costume. She worked it. Tina had the best body, with the longest legs, and she used it all. When she was on stage she became rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\u201d In the great tradition of showmanship, Diva has moments of tragedy and controversy, served with a Vegas-sized portion of feathers and sequins. \u201cEven though I knew she wasn\u2019t well, losing Tina was a shock,\u201d said Mackie, who knew the singer for four decades. \u201cThere was still such joy in that big rough laugh of hers. I thought she would be here for ever.\u201d Mackie identifies strength of will as a foundation stone of \u201cdivadom\u201d and Turner\u2019s personality. \u201cIn rehearsals, Tina would train her girls to dance the exact way that she wanted them to dance.\u201d The exhibition reclaims the word \u201cdiva\u201d with confidence and swagger, tracing how an Italian word meaning \u201cgoddess\u201d came to be used to critique individuals who speak loudly, and who confidently take up space \u2013 if they were not conventional heterosexual men. Visitors will have an immersive, audio-visual experience, thanks to headsets that flick between tracks depending on which display case the wearer is closest to. The dizzying soundtrack spans Maria Callas performing Bellini\u2019s Norma at La Scala in 1954, and Rihanna singing Umbrella. Among the items on display is Josephine Baker\u2019s costume, which is still sensationally risque, almost 80 years after she wore it on stage in Paris: a crystal bikini, cups suspended from fragile straps, has luscious cherry-red beading at the nipples to give an illusion of nudity, and the scantiest, frothiest of knickers. Mackie is the godfather of the naked dress trend, much in the evidence in Diva, which has turned up the heat on red carpets over the past year, with celebrities from Lizzo to Julia Fox going nude but for a light dusting of sparkle. \u201cThe secret is that it has to be just naked enough. You think you see everything, but you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a sexy thing, for sure but it\u2019s also about someone who\u2019s fascinating to look at. And not everyone can pull that off the way that Cher can.\u201d As a 23-year-old assistant to designer Jean Louis, Mackie sketched the dress in which Marilyn Monroe sang Happy Birthday to President John F Kennedy. When Kim Kardashian wore the dress to the Met Ball last year, Mackie described the loan as \u201ca big mistake\u201d, saying Monroe\u2019s dress \u201cwas designed for her, and no one else should be wearing it\u201d. The exhibition\u2019s curator, Kate Bailey, believes any gender can be a diva. Freddie Mercury, who once said he had more in common with Liza Minnelli than Led Zeppellin, is pictured bare-chested in tight white jeans and an ermine wrap, while Elton John\u2019s 50th birthday costume and a pair of high-heeled black satin booties worn by Prince, custom made with cushioned soles for dancing, make an appearance. But women are the undoubted headliners of the show. Bailey adeptly skewers the double standards of an entertainment industry which pushes its female stars to extremes and then chastises them for being too grand or demanding. Amy Winehouse\u2019s sunshine yellow Preen dress is poignantly styled, with the visible black bra straps that were as much a part of her look as her beehive hairstyle. But much of the finale section of the show is a joyful love letter to the bold wardrobes of modern pop. Mackie\u2019s barb notwithstanding, Beyonc\u00e9 is celebrated in a cinema-sized screening of her Formation video. The crystal- and pearl-encrusted dress, coat and mitre of the Pope-style outfit Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2018, and Lizzo\u2019s white fake fur haute couture evening coat with sash emblazoned: \u201cDon\u2019t be a drag, just be a queen\u201d have the pomp of royal court dress, with the sass of street style. Online talk: Bob Mackie in conversation takes place on 22 June. Diva opens at the V&amp;A on 24 June and runs until 7 April 2024"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331964", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/20/grocery-supermarket-inflation-great-britain-eases-remains-high-kantar", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Grocery inflation falls to lowest rate this year in Great Britain but is still at 16.5%", "lead": "Supermarket price growth slows, although household budgets still under pressure", "author": "Julia Kollewe", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:29:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173165", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8e1fd8b998d36a8204407001f70340593ba609a4/25_10_5798_3481/500.jpg", "body": "Supermarket inflation has eased to its lowest level this year but remains high, forcing people to change how they eat and cook as household budgets are strained, according to the data firm Kantar. Annual grocery inflation in Great Britain declined to 16.5% in the four weeks to 11 June, down from 17.2% last month and a record 17.5% in March. It remains at its sixth-highest level since the financial crisis in 2008, Kantar said. The biggest price rises were for eggs, cooking sauces and frozen potato products. The figures come a day before the official UK data on inflation, which is expected to show an easing to 8.4% in May from 8.7% in April, when food and drink prices rose at an annual rate of 19.1%. Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation this year is at risk from stubbornly high food inflation, which has kept the headline rate at a higher than expected level. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cThis is the lowest rate of grocery price inflation we\u2019ve seen in 2023, which will be a relief to shoppers and retailers. \u201cBut prices rising at 16.5% isn\u2019t something to celebrate and it\u2019s still the sixth highest monthly figure in the past 15 years. Price rises are now being compared to the increasing rate of grocery inflation seen last summer, which means that it should continue to fall in the coming months, a welcome result for everyone.\u201d A survey for Kantar found that of consumers\u2019 top five financial worries, rising grocery prices is the only one that they are more concerned about now than at the start of the year. Almost 70% of households are either \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery worried\u201d about food and drink inflation, compared with just over two-thirds in January. It remains the second-biggest concern behind rising energy bills. Consumers have been switching to supermarkets\u2019 cheaper own-label lines to save money, where sales are up 41% compared with last year, and changing how they eat and cook, Kantar said. McKevitt added: \u201cPeople are thinking more and more about what they eat and how they cook as the cost of living crisis takes its toll on traditional behaviours. The most prominent change we\u2019ve seen is that people are preparing simpler dishes with fewer ingredients. Our data shows that the public are turning away from their oven and increasingly using microwaves, which reflects the shift to simpler cooking.\u201d There were 4% fewer meals made using an oven in the last 12 weeks compared with the same period last year, while microwaved meals rose by 8%, and there was a rise in food prepared with toasters and grills. Sue Davies, the head of food policy at the consumer group Which?, said high prices have been \u201chammering the household budgets of millions, including desperate families and people on low incomes who have been skipping meals for many months to make ends meet\u201d. She called on the government to get urgent commitments from supermarkets on stocking essential budget ranges in all their stores, particularly in areas where people are most in need, as well as make pricing much clearer so shoppers can compare prices and find the best value products. The proportion of products sold for \u00a31 has almost halved in a year, from 9% to 5%, according to Kantar. McKevitt said: \u201cTraditionally, \u2018round-pound\u2019 prices have been attractive to shoppers, who find them easier to relate to and practical as well with no leftover change. But, with retailers eager to offer value and cash buying less popular, \u00a31.25 has emerged as an increasingly important price point. It now vies with \u00a32 as the second most popular price for a grocery item.\u201d With the advent of warm weather, consumers have been buying more ice-cream and mineral water, with sales up by 25% and 8% respectively last month, despite price increases of 20% and 17%. Barbecue food has also gone up in price, with fresh sausage prices up 16% and fresh burgers 13% more expensive. Aldi was the fastest-growing retailer in the past four months as people turned to the discount supermarkets, posting a sales rise of 24.6% to a record market share of 10.2%. Lidl\u2019s sales growth was only slightly behind its fellow German discounter, increasing sales by 23.2% to take 7.7% of the market."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331965", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/shaun-bailey-under-pressure-to-decline-peerage-after-partygate-video", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Shaun Bailey under pressure to decline peerage after Partygate video", "lead": "Video appears to show Tory workers dancing at mid-lockdown \u2018jingle and mingle\u2019 event during Bailey\u2019s London mayoral bid", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:23:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173183", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/af2eebc66d0d79c4259c49c69662f4b1c64c4ca3/60_0_1800_1080/500.jpg", "body": "Pressure is growing on the former Tory London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey not to accept the peerage offered to him by Boris Johnson, as a senior Conservative MP said he should \u201cconsider his position\u201d. Tobias Ellwood said there were \u201cbig questions\u201d around the peerage after a video surfaced appearing to show Tory party workers drinking alcohol and dancing on 14 December 2020, at a mid-lockdown gathering held by the campaign team involved in Bailey\u2019s unsuccessful mayoral bid. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, strongly hinted on Monday that fines might follow a reopening of an investigation into the party at Conservative party HQ \u2013 as it emerged it was described as a \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d event on the invitation. \u201cI think we can all guess which way it will go,\u201d he told the News Agents podcast, after he was asked about the apparent partying in the video, obtained by the Daily Mirror. Along with Ellwood\u2019s comments, there was a less than ringing endorsement of Bailey\u2019s position on Tuesday morning by the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, when asked if his party colleague should take the peerage. Stride told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWhat is happening here, as I understand it, is that the Metropolitan police are looking into the events surrounding this Daily Mirror video that has recently been released and they will no doubt come to their conclusions and then there are mechanisms involving the forfeiture committee that can lead to changes to honours that have been given in the past.\u201d Earlier, Ellwood said there were \u201cbig questions\u201d around Bailey\u2019s peerage, adding: \u201cAbsolutely he needs to consider that, if I\u2019m frank.\u201d He said that the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, should \u201cgrasp\u201d the issue of peerages, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t simply have prime ministers stuffing the Lords with their friends. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything to come of this I really encourage Mr Sunak to now draw a line under Boris Johnson\u2019s tenure and indeed influence over the parliamentary party. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity now for the prime minister to draw a line, to continue the progress that he\u2019s already made, further stamp his personality by dealing and confronting things like this directly.\u201d The video appeared to show events at Tory HQ hours after Matt Hancock, then the health secretary, announced London was to move into tougher tier 3 Covid restrictions. The minister Michael Gove has apologised and said the actions were \u201cindefensible\u201d, but he refused to back calls for some of those who attended to lose honours given by Johnson, who has been found guilty of misleading parliament over the Partygate scandal. Bailey has said that he \u201capologises unreservedly\u201d for the event, saying it \u201cturned into something after I left\u201d, but that \u201cthe buck stops with me\u201d. It was for others to decide if he should not have his peerage but he would like to continue \u201cdoing work for the country\u201d, he said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331966", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/20/riyadh-air-new-saudi-airline-seeks-to-benefit-from-travel-boom", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Soft power: Saudi Arabia flexes muscles with launch of new Gulf airline Riyadh Air", "lead": "Launch comes amid resurgent demand for air travel after end of Covid lockdowns", "author": "Jasper Jolly in Paris", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:00:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173200", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c9d8178bd510537bcb2ce486a236320062f5d6/0_275_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "As the deafening roar of an F35 fighter jet washes over the Paris air show, Tony Douglas allows himself a moment of nostalgia: he was formerly responsible for the UK government agency charged with buying the planes. Now he is in charge of a different aviation proposition, leading the launch of a new commercial airline belonging to the Saudi Arabian state. Riyadh Air, owned by the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund, was first revealed in March alongside a provisional order for up to 72 Boeing 787 aeroplanes. Now its full launch comes as the global aviation industry races to meet resurgent demand for air travel after the end of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. The carrier is this week showing its new purple livery \u2013 on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner \u2013 to the industry at the Paris air show, after making its debut last week in the Saudi capital, with which it shares its name. It forms part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to diversify its economy away from oil production under Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince who has taken a central role in ruling the country \u2013 including allegedly approving the murder of regime critic Jamal Khashoggi, according to US intelligence agencies. That murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 cast a cloud over Prince Mohammed\u2019s reign for several years, but the prince has continued with plans for a new 100-mile-long megacity called Neom and massively increased tourism. Saudi Arabia already owns Saudia, formerly known as Saudi Arabian Airlines, which has been in operation since 1945 when it was gifted a plane by US president Franklin Roosevelt. However, many of its routes are geared towards passengers travelling to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage. Rivals in the Middle East such as Qatar Airways, Dubai\u2019s Emirates and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad have built up extensive networks with luxurious facilities for travellers in business and first class. Those fleets of planes are seen as important boosters of the countries\u2019 \u201csoft power\u201d, carrying hundreds of millions of passengers each year through airports that have become hubs for connecting flights. Douglas, who previously led Etihad, insists that Riyadh is not aiming to compete directly with those other airlines. Instead, he emphasises the demand from Saudi Arabia\u2019s iPhone-wielding population. \u201cAre we designing to become another super-hub, another Dubai, another Doha? The simple answer is absolutely not. We\u2019re designing to serve a nation, to catch up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time in terms of serving the kingdom in the way that we need to serve the kingdom.\u201d Saudi Arabia is not the only market expecting booming aviation demand. European plane-maker Airbus announced a deal with Indian carrier Indigo for 500 of its bestselling A320 at the Paris show on Monday, thought to be the biggest single order in history. Hanging over the launch of the new airline, and the broader show, is the question of the carbon emissions that will be created by an enormous expansion of global air traffic. That question \u201cwill define ultimately who the winners and losers are\u201d, says Douglas. \u201cAnybody who doesn\u2019t take it seriously will almost certainly fail.\u201d Riyadh Air will have a sustainability advantage because it will only have the newest, more efficient planes. Douglas says that so-called sustainable aviation fuel \u2013 made from plants or using chemical processes powered by renewable electricity \u2013 will play an important role. However, he says he is unable to commit to using a certain proportion of the fuel because of uncertain future supply. The new airline\u2019s local rivals are playing down the threat of a new player with deep pockets. Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates airline, last month told a travel conference that \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a threat to us\u201d, according to a Financial Times report. Douglas says Riyadh Air will not be content with relying on its wealthy owner. \u201cWe cannot tolerate inefficiency because all that does is catch you up in the future. Commercial aviation is so competitive, if you start off lazy, you will die.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331967", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/20/matrescence-on-metamorphosis-pregnancy-childbirth-motherhood-by-lucy-jones-review-smashing-motherhood-myths", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Matrescence by Lucy Jones review \u2013 smashing motherhood myths", "lead": "A thrilling examination of what it means to become a mother challenges assumptions in bravura fashion", "author": "Jude Rogers", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:00:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173217", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/56e80ef507c85b83d8e9f450c1f262a96c0d3ccf/0_234_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Matrescence, the best book I\u2019ve ever read about motherhood, is a delightfully unusual one. For starters, brief passages that lay out the machinations of nature, and many of its horrors, sit around its chapters. We meet eels that endure five life stages and multiple habitats before breeding once and then dying, and black lace-weaver mother spiders who feed their living bodies to their infants. \u201cForty spiderlings, which resemble creamy yellow sea pearls, wander over her nonchalantly, devouring, snacking, nibbling, pulling bits of her flesh into their tiny mouths,\u201d Jones writes, watching a grisly nature video. Spotting a similar spider in her children\u2019s toy box not long after, she\u2019s relieved to find no babies. The whole experience has felt \u201cclose to home\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s safe,\u201d she writes. \u201cFor now.\u201d By exploring matrescence \u2013 the physical, physiological and psychological process of becoming a mother \u2013 within this wider context of the natural world, Jones recalibrates ideas of how women are meant to exist and behave during these fast-changing years. The book\u2019s title comes from a 1973 essay by medical anthropologist Dana Raphael, lamenting the lack of acknowledgment of \u201cmother-becoming\u201d in western societies. She discusses a ritual in the Pacific island of Tikopia that marks the fact that a woman has given birth, and prioritises \u201cthe sense of the newborn mother\u201d, rather than erasing her entirely around her child. This shift of focus captivates Jones, a new mother at the start of the book, who has a daughter and two sons by its conclusion. As in her previous book, 2020\u2019s Losing Eden (an examination of our disconnection from nature), Jones\u2019s writing is hungry to impart knowledge. Moving from the early stages of her pregnancy to her eldest child\u2019s first day at school, she describes how the mother\u2019s brain literally changes shape, retaining extra grey matter for years, processing more information, emotion and memory. She challenges the ideal of the nuclear family raising children in western societies, when babies are raised by networks of \u201cothermothers\u201d across the world, and in the animal kingdom, including in colonies of bats. Myths are also smashed from page one, which makes this a thrilling read. A sperm doesn\u2019t race to an egg, for example: \u201cThis is a retelling of the hero myth, essentially, with the egg as the passive vessel,\u201d Jones writes, in one of many withering lines. In fact, cells from the fallopian tube are required to secrete chemicals that allow the sperm to swim and mature, then the egg must enfold it. Women are reframed as active throughout, which empowers. Jones is great on the impossible rules, and the lack of correct information meted out to pregnant women. (How on earth are they meant to avoid car fumes without staying indoors? Why is morning sickness still called that by the NHS, when studies have proved it\u2019s an all-day rush to the sick bucket for the many who get it?) Passages that reveal what many advocates of \u201cintensive mothering\u201d miss out on are also revealing. The pioneer of attachment theory, John Bowlby, did indeed underline the importance of the proximity of a child to a caregiver in terms of their emotional development, but he also said that parents are equally \u201cdependent on a greater society for economic provision\u201d, and that society should \u201ccherish\u201d its parents. Look at the childcare and parental leave situation in modern Britain and weep. Especially good is her analysis of the modern obsession with \u201csacralising birth\u201d, tracking back to the (amazingly named) British obstetrician Grant Dickly-Read, who saw the vaginal delivery as the \u201cultimate phenomenon of a series of spiritual experiences\u201d. Jones understands women wanting \u201cto feel their bodies are powerful rather than degenerate, for facing danger and risk head-on\u201d, but this won\u2019t stop her from reminding us how nature is not always kind. But Jones never wags her finger or chastises. Experimental flourishes in her text \u2013 alongside all that beautiful, accessible writing \u2013 also add to its majesty. On one page, the phrase \u201cThis is how big it needs be\u201d is repeated in a formation that reveals the size of a cervix in its centre. How I howled.

And much like a campfire tale tailor-made to terrify impressionable listeners, this has a streak of self-referentiality that makes it feel ludic as well as lurid. After a 1940s-set prologue that\u2019s explained later, the story settles into the 1980s, a time when this sort of summer-fun-and-slashing package with a large ensemble cast was all the rage (see Sleepaway Camp, The Burning, and of course the Friday the 13th series). It\u2019s the last day of the season at Camp Briarbrook, and the assorted kids get ready to head home after one last performance-assembly in the mess hall. The camp counsellors, who predictably span the spectrum from theatre nerds and dweebs to glossy teen beauties ripe for terrorising, are also psyched to spend the night partying once the kids are gone. The camp\u2019s owners \u2013 paterfamilias Gilbert McCalister (William Sadler), his daughter (Cara Buono, Dr Miller in Mad Men), and her two sons Shawn (Tyler Elliot Burker) and Peter (Spencer List) \u2013 look on indulgently, little realising that by the end half of them will be murdered or at least traumatised one way or another. Is the mayhem caused by the undead spirit of camp nurse Agatha (Madeleine Dauer), who bears a grudge for things Gilbert did in the 1940s? Or is there a more quotidian explanation like bears, a hornets\u2019 nest or UFOs? Writer-director-editor Erik Bloomquist gamely takes the role of Danny, a lovelorn counsellor besotted with Kellie (Emily Keefe), and as anyone who\u2019s ever seen a summer camp horror movie knows desire is always a deadly emotion in these films. Bloomquist gets great performances from the younger element of the cast, who are clearly having the most fun ever marauding wantonly in the third act as if someone spiked the lemonade with every E number and sugar product known to humanity. But finger snaps are especially due to Dan Leahy who plays counsellor Ben, an out-and-proud theatre geek who can both quip like a queen and scream with terror convincingly, the full thespian range required by the material. \u2022 She Came from the Woods is released on 26 June on digital platforms."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331969", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/20/xi-jinping-antony-blinken-us-china-meeting", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Xi and Blinken exchange warm words while refusing to budge", "lead": "Meeting between US secretary of state and Chinese leader was a diplomatic coup, but yielded few breakthroughs", "author": "Amy Hawkins Senior China correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 07:49:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173251", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3cdce9e6b53cb0e82096bd9bed497822053240/0_0_4068_2441/500.jpg", "body": "Antony Blinken\u2019s meeting with Xi Jinping on Monday may have lasted only 35 minutes, but both sides insisted that it represented progress in the strained relationship. The two men exchanged warm words while both refusing to budge on their respective core interests. That the US secretary of state was able to meet China\u2019s leader at all was a diplomatic coup for the highly anticipated visit. Blinken is the highest-ranking US official to visit Beijing since 2018, but until he arrived in the Chinese capital it was not confirmed that he would meet China\u2019s leader. The meeting was brief compared with Blinken\u2019s seven-and-a-half-hour marathon meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang. But it was the culmination of an effort to stabilise the fraught relationship between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. \u201cChina\u2019s top leader personally meeting a US envoy lower than him in rank signals to Chinese government that China is in a gracious mood, and it gives Chinese bureaucrats political cover to extend an olive branch and make occasional compromises necessary to repair relations,\u201d said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University. According to a Chinese readout of the Xi-Blinken meeting, Xi said that \u201cChina respects the interests of the US\u201d and would not \u201cchallenge or replace\u201d the western superpower. Xi also called on the US to \u201crespect China and not harm China\u2019s legitimate rights and interests\u201d. The US had made it clear before Blinken\u2019s visit that it did not expect any breakthroughs from the trip. Rather, it was intended to prevent the relationship from deteriorating further. But just one day after Blinken\u2019s meeting, the Wall Street Journal reported that China was also in negotiations to establish a new joint military training facility in Cuba, highlighting the ongoing mistrust between China and the US. Some analysts argue that Beijing\u2019s interactions with Cuba are a reaction against the US\u2019s cooperation with Taiwan. Blinken insisted that the US supported the maintenance of the status quo on the Taiwan issue, and did not support moves towards Taiwanese independence. But attempts to reinstate more tangible avenues of cooperation were rebuffed. Beijing declined Washington\u2019s request to resume military-to-military communication channels, which have been frozen since the spy balloon incident in February. The Chinese side has also cited US sanctions against Chinese individuals, institutions and companies as a barrier to communications. Beijing is particularly excised by US sanctions against Li Shangfu, the defence minister. At the Shangri-La Dialogue, an Asian defence summit in Singapore held in early June, Li refused to meet his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin. Li has been under US sanctions since 2018. Many Chinese analysts see the failure to lift sanctions as evidence that the US is not sincere in its claims to want to restore the relationship. Prof Philip Hsu, the director of Center for China Studies and National Taiwan University, said: \u201cThe Biden administration is apparently unyielding on the bilateral security relations, and I do not think that either Xi or the Chinese society had hoped to attain anything concrete in this respect.\u201d Aside from mutual declarations of progress, neither side seemed to budge on topics such as trade, human rights and the war in Ukraine. But trips from other US officials such as the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen and commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, later in the year may help to boost economic cooperation. One element of the trip that attracted controversy was the western media\u2019s images of Blinken\u2019s arrival in Beijing. State media and netizens criticised the use of footage that appeared to show Beijing\u2019s sky cast in a dark filter. The state media tabloid the Global Times accused the international press of \u201cmaliciously fabricating the weather in Beijing as cloudy and hazy\u201d. Responding to the criticisms on Twitter, BBC Chinese noted that several outlets had used the same wire footage, including CGTN, a Chinese state broadcaster."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033196a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/football-transfer-rumours-spurs-to-replace-son-with-harvey-barnes", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Spurs to replace Son with Harvey Barnes?", "lead": "Today\u2019s tell-all is on the beach", "author": "Michael Butler", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 07:41:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173270", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/35bcd7a9f88d2fb1c920efbff3390e70ffb618da/133_209_3076_1846/500.jpg", "body": "Son Heung-min to the Saudi champions Al-Ittihad? That would be a painful one for Spurs supporters with the South Korean approaching legend status, despite a fairly underwhelming campaign last season. Still, \u00a351m for the 30-year-old is not to be sniffed at, if: a) the figure from ESPN is to be believed b) Son toiling last season was not just a blip and c) you can stomach the whole Saudi Arabia thing. Al-Ittihad, who have already nabbed Karim Benzema for gazillions and are close to snagging N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 for \u20ac100m (\u00a386.2m) a year, are hoping to defend their league title next season. Tottenham are under no pressure to sell, though, with Son contracted to 2025. Perhaps Daniel Levy would flog Son and sign a younger model in the shape of Harvey Barnes? It remains unlikely that the Englishman will be hugging the touchline at Plymouth Argyle next year in the Championship, but Leicester would demand a similar sum to the one being banded around for Son, and are hoping for another \u00a350m payday for James Maddison, despite there being only 12 months left on the midfielder\u2019s contract. Watching England\u2019s game against Malta, it is remarkable to think that Maddison is still a Leicester player. But here we are, and there he is, although surely not for much longer. However, Newcastle and Spurs are the only sides that retain a concrete interest at this stage. Not the bidding war that Leicester were hoping for. The Inter Miami owner, Jorge Mas, the scoundrel, has released a photo on his socials of three empty shirts, presumably ready to be filled by ageing old Barcelona legends who fancy a bit of that old MLS/Will Smith/Pitbull lifestyle. The trio are expected to be Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, although could there be a late twist? Luis Su\u00e1rez, maybe? Watch this space. It\u2019s 28 years to the day since Arsenal signed some bloke called Dennis Bergkamp for a whopping \u00a37.5m, and the Gunners are once again going after a Dutchman. Jurri\u00ebn Timber is the target, as he was for Manchester United last summer, with Arsenal opening the bidding at \u00a330m.

Sydney experienced its coldest June morning on record on Monday, with a minimum temperature of 1.8C at Olympic Park, according to Miriam Bradbury, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. While significant, Bradbury said the monitoring site was only established 12 years ago, so there could have been cooler conditions before then. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A high pressure system developing as a result of Monday\u2019s cold front will cause cool conditions to continue, even though the front has moved off into the Tasman Sea, Bradbury said. \u201cSo essentially, the cold front brought in the cold and the high pressure system is going to hang on to the cold.\u201d The minimum temperature in Canberra dipped to -5.6C on Tuesday morning, while in Sydney it was 6.8C and Melbourne 5C. And it felt even colder, Bradbury said. Sydney\u2019s minimum felt temperature was barely above zero at 0.5C, while Canberra felt like -9C and Melbourne felt like 3C. Bradbury said the high pressure system brought clear skies overnight, which cause colder temperatures in the morning. \u201cWe also had some pretty brisk winds through yesterday and overnight and that really made the \u2018feels like\u2019 temperature quite a bit lower than it actually was.\u201d But it\u2019s not immediately good news for the snowfields, Bradbury said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually seeing the chance of snow really dropping away. Even though it\u2019s going to be cold, there\u2019s not really going to be any cloud and rainfall about to turn into snow.\u201d Most ski resorts in the elevated parts of north-east Victoria and southern NSW have seen between 10-30cm of fresh snow in the last 24 to 30 hours, Bradbury said. Hotham Ski Resort said it was blanketed in over 40cm of snow in Monday\u2019s storm. Mount Hotham is set to receive 15-25cm when another snow system descends on Thursday night, according to meteorologist Jane Bunn. The cold snap comes after parts of Australia experienced their warmest start to winter on record in the first fortnight of June. Despite the cooler conditions, Bradbury said the longer-term outlook for the whole winter hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cWe\u2019re still expecting it to be warmer than average overall.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2023.

The major project was in pre-production in Melbourne when NBCUniversal\u2019s Universal Studio Group announced the eight-part series would not go ahead. The cancellation has been blamed on the US writers\u2019 strike because drafts of the scripts had not been finished before the start of the strike in May when the Writers Guild of America walked off the job over falling rates of pay. \u201cPush costs and uncertainty related to the ongoing [US writers\u2019] strike led to this difficult decision,\u201d UCP said in a statement, first reported by Deadline. The series, directed by Sam Esmail, had cast Briana Middleton and Lindy Booth in major roles, but few other details were initially available. Metropolis is considered by many critics as one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, dealing with themes such as class conflict, industrialisation and the perils of mechanised modernity. The Guardian film reviewer Peter Bradshaw called it \u201ca crazed futurist epic\u201d and a \u201cdystopian nightmare about a city-state built on slave labour, whose prosperity depends on suppressing a mutinous underground race whose insurrectionist rage is beginning to bubble\u201d. The project had been attracted to film at Melbourne\u2019s Docklands Studios by funding incentives from Australian state and federal governments. The Victorian government and the federal government chipped in $41.6m and $83.8m respectively in location incentive funding for a number of projects from NBC Universal\u2019s UCP including Metropolis. The Victorian government says it is \u201cdisappointing\u201d it won\u2019t go ahead but the $41.6m incentive fee had not been paid yet. Under location incentive funding, the final payment is only made once final Australian expenditure is incurred on the production. The federal location incentive program and the Victorian government\u2019s screen incentive scheme boasted that they had attracted \u201cone of the most technically ambitious film and television projects ever to film in Australia\u201d. The government said the projects would contribute up to $621m in direct spending over five years; provide work to 700 cast and crew; employ 2,500 people directly on Metropolis and see 700 local businesses and service providers benefit. In 2021 a Netflix series with $10m in incentive funding, Melissa McCarthy\u2019s God\u2019s Favorite Idiot, was axed after only half of the series finished shooting. Metropolis and God\u2019s Favorite Idiot were enticed to Australia through the incentive program, which allows overseas productions to recoup up to 13.5% of production expenses incurred in Australia. \u201cWhile the withdrawal of any production is disappointing, Victoria\u2019s partnership with NBCU remains in place with a significant estimated expenditure to be delivered over the coming years,\u201d a VicScreen spokesperson said. \u201cThe funds initially earmarked for Metropolis will be allocated to another project or projects to be delivered through the partnership.\u201d Part of the deal included the Victorian government contributing $12.5m to the cost of building a virtual production facility at Docklands. VicScreen says the facility will be used for other productions and education and training activities. A spokesperson from the department of the arts said no payments under the location incentive scheme have been made to the production because principal photography had not started."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033196f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/20/pixel-tablet-review-google-android-slate-smart-display-rolled-into-one", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pixel Tablet review: Google\u2019s Android slate and smart display rolled into one", "lead": "Magnetic charging speaker dock makes this tablet useful when idle, while software and app improvements are paying off", "author": "Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 07:00:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173357", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5182cb25aa3698a7bead360141ba92027ced8dd6/86_224_5370_3222/500.jpg", "body": "Google\u2019s long-awaited Pixel Tablet has finally landed to try to tempt users away from Apple\u2019s dominant iPad and make the large-screen devices useful in the home by becoming a smart display when not in active use \u2013 a feature that seems so obvious it\u2019s a wonder why no one has tried it before. The Android tablet costs \u00a3599 ($499/A$899) and comes with a magnetic charging speaker dock to enable its dual function super power. It is Google\u2019s first Android tablet in eight years and marks the company\u2019s attempt to reignite the category following up on its recent software efforts. The undocked Pixel behaves as a regular 11in tablet running Android 13 and features user profiles so it can be easily shared with more than one member of the family, something Apple still refuses to do with the iPad. The Pixel Tablet will get at least five years of software updates, longer than most Android competitors. The LCD screen is crisp, bright and colourful. Its 16:10 widescreen ratio makes it fairly tall when held in portrait, which takes some getting used to for apps. But films, photos and other content look and sound great using the four speakers in the Pixel, which provide stereo sound regardless of which way up you hold the tablet. It has the same top chip as Google\u2019s Pixel 7 phones and handles multiple apps and games well, while battery life is decent at about 12-hours of video playback in testing. Android on the big screen The Android tablet experience has improved in recent years. Every main Google app has been redesigned to take advantage of larger screens. Gmail has a split-pane view with your inbox on the left and an open email on the right. Chrome looks like the desktop browser and can place two active windows side-by-side in split screen as can Google Docs and other apps. Multitasking is handled by a dock or taskbar at the bottom of the screen, which can be pulled up while in an app via a short swipe gesture. Drag and drop an app from it to one side of the screen to enter split-screen mode or press and hold on the app icon to pop up a little menu to achieve the same result. A slider allows you to resize the pair of apps. The system works fine, and there are many more third-party apps optimised for Android on a tablet than there were even a year ago, including WhatsApp, Spotify and Evernote. Others such as Philips Hue just work like blown up phone apps, which is not a great experience. Then there are many such as the Ring, Instagram, Authy and other popular apps that refuse to resize, appearing as smaller apps with big black bars covering the rest of the screen. It will take some effort from Google to get all these third-party developers to play ball. Specifications Screen: 11in 2560x1600 60Hz LCD (276 pixels an inch) Processor: Google Tensor G2 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: Android 13 Camera: 8MP front and rear Connectivity: wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, USB-C, UWB Dimensions: 258 x 169 x 8.1mm Weight: 493g As a smart display Stick it on the magnetic dock to charge the tablet turns on \u201cHub Mode\u201d, which allows anyone to talk to it just like a Nest Hub smart display. They can ask Google for sport scores, play music or video, command smart home devices and set timers. As a smart display the Pixel has fewer of the shortcomings common to the devices, such as being limited to the video, calling and music services directly supported by Google Assistant or Alexa. You can just open the appropriate Android app on the tablet and start playing a video, make a call or play a game, which makes the Pixel much more flexible. You can also cast to and from the Pixel, which is a first for a tablet. I found sometimes it couldn\u2019t hear me quite as well as the best smart displays. Once or twice the tablet stayed on the lockscreen instead of triggering hub mode when the device went into standby on the dock. The options for customising screen brightness in certain lighting conditions and other common features of smart displays are more limited. These little pre-release niggles feel like they can be easily fixed with app updates. Sustainability Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The tablet is repairable by Google and third-party shops with screen repairs costing \u00a3319 and genuine replacement parts to be made available from iFixit. The devices are made with recycled aluminium, glass, rare earth elements and plastic, accounting for 35% of the tablet and 40% of the charging dock by weight. The company publishes environmental impact reports for some of its products. Google will recycle old devices free of charge. Price The Pixel Tablet starts at \u00a3599 ($499/A$899) including the charging dock and ships on 20 June. For comparison, the Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus costs \u00a3190, the OnePlus Pad costs \u00a3449, the Apple iPad costs \u00a3499, the iPad Air costs \u00a3669 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 costs \u00a3749. Verdict The Pixel Tablet is a fascinating experiment from Google at trying to figure out what people do with tablets in the home and make better use of them for the 80% of the time they are usually just left on a coffee table. The two-in-one concept of a tablet that docks to be a smart display most of the time is such a good idea it\u2019s a wonder no one has pulled it off before. The quality of the Pixel\u2019s screen makes it great for video but also the best digital photo frame you can get. The flexibility of Android is far more powerful than traditional smart displays too. As an Android tablet the Pixel is also generally well executed. Powerful enough with solid battery life, good speakers, a nice design and decent software. Third-party app support is improving, but Google still has a lot of work to do if it\u2019s going to match the iPad for tablet activities simply because developers produce more and better apps for Apple\u2019s device. At \u00a3599 in the UK, the tablet is pretty pricey, even if 10in or greater smart displays are at least \u00a3200 on their own. It is more competitively priced in the US at $499. Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets are cheaper, OnePlus\u2019s Pad has a smoother screen and Samsung\u2019s tablets make for better laptop replacements. But the Pixel Tablet might just be the best Android tablet because it is better suited to being a shared family device that is useful whether actively being used or not. Pros: two-in-one tablet and smart display, dock included in the box, great screen, good speakers, solid battery life, decent performance, multiple user accounts, recycled material, good video call camera. Cons: expensive, Android experience still a work in progress for tablets, not as good as an iPad for apps, screen only 60Hz."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331970", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/ndis-agency-scrambles-over-risk-of-leaked-sensitive-client-information-in-hwl-ebsworth-hack", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "NDIS agency scrambles over risk of leaked sensitive client information in HWL Ebsworth hack", "lead": "National Disability Insurance Agency seeking information after 1.1TB of law firm\u2019s data was posted to dark web this month", "author": "Josh Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 06:59:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173377", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5be33404be117e05426f18e6fa65ceb414bcfaa1/0_402_7816_4690/500.jpg", "body": "The agency responsible for the national disability insurance scheme is scrambling to learn whether sensitive client information related to appeal cases has been caught up in a large cybersecurity hack on the law firm HWL Ebsworth which has represented the agency. The Russian-linked ALPHV/Blackcat ransomware group said in a post on the dark web in late April that data from the law firm had been hacked. Earlier this month, the group published some of the data it claimed to have stolen \u2013 later established to be 3.6TB worth of data, of which 1.1TB has been posted. Over the King\u2019s birthday long weekend, the law firm obtained a non-publication order in the NSW supreme court attempting to prevent dissemination of the published material. One outcome of the injunction is that HWL Ebsworth clients must wait for the firm to inform them if their sensitive information has been caught up in the breach. HWL Ebsworth has several hundred clients including dozens of federal government agencies, according to Austender contracts. On Tuesday, the National Disability Insurance Agency \u2013 which manages the NDIS \u2013 said it was seeking information on whether it had been caught up in the hack. \u201cThe [NDIA] is engaging with HWL Ebsworth regarding the cyber incident experienced by HWL Ebsworth and whether any NDIA information has been affected,\u201d the spokesperson said. The firm has represented the NDIA in legal appeals brought against the agency regarding client NDIS plans. As of September last year, there were nearly 4,000 appeals backlogged; however, the new government has been working to clear the caseload. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup According to court documents for the case, obtained by Guardian Australia, at least one person with a case against a government agency has found their information in the leaked data. In an affidavit, HWL Ebsworth\u2019s chief strategy officer, Russell Mailler, said the person \u201ccontacted the firm regarding personal information about him that he has found in the [hack]\u201d. \u201cHe has referred to three other applicants in similar matters whose data he has also apparently viewed,\u201d Mailler said. The firm wouldn\u2019t comment on specific clients, but said it was continuing to do a detailed and comprehensive review of the data as swiftly as it can. Australia\u2019s chief privacy authority, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, last week said it was also a client of the firm and had been caught up in the breach, with \u201ca document or documents relating to a limited number of OAIC files\u201d included. HWL Ebsworth had to notify the OAIC about the data breach as part of its overall breach reporting obligations, and the regulator will be responsible for any investigation into how the firm secured private information. Court documents revealed HWL Ebsworth initially overlooked the ransom threats from ALPHV/Blackcat because the first email was marked as spam by those who received it, and the second email was caught in the firm\u2019s anti-spam filters. It wasn\u2019t until the post on the dark web came to light and a third email was received that the firm became aware of the legitimacy of the claims. According to emails included in the affidavit, the hackers were seeking US$4m, to be transferred in cryptocurrency. Michael DeBolt, chief intelligence officer with cybersecurity firm Intel 471, said ALPHV remains in the top three of ransomware groups at the moment. DeBolt said the group isn\u2019t particularly focused on one country or one sector. \u201cALPHV and its affiliates have conducted attacks around the world and across many industries, which suggests the group is mostly opportunistic when it comes to targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of its attacks have taken place in North America, Europe and Asia. A small percentage took place in Oceania. \u201cThis year, ALPHV has attacked organisations in verticals including manufacturing, energy, financial services and the legal sector, amongst others.\u201d He said it would be hard to predict how ALPHV would react to the court injunction taken out against them, but ransomware actors in the past have shown interest in how they\u2019re portrayed in the media.

Lambie said that the Brereton report gave senior commanders a \u201cfree pass\u201d while soldiers were \u201cthrown under the bus\u201d. The 2020 Brereton report found credible information that 39 Afghan civilians were killed by members of the Australian special forces, but did not find commanders criminally responsible. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said he was taking advice on whether the ICC would take up the case, but said the government had committed to Australia \u201cholding itself to account\u201d for the allegations raised in the Brereton report. Lambie said the federal government had not supported her call to admit \u201cthat we have a massive problem\u201d and that she had been asking for a meeting with the defence minister \u201cfor months\u201d. \u201cLike the chief of the defence force and the top brass, the government is no doubt hoping this will just go away,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping Australians will forget that when alleged war crimes in Afghanistan were investigated, our senior commanders got a free pass, while the diggers were thrown under the bus. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t forget. I won\u2019t forget. Lest we forget. There was a culture of cover-up at the highest levels of the ADF. It is the ultimate boys\u2019 club. Well, today I say enough is enough.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Lambie attempted to table documents asking the ICC to prosecute the chain of command, but the Greens, the government and the opposition voted against it, saying they had not had a chance to read the documents yet. They indicated they may allow the documents to be tabled once they had a chance to look at them, which could happen on Tuesday afternoon. Marles, in an afternoon press conference, said he would meet with Lambie tomorrow about her concerns, praising her \u201csignificant\u201d advocacy for the veterans community. The minister again reiterated that the allegations of war crimes raised in the Brereton report were \u201cappalling\u201d and committed to implementing its recommendations in full. \u201cUnder the Albanese government, Australia is holding itself to account,\u201d Marles said this afternoon. He said that included ensuring accountability of senior military figures. Marles said he\u2019d take advice on whether the ICC would take up the case, but that the government was committed to implementing the report\u2019s recommendations \u201cfully and thoroughly\u201d. The Greens senator Nick McKim said the Greens usually took a \u201cvery generous view\u201d on tabling documents, and would support Lambie\u2019s move if it was in the public interest. The Liberal leader in the Senate, Simon Birmingham, expressed his willingness to see them tabled but wanted time to examine them, a sentiment echoed by the Labor senator Anthony Chisholm. The ICC can investigate war crimes if a country is unwilling or incapable of doing so itself. In 2020, then defence force chief, Angus Campbell, said he accepted that the Brereton report found fault with commanding officers. He said the report highlighted \u201cthat there are officers in command roles in the special operations task group and indeed in higher appointments who had a responsibility to deal with issues and to completely and openly report, and he finds fault there\u201d. In May, Campbell conceded he reviewed his own performance commanding troops in Afghanistan. \u201cWhen the chief of defence was asked in estimates if his command accountability review was an investigation, he admitted that it was not,\u201d Lambie told the Senate. \u201cI guess it was just another marking your own homework exercise,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cLeadership knew this went beyond patrols. It went up the chain. Everyone knew. Everyone knew. And still our government is silent. \u201cI am giving you a second chance to get this right and fix this mess \u2026 I want to see what leadership you have.

When we would divide the papers on a Saturday morning I would claim the Border Mail and flip straight to the horses and gear section, to circle in red pen anything that caught my eye. Sometimes I\u2019d read them out and Dad, the Dale Kerrigan to my Steve, would always respond: \u201cTell him he\u2019s dreaming\u201d. They often weren\u2019t, but I was. You could find anything, or anything that a horse-mad teenager was likely to want, in the classifieds of the Border Mail. Back then, in the early 2000s, newspapers collected about 96% of the $1.6bn classified advertising market, according to an analysis conducted for Google in 2020. By 2018, just 12% of the then $1.9bn classified advertising market could be found in newspapers. The internet had gutted the classified pages as it had gutted all other advertising revenue sources. The Weekly Times, once a cornucopia of horsey classifieds, stopped publishing its horse pages two years ago. Now I spend my Saturday mornings trawling Facebook marketplace. I\u2019m in 34 \u201cbuy and sell\u201d groups on Facebook, 33 of which directly relate to horses. I read all the ads in detail and make note of who is posting. In the absence of any active equestrian media in Australia \u2013 aside from a few glossy magazines, the biggest of which is Horse Deals, a shiny book of classifieds that has survived through the voyeurism of people like me \u2013 the \u201cbuy and sell\u201d groups are my gossip line. I know which vets are recommended, which farriers are taking on new clients, which farriers have completed what qualifications (that was a particularly heated debate on one page recently), and how people have set up their properties to manage the mud. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter I follow the hay ads to know who had a good season, whose harvest was ruined, and which paddocks were overrun. I know who built a new arena or a new shed, who they used, how much it cost, and whether they did a good job. I know how angry people are about planned fireworks displays (very), and where the town has landed on the development of a new Bunnings store (on the fence). I save posts and screenshot numbers and have built up a contact book of plumbers, electricians, earthmovers, and the guy who is happy to swing past on his large tractor and do jobs that we can\u2019t manage with a wheelbarrow. The most popular thing we\u2019ve posted so far was a stack of dirty and rusted corrugated iron from an old chook shed, free if you pick it up and load it yourselves. I had to silence my notifications. The listings in the groups I follow this week include a luxury Landau (a four-wheel horse-drawn carriage) for $5,000; a stack of timber pallets (always very popular); a free old bath that has been used as a water trough; and a Corningware casserole dish with lid and original box for $25,000 (she\u2019s dreaming). I read these local pages with the same fervour and for the same reason that my grandfather used to read ads for clearing sales in The Land: not because he wanted to buy something, but because he wanted to see what his neighbours were selling. These pages also play a more direct role in distributing community information. During the floods last year, the pages in my area rallied to find evacuation paddocks and provide transport to retrieve stranded animals. In the 2019-2020 bushfires, local buy and sell pages \u2013 which usually had a larger, more engaged and more interconnected following than official channels \u2013 shared emergency alerts and located lost people and animals. They coordinated the primary disaster response, offering rooms, loaning generators, and sending teams out to fix fences. And once the fire was out, they helped raise millions of dollars for recovery funds. That\u2019s still the work of local newspapers and radio, but more and more people see it on Facebook first. The power of these largely unmoderated groups is often not wielded with care \u2013 community Facebook groups have incited vigilante attacks and have spread both racism and an overblown sense of panic about local crime rates. Small town gossip can quickly turn sour if left unchecked. But when well managed, these pages are a lifeline to someone new in a community. They\u2019ve connected me to farmers who have told me how to manage my paddocks, the vet who now handles my panicked texts and the farrier who leaves me on read. Local knowledge that it would previously have taken newcomers like us years to glean is now accessible, if wildly unreliable. And if nothing else, I now know where to buy a Landau.

Mookhey\u2019s statement, made to parliament on Tuesday, sought to highlight the budget challenges inherited by the Minns Labor government, including an extra $33bn in spending commitments made by the previous Coalition government in its final 14 months in office. These include already disclosed $7.1bn in \u201cfinancial pressures\u201d. \u201cThere are serious decisions ahead and there are tough choices to be made,\u201d Mookhey told journalists ahead of his speech. Of particular urgency was reining in debt as the rising cost of borrowing would mean the budget would be forking out $7bn annually in three years\u2019 time. \u201cThis is billions more than we spend to fund the entire NSW police force,\u201d Mookhey said. \u201cIt is equal to 16 cents out of every dollar the state collects in taxes directly\u201d and meant less could be spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals. But Mookhey said the government would wait until after the winter recess before deciding whether to proceed with the Perrottet government\u2019s plan to increase the sales tax on the Star casino group by as much as $300m. \u201cWe obviously want to make sure that we\u2019re minimising the impact that any changes we make have on people\u2019s jobs,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe want to be mindful of the fact that there are 1000s of people employed in these businesses.\u201d NSW accounts for about a third of the Australian economy and its state budget was on track to exceed $103bn in the 2022-23 year, according to the mid-year update. The predicted return to a surplus by 2024-25 will be postponed after Mookhey said on Monday that it would exclude proposed revenue from a debt retirement fund because it distorted the true state of the 2023-24 budget, which will be finalised in September. The opposition has rejected Mookhey\u2019s criticism, saying it was intended to make the previous government look bad and also to discourage public sector workers from pressing too hard for pay increases. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said the government was looking for a \u201cpretext to break election promises\u201d at the September budget. \u201cThey are looking for excuse after excuse to cut services, to cut infrastructure programs, apparently to fund public sector wage increases,\u201d he said. Opposition treasury spokesperson, Damien Tudehope, said the treasurer should be working to maintain the state\u2019s top credit rating that it maintains with Fitch and Moody\u2019s rating agencies. S&amp;P has NSW at one notch lower but with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook. \u201cWhen the previous government left office, we had a triple-A credit rating,\u201d Tudehope said. \u201cWe had a pathway to a surplus, we had an infrastructure pipeline \u2026 All those things have now been flagged by the treasurer as things which are under threat.\u201d Another adjustment in the September budget would take into account a revision of the value of the government\u2019s assets that would lift their worth by $30bn. As a result of the revision, depreciation costs would also increase by hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Despite the state\u2019s ongoing fiscal headwinds, NSW\u2019s economy remains relatively robust with per-capita income likely to expand even as the national gauge is projected to go into retreat in the 2023-24 year. The jobless rate is at 3%, the lowest in half a century, and well below the 3.6% national average in May. Mookhey also reiterated concerns that a slate of mega-projects needed \u201cbig bailouts\u201d. Finishing Sydney Metro City and Southwest will cost at least $20.5bn \u2013 $9bn more than the original sticker price [and] $2bn more than we were last told,\u201d he told parliament. \u201cAnd it is years behind schedule too\u201d. \u201cSydney Metro West will cost more than $25bn; $12bn higher than the original forecast,\u201d he said. Similarly, the Western Harbour Tunnel was now likely to cost $7.4bn, compared with an early costing of $6.7bn, even though the contract had only been signed last December."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331976", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/20/venice-to-mantua-by-bike-and-boat-along-italys-glorious-po-valley", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Venice to Mantua: by bike and boat along Italy\u2019s glorious Po valley", "lead": "Using canals, rivers and quiet roads this cycling/boat break \u2013 \u2018a holiday not a road race\u2019 \u2013 takes riders to beautiful wetland scenery, ancient towns and delicious food", "author": "John Brunton", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 06:00:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173484", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0470a881073408010a52b025a78d228c9687cfd9/0_379_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "Ten years ago, while exploring the Renaissance city of Mantua in Lombardy, I bumped into a bunch of cyclists embarking on a \u201cbike and barge\u201d trip all the way to Venice. It sounded like the perfect way to hit the quiet backroads of the little-known Polesine region, which surrounds the Po River and stretches to the Adriatic. Finally, here I am, joining the trip (though in the opposite direction), boarding the Ave Maria, which is moored behind Palladio\u2019s iconic Redentore church on the island of Giudecca. The once rust-encrusted 42-metre transport boat was saved from the scrapheap by local tour operator Girolibero and transformed into a very comfortable 17-cabin floating hotel. My 32 fellow passengers are a cosmopolitan crowd: Britons, Berliners, Americans, Canadians and New Zealanders, ranging from a teenage student to sprightly retirees. Unlike me they are experienced cyclists, but the tour leader, Hein Hoefnagels, a superfit 74-year-old Dutchman, reassures me that \u201cthis is a holiday not a road race\u201d. We will be travelling at a leisurely pace, covering between 15 and 35 miles a day for eight days with lots of stop-offs (including the fishing port of Chioggia and the ancient town of Adria); the roads are flat \u2013 plus there\u2019s the option of an electric bike instead of a touring one. The boat sets off at 8am from Giudecca while we tuck into breakfast, slowly chugging across the lagoon to the northern tip of the lido, home to grand art deco villas and long sandy beaches. The keen bikers are kitted out in fluorescent spandex, some with their own cycling shoes and personal pedals; others, like myself, are in T-shirt and shorts. With more than 30 cyclists heading off along the lido\u2019s narrow promenade, at first I feel there is a Tour de France multi-crash waiting to happen. But the two guides, upfront and at the rear, make sure safety is the priority. The ride runs along the spectacular Murazzi sea wall, on to a ferry that crosses to the fisherman\u2019s island of Pellestrina, and ends by the wild dunes of the Ca\u2019Roman nature reserve. Keen birdwatchers head off on a hike with the junior guide, Irene Badone, an enthusiastic ornithologist, while stragglers like me climb back on to the Ave Maria where high tea awaits. It is one of the trip\u2019s many genuine sustainable initiatives; delicate salami and salad tramezzini sandwiches, cookies and fruit smoothies \u2013 all recycled from breakfast leftovers. Dinner is a delicious meal of thick bigoli spaghetti smothered with mackerel and wild fennel sauce, followed by sea bream roasted in a crunchy crust of potatoes and almonds. To complete a perfect day, the sun dramatically sets over the water. Most of us head to bed early (the comfortable cabins are a mix of doubles and a few bunks, all with en suites, and most have beautiful views over the water from portholes). Each evening after dinner, Hein talks us through what is in store the next day, highlighting historical, social and environmental issues as well as classic sightseeing. For Venice, he perfectly explains the problem of acqua alta floods and just how the Mose dam is helping. While approaching the Po delta, he talks about how climate change has affected the area, from deadly floods in 1951 to the present freshwater drought, which allows a \u201csaline tongue\u201d from the sea into the freshwater wetlands, meaning local farmers can no longer irrigate their crops with the increasingly saline water, and changing biodiversity threatens the traditional breeding grounds of clams and mussels. The Ave Maria\u2019s captain, Riccardo Tamani, is a mine of information too. A \u201cpaesano del Po\u201d, born here and working all his life on the river and its canals, he has seen lots of changes in his time. Today, he says, it is impossible to navigate on the Po because water levels have dropped dramatically, so he sticks to a network of canals, with cyclists following waterside towpaths alongside stretches of the Po, Adige and Brenta rivers. \u201cMuch of the fragile environment is under threat from annual droughts caused by global warming,\u201d says Riccardo, \u201cbut I am grateful that I can still earn my living bringing tourists here to discover the unique wetlands of my homeland.\u201d Each day brings a different set of surprises. After Venice, urban stops include Chioggia (for its canals and fish market), Ferrara (for stunning Unesco world heritage architecture), and Mantua (for beautiful lakes and palaces). But for most of us, the highlights are the more unexpected sights; riding a narrow path surrounded by the still waters of the Po delta nature reserve, passing a flock of pink flamingoes and ancient \u201ccasone\u201d cottages of wetlands fishers. Everyone loves the visit to a dairy making grana padano cheese, a local version of parmesan, and no one is prepared for the brilliant Museo della Giostra in the sleepy hamlet of Bergantino. As unlikely as it seems, for more than a century this has been where many of the fair rides for amusement parks across the globe have been made and the museum is utterly enchanting. The organisers certainly do everything to live up to their Girolibero name, giving the option of riding with the group and tour leader or downloading their free app to cycle independently. Want a rest day? Then stay on the boat as it navigates canals and locks. During the city stops, guests can join the guided tour or head off and explore alone; they can eat at a roadside trattoria or make a free packed lunch from the buffet breakfast. It\u2019s the perfect balance of comfort and independence \u2013 ideal for less adventurous cyclists who like a comfortable bed and great food. Girolibero runs a similar bike and barge trip in France, through the Camargue to Avignon, and when the time comes to pack luggage and disembark, many of the group are already considering that for next year\u2019s holiday. The trip was provided by Girolibero. The eight-day/seven-night tour (Venice to Mantua or vice versa) begins at \u20ac1,030pp (in a twin cabin) including breakfast, dinner, packed lunch, visits and walking tours.

I walked past, tears welling, and headed for frozen fish instead. Right at that moment, I was at the peak of what I look back on as my \u201cfertility freakout\u201d \u2013 a period when I struggled most with not having become a mother. I was 41, and still hoping I could change that. About a month before I wept in the pizza aisle, I had gone for a fertility test to understand whether, as a single woman, I could have a baby via donor sperm. I didn\u2019t expect to have the ovarian reserves of a 25-year-old, but seeing the test results printed in black and white at the clinic \u2013 that I only had about a one in 10 chance of producing an egg suitable for implantation \u2013 hit hard. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do this, now is the time,\u201d the consultant said, explaining that my fertility would decline sharply from there. A few weeks after the tests, I attended my first meeting at the Nurture Network, a monthly group for women (mothers or not). There, I found myself sitting in a circle announcing my fertility test results to 10 strangers. It was upsetting, but I felt relieved to be able to say out loud what I\u2019d dreaded acknowledging for years: that I may never give birth to a child. Some people know they don\u2019t want to have children, but I always did. During my 30s, I was ashamed not to have met someone I wanted to have a family with and felt embarrassed when colleagues or people at networking events asked if I had kids. I didn\u2019t think I needed to explain, but I also didn\u2019t feel strong enough to tell them it was none of their business. For a long time, I carried this feeling of shame around with me like a ball and chain. When friend after friend got pregnant, I was happy for them but sometimes pictured myself lying in a coffin, being nailed down, the box becoming darker as each one made their announcement. Yet there was always a chink of light in the corner, some hope to hold on to. When the UK, where I live, went into lockdown in March 2020, that hope was fading. I sought help from David Edmonds, a life coach who encouraged me to ask myself different questions from those I was stuck on. The first one he suggested was deceivingly simple: \u201cHow might I have a great life beyond having kids?\u201d At first I resisted, because asking this meant accepting that it might not happen. But eventually, I started to engage: who would I be if I didn\u2019t become a mother, and how could I feel fulfilled? The future finally held some possibilities, and slowly I decided to start opening up to them. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In my quest to find some answers, I seek counsel from Dr Gertrude Lyons, a relationship coach. I tell her I want to look deeper into why people say they want children, what longings they think they will fulfill, to try to understand whether those can be satisfied in other ways. \u201cA lot of people say: \u2018I want kids,\u2019 but when you start looking at yearnings, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I yearn to have an impact,\u201d she says. \u201cRaising a child, you feel like you\u2019re making a difference\u201d is something she often hears in her practice. I never truly asked myself why I wanted children \u2013 like many, I blindly assumed it would just happen. What I do know is that when my friends were getting pregnant, the feelings of missing out on what \u201ceveryone else\u201d was doing were strong, and they lived alongside the desire I had to nurture another human. And when the fertility consultant asked why I wanted kids, I blurted out, \u201cSo I don\u2019t die alone,\u201d although I knew that having children is no guarantee of care in later life. To get different perspectives, I send a message to a WhatsApp group where nine of my university friends regularly gather. I ask them why they chose to have children. Alongside the biological urge to do so, many say they wanted to have a focus for their love, someone to teach and learn from. Some acknowledge that the convention of having children resonated and others felt the pressure of meeting society\u2019s expectations. One points out that she has a lot of love to give outside her family, nurturing \u2013 or mothering \u2013 beyond her children. And another rightly suggests that the positivity I have started to feel is due in part to seeing how tough being a parent can be, which I recognize is bloody hard work and can come with its own identity crisis. Listening to them, I have the sense that I might be able to meet some of those needs outside of having kids. Lyons advises her clients to start thinking about their bigger vision or purpose in life, something beyond what they thought they would have or want. She advises people to write down what comes to mind without overthinking, or perhaps creating a collage. Some of her clients have even written poems or a song. Lyons often finds that what people envision is similar whether they want children or not. \u201cI still want to learn and grow; I still want to use my gifts and talents; I want to explore, expand and live to my potential,\u201d clients tell her. One night at the Nurture Network meeting, our homework was to create a life board where we allowed ourselves to dream of our futures. Alongside images showing my career and home ambitions (write a book, cultivate a garden), I cut out a magazine photo of a man standing in a field holding a child. I used to resist the idea of a vision board, discarding it as foolish, but digging deeper, my main concern was the \u201cwhat if\u201d factor, also known as fear. What if I glue a photo of a cute baby to a piece of cardboard and never have a child? Younger people I speak to in the \u201cwhat if it doesn\u2019t happen\u201d phase say they are concerned about missing human connection or being lonely. Like me, they want to hear positive stories about life beyond having kids. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Childfree women are indeed having a moment. Tracee Ellis Ross, Jennifer Aniston and Michelle Yeoh have all spoken about the desire or expectation that they would have children and how they came to terms with not having done so (Ellis Ross says she tries to think about it \u201cwith curiosity instead of heartbreak\u201d). The journalist Ruby Warrington\u2019s Women Without Kids book and podcast has also been a resounding success. It is, however, not only about women. Men are often left out of the conversation, in part because their fertility has not been regularly recorded by official data collectors. I want to know how they feel as well. It wasn\u2019t until 2019 that the United States Census Bureau released a report on men\u2019s fertility \u2013 using data from 2014 \u2013 revealing that almost a quarter of men aged 40 to 50 don\u2019t have children, compared with 16% of women in the same age group. Dr Robin Hadley wants to tell the stories of men who hoped to have children. He has carried out extensive research into the complexities of their situations, covering topics such as male broodiness and the impact of not having kids on older men, both emotionally and in terms of care provision. Hadley always wanted to have children but fell in love with a woman (now his wife) who had chosen not to. When we speak over video call, I ask him if he feels comfortable discussing his experience. He talks about his fondness for his neighbor\u2019s children, and tears come to his eyes. \u201cIt makes me emotional,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething is missing [when you don\u2019t have kids as a man], is what came up in my research,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t describe it, there\u2019s no words there, no narrative, no structure, no ritual \u2026 that\u2019s why I do all the stuff I do, because voices need to be heard,\u201d he tells me. Hadley interviewed 14 men aged between 49 and 82 who wanted to have children but haven\u2019t for his 2021 book, How Is a Man Supposed to Be a Man? Male Childlessness \u2013 A Life Course Disrupted, finding that many had a sense of loss, were concerned about their role in life, and were worried about being seen as pedophiles if they did interact with children. He disputes the idea that men don\u2019t have a biological clock, citing research showing that sperm declines in efficacy after the age of 35, and urges medics, therapists and policymakers to recognize the effect of not becoming a father will be different for each man. Hadley\u2019s book reveals the sadness those men feel, but some have found connection with children in the form of surrogate grandfather roles. Alan [not his real name], for example, a gay man who\u2019s 82, \u201cwas approached at a local football match by the father of two teenage boys to fill the role of \u2018adopted\u2019 grandfather for a school project\u201d, Hadley writes. This honorary grandad role continued for three years and then informally as the boys grew up, and the older child continued to yell \u201cGrandad!\u201d when Alan watched him play football. \u201cThat makes me feel like I belong. Makes me feel I\u2019m part of something,\u201d Alan told Hadley. Has Hadley found ways to fill the gap he felt when he didn\u2019t become a father? You can contribute positively to children\u2019s lives, whether you have your own or not, he says. In his previous career as a photographer, Hadley took on teenagers for work experience, and he enjoyed seeing their confidence grow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a biological contributor to give a legacy, to pass something on \u2026 Over quite a short timeframe, you can make a difference,\u201d he says. It gets me thinking. While I\u2019m fortunate to finally feel at peace right now, emotions and circumstances evolve. How might I feel when I get older? I talk to Catherine Rushforth, who, along with running the Nurture Network and working as a couples therapist, is a child-safeguarding expert who has contributed to UK government policy on early years development. She does not have children and explains that in her 20s, she had relationships where things might have \u201cled in that direction\u201d and later made the decision that she would only consider having children with someone who \u201cwould meaningfully be a joint co-parent with me\u201d. That didn\u2019t happen, and she is now 62 with no regrets. \u201cThere are many, many ways to live life. You know, your baby may be a different kind of baby,\u201d she tells me; hers is the safeguarding training consultancy she founded 30 years ago. Plus, she says, not having her own children means she has time to commit to supporting other people\u2019s. \u2022\u2022\u2022 I look back at the life board I made and realize that some of the images I included could be reframed. Instead of \u201cI would like a child\u201d, I am now ready to reconsider this as \u201cI would like to have children in my life\u201d, and I do: I am auntie to two cheeky and gorgeous little boys, and I love being godmother to a nine-year-old girl and a baby boy. I can also see that the images could represent feelings, like the vision Lyons talked about. Mine are a sense of achievement, contentment, joy and nurturing. Consciously or not, I have sought those out, and not having children is giving me time to find things that inspire those feelings. The freedom I now feel in not having kids might sound like a cliche, but it has allowed (and sometimes forced) me to work out what makes my heart sing. I\u2019ve taken improvisation classes and performed with a group on stage \u2013 the loss of control felt liberating \u2013 and I\u2019ve been traveling by myself to India, Bali and Vietnam. During the UK\u2019s second pandemic lockdown, I made and delivered flyers to about 150 homes on my street, inviting people to join a WhatsApp group, which helped me forge local connections. I even went clubbing with neighbors who are 20 years younger than me. I\u2019ve made many new friends by joining a co-working space, I write a newsletter, and I\u2019ve started weight training. This isn\u2019t the life of the lonely woman I once feared becoming; it\u2019s a joyful one that I have been fortunate enough to create. Letting go of the shame and accepting myself has meant I can now say \u201cno\u201d with confidence when someone asks if I have children. I no longer resent the question: sometimes it\u2019s asked by a parent seeking common ground, and I am now content to say that I haven\u2019t, and I don\u2019t feel the need to explain. I no longer feel like I\u2019m lying in a coffin: the lid is off, and I am free."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331978", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/20/makeup-review-secret-life-of-a-drag-artist-banker-underpins-tender-friendship-tale", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Makeup review \u2013 secret life of a drag-artist banker underpins tender friendship tale", "lead": "The story of an unlikely friendship between a city type and a haughty Frenchman has moments of genuine pathos but doesn\u2019t quite feel real", "author": "Cath Clarke", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 06:00:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173521", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/81d363aa4717385f10e7ac2fe64a15a863f3c12c/186_158_1317_790/500.jpg", "body": "This low-key, low-budget portrait of an odd-couple friendship takes a while to get going, and never fully hits its stride \u2013 though it has its moments.

When Dan cooks soup, picky gourmand Sacha looks appalled in the way that only a Frenchman can at the claggy dollop of peanut butter slopped into his bowl. There\u2019s a real sweetness, too, in Masheter\u2019s performance as Dan begins to live more openly, tiptoeing into the world of cabaret \u2013 and, if nothing else, watching his self-expression blossom is a reminder of how sinister the anti-drag laws are that are currently sweeping the US.

The movie deals unconvincingly with a disciplinary procedure at Dan\u2019s banking firm, where his line manager takes action that I\u2019m certain no city boss would dare to, fearing an expensive lawsuit or bad publicity.

At a time when much of the UK was barred from socialising indoors, staff are seen drinking wine and mocking Covid-19 rules. At one point, a couple wearing Christmas jumpers laugh and dance past a sign that says: \u201cPlease keep your distance.\u201d Two of the people present are on Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. On Monday, 48 hours later, MPs \u2013 those who bothered to turn up \u2013 gathered to consider Johnson\u2019s fate.The Commons voted to accept the privileges committee report; 225 MPs abstained. The prime minister was reportedly busy elsewhere. As Rishi Sunak\u2019s allies put it, they are just keen \u201cto move on\u201d. Quite. Time to get over it. Though I imagine that is easier if you\u2019re a Tory cabinet member seeking re-election rather than say, a child who said goodbye to their dying mum over an iPad during lockdown. Since Partygate stories first emerged, the government has worked to convince the public that nothing really happened \u2013 and if it did, that it didn\u2019t really matter. It was just a cake. They were work meetings. The broken swing and suitcase of booze were simply hardworking staff blowing off steam. (That no picture emerged of nurses partying in an intensive care unit presumably means they weren\u2019t really working at all.) Any criticism \u2013 even by a parliamentary committee \u2013 is said to be politically motivated. A \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. As the Covid inquiry continues this week, the attitude of many Conservatives could best be described as \u201cbury the bodies and get on\u201d. Sunak \u2013 who has reportedly not found the time to read the full privileges committee report \u2013 has the air of a fan bored of his favourite TV show\u2019s long-running storyline. By the time the leaked video of a party emerged, it was already old news to some. Much of the rightwing media are more than happy to peddle this narrative. As Nick Ferrari said on LBC on Monday, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we need to chase 22 people for dancing.\u201d It is not as if these tactics have been wholly unsuccessful. If there is one thing the spectacle of the past few days has confirmed, it is just how few consequences there really are for a certain class of people with power. Johnson may be wounded but he has slipped out of parliament with his characteristic non-stick coating, failing upwards to a lucrative newspaper column and the praise of loyalist MPs and press already salivating for his return. His biggest loss will be a parliamentary pass. The Met police suggest action will be taken over the party footage, but they did not do so earlier, and it\u2019s not likely any fine issued now would dent anyone\u2019s career. Shaun Bailey \u2013 whose London mayoral campaign team were in the leaked video, and who was previously photographed smiling at the party \u2013 will now sit in the House of Lords after Johnson gave him a peerage. Ben Mallett \u2013 a Tory aide seen in the film wearing festive braces \u2013 has been awarded an OBE. Mallett, it\u2019s worth noting, is said to be a close friend of Carrie Johnson. Contrast that with the ordinary members of the public who stuck to the rules during the lockdowns, many of whom now have to live with the life-changing sacrifices they made in order to do so. There are countless stories I could mention, not least the thousands shared on social media in recent days from people forced to relive the loss of loved ones to whom they will never get a chance to say goodbye. My mind keeps coming back to 13-year-old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab. Described by his family as a \u201cgentle and kind\u201d boy with a \u201cheartwarming\u201d smile, Ismail died in hospital at the height of the pandemic without his family by his side. Neither his parents nor his brothers or sisters could go to his funeral. Two of his siblings had Covid-19 symptoms and the family self-isolated. They followed the rules. They followed the rules and they watched their little boy\u2019s burial on a live-stream from home. In the days after his death, Ismail\u2019s family urged the public \u201cto listen to government guidance\u201d and \u201censure that we adhere to social distancing\u201d. What they didn\u2019t know, of course, was that those at the very top of government would soon be breaking the rules themselves \u2013 and laughing as they did so. Fast-forward three years: Johnson exits largely unshaken, his chums are honoured, and we\u2019re told to move on. It\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that they are still laughing, and squarely at us.

She had this kid who was a rascal, and one day the police called to say he\u2019d been nicked for some rascally behaviour. \u201cTo his credit,\u201d they said, \u201che doesn\u2019t have any previous convictions.\u201d She replied: \u201cWell, give him a chance \u2013 he\u2019s only 13.\u201d Her voice popped into my head the other day when I was worrying about my daughter, and how non-alcohol-curious she is. Well, give her a chance \u2013 she\u2019s only 13. But my nieces are the same way, and they\u2019re older. My sister and I decided a while ago that this was our doing: they\u2019d taken one look at us, or to be accurate, a million looks at us, and decided the Aperol bounce wasn\u2019t for them. And while I\u2019m almost immune to parental guilt, I did feel fantastically bad about the idea that I might, just by enjoying it too much, have put my kids off alcohol. The drop-off in drinking among 16- to 25-year-olds is striking. Festivals have to order alcohol-free lager to cater to the new demographic, which is just peculiar \u2013 if you never got a taste for regular lager, why not drink squash? Gen Z are more likely to be teetotal than any other age group; if they drink at all, they start at a later age than we did, they consume smaller amounts and less frequently. This is not just the UK \u2013 it\u2019s Europe-wide. Realistically, this cannot have been caused by me and my sister. The social-media explanation is plausible, if depressing. It\u2019s an era where everything is recorded and nothing gets forgotten; where half the point of doing anything at all is to take a picture of yourself doing it. What goes on tour no longer stays on tour; indeed, every tiny event of the tour could be burned into the retina of a future employer. I think the impossibility of forgetting has got into their bloodstream, and now they think of their own brains as data storage, from which it would be catastrophic if anything were to go missing, on par with losing your phone or accidentally wiping your hard drive. Some early-adopter teetotal twentysomethings were interviewed about their choice, and one phrase came up again and again: they wanted to be able to remember the night before. It seemed so alarmist, such an overstatement: you can usually remember most of it, and what you can\u2019t will float back to you over the course of the day, until it disappears forever in a week and a half; plus, it won\u2019t all have been massively consequential. If you lose an hour of your best friend telling you about the jacket she can\u2019t decide whether to get in black or brown, and also that she loves you, is that the end of the world? I think of all the situations I would have found completely untenable, as a young person, without several cans of Tennent\u2019s. Festivals, for sure \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere to hide except the tent you haven\u2019t put up correctly; parties, specifically the unique, exquisite awkwardness of feeling so visible, so conspicuous, so out of place, and yet at the same time, so irrelevant, so blank, so entirely uninteresting; university, which is as bad as a party \u2013 all the strangers, all the performance anxiety, except you have to live there; the first forays into work, as bad as university except now you don\u2019t know how a fax machine works and that\u2019s your entire job.

But there are few people whose opinions I would rather have. Stanley is a highly articulate proponent of pop rather than rock (his previous book was Let\u2019s Do It: The Birth of Pop) and a practitioner himself, with his group Saint Etienne. Pop has come in out of the cold in recent years, Blondie as likely to be pontificated about as Led Zeppelin, but the Bee Gees \u2013 who were certainly \u201cpop\u201d, despite evolving through quasi-psychedelia into R&amp;B and disco \u2013 remain, as Stanley writes, \u201cothered\u201d, rarely accorded the respect they deserve. And he suggests that such praise as they do receive tends to be conditional: \u201cIt\u2019s the Bee Gees\u2026 but it\u2019s really good.\u201d In 1997, they walked off Clive Anderson\u2019s chatshow when he said: \u201cYou\u2019re hit writers\u2026 I think that\u2019s the word\u2026 We\u2019re one letter short.\u201d A more subtle, and accurate, insinuation might have been that the Bee Gees were odd, and Stanley speaks of these three \u201cstrange brothers\u201d. They were born in the Isle of Man, Barry (the only surviving one) in 1946, the twins, Robin and Maurice, in 1949. Their father, an itinerant fading band leader, moved the family to Manchester, where in 1957 the three sang Wake Up Little Susie at the Gaumont picture house in Chorlton. The following year, the Gibbs moved to Australia, where the brothers became child stars and Barry started writing songs: \u201cI like to make up the tunes I sing,\u201d he told the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly. \u201cI get the words from romance magazines.\u201d \u201cWe were like the Bront\u00eb sisters,\u201d said Robin, meaning they created their own world. They were bound together by three-part harmony, much like Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and his younger siblings, Carl and Dennis. But Stanley mentions that, whereas Brian Wilson was born on the cusp of the summer solstice, Robin and Maurice Gibb were born on the winter solstice, and it seems the Manchester rain, rather than Australian sun, persisted in the hits they scored on returning to Britain in the late 1960s. Their songs were \u201crainy\u201d, \u201cmelancholic\u201d, \u201cdeath-haunted\u201d. New York Mining Disaster 1941 is about being buried alive. I\u2019ve Gotta Get a Message to You was from the perspective of a condemned prisoner. The most melancholic and romantic \u2013 in a gloomy Victorian sort of way \u2013 was Robin, who was given to waistcoats and fob watches. Typical of his output was I Started a Joke, in which he sang, in his somehow compelling, bleating tones: \u201cI finally died / Which started the whole world living\u201d, a proposition that \u201craised questions among the heads\u201d, writes Stanley, who suggests that the Bee Gees wrote English \u201cas if it were a second language\u201d, creating a dreamy, dislocated effect. (Think of Stayin\u2019 Alive: \u201cWell, you can tell by the way I use my walk\u2026\u201d) Robin resented Barry\u2019s domination of the singing and songwriting, and in 1969 the Bee Gees split. Re-forming a year later, they began a run of \u201cconfusing\u201d but \u201cstrangely fascinating\u201d albums with songs in a variety of styles, but mainly slow. Their late 1970s shift towards R&amp;B was encouraged by the producer Arif Mardin, who suggested about one song that they \u201ckick it up an octave\u201d \u2013 and so Barry\u2019s falsetto was unleashed. Their \u201cslew of classics\u201d for the film Saturday Night Fever marked their high point as a band, but as songwriters they hadn\u2019t yet peaked. The \u201cdisco sucks\u201d backlash involved the public burning of Bee Gees records in the US. They were in good company, since Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson records were also burned, but the brothers (\u201cconfident\u201d yet \u201cinsecure\u201d) retreated, becoming songwriters for hire and producing work that, for Stanley, \u201cplaces them among the greats\u201d. Woman in Love, for Barbra Streisand, begins: \u201cLife is a moment in space\u201d, and has a production as \u201castral and gaseous\u201d as the lyrics. Heartbreaker served Dionne Warwick\u2019s \u201cwhite witch energy\u201d. Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers were a \u201csweet-and-salty\u201d combination on Islands in the Stream. Stanley\u2019s description of sound is a constant pleasure. One of Robin\u2019s songs is \u201cfoggy\u201d. Take Me I\u2019m Yours by Squeeze is \u201csquelchy\u201d. So here\u2019s a summer project for pop fans: read this book, then listen to the music. \u2022 Andrew Martin is an author, who also writes music as Brunswick Green \u2022 Bee Gees: Children of the World by Bob Stanley is published by Nine Eight Books (\u00a322).

In late 2017, the Guardian started publishing a series of stories that highlighted numerous cases of mistreatment from the Home Office towards Caribbean-born UK residents who had migrated during the Windrush era, between 1948 and 1971. For six months the investigation quietly rumbled on, revealing how people\u2019s lives were destroyed after they were incorrectly classified as illegal immigrants, rendering them unable to stay employed, or to access housing or other public services. Many were deported to countries they had not lived in since they were children \u2013 24 of those people died before the government could contact them to apologise for its error. By the time of that apology, the issue had become a political scandal that resulted in the resignation of the home secretary, Amber Rudd. An independent review found uncovered \u201cprofound institutional failure\u201d that had destroyed hundreds of people\u2019s lives. In the years since, the government has faced significant political and legal scrutiny over its handling of a crisis that seemingly had brewed for decades. On the 75th anniversary of the HMT Empire Windrush docking at the Port of Tilbury in Essex, the Home Office has reportedly closed down its transformation directorate, the unit tasked with handling changes meant to prevent a repeat of the scandal. Staff were told via video call that it would be discontinued by the end of this month, despite reports that the department has failed to adequately reform its culture and to implement changes to ensure that people would be treated more humanely in future. I spoke to Amelia Gentleman \u2013 the Guardian reporter who broke the Windrush scandal story and wrote the book The Windrush Betrayal, Exposing the Hostile Environment \u2013 about whether much has actually changed in Britain since the story first came to light. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Titanic | Search and rescue teams have been in a race against time to find a tourist sub that went missing in the north Atlantic while on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic.

The prime minister said the government should \u201cstick to the plan\u201d to halve inflation in its attempts to tackle the cost of living crisis. Health | David Cameron has admitted failures in his government\u2019s preparations for a pandemic but defended the austerity drive that he and his chancellor, George Osborne, imposed, saying \u201cyour health system is only as strong as your economy\u201d. In depth: \u2018The Home Office will try to say it\u2019s time to move on. But a lot of people would disagree\u2019 News of the Windrush scandal rocked Westminister and the country. But as the current home secretary, Suella Braverman, continues to use inflammatory and dehumanising language to describe asylum seekers and migrants, the question remains, have any lessons really been learned? *** The crisis This week marks 75 years since the Empire Windrush (pictured below) arrived in the UK, bringing with it the first members of a generation who had been encouraged to move to the UK after the second world war to rebuild the country and revitalise the economy. The 1971 Immigration Act gave Commonwealth citizens \u2013 including those from former colonies in South Asia and Africa \u2013 the right to live and work in the UK permanently. People built their lives in Britain for decades, had children and grandchildren, worked, paid taxes and engaged in public life. But in 2018 it was revealed that these citizens, many of whom were from the Caribbean, were wrongly denied access to basic public services, charged for life-saving medical treatment and even detained and deported, because the government did not keep records of those granted permission to stay and had not provided them the paperwork needed to verify their status. In fact, it came to light that in 2010 the Home Office had destroyed thousands of landing card slips that recorded people\u2019s arrival dates in the UK. Since the introduction of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy in the early 2010s \u2013 which tasked various public institutions with enforcing immigration controls \u2013 at least 83 people have been wrongfully deported. The stories caused shockwaves. Historically, the public has often veered towards a more anti-immigration perspective, but this was different. \u201cIt was really the first time that public sympathies were with the victims of Home Office decisions,\u201d Amelia explains. \u201cThere was complete cross-party recognition that a terrible mistake had been made, which raised lots of questions about race in Britain, and how it was that a large cohort of people had been suffering so badly for such a long time without anybody noticing.\u201d *** *** The transformation directorate Amelia found out about the goings on at the transformation directorate, a special Home Office unit, after whistleblowers approached her about its closure (\u201cIt\u2019s not a unit that\u2019s been particularly well-publicised or one that we\u2019ve got much awareness of what its function is\u201d). In reporting this story, she found that the unit\u2019s role expanded after the Windrush scandal to take responsibility for implementing the reform agenda that Sajid Javid, Priti Patel \u2013 and later Suella Braverman \u2013 all claimed to have signed up to. Its success is up for debate. Earlier this year, analysis of the 30 recommendations made by the Windrush review found that just eight had been met, 13 had been partially met, and nine had not been met or were dropped. As recently as February, it was clear that there was still a huge amount of work to be done. \u201cWe need to find out how well they\u2019ve done with finishing all of that work,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cI suspect that when they decide to formally announce the closure of the unit, the Home Office will try to say it\u2019s done and it\u2019s time to move on. But I think a lot of people close to the work would disagree and say that there\u2019s a lot left outstanding.\u201d *** Suella Braverman\u2019s Home Office It is clear that the Home Office under Braverman wants to draw a clear line under the scandal. She also wants to further toughen the immigration system, and by extension make life more difficult for asylum seekers and migrants. \u201cThe hostile environment policy, which has been rebranded as the compliance environment, remains in place,\u201d Amelia says, \u201cso I don\u2019t think it serves the Home Office\u2019s interests under Suella Braverman to be self-critical about what happened during the Windrush scandal. Within this reform agenda [the point was to] reshape the culture of the Home Office to make it fairer towards individual immigrants, to make the immigration system more humane and more compassionate. That agenda isn\u2019t really in keeping with the goals of the Home Office.\u201d *** Has anything changed? There have been some positive changes. There was, for example, a widespread drive to give documentation to people who did not have it. \u201cThat scheme has worked really well,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cAlmost 16,000 people who didn\u2019t have documentation now have it \u2013 that has been done very swiftly and very successfully.\u201d As a result, people were able to find work, accommodation, and access the NHS and their pensions. Some people who were deported or denied re-entry were brought back to the UK. And while the Windrush compensation scheme has been criticised as being too slow, narrow and prescriptive, it is still there and has given some people financial relief. *** Where does the Home Office find itself now? \u201cAfter the scandal, there was a lot of soul-searching within the Home Office about how it could have found itself in a position where it got something so wrong for such a long time, without civil servants feeling able to raise the alarm,\u201d Amelia says. Civil servants have since been encouraged to take a more compassionate approach to immigration and asylum applications through training programs that encourage more thoughtfulness and educate workers on the country\u2019s history of colonialism and racism. While this is certainly better than nothing, there is a disconnect between these attempts to humanise the immigration process and the government\u2019s political stance, which has only gotten more hardline. Despite the government\u2019s best efforts to close this chapter, it is clear that the Windrush scandal remains unresolved.

Now 38, she has spent most of her adult life trying to process \u2013 and heal from \u2013 the years of violence she endured at the hands of her father during the 90s. \u201cIt started very early,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mum said that when I was a baby, he would use my cart as a balance for his gun while he\u2019d shoot groundhogs.\u201d Later, he would beat Bernath to the point where it was painful to sit down. Didn\u2019t her teachers notice? \u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201cno one questioned.\u201d At first glance, Bernath\u2019s family were the sort that others in their community in the US state of Virginia might envy: her father was a successful storyboard artist working regularly with companies such as Disney and Coca-Cola, and her mother was a model from England. They lived in a \u201chuge house\u201d away from anyone else. But behind closed doors, all Bernath remembers was violence. Describing an average day, she starts with the nights. \u201cHe would scream until three or four in the morning,\u201d saying things like, \u201c\u2018I hate you, you should be dead. You\u2019re not good enough to be my daughter. No one will ever love you. You are disgusting.\u2019\u201d Such emotional abuse was daily, as was the neglect. \u201cHe\u2019d sometimes lock me out of the house at night with just a packet of biscuits.\u201d When he hit her \u2013 which he would do most days, usually with slaps or pushes, though sometimes with sticks \u2013 he would do so in sets of a hundred, and if she cried, he would double it. \u201cHe\u2019d say: \u2018This is because I love you. If your mother loved you as much as I did, she would be doing this.\u2019 It completely warped my perception of what love was.\u201d One minute he\u2019d be hitting her and the next he\u2019d suddenly \u201cbe sobbing on the ground, saying: \u2018Just kill yourself. Everything was OK until you were born.\u2019\u201d \u201cEverything was just madness,\u201d she says. Her father projected on to her something he felt he had inside of himself. \u201cAs soon as I was born, he said he saw a devil or some bad energy in me, the same he had.\u201d He wasn\u2019t religious then, although he did become so eventually. Alcohol made it worse. He would often drink solidly for nights on end during a storyboarding assignment. \u201cMy dad was abusive when he was sober and drunk, but the alcohol definitely released his inhibitions,\u201d she says. Even when she was as young as five, she remembers, she would feel truly miserable. \u201cPeople think that children bounce back and aren\u2019t aware of what\u2019s going on \u2026 but as a child you have no formed self. You are just forming or deforming in response to the trauma. It\u2019s the entire way you interact with yourself and the world. You just are the walking embodiment of that abuse.\u201d Bernath describes being an \u201coutsider\u201d at school, where she kept the abuse secret. Although she wasn\u2019t bullied, she had only one friend and struggled to make others. \u201cI was so confused about what love is. I tried to make friends on the first day by giving kids Chinese burns.\u201d When she was 10, she was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She was \u201cjust always wanting to flee \u2013 and that transmuted as hyperactivity. And I was exhausted. I was only getting a few hours of sleep.\u201d Bernath was close to her mum. \u201cShe was the most beautiful, warm, loving, kind woman. She was just trapped. So although she didn\u2019t protect me, I think of her as very down and depressed.\u201d Although to Bernath it always felt like the violence was directed more at her, there is a lot she can\u2019t account for. \u201cMy mum already had a broken leg when she broke her arm and she had to drive herself to hospital. I don\u2019t know how she broke her arm but given he slammed my arm under a window when he saw me bite my nails, I can hazard a guess. It\u2019s things like that.\u201d Her father controlled her mother right down to her wardrobe. \u201cHe threw out all the Biba and put her in what he wanted \u2013 very conservative clothes.\u201d And, as is typical in domestic abuse cases, he isolated her from family and friends. Bernath remembers begging her mother to leave him. \u201cApparently, when I was two, we put him on the train and I said: \u2018Well, Daddy\u2019s gone. Let\u2019s go get a new one.\u2019\u201d As the years passed, the alcoholism \u2013 and the violence that came with it \u2013 steadily progressed. \u201cWe thought he\u2019d kill us. I\u2019m sure my dad even said it to my mum sometimes.\u201d He always made it clear that if they told anyone he would \u201cdestroy\u201d them. On one occasion, when Bernath was 10, her mother did take them to Al-Anon, a support group for families of alcoholics. \u201cHe found out when we got home. He was just going mad, it was terrifying. That was the biggest thing in my childhood, being permanently terrified and thinking, he\u2019ll kill me.\u201d That night, her father got into bed with her. \u201cHe started saying: \u2018It\u2019s because I love you\u2019 and \u2018Your mum doesn\u2019t love me any more\u2019, like poor me, and \u2018You need to show me how much you love me\u2019.\u201d Then, she says: \u201cHe climbed on top of me. And I just froze, because I knew. But then he passed out and I just lay under him, still, until it was time to get up for school. I was terrified of what would happen if I moved.\u201d Bernath says that while she never explicitly told her mother what happened, she must have known because the next day, as they were driving home from school, her mother said: \u201cWe have to go now.\u201d As they pulled up outside the house, \u201cshe told me to go in there and say to him: \u2018It\u2019s us or the drink.\u2019 So I did.\u201d Her father \u201clost the plot and charged out after us. I jumped in the car and we sped off but he chased us.\u201d They drove over the treacherous roads of the Blue Ridge Mountains. \u201cI was looking over the back of the seat at him, [saying] \u2018He\u2019s coming, he\u2019s coming.\u2019\u201d Her mother drove as if her life depended on it \u2013 and arguably it did. \u201cWe went round the windy corners and as it was becoming dusk, at the right moment she swooshed down under this bridge, turned off the lights and we just sat there. My heart was just pounding. He drove past. And then we waited, just utter silence.\u201d Eventually, when it felt safe, they drove to a friend\u2019s home to spend the night. The next day, they began the long process of separating their lives from him. But just as they were escaping one threat, they faced another. Not long before that fateful day, Bernath\u2019s mother had learned that a lump in her breast was cancerous and that, without medical intervention, she would have only months to live. She had kept it secret from her husband but managed to access treatment. When he learned about it, however, he cut off the medical insurance, preventing her from getting further care. It wasn\u2019t until some time later \u2013 Bernath is unclear of the time frame \u2013 that her mother was able to restart the treatment she so desperately needed and that gave her three more years of life. Mother and daughter had made it to England to live with Bernath\u2019s grandmother, \u201ca true feminist powerhouse, and one of the first women at Oxford\u201d. Things started to get better. \u201cThat was when I finally got a mum. Every minute she was out of there,\u201d she says, referring to her marriage to her father, \u201cshe was incredible.\u201d When her mother died, \u201cthe ground came out from beneath me. That was genuinely the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u201d Yet within the safety and support of her grandmother\u2019s home she was able to keep going. An insurance fund from her mother\u2019s death allowed her to go to private school, and during the holidays she\u2019d return to her loving home. This part of her life was not completely trouble free, however: at one point her father threatened to abduct her, and an order was issued to prevent him from contacting her until she was 21. But \u201cthe structure\u201d of schooling helped. She was high achieving, went to Cambridge and managed to make plenty of friends. Recovery from trauma is never linear \u2013 there are always ups and downs, and parts of one\u2019s life can be out of control even when others are orderly. So, although Bernath was enjoying university life and finding her way as an actor, she was engaged in \u201cself-harm\u201d \u2013 battling an eating disorder \u2013 and \u201cbingeing into oblivion\u201d through her 20s. Furthermore, the yearning for a parent led her to reach out to her father, who was by then living in New York. \u201cI wanted to believe he\u2019d changed,\u201d she says. They would speak over the phone and on email, and although there were times she would have to cut him off when he distressed her too much \u2013 such as during a call when he \u201cboasted he had passed out with a heroin needle in his arm\u201d \u2013 he could be loving and proud of the daughter whose star was rising. But, at other times, \u201che would say negative things and it would just absolutely destroy me\u201d. She recalls a time when she had been holidaying in Thailand with a boyfriend. They had been off-grid for a while and she hadn\u2019t had a signal to contact her father. When she finally did, he began \u201cscreaming things down the phone: \u2018You\u2019re unlovable, you\u2019re disgusting, you should be dead.\u2019 When he did that, I could just put the phone on the side as he yelled and go and have a swim.\u201d Once, she gave the phone to her boyfriend and \u201chis jaw just dropped\u201d. He implored her to cut ties and, for a time, she did. A few weeks later, while filming St Trinian\u2019s, Bernath was in Tesco when her agent phoned to tell her that her father had died. She had to identify the body through photos. \u201cHe had decomposed because he hadn\u2019t been found for two weeks,\u201d she recollects. Any chance of reconciliation, or even confrontation about what happened, was gone. But, traumatised by years of violence, she was \u201cglad that he died. I walked away from my inheritance \u2013 I didn\u2019t want anything to do with it.\u201d Did she feel frustrated or robbed of the chance for some semblance of justice? No, she says: \u201cHe\u2019s dead and probably died quite horribly so there was karmic justice.\u201d Now, her life is \u201cutterly full of joy\u201d. Learning to feel that joy took time and work. Therapy \u2013 \u201cand lots of it\u201d \u2013 helped her understand her eating disorder as an unhealthy method of processing the trauma. \u201cWhat I found was that you can actually just completely get over it,\u201d she says. \u201cNot the feelings behind it \u2013 they stay a lot longer \u2013 but the actual behaviour can go.\u201d Part of her remarkable recovery has been learning about the psychological theory of \u201cthe internal or the external locus of control\u201d. As Bernath says: \u201cWhen you are a child, you\u2019re genuinely so powerless. But when you are an adult, you can be a victim to the external where it\u2019s like, \u2018until they apologise, we\u2019re all stuck\u2019. But actually it is all up to me.\u201d She has learned to identify when the trauma is talking. Take her perfectionism, which she came to realise she had developed as a coping strategy. \u201cI thought if I could just be perfect, then he\u2019d love me and I\u2019d be safe.\u201d Of course, it was never enough. Even when she achieved things, an internal voice would still tell her: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have won that,\u201d or \u201cWork harder\u201d. With the wisdom therapy brings, she has realised that this was the internalised voice of her abuser, but also that of the little girl who just wanted to be perfect. This realisation has helped her bring compassion even to the \u201cnegative\u201d thoughts in her head. With ongoing therapy, she is, she says, learning to feel a whole range of healthy emotions again, not just the positive ones. \u201cSometimes the anger in you is the part that loves you the most, because that\u2019s the bit that says it\u2019s not OK to treat me like that. Or the sadness is the vulnerability in you that allows you to genuinely connect with someone.\u201d Alongside the therapy, it was meeting the love of her life \u2013 her husband, Ollie \u2013 that finally pushed her beyond the clawing reach of her demons. \u201cThrough him loving me, I saw that I was worthy of love and that the love I had to give was worthy of being received. You have to feel safe to feel happy.\u201d Bernath is aware that \u201c50% of people who have been abused in childhood end up in domestic abuse situations.\u201d Thankfully, she says, Ollie is the \u201cantithesis\u201d of her father. This victory, of ending the cycle of abuse, was felt most acutely when she became a mother. \u201cThere were times when I\u2019d look at my daughter and think: \u2018I was that age when I was being beaten up and starved and hated.\u2019\u201d While she is, she says, \u201cnot a perfect mum\u201d to her two daughters \u2013 \u201cmy kids eat too much junk and watch too much television \u2013 she is proud to have ended the cycle of abuse. Indeed, it is that possibility \u2013 that such cycles can be ended \u2013 that drives her each day. She is telling her story in the hope that it might help others suffering domestic abuse, which is estimated to affect about one in four women and one in 10 children. \u201cShame drives people into silence. We need a culture where it\u2019s OK to talk about this. I want to be part of a call to arms to do whatever is possible to change that.\u201d In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid.

While previous research has suggested long naps could be an early symptom of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, other work has revealed that a brief doze can improve people\u2019s ability to learn. Now researchers say they have found evidence to suggest napping may help to protect against brain shrinkage. That is of interest, the team say, as brain shrinkage, a process that occurs with age, is accelerated in people with cognitive problems and neurodegenerative diseases, with some research suggesting this may be related to sleep problems. \u201cIn line with these studies, we found an association between habitual daytime napping and larger total brain volume, which could suggest that napping regularly provides some protection against neurodegeneration through compensating for poor sleep,\u201d the researchers note. Writing in the journal Sleep Health, researchers at UCL and the University of the Republic in Uruguay report how they drew on data from the UK Biobank study that has collated genetic, lifestyle and health information from 500,000 people aged 40 to 69 at recruitment. The team used data from 35,080 Biobank participants to look at whether a combination of genetic variants that have previously been associated with self-reported habitual daytime napping are also linked to brain volume, cognition and other aspects of brain health. Given that such variants are set at birth and are assumed to be randomly assigned, the approach allows researchers to probe the effect of napping on the brain by reducing the impact of lifestyle factors that can influence people\u2019s napping habits and brain health, such as smoking or physical activity. \u201cIt is like a natural randomised control trial,\u201d said Dr Victoria Garfield, a co-author of the study from University College London, adding that the variants were quite common. \u201cThey\u2019re present in around at least 1% of the population, which is actually quite a lot of people.\u201d Indeed, while it first appeared that participants who reported never or rarely having a daytime nap had a larger total brain volume, the team found the reverse relationship when genetic predisposition to napping was considered, suggesting the initial finding could have been down to other factors muddying the relationship between a daytime doze and brain size. Overall, the team found an association between genetic predisposition to habitual daytime napping and larger brain volume equivalent to 2.6 to 6.5 fewer years of ageing, although there was no relationship with cognitive performance such as reaction times. \u201cIt could be having a short daytime nap \u2026 could help preserve brain volume and that\u2019s a positive thing, potentially, [for] dementia prevention,\u201d said Garfield, adding that previous research suggested a duration of up 30 minutes may be beneficial. Garfield noted there were a plethora of risk factors that could lead to dementia, while many other factors can also affect brain volume. What\u2019s more, the study is based on data only from white British people, and the exact duration of naps associated with the benefits are unclear. It is also unclear if the same benefits of napping would be seen in people without a predisposition. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the president of the British Neuroscience Association, a group leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute, and deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, welcomed the study, although she said it had limitations including that the self-reported napping habits of UK Biobank participants may not be entirely accurate. \u201cThis study is important because it adds to the data indicating sleep is important for brain health,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331980", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/nature-at-risk-of-breakdown-if-cop15-pledges-not-met-world-leaders-warned", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nature at risk of breakdown if Cop15 pledges not met, world leaders warned", "lead": "Author of landmark UK review into the economic value of nature joins UN environment chief in calls for \u2018action, not just words\u2019 on biodiversity goals", "author": "Patrick Greenfield", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 05:00:33", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173663", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/045c97fc9b16b3dac742bf38b34270e0e7edc502/0_67_3460_2076/500.jpg", "body": "Humans are exploiting nature beyond its limits, the University of Cambridge economist Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta has warned, as the UN\u2019s environment chief calls on governments to make good on a global deal for biodiversity, six months after it was agreed. Dasgupta, the author of a landmark review into the economic importance of nature commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2021, said it was a mistake to continue basing economic policies on the postwar boom that did not account for damage to the planet. Speaking to the Guardian six months after Cop15, where countries agreed this decade\u2019s targets to protect nature, Dasgupta cautioned that a headline goal to protect 30% of land and sea should not lead to the destruction of the remaining 70%. He reiterated a recommendation from his 2021 report that companies must disclose the parts of their supply chain that rely on nature, so governments can take action on halting biodiversity loss. Since the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework was agreed in December 2022, there has been a deal to protect the high seas and first steps towards a legally binding UN treaty to regulate plastic waste. The first few months of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s presidency in Brazil has seen reductions in deforestation in the Amazon, although nature has become a culture wars issue in the EU, with proposals on restoration and pesticide reduction facing fierce opposition. An informal update on progress towards reaching the 23 targets and four goals included in the Montreal agreement is expected to be made at Cop28 in Dubai amid continuing scientific warnings about the health of the planet. \u201cIt is a truism: if the demand for nature\u2019s products and services continues to exceed its ability to supply, then there is going to be a breakdown,\u201d said Dasgupta. \u201cIt is a finite resource. We know when fisheries are depleted by continuous overfishing, it leads to the destruction of a fishery. Now try to imagine that at the scale of the biosphere. \u201cThis excess demand [for nature] is only about 50 years old. There\u2019s been a great acceleration in that demand since the second world war. This experience is guiding policy and it\u2019s a real mistake because it has come at a big expense to natural capital. The decline has not been recorded in statistics. It doesn\u2019t show up in national accounts,\u201d he added. \u201cAs an economist, I like to look at small societies as a prototype of the world economy. Studying poorer village economies tells you a lot: they are deeply dependent on natural capital. Many such societies have fallen under. We\u2019ve seen this in Sudan with rainless areas, skinny cattle and people migrating miles and miles. It is not as if we don\u2019t know what happens when nature breaks down.\u201d Among the targets and goals agreed in Montreal by all governments, except the Vatican and the US, were aims to protect 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade, reform $500bn (\u00a3410bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies and restore 30% of the planet\u2019s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN environment programme, said now was the time for action from governments and businesses to make the agreement reality. \u201cWe should be very proud of what was achieved. It is words on a piece of paper. We need to make them real. Everyone needs to adjust their targets and move this beyond the environment ministry to all sectors. It needs the whole of society. Action now has to be seen, not just in words,\u201d she said. Dasgupta\u2019s 2021 report, inspired by the 2006 Nicholas Stern review that transformed economic understanding of climate breakdown, found the world\u2019s economies are being put at \u201cextreme risk\u201d by the failure to account for the state of the natural world, and called for radical reform. \u201cI know there is a target to protect 30% of the planet in the [Cop15] deal. But the trouble with that is what happens to the other 70%. If you don\u2019t have a policy for protecting the other 70%, you\u2019re going to have huge pressure on it. It\u2019s an interrelated biosphere. The 30% and the 70% are not disconnected. There are no big barriers \u2013 there\u2019s not a Donald Trump wall between them,\u201d he said. As part of the Cop15 agreement, large companies around the world are required to disclose the parts of their supply chains that rely on nature and take actions to mitigate any destruction, echoing a key recommendation of the Dasgupta report. \u201cAs citizens, we all want actions: what should the government do? What should the citizen do? What should the company do? What laws should be passed? We should insist on company disclosure of what\u2019s happening in their supply chain. By doing so, you are sending a signal to your investors. And if they care about the fact that you\u2019re trashing the rainforest in Brazil, they\u2019ll punish you for it. But if they never know that you\u2019re doing it, they won\u2019t,\u201d he said.

Politicians and their parties are not \u201call the same\u201d. On one side, the Conservatives diminish and damage the public realm, the lives and livelihoods of those with least and the quality of civic values. On the other side, Labour strives to improve public services, the public sphere and enhance the life chances and living standards of those people that the Tories do down. I\u2019m not sure why I am still so easily shocked by the Tories\u2019 vandalism. But time and again I come across some new act of sabotage that takes my breath away. This time it\u2019s their stripping out of an already thin veneer of civilisation by laying waste to trading standards. Now this is a dull and invisible service, you might think, the sort of thing anyone from a first-world country could take for granted. No longer, just as you no longer assume the rivers are safe from sewage. Enfield council, in north London, may be about to lose its entire trading standards department. Three of its deeply diminished team of four are being sacked to save costs, and the remaining manager is resigning in protest: this is not a job for one person. Everywhere else the service is in steep decline, with the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) telling me there are half as many trading standards officers in local government as a decade ago: 2,500 highly skilled professionals have been lost. Enfield\u2019s Labour council may not be particularly to blame: councils cut to the bone since 2010 have to make unspeakable choices to shrink vulnerable children\u2019s services, social care for the frail, public health, housing, bin collections \u2013 or other statutory essentials. (Since Enfield never replied to my query, I don\u2019t know.) What do trading standards officers (TSOs) do? They have more than 290 pieces of legislation to enforce. Weights and measures officials, existing since time immemorial, still need to check scales in shops, baby scales in clinics or airport scales that airlines use to claim your bag is overweight: scales are often wildly wrong. A supermarket packet claiming to contain 500g often doesn\u2019t. You assume a litre of petrol goes into your tank because you imagine someone checks. But that happens less and less \u2013 and traders know it. Just look at the long list of areas of life that TSOs are supposed, by law, to police, and it\u2019s hair-raising how little now gets inspected. Take a very deep breath here before reading this random selection: gas appliances, offensive weapons, botulinum toxin in cosmetic fillers, tenant fees, package holidays, money laundering, fireworks, olive oil marketing, scrap metal, sunbed safety, timeshare holidays, dog breeding, infant formula, mineral water, lotteries and gambling, Christmas Day trading, GM food, battery hens, tobacco advertising, the Knives Act, car tyres and brake linings, calorie counts on packets, the Clean Air Act, copyright and patents, furniture fire safety, motorcycle noise, nightwear safety, the Estate Agents Act, dangerous wild animals, unsolicited goods and services. Incidentally, since David Cameron and George Osborne are being grilled by the Covid inquiry this week on the abysmal state of Britain\u2019s preparedness, remember that TSOs are also responsible for checking personal protection equipment (PPE). How unlikely it looks that Britain will be any better prepared for another pandemic. Or indeed for another Grenfell, since TSOs check cladding materials and electrical equipment, such as the faulty fridge that started the tower block fire. I spent time with a Hammersmith and Fulham TSO with more than 30 years experience, Doug Love, who showed me round his warehouse of evidence that is waiting \u2013 a long time these days \u2013 for court cases prosecuting offenders. Shelves were stacked high with bags of allegedly counterfeit cigarettes and illegal and possibly dangerous vapes, vodka of unknown origin that often lands people in A&amp;E, fake batteries (a danger on e-bikes and scooters), fire-hazard fake mobile chargers and toxic cosmetics. He had cases of wine misspelled \u201cshardonnay\u201d, and e-cigarettes with untested levels of heavy metals. He had just completed a case that took five years, concerning the mass theft of access to TV platforms. He speaks of giving evidence more often now at coroners\u2019 courts after anaphylactic shock deaths due to killer allergens that have not been listed on packaging. These days, he says, checks largely only happen after a complaint or intelligence is received. Last week, the CTSI conducted a spot check in Salford, issuing a stark warning after toy testing revealed bows and arrows with 100 times the legal limit of phthalates \u2013 and fashion dolls 300 times over the limit of these chemicals, which have been linked to cancer. The institute found that the cost of living crisis was driving Salford people to buy cheap and dangerous counterfeit goods. \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d they said, \u201clikely to be replicated across the UK.\u201d Smugglers, counterfeiters and poisoners need not head to Enfield: just about everywhere is \u201cat breaking point\u201d, says the chair of the CTSI, Tendy Lindsay. She warns me that the UK is becoming \u201cthe dustbin of Europe\u201d, saying that the UK \u201cno longer shares intel\u201d with the 27 EU countries about dangerous chemicals and products. At the ports, there are now few TSOs, she says, with Border Force under pressure to get things through ports quickly. The idea that Britain is about to start rigorous border checks on goods arriving from the EU is delusional. But the rest of the world may become concerned about uninspected rogue goods and services from the UK: a reputation for safety and probity once lost is hard to recapture. It may hardly matter if the Brexiteers strip away vital EU compliance regulations if no one enforces them anyway. This is becoming a country where civilisation\u2019s safety nets seem perilously frayed.

All Things Bright and Beautiful and Abide With Me are the first hymns in the top 10 for seven years, in the Co-op Funeralcare chart based on song selections at about 93,000 funerals. Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman singing Time to Say Goodbye by the Italian composer Francesco Sartori, who wrote much of Bocelli\u2019s pop repertoire, climbed to No 1, replacing Gerry and the Pacemakers\u2019 You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.

Meatloaf\u2019s Bat Out of Hell was the most popular rock song picked for final rites, with Queen\u2019s Another One Bites the Dust and Who Wants to Live Forever not far behind. Diddy\u2019s I\u2019ll Be Missing You (sampling The Police\u2019s Every Breath You Take) was the most popular R&amp;B selection, while the themes from Only Fools and Horses and Match of the Day were the TV tunes picked most regularly. Robbie Williams\u2019 Angels, a previous chart-topper, was last among the most popular songs in 2019. The chart suggests that the deceased do not always get what they want. When Co-op members were asked what song they would like at their funeral, Jerusalem by Sir Hubert Parry and Louis Armstrong singing What a Wonderful World were among the top 10, but these did not appear in the most played list. \u201cEach element of a funeral is a very personal choice and we\u2019re encouraging the nation to be more open about their funeral wishes,\u201d said Gill Stewart, the managing director at Co-op Funeralcare. \u201cMaking it clear to their loved ones what they would want for themselves when the time comes, and music is a really simple and comforting place to start.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2023.

In some cases, patients\u2019 treatment options narrowed or their cancer spread or became incurable as a direct result of their long waits for NHS care, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. The \u201cinhumane\u201d impact of delays on patients is \u201cshameful\u201d, it said, blaming ministers across the four home nations for underfunding and not tackling staff shortages in cancer services. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients arrive for their radical chemotherapy appointment, who wait three hours only to be told that because of staff shortages we can\u2019t deliver their treatment today. It\u2019s inhumane\u201d, said Naman Julka-Anderson, an advanced practice therapeutic radiographer who is also an allied health professional clinical adviser for Macmillan. An analysis by the charity has found that about 180,000 more people than planned for in NHS cancer waiting time performance targets had to endure a long wait to be diagnosed or begin treatment between January 2014 and December 2022. Many waited longer than 62 days to start treatment \u2013 surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy \u2013 after a GP referred them as an urgent case, the charity\u2019s analysis of official NHS data found. At least 100,000 of those 180,000 people have seen their symptoms worsen, or their cancer progress or their chances reduce of successfully being treated because they have had to wait, Macmillan said, citing a representative sample of more than 4,000 cancer patients it commissioned from pollsters YouGov. \u201cCancer care is in crisis after years of governments failing to act,\u201d said Gemma Peters, the charity\u2019s chief executive. \u201cEvery single person who has faced a worse outcome from their cancer diagnosis because of delays will know the devastating impact that waiting has had on their lives, from the burden of anxiety that their cancer is growing and for many the devastating news that their cancer is now incurable.\u201d Cancer waiting time performance has declined sharply in recent years as the NHS has struggled to test the rising numbers of people showing possible symptoms of the disease and treat those who were diagnosed with it within agreed waiting times. Delays have become more common as cancer services have not expanded fast enough to meet the extra demand caused by the ageing and growing population and efforts by GPs to improve the UK\u2019s poor record on early diagnosis by sending many more patients than before to be tested. Serious shortages of personnel, such as specialist nurses and radiologists, have hindered progress. Waiting times for cancer care have declined in England for the last 10 years, and Macmillan pinpointed 2014 as the \u201ctipping point when the health service in England could no longer keep up with the growing number of people who required cancer care.\u201d Wales recorded its worst ever cancer waiting times in January. In Scotland just 71% of patients are starting their treatment on time. And the situation is even worse in Northern Ireland where last year just 38.6% of people began treatment when they should have. Shirley, a 56-year-old in Essex was who diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, had to chase her oncology team to find out whether she needed to keep taking a course of tablets. \u201cFrom September I spent weeks hounding my oncologist\u2019s secretary, leaving messages, trying to find out what was going on. I was left fighting, phoning every single week. I\u2019d lie awake worrying the cancer had come back. \u201cI didn\u2019t get an answer until January this year, when I received a letter to say that I was in fact discharged from oncology care. But it was decided that I\u2019d be carrying on with the tablets for another five years from now.\u201d Angie, from York, who was also diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, was urgently referred to gynaecological services in August 2022 when she developed complications but not seen until this March \u2013 seven months later. \u201cHospitals are under extreme pressure and politicians need to do something. The anxiety of these waits intrudes into every aspect of your life. I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep. Every time the post came I would rush to the door praying it was a follow-up letter from the hospital. It felt like somebody was playing Russian roulette with my life,\u201d she said. The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to Macmillan\u2019s findings. A spokesperson said: \u201cCutting waiting lists is one of this government\u2019s five priorities and the NHS has seen and treated record numbers of cancer patients over the last two years, with cancer being diagnosed at an earlier stage more often and survival rates improving across almost all types of cancer. \u201cWe have opened 108 community diagnostic centres that have delivered over 4m additional tests, checks and scans \u2013 including for cancer, which is also one of the six conditions we are looking to tackle as part of our major conditions strategy.\u201d They added that the NHS has \u201c50% more cancer staff diagnosing and treating patients now compared with 2010\u201d."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331984", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/20/celebrities-smoking-lily-rose-depp-anya-taylor-joy", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Celebrities are smoking again: \u2018Things are grungier, edgier, sleazier\u2019", "lead": "Not long ago, stars showed off their green juice and yoga mats.

But one accessory stood out the most: a lit cigarette, which the actor and noted nepo baby conspicuously puffed as she waved for the paparazzi. The picture was no accident. \u201cShe wants that Pinterest paparazzi pic so bad with the cigarette,\u201d one person wrote in a comment underneath footage on @cigarettes, a popular Instagram page that documents celebrities smoking. \u201cThat photo is so clearly staged,\u201d said Brock Colyar, a New York magazine writer who covers nightlife. \u201cNo matter how casual she may be trying to look, she knew she was going to be photographed, and the smoking is a conscious decision. She looks fabulous, unfortunately.\u201d While fans speculated that getting \u201ccaught\u201d looking louche and European was part of The Idol\u2019s PR game plan, Depp is hardly a novice cig smoker. The 24-year-old was photographed puffing away at an In &amp; Out Burger drive-thru when she was 17, and professed her love for Virginia Slims a year before that. Depp is also far from alone in smoking conspicuously. After years of health-conscious posturing, which saw stars leaving their houses toting green juices or yoga mats, many gen Z stars are holding old Hollywood\u2019s once beloved props: cigarettes. There\u2019s Anya Taylor-Joy, whose curbside cig-and-coffee break was captured by paps in 2021, and who\u2019s snapped smoking nearly everywhere she goes \u2013 in parks, on balconies, and while staring deep into the eyes of her boyfriend, the musician and Liam Gallagher lookalike Malcolm McRae. The Wednesday star Jenna Ortega may only be 20 years old, but she was photographed dragging on a cigarette during Memorial Day weekend, with the vacant, dead-eyed intensity of a 40-something divorcee on her lunch break. Matty Healy, the 1975 frontman best known for his romance with Taylor Swift and inability to shut up on podcasts, has also made tabloid headlines for onstage antics that include mid-song puffs. Though Hollywood has long imposed penalties for onscreen smoking, driving up the MPAA rating with each puff, it does not deter film-makers. Seven of the 10 best picture nominees for 2023 contained tobacco imagery, as did nearly two-thirds of all Oscar-nominated films. It\u2019s so prevalent that even Aiden Shaw, the formerly anti-smoking boyfriend of Carrie Bradshaw, reportedly takes a few drags in the forthcoming second season of the Sex and the City reboot. (It\u2019s a total 180 after the character said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t date a smoker\u201d and almost left Carrie because of her devotion to Marlboro Lights.) If gen Z\u2019s nostalgia for Y2K culture has enabled a renaissance for low-rise jeans, the Strokes, and an obsession with the \u201cheroin chic\u201d body type, then it makes unfortunate sense that young celebrities would be smoking again. Not that some celebrities ever stopped \u2013 but they did their best to hide it. For decades, says Giles Harrison, a longtime paparazzo and founder of London Entertainment Group, celebrities have avoided the association. They have asked him for years to delete the photos he takes of them smoking. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Use whatever you want, except for that,\u2019\u201d he said. The New York Times reported that sales of cigarettes increased for the first time in 20 years in 2020. That may be alarming, but rates of smoking are still at historic lows: now, about 11% of adults are smokers, according to the CDC. Which is just as well, given that smoking is the No 1 cause of preventable death in the US. Perhaps it\u2019s not relatability celebrities are striving for when they pose with cigarettes. Rather, they seem to enjoy the edginess of it. While e-cigarette use rose a bit, from 4.9% in 2021 to 6% in 2022, visually, it may lack the star power of cigarettes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it ever looked cool to vape, but it definitely doesn\u2019t look cool now,\u201d Colyar said. Culturally, \u201cvaping has entered its death phase. There\u2019s just something about cigarettes.\u201d And doesn\u2019t gen Z know it. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the air, three years after the pandemic: things are grungier, edgier, sleazier,\u201d said Colyar, who added that they\u2019ve picked up a \u201creally awful\u201d habit themself: trying to smoke inside any club that will allow it \u2013 or at least turn a blind eye to it. Tyler McCall, a writer and the former editor-in-chief of Fashionista, blames the boon in celebrities lighting up on the Ozempic craze. While the obesity drug reportedly curbs addictions like smoking and drinking, it has become most synonymous with weight loss, and fashion media has cited it as a reason for the return of \u201cthin is in\u201d. Since cigarettes have long been used to curb appetite and reduce hunger, McCall sees a connection. \u201cI think the two trends are adjacent,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore prescription drugs were widely accepted, a lot of stars stayed skinny on those classic cigs/Diet coke/coffee diets that traumatized so many of us millennials.\u201d Kirbie Johnson, a writer and host of the podcast Gloss Angeles, says: \u201cI hate to even acknowledge it, but there\u2019s something sexy about smoking a thin cigarette: the lips, the smoke, the way it sits between the fingers.\u201d She suspects it is the culture of thin worship that makes cigarettes appealing to younger stars: \u201cI\u2019m not sure any of the aforementioned celebrities are doing it [to be sexy]. Seems like a means to an end in their case.\u201d If the pandemic made us a little more aware that we all have vices, that doesn\u2019t mean celebrities are entirely off the hook for promoting smoking. After The Idol premiered last month, one of the main Twitter takeaways seemed to be just how much Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s character Jocelyn smoked. In one scene that might even leave Humphrey Bogart coughing, she lights up while inside a sauna. \u201cJocelyn has smoked like 5 cigarettes and we\u2019re only 30 minutes into the first episode,\u201d read one tweet. Of course this is a character fans were talking about, not Depp herself, but the chronically online can have a hard time separating the two. Jenna Ortega\u2019s smoke break also earned critiques from the internet \u2013 and one very important fan in particular. After the photos went viral, her mother, Natalie Ortega, posted a series of anti-smoking PSA memes to her Instagram page. \u201cThat sort of says it all,\u201d Colyar said. \u201cAt the end of the day, everyone knows that if they post a photo of themselves smoking, their mother will send them a message or post a snarky comment.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331985", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/fitzwilliam-museum-cambridge-explores-founders-slavery-links", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge explores founder\u2019s slavery links", "lead": "Historic and contemporary pieces interrogate city and university\u2019s connections to colonialism", "author": "Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 05:00:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173754", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/da22f44516f901fdc008d5275c2a273e64be5879/0_374_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "An exhibition by the Fitzwilliam Museum will explore Cambridge\u2019s connections to enslavement and exploitation for the first time, both in the university and the city. Black Atlantic: Power, People, Resistance features works made in west Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Europe, and interrogates the ways Atlantic enslavement and the Black Atlantic shaped the University of Cambridge\u2019s collections. Historic pieces will be exhibited in dialogue with works by modern and contemporary black artists including Donald Locke, Barbara Walker, Keith Piper, Alberta Whittle and Jacqueline Bishop. Between 1400 and 1900, people resisting colonial slavery in the Americas produced new cultures known as the Black Atlantic, the museum said. By asking questions about how Atlantic enslavement and the Black Atlantic shaped the university\u2019s collections, the museum said it has made new discoveries about Cambridge\u2019s own connection to colonialism. The exhibition begins by looking at the early history of the Fitzwilliam Museum and its founder, Viscount Richard Fitzwilliam (1745-1816). A student at Cambridge, Fitzwilliam left a large sum of money and an extensive art collection to the university upon his death, founding the museum that bears his name. It is revealed how a significant part of Fitzwilliam\u2019s wealth and art collection was inherited from his grandfather Matthew Decker, a prominent Dutch-born British merchant and financier who in 1700 helped to establish the South Sea Company, which obtained exclusive rights to traffic African people to the Spanish colonial Americas. The show\u2019s first section, Glimpses of the World Before Transatlantic Enslavement, will highlight the independent histories of west Africa, the Caribbean and Europe, with highlights including rare pre-1500 tools and ceremonial stone objects from the Indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and Jan Jansz Mostaert\u2019s Portrait of an African Man, which is believed to be the earliest individual portrait of a black person in European art. Section two, Cambridge Wealth from Atlantic Enslavement, reveals how the profits of enslavement filtered into everyday life in Britain, and how European colonies passed laws that created racial categories to justify enslavement and promote anti-black racism. Examples of historical race-based pseudoscience, some developed by academics at Cambridge, will be displayed alongside reflective pieces by contemporary artists, curators, activists and academics. Fashion, Consumption, Racism and Resistance looks at how products harvested by enslaved people \u2013 from mahogany, ivory and turtle shell to coffee, sugar cane and tobacco \u2013 became fashionable materials for European luxury goods and central to everyday consumption in Britain. And the final chapter, Plantations: Production and Resistance, highlights the contribution of Indigenous, enslaved and free black people to major scientific discoveries and botanical knowledge, which were brought back to Britain. Among the works included is John Tyley\u2019s drawing of a young man sitting under a breadfruit tree \u2013 a rare example of a historic and named black artist depicting a black subject. The exhibition, which opens in September, is the first in a series of planned shows and interventions at the Fitzwilliam Museum between 2023 and 2026. Luke Syson, the museum\u2019s director, said the exhibition was \u201can important moment in the history of the Fitzwilliam\u201d. He added: \u201cReflecting on the origins of our museum, the exhibition situates us within an enormous transatlantic story of exploitation and enslavement, one whose legacy is in many ways as pervasive and insidious today as it was in the seventeenth, eighteenth or nineteenth century.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331986", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/20/misleading-home-office-advice-leaves-hong-kong-protester-fearing-deportation-from-uk", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Misleading Home Office advice leaves Hong Kong protester fearing deportation from UK", "lead": "Student who took part in anti-Beijing protests is in legal limbo after withdrawing her asylum claim to make a visa application that was then rejected", "author": "Amy Hawkins", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 05:00:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173772", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/63afca2ead5dab5fd2673bed7c634e3dcc56fc58/0_354_5310_3186/500.jpg", "body": "A Hongkonger who fled to the UK after being targeted by security officials has been left fearing deportation after appearing to be wrongly advised by the Home Office. Olivia (not her real name) left Hong Kong in July 2022 after someone claiming to be from the new national security department \u2013 created two years earlier when the Chinese Communist party (CCP) imposed a draconian security law on the city \u2013 approached her in the street and accused her of supporting Hong Kong independence. She says that they loitered outside her apartment as well as contacting her on social media. Her earlier participation in pro-independence protests as a student left her in fear, and she booked a flight soon afterwards. In 2019 and 2020, Olivia had taken part in Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests, in which millions of people took to the streets to oppose a bill that would have enabled opponents of the Chinese government to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The protests soon morphed into more general calls for democracy and freedom. In June 2020, the Hong Kong government quelled the unrest with a national security law, imposed by Beijing, which criminalised \u201csecession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces\u201d \u2013 terms so vague that they have been used to silence virtually all criticism of China. At the time she travelled to the UK, Olivia could not have applied for the flagship British national (overseas) \u2013 or BNO \u2013 visa. It was open only to those (and their dependants) who had registered before the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Born after that date, and travelling alone without her BNO-status parents, Olivia was ineligible. Instead, she claimed asylum, joining a cohort of Hongkongers who in seeking safety from persecution have been stuck in temporary accommodation in the UK, reporting exploitation and abuse \u2013 and long waits to discover if they will be granted asylum. Olivia was given hope last November when the government expanded its visa scheme to younger people, who were more likely to have been at the frontlines of the protests in 2019 and 2020. Within days of the BNO scheme being expanded, Olivia emailed the Home Office, requesting to change her asylum application. Unlike asylum seekers, Hongkongers on a BNO visa can work in the UK; their applications are processed more quickly. \u201cIt might take years to wait for asylum,\u201d Olivia says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait that long.\u201d But in February, she was shocked when she was rejected from the newly expanded scheme. The Home Office had categorised her as an \u201coverstayer\u201d in the UK, in breach of immigration laws, and therefore ineligible for a BNO visa. The government\u2019s guidelines for assessing a BNO visa application state that the applicant cannot be on \u201cimmigration bail\u201d, the term given to asylum seekers, such as Olivia, who are not kept in detention while their claim is processed. On the advice of her Home Office case worker, Olivia withdrew her asylum claim in January in order to start her BNO application. But withdrawing her application meant that she was no longer recorded as an asylum seeker, and was in the UK without any leave to remain. Now she is in immigration limbo, fearing deportation as she awaits the outcome of her appeal against the rejection of her claim for BNO status, a process that could take six months or more. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI read the immigration law. It says if I was applying for asylum, I am regarded as being on immigration bail, but if I withdraw [the asylum application], I am an overstayer. So whether I withdraw it or not, I can\u2019t apply for the BNO visa. But they didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d The Home Office recommended that Olivia seek legal advice before she withdrew her asylum claim. But without access to a lawyer, she turned to Hong Kong Aid, a support group, who said that she should follow the Home Office\u2019s instructions. Now it is clear that those instructions have caused Olivia unwittingly to breach the UK\u2019s immigration laws. The conflicting advice has given false hope to people like Olivia, says Ivan Yim, co-founder of Hong Kong Aid, who successfully claimed asylum himself in December. \u201cWe strongly recommend that Hongkongers seeking asylum continue their claim until the Home Office has clear instructions,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe UK government is historically responsible for what happened in Hong Kong, and they should provide a lifeboat for those on the frontline of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom.\u201d The Home Office declined to answer questions about Olivia\u2019s situation. It has also not refunded her \u00a3250 BNO application fee. A spokesperson says: \u201cWe are continuing to deliver on our historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong and expect to welcome more Hongkongers to our country, where they can settle into their lives here.\u201d The vast majority of BNO applications are granted. But the number of refusals has started to creep up. The reasons for those refusals are not publicly available, but as of the end of March, 71 people, including Olivia, have been rejected this year after applying from within the UK.

The fate of the bill won\u2019t be decided until after a Senate inquiry reports on 1 August, but the Coalition\u2019s changed position sets up another Labor-Greens stoush over environmental legislation. There is underlying antipathy from the minor party about the scheme, which is meant to encourage businesses to invest in projects to protect nature and biodiversity. The proposed legislation establishes a scheme to incentivise investment in nature restoration by creating tradable certificates for projects that protect and restore biodiversity. In March, the Coalition party room resolved to support the bill in principle because it had proposed the same scheme in government. In late May the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told the Guardian\u2019s Australian Politics podcast that the bill was \u201cbasically verbatim our legislation\u201d, saying he was \u201cproud of the fact that it\u2019s stood the test of time \u2013 of a changing government\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m profoundly proud of, to have a world-first that actually is going to improve our biodiversity on our farms around this country and beyond.\u201d But on 13 June, Littleproud told the lower house that Labor\u2019s bill had \u201cdiverged far too far\u201d from the one the Morrison government introduced in February 2022, claiming it was no longer about \u201crewarding farmers for the stewardship of their land\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Littleproud noted that pilots were already in place, meaning that \u201ccertificates would have been able to be traded once this legislation went through\u201d. But he claimed Labor \u201clet their ideology\u201d get in the way, by deciding to strip the role of overseeing the scheme from the agriculture department and give it to the environment department. The shadow environment minister, Jonathon Duniam, said the Coalition was responding to \u201cmore and more stakeholder dissatisfaction with the legislation\u201d. \u201cIn government, our bill for a biodiversity market was deliberately confined to agricultural land. By contrast, Labor\u2019s bills cover all land tenure and water.\u201d The government negotiated amendments with the lower house crossbench but on Tuesday the Greens party room concluded they did not substantially improve the bill. The Greens now hold the crucial Senate votes \u2013 because the Coalition won\u2019t back the draft laws \u2013 and are pressuring Labor to ban native forest logging. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, the Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, told Guardian Australia that \u201cwithout a climate trigger to stop pollution and a ban on native forest logging, the government\u2019s environment plan is not really an environment plan at all\u201d. \u201cWe are always willing to speak with the minister about how to best stop the destruction of our environment but as it stands the nature repair market seems irreparable,\u201d she said. Plibersek, the environment minister, said: \u201cOur nature repair market bill is good for farmers, traditional owners and other landholders and it\u2019s good for nature.\u201d \u201cThe Nationals claim to support people who live on the land. By changing their mind and withdrawing support, they\u2019re preventing farmers from getting rewarded for looking after their land,\u201d Plibersek said. Plibersek noted the bill was supported by the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, the Northern Land Council, Farmers for Climate Action and Landcare. \u201cThis bill is broadly supported by people living on the land,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who want to get paid to restore their local environments and protect threatened species in their community. The Greens say they want investment in nature repair, why would they block billions of dollars of investment in nature?\u201d The bill is not widely supported by environment groups, due to concerns that the scheme as proposed could be used to offset habitat destruction caused by other developments. Tim Beshara, manager of policy and strategy of the Wilderness Society, said the scheme would \u201conly deliver increased environmental repair through capturing the existing biodiversity offset schemes and hoping that the destruction delivering those offsets will increase\u201d. \u201cA growing \u2018market\u2019 right now would look like growing the volume of destruction to pay for it,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331988", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/country-diary-a-30-year-journey-from-fertilised-farmland-to-wildlife-heaven", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Country diary: A 30-year journey from fertilised farmland to wildlife heaven | Mark Cocker", "lead": "<strong>Cosford Hall, Suffolk:</strong> The biodiversity here is astonishing \u2013 and our goal was to find the owners 10 new species", "author": "Mark Cocker", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 04:30:31", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173807", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d772673a3225101384f84a0a57e3f44200ebbf3f/0_27_4000_2399/500.jpg", "body": "I\u2019m still searching for an alternative title for the \u201cbioblitz\u201d (those terrible war connections!), but as an exercise in nature connectedness, complete absorption, learning, humility and fun with a dash of competitiveness, it has few equals. Normally a bioblitz involves identifying as many life forms as possible in one place over one day. Since the owners of this 30-acre former farm have an inventory of 1,100 fellow residents already, our goal was more modest: 10 new species for their list. Some additions were admittedly less than exciting. Traps set the night before yielded several of a moth family called \u201cthe pugs\u201d: 50 tiny elongated flakes of greyness with lines of minute dark-grey dots. They have names like grey pug, plain pug, shaded and mottled pug, but ours was perhaps the masterpiece in anonymity \u2013 common pug. Yet it was new and thus equal in bioblitz status to more noteworthy finds, including a speckled bush cricket. This extraterrestrial beast possesses an inner-body glow of fluorescent lime and manoeuvres on six stilt-like legs twice the length of the ink-freckled abdomen. Equally, an arachnid named the \u201ccucumber spider\u201d needs little further gloss to convey its own thrilling colours. As in all natural history work, it wasn\u2019t what we set out to achieve that moved me most, but a realisation that crept up sideways as we went about the task. Cosford has been in a countryside stewardship scheme for three decades, and it\u2019s astonishing how far it has journeyed towards its present wild conditions. Where once were arable crops propped up with fertilisers and pesticides are now 10,000 globes of golden yellow spread over the rolling terrain by a flower called creeping cinquefoil. Among this was a busy weave of five bumblebee species. In one 5 metre by 5 metre plot, we counted 112 bee orchids and as many pyramidal orchids. All this is in a habitat that attracts the least subsidy support, yet yields to this country possibly more biodiversity than any other \u2013 scrub. That indefinable mix of young tree and thorn bush within a scrappy mosaic of flower-rich turf. Scrub needs a rebrand more urgently than the bioblitz, but bring the two together and you have something like an English version of wildlife heaven. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331989", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/hopes-rewilding-critically-endangered-brush-tailed-bettongs-will-help-them-bounce-back", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hopes rewilding critically endangered brush-tailed bettongs will help them bounce back", "lead": "Dozens of the \u2018ecosystem engineers\u2019 have been caught in Western Australia and flown to their new habitat", "author": "Graham Readfearn", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 04:29:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173824", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f4a3def35abbf6cd06caf32cbde224ca13e6e31b/0_73_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "As in-flight meals go, sweet potato and mushroom might not be everyone\u2019s first choice. But it was the perfect snack for the 73 critically endangered brush-tailed bettongs as they were flown 2,000kms to a new home on South Australia\u2019s Yorke Peninsula. The 49 males and 24 female bettongs were caught by a team of more than 20 conservationists over five nights last week in a national park and sanctuary at Dryandra, about 180km southeast of Perth. The bettongs\u2019 new South Australian home at the Dhilba Guuranda-Innes national park is the site of an ambitious rewilding project \u2013 Marna Banggara \u2013 that has now re-introduced 193 of the marsupials that were once common across Australia\u2019s mainland. Derek Sandow, an ecologist at South Australia\u2019s Northern and Yorke Landscape Board, said radio transmitters fitted to most of the new arrivals show \u201cthey\u2019re all accounted for at them moment\u201d after the translocations started a week ago across seven flights. Monitoring of the new population earlier this year showed the tiny marsupials were thriving in their new home. There are as many as 15,000 bettongs living in the Dryandra Woodland national park and another 1,000 or so in a nearby sanctuary. The south-west of WA is the species\u2019 last remaining stronghold on Australia\u2019s mainland after the once-common marsupial \u2013 described by Sandow as like a \u201cmini kangaroo on steroids\u201d \u2013 was decimated by cats, foxes and habitat destruction after European invasion. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week, the team set traps with baits of peanut butter balls in the woodland at dusk for the animals, known as woylies in WA and yalgi in the Narungga language of their new home. Narungga nation representatives travelled to WA to meet the Noongar Gnaala Karla Boodja People in WA. Within 24 hours, each animal had been driven to Perth airport, flown 2,000km to Adelaide with a sweet potato and mushroom snack, checked twice by a vet and then driven to York Peninsula and released to their new home. Adding these new animals to the Yorke Peninsula community will help strengthen the genetic mix of the new population that have been drawn from another WA site in the Upper Warren region and a population from the feral animal-free Wedge Island to the peninsula\u2019s west. The first bettongs were translocated from Wedge island in August 2021 and the latest cohort will likely be the last, with monitoring ongoing. Sandow says there are two reasons why translocating the animals in winter helps. The new arrivals will not have to work too hard to find the tubers and fungi they like to eat, and cats and foxes are also less active. Bettongs are a good candidate for a rewilding project because they are prolific \u201cecosystem engineers\u201d. One bettong can dig between two and six tonnes of earth a year, improving the soil, spreading seeds and creating small water pools that help native bugs and plants to thrive. \u201cThe yalgiri have a purpose on this country. They\u2019ve got a purpose here, just as every other animal, bird and reptile does, and that\u2019s to look after country. So reintroducing these animals is helping to create a healthy country,\u201d said Cyril Kartinyeri, a Narungga elder. The translocation team was made up of staff, conservationists and vets from Zoos SA, Northern and Yorke Landscape Board, SA Department for Environment and Water, WWF Australia and the WA Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions. The Marna Banggara project hopes to re-introduce more species to Yorke Peninsula, with candidates including bandicoots, the red-tailed phascogale and the western quoll. WWF Australia\u2019s head of regenerative country, Darren Grover, said: \u201cRewilding gives us an opportunity to reset the clock. Some of these species have been missing from the landscape for 100 years or more and it\u2019s like a jigsaw puzzle with key pieces taken out. We want to put these pieces back over time and ensure these lost species can thrive again.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033198a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/20/veteran-titanic-explorer-concern-missing-submersible-sub", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018We\u2019ve feared this\u2019: veteran Titanic explorer tells of concern for missing submersible", "lead": "Joe MacInnis, a member of the first expedition to locate the wreck of the Titanic, says the deep sea exploration community has been left \u2018shattered\u2019", "author": "Leyland Cecco in Toronto", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 04:15:31", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173841", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c59d450201cbe595dc476fcc9426f6c5f4a4c781/0_58_1200_720/500.jpg", "body": "A missing submersible near the wreck of the Titanic that has kicked off a frantic international search has left the deep sea exploration community \u201cshattered\u201d, a famed Canadian scientist and veteran explorer has said. \u201cThis is the day that we have been fearing for a long, long time \u2013 when you lose a sub in really deep water,\u201d Joe MacInnis, a member of the first expedition to locate the wreck of the Titanic in 1985, told the Guardian on Monday night. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d Authorities from Canada and the US have deployed specialized aircraft and ships to search for the five people aboard a 6.4-metre vessel that lost contact about one hour and 45 minutes into a planned dive Sunday, nearly 400 miles (640km) off the coast of Newfoundland. OceanGate Expeditions, the US company that owns the submersible, said it was \u201cexploring all options\u201d to bring the crew back safely. OceanGate operates trips that combine commercial tourism with scientific research and exploration, to the final resting place of the ill-fated ocean liner that struck an iceberg in 1912 and sank, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew. In deep sea expeditions, MacInnis said, crews often worry about the \u201ctrinity\u201d: fire, hull failure or entanglement. MacInnis is a veteran deep sea explorer who has completed 17 trips to the famed wreck with a Russian crew, as part of making the 1992 Imax documentary Titanica. He is also a close friend of filmmaker James Cameron who he introduced to the Russian submersible pilots involved. \u201cThe next thing you know Jim hires them and makes all his dives to the Titanic before he makes his big film,\u201d he said, referring to the 1997 mega-blockbuster feature, Titanic, that Cameron directed. On his second expedition to the Titanic, MacInnis and the crew briefly found themselves stuck on part of the wreck. A second sub was sent to investigate and between the two figure out a way to gently jiggle the craft free. On that same trip, the crew lost radio contact after the sub went behind the Titanic\u2019s propellers to film footage for the documentary. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you for a while we were scratching our heads and hoping everything was OK. As soon as they got back from underneath the stern, we got radio contact back. And that was a big, big relief.\u201d While MacInnis\u2019 teams lost momentary contact, Titan had been out of contact for more than 30 hours by Monday night. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern, especially as time ticks on,\u201d he said. MacInnis said that in the event the submersible is located deep within the ocean, any recovery will be \u201cincredibly costly\u201d. \u201cIn any accident, you really want an analysis of what went wrong. And I suspect in this case, there will be a lot of head scratching and [if lost] we\u2019ll likely see an effort to recover it if they can.\u201d On Monday, Rear Admiral John Mauger of the US Coast Guard told reporters crews were \u201cdoing everything we can\u201d to find the submersible. The coast guard is relying on aircraft, some of which have underwater detection capabilities. But officials admitted they only have the capability to search for sounds at the moment. The outcome officials are hoping for is that the vessel somehow limped to the surface and is drifting somewhere in the North Atlantic, awaiting rescue. \u201cWe\u2019ve feared this for a long time,\u201d said MacInnis, adding the news has rocked a tight-knit community of scientists and explorers who have spent much of their lives pushing further into the darkness of the deep sea. \u201cBut this is the reality of the ocean, especially in its deeper waters. It really is a place of scorching fear.

A handful of minutes left on the clock, a razor-thin margin on the scoreboard and the overwhelming pressure that comes with knowing only one team will walk off the field victorious. \u201cIt\u2019s immense,\u201d the former NSW hard man says of \u201cthe close ones\u201d, those Origin thrillers hanging in the balance moments before full-time. \u201cNo matter what you\u2019re playing, whether it\u2019s Origin, club footy or Test matches, there is a lot more anxiety the closer the score is late in the game.\u201d The data shows Geyer \u2013 and Blues fans \u2013 have a particular right to be anxious, with the Maroons all over NSW when it comes to winning tight matches. Queensland have a success rate of 51% in Origin games decided by seven points or more, but that jumps to 59% in games decided by six points or fewer. With nearly half of the 126 Origin games decided by these small margins, the Maroons\u2019 ability to clinch tight games is a key reason for their dominance. Since Brad Fittler took hold of the Blues coaching reins in 2018, NSW have outscored Queensland 350 to 238, and yet each team has won eight matches. Six of the Maroons\u2019 eight wins have been by six points or fewer, which doesn\u2019t even include their epic 26-18 triumph in this year\u2019s series opener, when they scored two tries in the final 10 minutes despite playing with only 12 men. \u201cThey should never have won that game,\u201d says Clinton Schifcofske, who kicked the series-winning goal in the Melbourne miracle of 2006 when the Maroons likewise scored two tries in the final 10 minutes to snare a 16-14 victory. \u201cWhen [Tom] Flegler got sinbinned, I got up to make a cup of tea because I thought there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to win now.

It\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d So we come to Wednesday night\u2019s game and the high chance there will be a handful of minutes left on the clock and a razor-thin margin on the scoreboard. Given the history books, what will be going through the minds of the men wearing blue? \u201cEveryone will give you the flat-bat answer and say, \u2018History means nothing\u2019, but it\u2019s a mind game for NSW now,\u201d Schifcofske says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Joey [Johns] and those blokes banging on about Queensland spirit being a load of shit so it\u2019s almost reverse psychology now. They\u2019re all over the shop, the poor old Blues. \u201cSubconsciously, you try to block it out but the more you do that, the worse it gets.\u201d Experts agree that actively trying to ignore the issue could have the opposite effect. \u201cAs soon as you start trying to push things away and avoid certain topics, you are distracted from the job on the field,\u201d says senior performance psychologist David Barracosa, who has provided mental toughness training to various Origin players. \u201cBoth teams have identities based on past results and for Queensland it is that they will do the dirty work and scratch and claw their way to those really close victories. That has become part of the narrative that is really difficult for NSW to ignore, but narratives can change. \u201cThe message we give athletes is they can read into patterns about what has happened before but what happens now is its own standalone event. There is no storyline already written. \u201cIt\u2019s about recognising that each possession, each set of six, is a new opportunity to have an impact and shine. \u201cWe just want them to embrace the moment and have good mental skills in place to stay grounded, centred and bring them back to the job at hand and write a new narrative.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033198c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/mariupol-exiled-leaders-look-to-the-future-with-plans-to-rebuild-ukraine", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mariupol\u2019s exiled leaders look to the future with plans to rebuild", "lead": "Ukrainian mayor says there is no time to waste in drawing up vision for devastated city, which is now under Russian control", "author": "Daniel Boffey in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 04:00:31", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173879", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/044fa12c52b8eadb7abfbe1df75d7efd681405ac/172_63_2016_1210/500.jpg", "body": "A tram glides pasts cyclists and pedestrians making their way along green and pleasant streets. A submerged diver swims in clear waters by an underwater research centre while families enjoy a picnic at the nearby beach, gazing over at the yachts in the distance as they enjoy the afternoon sun.

In the first location, it is estimated that more than 600 men, women and children seeking shelter from the bombs and carnage died in a Russian air attack on 16 March last year. The latter, once the site of one of Europe\u2019s largest metal-producing plants, was where wounded and emaciated Ukrainian soldiers and more than 1,000 civilians resisted a grotesque onslaught of fire and fury for more than 80 days in a desperate last redoubt. The two sketches feature in a presentation put together by four architectural firms for what is being called Mariupol Reborn, an initiative led by Vadym Boichenko, the mayor of the city since 2015, who lives in exile in Dnipro, 200 miles to the north. An estimated 22,000 civilians died in Mariupol after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and 90% of the city\u2019s infrastructure was damaged in the fighting for its future. Half of all the apartment blocks were destroyed, as well as 69 schools or colleges and 15 medical institutions, including, infamously, maternity hospital number three, where four people were killed in a strike on 9 March.

A video was produced of Vladimir Putin allegedly visiting new apartment blocks in Mariupol\u2019s suburbs in March. The claims were rather undermined by Putin\u2019s peculiar appearance \u2013 he allegedly employs doubles \u2013 and a voice that could be heard in the background. \u201cAll this isn\u2019t true,\u201d an unidentified woman shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s all for show.\u201d Boichenko says maybe 1% of what was destroyed has been rebuilt by the Kremlin, and then only to sate the Russian TV audience. Mariupol Reborn, with funding from Rinat Akhmetov, one of Ukraine\u2019s richest business leaders, and organisations such as USAid and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has, he says, a genuine vision to build a new city on the ashes of the old, albeit smaller than it was. It will accommodate between 200,000 to 250,000 people initially, with the city\u2019s capacity to be increased over the years should people choose to return. The expectation is that Mariupol will be home to 350,000 in time. The plans, which will be formally unveiled and discussed at a two-day conference in Lviv, in western Ukraine, starting on 28 June, are ambitious and will require billions of dollars \u2013 an estimated $14.5bn over 15 years \u2013 to put into action. Representatives from the Polish cities of Warsaw, Wroc\u0142aw and Gdansk, who have their own stories to tell of rebuilding from ruin, will offer their views in Lviv before the drafting of a final master plan. But are these blueprints not just the fruits of wishful thinking? Konstantin Ivashchenko, a former pro-Russia opponent of Boichenko\u2019s on the Mariupol council, has been appointed as mayor by the Kremlin. While Russia does not have control over much of the region, Putin has declared the Donetsk oblast, in which Mariupol is located, to be permanently part of the Russian Federation. Boichenko, buoyed up by private briefings about Ukraine\u2019s long-anticipated counteroffensive in the east and south of the country, says the planning must start now and there is no time to waste. The last time he saw his city was when he left on 26 February having been ordered out, he says, by the regional administration who had become aware of Russian headhunters roaming the streets. He expects to be back in Mariupol by the end of the year. \u201cThe Ukrainian armed forces are already close to the city of Volnovakha,\u201d he says. \u201cMariupol is 60km away. This is an important transport hub. In world war two, the Soviets also liberated Mariupol through Volnovakha. We believe in the armed forces of Ukraine. And we are confident that we will return to Mariupol this year.\u201d The fundamentals of Mariupol\u2019s future have been drawn from a consultation exercise that sought to discover the views of the city\u2019s \u00e9migr\u00e9s from their places of refuge in 16 cities across Ukraine. The message was that Mariupol should remember \u201cbut not be a cemetery\u201d, Boichenko said. The places where mass graves are sited will be marked, and memorial paving stones built into the streets. A new Museum 86 \u2013 in reference to the 86 days of resistance against Russian attempts at occupation \u2013 will be established. The former drama theatre will not be rebuilt but a memorial inspired by the 9/11 museum found today at the site of the twin towers in New York, where the absence of the fallen buildings is the focus, will be constructed. Flora and fauna will be allowed to take over some of the wreckage of the Azovstal steelworks, sitting alongside a new children\u2019s play park. Russia\u2019s influence and impact on Mariupol will not be allowed to dominate, Boichenko says. Mariupol\u2019s history will not begin in the public consciousness with Grigory Potemkin, the governor general in the 18th century of Russia\u2019s southern provinces, but instead centuries earlier when Cossack settlers first made their mark, he says. \u201cWe have asked Mariupol residents [around the country] what we need to remove from the city and what to leave,\u201d Boichenko says. \u201cThat\u2019s when the idea came up that we should remove everything Soviet from the city. This is the anchor that pulls us back and Putin is clinging to it. The people of Mariupol said that we need to build something new but preserve the history. Then the next question arose: what is the history of Mariupol and who founded it? And we can no longer mention Potemkin and Russia and Mariupol. We asked the Institute of Ukrainian Memory when Mariupol was founded and they gave us the date \u2013 1594.\u201d This last year of horrors will not define Mariupol, Boychenko says. The city is rethinking its past as it looks to the future."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033198d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/west-needs-strategy-to-tie-ukraine-aid-to-corruption-progress-thinktank-says", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "West needs strategy to tie Ukraine aid to corruption progress, thinktank says", "lead": "German Marshall Fund says oligarchs biding their time until after war ends to reassert their influence", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 04:00:31", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173897", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/75dad3cbc8829bebb264b78156f6a18ca2d577d7/0_0_5637_3384/500.jpg", "body": "Western powers will only protect Ukraine\u2019s multibillion-dollar postwar recovery if they agree a unified strategy to make aid conditional on clear progress on combating judicial corruption, reinstating the obligation on Ukrainian public officials to declare assets and ensuring all recovery finds can be digitally traced, according to an authoritative report from the German Marshall Fund. The US thinktank\u2019s proposals, matching calls from Ukrainian civil society and G7 ambassadors in Ukraine, reflect a concern that donors have not yet assembled a strategy to ensure how recovery funds can be monitored in a country that has made progress in tackling capture by oligarchs since 2014 but still has many unreformed institutions. The report, published before the UK government-led Ukraine recovery conference takes place in London, argues that Ukraine is fighting a two-front war to defeat Russia and to permanently embed the rule of law. Members of Ukrainian civil society feel they have been sidelined at the conference, which will be dominated by the private sector and international politicians. \u201cUkrainian oligarchs are biding their time until after the war to reassert their influence,\u201d says the report, partly written by former US officials involved in Ukrainian anti-corruption reform. \u201cIn the face of those realities, continuing to uproot oligarchy \u2013 a critical part of winning the war, rebuilding the country and preparing for EU accession \u2013 will require heavy domestic and foreign support. Beyond the executive branch, the parliament and the judiciary remain penetrated by powerful, unaccountable and obscure private interests.\u201d It says a new G7-established multi-agency donor platform \u201chas not yet corralled donor countries \u2013 each with their own safeguarding procedures and anti-corruption reform initiatives for Ukraine \u2013 into agreement on policy reform priorities\u201d. The warning comes as the UK announced it was introducing laws to allow ministers to maintain sanctions on Russian assets until compensation is paid to Ukraine, so introducing a route for frozen Russian assets to be donated for Ukrainian reconstruction. The laws go some way to ensuring that Russian assets currently frozen by the UK government can in effect eventually be seized, a move that many western powers have rejected on the basis that it could set a precedent for western assets held overseas to be seized by other countries. The UK stressed that the new laws did not amount to forfeiture and could only be imposed if there was evidence of criminal conduct. The new laws will change the purpose of sanctions so that they will be maintained until Russia agrees to pay compensation, rather than merely protecting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the current purpose of the sanctions. The UK is the first government to take these initial steps and accepts they may take time to resolve and require consultation. New measures will also require a designated person to disclose all the assets they hold in the UK, with a failure to comply leading to a fine or a seizure. It follows efforts by an all-party group of peers who have tabled an amendment to the economic crime and transparency bill currently in its report stage in the Lords, though ministers believe there are legal difficulties to the amendment and would prefer to table their own laws next year. Further sets of measures will require individuals to disclose if they hold Russian sovereign assets in the UK and make it easier for Russians under sanction to have their assets voluntarily transferred and handed to Ukraine to help secure its recovery. Some Russian oligarchs have been signalling they would be prepared to give some money to Ukraine if their assets were released. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: \u201cAs Ukraine continues to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, the terrible impacts of Putin\u2019s war are clear. Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction needs are \u2013 and will be \u2013 immense. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to recover from Russia\u2019s war of aggression and lay the groundwork for a prosperous nation.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cPutin\u2019s Russia must take financial responsibility for the wanton devastation it has wrought on Ukraine. These new measures \u2013 on top of our largest ever sanctions package \u2013 show the UK is ready and able to clear new paths to ensure Russian money reaches Ukrainian people.\u201d Officials said the measures were about establishing a framework for sanctioned Russian assets to be used for compensation. Discussions are still under way about the transfer of the \u00a32.3bn of proceeds from the sale of Chelsea football club to humanitarian causes in Ukraine and the long-term recovery, with the agreement of Chelsea\u2019s former owner Roman Abramovich. Officials say Portugal needs to decide if a special licence is required since Abramovich is a Portuguese citizen. The officials said they were reasonably optimistic that the negotiations would be completed soon."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033198e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/steph-catley-hopes-to-see-euros-effect-in-australia-after-womens-world-cup", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Steph Catley hopes to see \u2018Euros effect\u2019 in Australia after 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup | Joey Lynch", "lead": "The Matildas vice-captain points to England\u2019s experience as an example of the impact hosting a major tournament can have", "author": "Joey Lynch", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 03:12:52", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173916", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/22f97589fe91fb3ee09e8f2c35b28b1e11d69334/0_166_3724_2235/500.jpg", "body": "Steph Catley knows what kind of impact hosting the Women\u2019s Euros had in England. She felt it first hand, walking around the streets of London bathed in the afterglow of the Lionesses\u2019 triumph. The Matildas defender saw the effect it had on the lives of Arsenal teammates such as Beth Mead and Leah Williamson. \u201cThey\u2019re superheroes on another level to the young girls over here,\u201d Catley says. \u201cThey can\u2019t walk down the street without being recognised\u201d. Most of all, she has lived it, playing for Arsenal in an extra-time defeat to Wolfsburg in the Champions League semi-final in front of 60,063 fans at Emirates Stadium \u2013 58,657 more than the last time the Gunners hosted a European semi and an attendance that set a new record for women\u2019s club football in the UK. Now, it\u2019s the turn of her homeland. The 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, the biggest sporting event Australia has seen since the 2000 Olympics, is now just a month away. The tournament has become a shining beacon on the hill Down Under ever since Fifa president Gianni Infantino declared the \u201cAs One\u201d joint bid with New Zealand successful, a kind of cure-all for the ills of the game and the potion that will lift it to new heights, often with not a lot of detail beyond that. Participation numbers amongst young girls are expected to explode on the way to a 50-50 gender split. The A-League Women\u2019s competition is hoping the World Cup will supercharge public interest and crowds for the coming season \u2013 the first in which it will play a full home-and-away fixture. A legacy in facilities at both the elite level and on the ground in communities, where there is a critical lack of female-friendly spaces, is targeted. So too a legacy of women\u2019s leadership in refereeing, coaching and administration. \u201cIf you think about that kind of hype, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not true because if you look at what happened with England and the Euros,\u201d Catley says. \u201cThat\u2019s proof. If you do well at a major tournament that you\u2019re hosting, the effects and the ripple of that can be huge. If you look at the WSL the crowd sizes, the investment\u2026 it\u2019s gone through the roof since [the Euros] and grassroots is benefiting from that. There is that pressure and there is definitely an understanding that our success could have an incredibly big impact on women\u2019s football in Australia and football in general in Australia.\u201d For Catley and her teammates, this puts them in an awkward, almost contradictory position. There is the ubiquitous instinct of any elite team to contain any sense of excitement and maintain all focus on the task at hand, but at the same time, it is impossible to ignore the impact the tournament could have. \u201cI know that\u2019s kind of a boring answer to hear but it really is for us so important just to go game by game,\u201d Catley says. \u201cThere\u2019s no point really in thinking too far ahead because we\u2019re not there yet. Sometimes you can think too far ahead and that means you\u2019re not focused on the moment.\u201d Yet hosting the World Cup in Australia represents the capstone of generations of work by countless, often unsung and under-appreciated women\u2019s pioneers. The Matildas have been at the forefront of a movement that has put women\u2019s football into the public eye and dragged administrators and officials towards understanding its importance. It is why there was such excitement when Infantino announced the bid had been successful; Catley, who provided that evening\u2019s defining image as she leapt into the arms of Lydia Williams and Alanna Kenndy, described it as a match-winning feeling. \u201cAs a team, we\u2019ve always gotten better from having that sort of responsibility,\u201d Catley says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever shied away from it. We\u2019re the ones that have fought for pay equality, we\u2019re the ones that have gone through the hard times and worked for what we\u2019ve got. So for this to be in front of us, football is our main focus, but we are definitely aware that it could have a massive impact on the rest of Australian football. I think that definitely drives us and helps us.\u201d But for all the talk of the legacy the Women\u2019s Euros left on England and how it is now Australia\u2019s turn, there was another aspect to it all. Not only did the Lionesses host that tournament, they won it. It adds a heightened pressure for a team already shouldering so much. \u201cYou can almost say confidently that actually winning it created a buzz that is unlike anything else,\u201d Catley says. \u201cFor us, you see that and you go \u2018100% I want to do that for our country\u2019. Not trying to think too far ahead, one game at a time, but yeah, you couldn\u2019t think of doing anything better for your country than winning a World Cup on home soil.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033198f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/20/li-cunxin-maos-last-dander-retires-queensland-ballet-health-concerns", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Li Cunxin retiring from Queensland Ballet due to \u2018serious health concerns\u2019", "lead": "The 62-year-old ballet dancer and author of bestselling memoir Mao\u2019s Last Dancer is retiring after 11-years as artistic director, having been diagnosed with a heart condition", "author": "Sian Cain", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 02:53:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173933", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69bc189e6f77ca4e9825971ee927960a38bbfe2a/167_0_3750_2250/500.jpg", "body": "Li Cunxin, the renowned ballet dancer and author of bestselling memoir Mao\u2019s Last Dancer, is retiring as the artistic director of Queensland Ballet due to ill health. On Tuesday, the Queensland Ballet confirmed the 62-year-old had been diagnosed with a heart condition and \u201chas been troubled by serious health concerns since 2022\u201d. He recently experienced \u201ccomplications\u201d and is retiring in order to recuperate. Li\u2019s wife and fellow dancer Mary is being treated for cancer, and will also retire at the end of 2023 from her roles as ballet mistress and principal repetiteur. Staff and company dancers at Queensland Ballet, where Li has been artistic director for 11 years, were informed of the news on Tuesday morning. \u201cI need to take some space to recover and spend time with family,\u201d Li said in a statement. He said he was \u201ctremendously proud\u201d of the company, adding, \u201cThis journey has enriched my life beyond measure and offered me so much fulfilment and joy. From the moments of success to the periods of challenge and uncertainty that have dared me to dream fearlessly, it has been an incredible opportunity to each day make a difference to the arts in Queensland and the nation, and I\u2019ll miss it all terribly.\u201d The chairman of Queensland Ballet\u2019s board, Brett Clark, congratulated Li on \u201chis selfless, generous and visionary service\u201d. \u201cWhen I think about what Li Cunxin has achieved in life, for his family in China, for his family around the world, for ballet, for Queensland, for Queensland Ballet, it is nothing short of sensational,\u201d he said, adding that the company would celebrate Li\u2019s career in the coming months, before his retirement at the end of the 2023 season. Born into poverty as the sixth of seven brothers in rural Shandong, China, Li was selected by Chinese officials to attend the Beijing Dance Academy at the age of 11. Training 16 hours-a-day for seven years, Li emerged as a standout dancer and was one of two selected to study at the Houston Ballet. He defected to the west in 1981, which led to him being briefly incarcerated in the Chinese consulate in Houston. After a 21-hour standoff and an intervention by the then US-vice president, George Bush, Li was approved to stay in the US and his Chinese citizenship was revoked. He remained with the Houston Ballet for 16 years, before meeting Australian ballerina Mary McKendry, now Li, in London. They married in 1987 and moved to Melbourne in 1995. Li became a principal dancer with the Australian Ballet until he retired from dancing in 1999, at the age of 38. His 2003 memoir, Mao\u2019s Last Dancer, became a huge hit and made him a celebrity. The book was adapted into a film in 2009. He was named Australian father of the year in 2009 and had a spider named after him in 2016. After a period working as a stockbroker, he became artistic director of the Queensland Ballet in 2012. After an 18-year break, he returned to the stage to dance in a one-off performance of The Nutcracker with Queensland Ballet, in which he danced with Mary. Friends and admirers of Li paid tribute to him on Tuesday. Britain\u2019s Royal Ballet director, Kevin O\u2019Hare, said he had \u201clong admired Li\u201d, who has \u201cbeen a powerfully positive advocate for ballet in Australia and a dynamic force for dance worldwide\u201d, while the Australian Ballet artistic director, David Hallberg, said Li had \u201cmade Queensland Ballet a company that Australians have great pride in\u201d. In a joint statement, film director Baz Luhrmann and his production designer and wife, Catherine Martin, paid tribute to Li and Mary \u201cas creative compatriots and friends\u201d. \u201cLi has always had one eye on tradition and the other very much on the future. Though personal reasons have compelled him to prioritise his health at this time, I know he\u2019ll continue keep a keen eye on helping the next generation of ballet in Australia to flourish with the same global vivacity that has been the hallmark of his tenure,\u201d they said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331990", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/daniel-andrews-flags-tighter-rules-for-killers-seeking-parole-after-apologising-to-victims-families", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Daniel Andrews flags tighter rules for killers seeking parole after apologising to victims\u2019 families", "lead": "Victorian premier says families of those killed by Paul Denyer should have been treated better when he sought parole", "author": "Benita Kolovos", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 02:49:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173950", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/56a3217063b525b3dbd59d828f863291637aeb52/0_434_8089_4854/500.jpg", "body": "Murderers in Victoria could be restricted from applying for parole for several years under a proposal being considered by the state government to keep the serial killer Paul Denyer behind bars. The premier, Daniel Andrews, on Tuesday apologised to the families of Denyer\u2019s victims, who he admitted had not been adequately supported during the killer\u2019s recent failed bid for parole. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a situation where families who have been through unimaginable tragedy, where there\u2019s really very little prospect of any prospects that the person is going to get out, laying awake at night thinking that that person is going to be free,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe system has had 30 years to get ready for this day. Sadly, I don\u2019t think those families have been as well supported as they should have been. I\u2019ll take responsibility for that and we\u2019re going to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d He said the changes under consideration would be similar to those passed in Western Australia in 2018, which gave the state\u2019s attorney general the power to suspend parole applications by serial killers for up to six years at a time. \u201cIf you apply for parole and you are knocked back, an amount of time will have to pass before you\u2019re able to reapply \u2013 that will either be five years or perhaps longer,\u201d Andrews said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said there could be further limits applied to serial killers who have not engaged in rehabilitation programs while in prison. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to be involved in those rehabilitation programs, then you might get one crack at parole and that\u2019s it \u2013 you don\u2019t get any more,\u201d Andrews said. The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the proposals followed a meeting with the loved ones of Denyer\u2019s victims. \u201cThey are so tired. I don\u2019t want to politicise their pain \u2026 it\u2019s fair to say they welcomed my suggestions and they want to be involved in how we progress this legislation,\u201d she said. Denyer, now 51, was sentenced to three life sentences in 1993 after pleading guilty to the murders of Natalie Russell, 17, Elizabeth Stevens, 18, and Deborah Fream, 22. After an appeal, Denyer was granted a 30-year-sentence without parole, which made him eligible to apply for parole this year. His bid was refused by the adult parole board in May. There were fears among family and friends of Denyer\u2019s victims that he would continue to apply for parole. In April, he wrote to the Liberal Democrat MP David Limbrick, who was Russell\u2019s partner at the time she was murdered, saying he had been rehabilitated during his 30 years in jail and was not a danger to society. Limbrick said Denyer \u201ccannot be rehabilitated\u201d and was open to working with the government to keep him behind bars. \u201cWe need confidence that he can never harm another woman \u2013 that\u2019s been our goal all along. How the government wants to do that, that\u2019s up to them to figure out,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re sort of rushing at the last minute to come up with some sort of solution is pretty disappointing.\u201d A Coalition bill to restrict any future parole applications by Denyer unless he was at risk of death will be debated in the upper house on Wednesday but is likely to fail . The opposition\u2019s corrections spokesperson, Brad Battin, said the government was continuing to ignore Denyer\u2019s victim\u2019s families pleas to ensure he never apply for parole again. However, Andrews said they would not create a single law dealing specifically with Denyer\u2019s case. \u201cIf we keep trying to keep individuals behind bars with one-person laws, we are drumming up business for the high court and we will finish up potentially with a ruling that no one wants,\u201d he said. The Liberty Victoria spokesperson, Michael Stanton, said he welcomed the government\u2019s decision not to legislate in respect of individual prisoners but was concerned the proposed changes could have wider ramifications. \u201cWe understand that a prisoner being potentially granted parole will have a significant impact on victims and/or their family members and friends. However, these kinds of proposed reforms are highly susceptible to penal populism and are likely to operate unfairly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should allow the decision to be made by the appropriate independent authority with all relevant information. These are difficult issues, but we must guard against the danger of legislative overreach and politicised decision-making.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331991", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/titanic-tourist-submarine-missing-north-atlantic", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Titanic tourist submersible: desperate search for sub missing with five onboard", "lead": "French expert and British explorer believed to be among five onboard submersible missing in north Atlantic since Sunday", "author": "Edward Helmore in New York and Leyland Cecco in Toronto", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 02:08:24", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173967", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/09c371bed16d4eec79e1787b4bd4d4d55a6ab858/0_316_5049_3032/500.jpg", "body": "Search and rescue teams were racing against time on Monday to find a tourist sub that went missing in the north Atlantic while on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. The US Coast Guard said \u201ca small submarine with five persons onboard\u201d had gone missing in the vicinity of the Titanic wreck and that the vessel had the capacity to be submerged for 96 hours, but it was unclear whether it was still underwater or had surfaced and was unable to communicate. The submersible was reported overdue on Monday but contact was lost 1 hour 45 minutes into its dive on Sunday afternoon, the coast guard said. A British explorer and a French military veteran and submarine expert were believed to be among those onboard the Titan, a deep diving submersible operated by underwater tourism company Oceangate. Rear Admiral John Mauger, first district commander of the US coast guard, overseeing the search-and-rescue operation, told a press conference late on Monday afternoon that \u201cwe are doing everything we can do\u201d to find the sub and its occupants. US and Canadian ships and planes swarmed the area about 1,450km east of Cape Cod, some dropping sonar buoys that can monitor to a depth of almost 4,000m, the US Coast Guard said, but the search was \u201ccomplex\u201d because crews did not know if the vessel had surfaced, meaning they must scour both the surface and the ocean depths of nearly 13,000 feet. \u201cWe\u2019re making the best use of every moment of that time. What we\u2019re focused on is finding those five people,\u201d Mauger said. David Concannon, an adviser to OceanGate, said the submersible\u2019s 96-hour oxygen supply started at roughly 6am Sunday. In an email to the Associated Press, Concannon said officials were working to get a remotely operated vehicle that could reach a depth of 6,000m to the site as soon as possible. Despite the wreck of the Titanic resting south-east of the coast of Newfoundland, Canadian authorities told the Guardian the search efforts were under the jurisdiction of the US Coast Guard\u2019s Boston fleet. OceanGate Expeditions, the company that offers the visits to the wreck, which lies on the ocean floor at a depth of almost 4,000m and about 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, has been running expeditions since 2021. A statement on the company\u2019s website on Monday read: \u201cOur entire focus is on the crew members in the submersible and their families. We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to re-establish contact with the submersible.\u201d One of those believed to be on board is Paul Henry Nargeolet, a former French navy commander, a deep diver and a submersible pilot. As director of underwater research for E/M Group and RMS Titanic, Inc, he is widely considered the leading authority on the wreck site and it is possible he was in charge of the submersible on the dive, with four passengers alongside. Nargeolet has led several expeditions to the Titanic site and supervised the recovery of 5,000 artifacts, including the recovery of the \u201cbig piece\u201d, a 20-tonne section of Titanic\u2019s hull. British businessman Hamish Harding, a well-known aviator and explorer who is one of the tiny group of tourists who have been to space, was booked on the trip. His stepson, Brian Szasz, posted on Facebook his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d as \u201chis submarine has gone missing\u201d and then later deleted the post. Harding, 58, posted on Instagram on Saturday: \u201cDue to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023. A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow.\u201d In a previous post he described himself as \u201ca mission specialist\u201d on the trip. The RMS Titanic, a British passenger liner which had been marketed as \u201cunsinkable\u201d, sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912. It had been en route from Britain to the US when it was holed by an iceberg. The lives of 1,514 of the 2,224 passengers and crew were lost and the Titanic became perhaps the most famous civilian shipwreck of all time. The wreck itself was not found until the 1980s. OceanGate started taking small crews of \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d in a five-person mini sub two years ago. A ticket costs $250,000. According to the company\u2019s website, Oceangate had an eight-day, seven-night expedition to the wreck planned for 12-20 June. A maximum of six visitors were scheduled to depart and return to St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada. Since 2021, the Bahamas-based OceanGate Expeditions has ferried about 60 paying customers and 15-20 researchers to the wreck. \u201cWe started the business and it was this idea of researchers and wealthy people,\u201d OceanGate founder Stockton Rush told the Guardian in January. \u201cIs there a way to match those people who wanted to have an adventure travel experience with researchers who need funding and a sub?\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331992", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/20/rba-meeting-minutes-interest-rates-june-lift-cash-rate-finely-balanced-reserve-bank-says", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "RBA says decision to lift interest rate in June was \u2018finely balanced\u2019, easing expectations of further hikes", "lead": "Minutes from RBA meeting on 6 June show the board was concerned about the \u2018considerable uncertainty regarding the outlook for household spending\u2019", "author": "Peter Hannam Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 01:32:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.173985", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9b57582565bf19e0675288c9b4887d338e9ad836/0_183_5134_3082/500.jpg", "body": "The Reserve Bank of Australia says its decision to increase the official interest rate in June rather than pause was \u201cfinely balanced\u201d and further increases would hinge on how developments at home and abroad affect the inflation outlook. This assessment, contained in minutes of the RBA\u2019s 6 June board meeting released on Tuesday, may ease some of the expectation that the central bank will hike rates much further in coming months. At the June meeting, the bank lifted the cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.1%, the highest level since 2012. The Australian dollar fell by almost half a US cent to about 68 US cents after the minutes were released, indicating investors were responding to the more dovish tone by paring their expectations of how soon and how much higher rates will rise. \u201cIn taking the decision to increase interest rates again, [board] members acknowledged the considerable uncertainty regarding the outlook for household spending and the financial stresses facing some households,\u201d the minutes showed. \u201cMembers affirmed their determination to return inflation to target and their willingness to do what is necessary to achieve that.\u201d The RBA has hoisted interest rates by four percentage points in 12 moves over the past 13 months, beginning its rate rise cycle during the May 2022 federal election. Critics have warned that the lagging effects of increases \u2013 banks can take a couple of months to pass changes on to borrowers \u2013 mean that the central bank was at risk of hammering demand too hard to knock inflation down to its preferred 2%-3% annual rate, sending the economy into a hard landing. Since the board meeting, though, the May labour market figures have been released. They showed the jobless rate falling unexpectedly to 3.6% from 3.7% in April, with more than 70,000 extra jobs added, or about four time more than market economists had forecast. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The minutes indicate the RBA\u2019s main concern remains whether inflation will prove too persistent, failing to slow to 3% by mid-2025, as the banks wants. Among the reasons for such stickiness in pricing was that \u201csome firms were indexing their prices, implicitly or directly, to past inflation\u201d. There was also the possibility that wage increases were also being indexed to past high inflation and the \u201cpotential\u201d was there for such a trend to become widespread. \u201cThese developments created an increased risk that high inflation would be persistent, which would make it more difficult to keep the economy on the narrow path\u201d sought by the RBA of cooling inflation without stalling the economy. The RBA board members noted the federal budget had \u201cnot had a material effect\u201d on RBA staff forecasts. The 5.75% increase in the Fair Work Commission\u2019s annual wage decision, though, had been higher than staff modelling and would add directly to the September quarter\u2019s wage price index. While it was understandable that lowest paid workers would be compensated for high inflation, \u201cit would be concerning if wages across a broad range of jobs were to become implicitly indexed to high inflation\u201d, the minutes showed. The minutes detailed the case for leaving the cash rate unchanged at 3.85%. The nine board members noted that the \u201csignificant increases in interest rates to date\u201d raised the possibility that the economy might slow more sharply than expected. \u201cMembers noted that consumption growth was already quite weak, especially in per-capita terms,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cReal disposable incomes were falling, especially for home-loan borrowers, and many renters were experiencing difficult financial conditions.\u201d Inflation, too, might fall faster than anticipated, not least because of falling commodity prices. The RBA noted that about 10% of household disposable income would be taken up by debt repayments by the end of 2024, up from about 9% in April. For now, the value of non-performing housing loans had risen a little, but from a very low level, and personal insolvencies remained at low levels, the board said. The board members noted that the resumption in the growth in house prices \u201cif sustained\u201d implied less of a drag on consumer spending in the coming year. The recent stabilisation in housing loan approvals also suggested that \u201cfinancial conditions may not have been as tight as [the board] had previously judged\u201d. Economists and data groups have lately revised their forecasts to predict broad-based price increases after earlier expecting falls.

In Is God Is, all these worlds collide as two Black twin sisters, Racine and Anaia, decide to avenge both their mother and themselves by finding and killing their violent father. The award-winning play by US playwright Aleshea Harris, who the New York Times anointed a \u201csnarly new master of high-octane carnage\u201d in its review of the show\u2019s world premiere in 2018, makes its Australian debut this month under the co-direction of Zindzi Okenyo and Shari Sebbens. The two previously worked together on Jasmine Lee-Jones\u2019 play Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner, which sold out seasons in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Okenyo and Sebbens both separately read and fell in love with Is God Is, so they jumped at the chance to bring it to life, and to work together again when approached by Melbourne Theatre Company artistic director Anne-Louise Sarks. Okenyo says it is a bold and progressive move to program this play in Australia. \u201cAfter all my years of working as an actor in main-stage theatre companies, I was not expecting a show like this to be programmed,\u201d she says. \u201cHistorically, we haven\u2019t been able to do stories like this on main stages.\u201d Co-produced by Sydney theatre company, where the play will open in September, Is God Is is the MTC\u2019s first all-Black production; its cast of eight actors includes Henrietta Enyonam Amevor (Bump) and Masego Pitso (Chewing Gum Dreams), as well as actors with US backgrounds, to bring out the cultural context of the work. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to take part in a Black American work, so I want to be really specific with that,\u201d Okenyo says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any adaptations to make it more Australian \u2013 we\u2019re doing the text as it is and as it needs.\u201d Is God Is takes the audience on a breakneck, bloodthirsty journey from New York to the dirty south to California. Physically scarred from their abusive past, the sisters seek justice and revenge. These characters are complex: like Medea before them, their morality exists in shades of grey, their rage both palpable and righteous. \u201cIs God Is celebrates and affirms their anger without care for those who don\u2019t believe Black women and girls get to be mad,\u201d Harris says via email. \u201cThe well-worn tropes were ripe for reinvigoration.\u201d \u201cBlack women are often stereotyped into just being strong or having to be survivors in a one-dimensional kind of way, whereas the twins are so multifaceted,\u201d Okenyo says. \u201cMy aim is to make sure that every character has deep humanity.\u201d Harris\u2019s writing is electric, rendered in a distinctive dialect. Even the stage directions read like slices of poetry: one calls for \u201ca sound like a thousand matches being struck simultaneously\u201d. She leaves a lot for the actors to interpret, with a unique use of typography \u2013 words and phrases are presented in different sizes and fonts, but there is no specific direction as to how these passages should be performed. Cessalee Stovall, who plays the twins\u2019 mother known as God or simply She, is enjoying the challenge, often playing against what might be the obvious interpretation. \u201cWhat\u2019s been really fun in the room is to explore \u2013 what if that typography is about how much intensity you have, and you play the opposite?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting that Aleshea doesn\u2019t tell us what to do with it, and instead allows us to be really creative.\u201d Setting, too, is malleable. Okenyo is reluctant to reveal too much before audiences in Melbourne see it, but confirms that it is different to what has been done overseas in the US, UK or Canada, with a \u201creally complex piece of architecture\u201d as the central stage setting. \u201cThere are really interesting provocations from the writer in terms of how we can make bold choices, and live outside of the parameters of what we think classical theatre might be,\u201d she says. Is God Is arrives at a critical time for Australian theatre. Okenyo and Sebbens\u2019 last co-production made headlines earlier this year when the Age published a rebuttal to a request from the show\u2019s creative team, asking publications to only send critics of colour to review it. The stipulation originated in London and was honoured by the Australian production. Stovall runs Stage a Change, an organisation dedicated to creating more opportunities for people of colour in theatre, and wrote a widely shared open letter responding to the controversy. \u201cI\u2019m happy to know how many people are still thinking about it and questioning things,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a simple fix \u2013 I think it\u2019s an ongoing, systemic level change \u2026 It\u2019s an amazing and exciting opportunity for Australia to decide how we are going to be leaders in this conversation.\u201d For this production \u2013 particularly considering its heavy themes \u2013 Okenyo and Sebbens are fostering a culturally safe workplace where cast members can feel supported. \u201cYou have to be really mindful with work that is centred on trauma intertwining with performers that aren\u2019t traditionally comfortable or allowed in these spaces,\u201d Okenyo says. \u201cWhen you bring Black people into a space like this, you have to think really deeply about what people need \u2026 It\u2019s important that I am Black, and they are Black, and that they see themselves in me and each other.\u201d Through that care and kinship, a kind of radiance emerges. \u201cThe Black experience is so centred on optimism and joy and how we overcome struggle, and so even though we\u2019re making a work that is really dark, there\u2019s so much joy in the room,\u201d Okenyo says. Five years after the play\u2019s debut off-Broadway, Harris says, \u201cI still love it and feel strongly that it does, on the page, exactly what I want it to do \u2026 I hope people, especially Black women, find it compelling and useful.\u201d Is God Is provides a much-needed shake-up for what Stovall calls MTC\u2019s \u201chomogenous\u201d audience \u2013 still largely rich, older white patrons. More importantly, it opens the traditionally elitist world of theatre to a new community by telling a story that is by, for and about them. \u201cI hope that Black people feel really comfortable in coming to MTC and feeling like a part of this community,\u201d Okenyo says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been the only Black actor in the room, and now I\u2019m working on these plays that centre the Black experience. I\u2019m really proud to be part of this movement.\u201d Is God Is runs at Southbank Theatre, MTC until 15 July; it opens at Sydney theatre company on 15 September"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331994", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/20/if-its-broken-they-fix-it-four-fashion-brands-that-give-their-garments-a-second-life", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "If it\u2019s broken, they fix it: four fashion brands that give their garments a second life", "lead": "From a word-of-mouth mending service to decades-old circular-fashion initiatives, meet four labels extending their garments\u2019 lives through repair programs", "author": "Lucianne Tonti", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 00:27:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174022", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/08f1e9ecce5c85ff45a68bf30e5564df89aeed4c/0_279_6016_3609/500.jpg", "body": "Earlier this month the Australian Fashion Council, in partnership with several organisations and government agencies, announced the final stage of its scheme to reduce the 200,000 tonnes of clothing waste sent to landfill every year in Australia. The Seamless scheme imposes a four-cent levy on each garment produced by fashion businesses, which will fund research into sustainability for the industry and establish the infrastructure for textile recycling. While the scheme is voluntary \u2013 the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has flagged the industry may face regulation in 12 months\u2019 time \u2013 it encourages fashion businesses to embrace circularity and take responsibility for the full life cycle of a garment by making rental, resale and repair available for consumers. This week, we take a look at four global fashion brands that have successfully integrated repair into their business models \u2013 and how they have navigated some trickier aspects like monetisation and garment collection. Patagonia Patagonia\u2019s Worn Wear program has been part of the outdoor brand\u2019s DNA since the 1970s. Worn Wear is an umbrella term for a variety of circular initiatives that include personal repair and care tools (including DIY kits and online tutorials), resale and repair services and an upcycled line of vests and bags. Through the repair-and-resale program, customers can send back eligible items via post or in-store drop-off and receive a voucher for up to 50% of the resale price of the item. The repaired secondhand garments are then sold at a reduced price. Currently, this scheme is only available in the United States. But when it comes to repairing Patagonia items, the company has 72 repair centres all over the world where items are mended free of charge or for a nominal fee. Corey Simpson, a communications manager for Patagonia, says, \u201clast year we repaired 100,000 items, and we plan to grow that commitment over time\u201d. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The largest stand-alone repair centre is in Reno, Nevada, where Simpson says more than 115 full-time employees repair returned Patagonia items. Nudie Jeans Inside every Nudie Jeans store is a repair shop for worn and damaged denim from the Swedish label. The in-store repair program began on a \u201cvery small scale around 15 years ago\u201d says Kevin Gelsi, Nudie Jeans\u2019 circular product manager. Back then, each store had a hemming machine to shorten jean-leg lengths but over time, staff used the machines to repair their own jeans and began offering the service to customers. This became a \u201cword-of-mouth attraction\u201d, says Gelsi, and as the repairs grew in popularity the label decided to make it \u201can official concept of its own\u201d. Before long, Nudie Jeans stores also had darning machines to patch up denim; and in 2012 the brand introduced its Reuse take-back program, where customers were offered a 20% discount on a new pair of Nudies in exchange for their old, worn-out pair. The reclaimed jeans were resold, used for patches in repairs, or saved for recycling projects. Today, the Reuse program has grown to include all Nudie garments, and the discount incentive can be used to purchase secondhand jeans. The numbers point to the program\u2019s success \u2013 in 2022, Nudie repaired 65,386 pairs of jeans, resold 3,984 pairs and collected 20,722 post-consumer jeans. Kathmandu This year, New Zealand outdoor clothing brand Kathmandu launched Kathman-REDU, a program that takes faulty, returned or unsellable items and cleans, repairs and refurbishes them to sellable condition. The program launched in the Richmond and Galleria Kathmandu stores in Melbourne, with the intention to scale up over time. Aleasha McCallion from the Monash Sustainable Development Institute worked with Kathmandu to figure out exactly where along the supply chain there were \u201cpockets of waste\u201d that could instead be redirected to more profitable items. \u201cNone of their waste is directly going to landfill, but it\u2019s ending up in seconds and not actually being repaired. So, it might be sold at a discount because something\u2019s broken,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was really about taking a look at and maximising all of that potential.\u201d In addition, the brand has a drop-off used clothing scheme in partnership with recycler Upparel. Clothing collection bins have been placed in 24 Kathmandu stores across Melbourne, and customers can donate their old, used or faulty Kathmandu gear. A portion of appropriate items from this initiative will be repaired and returned to retail as a part of the Kathman-REDU scheme. Asket In May, Swedish brand Asket opened a bricks-and-mortar retail store in Stockholm dedicated to the sale of reconditioned secondhand garments. Before committing to a permanent location, cofounders August Bard Bring\u00e9us and Jakob Sazon Dworsky ran a twelve-month takeback and repair program \u2013 including opening two pop-up retail spaces \u2013 to trial the concept. The response was so good they believed a permanent store could be financially viable. So far at the Stockholm store, they have collected some 2,000 worn garments and reconditioned 70% of them. Customers send pre-loved Asket garments through the mail; in exchange, they receive a voucher of up to \u20ac25, depending on the garment. The garments are then sent to Fabrik\u00f6rerna, a partner factory on the west coast of Sweden, to be repaired for resale. Currently Asket are searching for a solution for garments that are beyond restoration. \u201cWe are in discussion with local remake organisations and continue to look for viable recycling options with a focus on garments being used to create new yarn,\u201d say Bard Bring\u00e9us and Dworsky in a joint email response. \u201cThe intended solution would include using fabric scraps to remake into unique items or recycling the fabric.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331995", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/20/will-a-national-rent-freeze-fix-australias-housing-crisis-depends-on-who-you-listen-to", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Will a national rent freeze fix Australia\u2019s housing crisis?

Berlin froze rents in 2019 on apartments built before 2014. It saved that city\u2019s renters billions before being ruled unconstitutional in 2021. Perverse supply outcomes that were promised failed to materialise, with Berlin seeing much faster new housing development than the 13 next-largest German cities in the two years of the policy. The likely outcome of the Green\u2019s political bargain, however, is a more modest rental regulation that smooths out rental price shocks, rather than freezing rents in place, which is something that even landlords think is a good idea. Most states protect landlords from the \u201cbill shock\u201d of sudden increases in their land taxes. To smooth out costs for landlords, land values are averaged out the last three years. A sudden 30% increase in land values, for example, would normally result in a 30% or more jump in land taxes. But we have \u201ctax controls\u201d that instead smooth this out to 10% a year over three years. Protecting landlords from \u201cbill shock\u201d costs taxpayers hundreds of millions a year in forgone revenue when property prices are rising. Second generation rent controls that limit the rate that rents can increase offer the same protection for tenants and have operated for decades in many countries like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands. Even the ACT limits rent increases to a touch above CPI for ongoing rental contracts. It is the modern tenancy standard. Many landlords will even voluntarily smooth out rental increases for tenants over multiple years because they see the fairness of it and value tenant stability. I was a landlord for 20 years and that\u2019s what I did. There is nothing radical here. Yet the actions of landlord and property lobby groups against any such change to tenancy laws would have you thinking that limiting the rate of rent increases amounts to \u201cbombing a city\u201d as economist Assar Lindbeck described rent controls back in 1971. Supply will dry up. Landlords will sell. Houses will disappear. In fact, some economists have gone so far as to say that rent controls will backfire and raise housing rents and prices in the future. Call me sceptical, but landlords lobbying against a policy that will increase the value of their property in the long run seems contrary to their own financial interests. And that\u2019s the problem \u2013 landlords make money from higher rents, so they are going to complain about policies that work to make rents lower, and support policies that don\u2019t. They aren\u2019t saints. I call this pattern of property lobbying The Great Housing Contradiction. Landlords lobby against rent controls, which they say won\u2019t make housing cheaper, and for upzoning and more competition, which they say will. Deceptive stories and mythmaking like this is normal behaviour for interest groups. Prior to Medicare, doctors fought against public intervention and free medical services for customers if it meant they could only charge a regulated price for their service. The taxi industry hates more competition and lower prices, arguing for more regulation, not less, to protect their monopoly. The pharmacy industry today is lobbying to make prescriptions more expensive for the public by pushing against 60-day dispensing. Even in the 1930s depression era when building public housing emerged as a policy to support the poor and a macroeconomic stimulus tool, landlords across the US lobbied hard against the government supplying housing and competing with them for tenants. None of these groups are evil. They are just self-interested like the rest of us. Economic studies are also weaponised to make these arguments. For example, a study of San Francisco rent control found that 15% decline in the number people in rent controlled housing after two decades, which is interpreted as some kind of decline in the supply of housing. But that was the result of a combination of half of those being renovated or redeveloped into more and better housing and half due to selling to owner-occupiers. These are both good things but can be twisted as a negative by calling them a \u201cdecline in supply\u201d. But that doesn\u2019t make it true. The fact that the only way to earn more rent when rents are regulated is to build more housing seems neglected.

After the Australian newspaper published texts between former Liberal staffer Higgins and her partner David Sharaz, Network Ten confirmed it had asked the Australian federal police to investigate \u201ca suspected contempt of court in relation to material produced under an AFP warrant and a subpoena issued in the ACT supreme court which appears to have been disclosed to the media\u201d.

Daniel Westerman, in a speech on Tuesday, will also argue that delays in transmission construction have left the grid vulnerable to the sudden exit of coal-fired power stations. Westerman says coal plants supply about 60% of the country\u2019s electricity needs but as much as two-thirds of the capacity could leave the grid by 2030. Renewable energy backed by storage was the cheapest form of new capacity, and there was \u201ca strong pipeline\u201d of proposed new wind and solar plants totalling more than 200 gigawatts of capacity, the Aemo boss will tell the Australian Energy Week 2023 conference. However, whether they would actually be built remained uncertain. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThis investment is not happening fast enough\u201d for what was \u201cthe biggest energy system transformation since the introduction of electricity itself\u201d, Westerman says in his written speech. \u201cBringing these new projects to market and connecting them into the grid urgently is critical to ensure consumers continue to have reliable power when they need it.\u201d Westerman\u2019s comments echo those of industry groups, such as the Clean Energy Council, which have warned that the influx of new renewables is faltering and could fall far short of the speed required to meet energy demand and the need to reduce emissions from the power sector. Electricity generation is the country\u2019s largest source of carbon pollution. States such as New South Wales have recently announced that their plans to accelerate away from fossil fuels are running behind schedule. Snowy Hydro\u2019s giant 2.0 pumped hydro project, the largest energy project in the country, is also years late and facing much higher costs than originally predicted. Westerman noted that were no new financial commitments on large-scale renewable energy generation signed in the first quarter of 2023. Only a single storage plant secured investment support. \u201cOne quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but investment decisions are an important leading indicator for our energy transition,\u201d he said. Aemo was working to support 163 projects with 27GW of capacity in eastern Australia that were at various stages of connection. Securing approval from local communities for the new projects and the power lines linking them was one of the main challenges. \u201cThis situation has been framed in fairly oppositional terms: city versus country; business versus community, infrastructure versus agriculture, David versus Goliath,\u201d Westerman said. \u201cLandowners in these communities that host transmission towers should be fairly compensated.\u201d Victoria and NSW have been offering landholders payments over time of $200,000 per kilometre for power lines on their properties and Queensland as much as $300,000. While large-scale plants will need to increase nine-fold by 2050, rooftop solar is projected to expand five times to reach two in three homes by then. Rooftop solar already amounted to 15GW of capacity in eastern states, or about a quarter of the total. \u201cBut as the operator who is accountable for system security, huge amounts of rooftop solar can sometimes be a challenge because it is largely invisible and doesn\u2019t yet respond to either market or operational signals,\u201d Westerman said. More was also needed to be done to improve energy efficiency so less energy was required in the first place. Australia ranked 18th out of 25 nations on the efficient use of energy, lagging countries such as India and Indonesia, he said. Storage, too, was another challenge. The grid now has about 2GW of capacity in the form of batteries or pumped hydro, a scale that will need to expand 30-fold by 2050."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331998", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/20/gay-rights-are-going-backwards-in-the-us-says-elton-john", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gay rights are going backwards in the US, says Elton John", "lead": "Singer says he will no longer do residencies in the US, describing recent changes in law as \u2018disgraceful\u2019", "author": "Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 23:01:25", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174090", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d31f5ad2ecc63184e5c6ff29b9b484587e367136/0_134_2896_1738/500.jpg", "body": "Gay rights are going backwards in the US, where \u201cdisgraceful\u201d laws are discriminating against LGBTQ+ people, Elton John has said.

The latest cost of living tracker by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) found the government\u2019s \u00a3900-a-year payments, which are paid in three \u00a3300 instalments, provided only short-lived respite for poorer households struggling to afford everyday basics from food to shampoo. The anti-poverty charity warned high levels of hardship had hardly budged over the past 12 months and were in danger of becoming \u201cbaked in\u201d. It said record food inflation and soaring energy bills, combined with inadequate universal credit rates, emphasised how unaffordable everyday life had become for many. Although the \u00a3300 payments on average amounted to the equivalent of a fifth of eligible households\u2019 monthly income, the survey found they provided little in the way of breathing space for families and were rapidly used up, mainly to pay down debts and buy food. Although the support payments were appreciated by many claimants, they were \u201cclearly insufficient to reduce ongoing day-to-day financial strain,\u201d the charity said. Instead, it concluded, \u201cthey appear to have prevented already worrying high levels [of debt] getting worse.\u201d JRF\u2019s survey of 4,000 UK households earning less than \u00a326,000 a year \u2013 the bottom 40% of incomes \u2013 found that 39% were behind with at least one bill with average arrears of \u00a31,600. A third of households had applied for a loan but were rejected, while more than a fifth said they had borrowed from loan sharks or payday lenders. Although 80% of those surveyed who were on universal credit had received a cost of living payment at the time of the survey in May, 90% said they had gone without essentials, and 69% said they had cut back on fresh food, with a similar proportion saying adults in the household had skipped meals. Rachel Earwaker, a JRF senior economist, said: \u201cOver the past year people have been telling us about being unable to afford hot meals, shampoo or a warm shower. We are seeing these levels of hardship persist and it has become a horrendous new normal.\u201d She added: \u201cThat places a huge burden on families in the here and now, but we need to get real that this is a hardship crisis that won\u2019t end as inflation starts to fall. Higher prices will remain baked in, and cost of living payments, while necessary, are not even providing breathing space for people who desperately need it.\u201d Households have been hit by average price rises of more than 18% over the past two years, with energy prices climbing by 110% over the same period. At the same time earnings rose by 13% and benefits by 14%, with many low-income households \u2013 a third have savings of under \u00a3200 \u2013 having little in reserve to cope, said JRF. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are providing record financial support to those who need it most, with a \u00a394bn cost of living support package worth around \u00a33,300 per household. \u201cOn top of this we have raised benefits, including universal credit, by 10.1%, increased the national living wage and are helping families with essential costs through the household support fund.

Sounding the alarm as the economy struggles to gain momentum, the Institute for Public Policy Research said the UK risked falling further behind comparable wealthy nations without a sharp turnaround in approach. Business investment is lower in the UK than in any other country in the G7, and 27th out of 30 OECD countries, ahead of only Poland, Luxembourg and Greece. Highlighting a severe shortfall in public and private investment stretching back over several decades, the IPPR\u2019s research showed that Britain had ranked below the G7 average since 2005 for spending on infrastructure, research and development, skills and training. Had the UK maintained its position at the G7 average since that date, the private sector would have invested an extra \u00a3354bn in real terms. If public sector investment had also held that position, the UK government would have invested an additional \u00a3208bn between 2006 and 2021. However, the UK has steadily slipped down the global investment league tables as successive governments have held back from boosting expenditure, alongside a faltering performance in the private sector \u2013 amounting to a shortfall versus the G7 average worth the equivalent of 30 Elizabeth line rail projects. The centre-left thinktank said low investment put Britain at risk of being left behind in a global race to develop the green industries of the future, which are forecast to be worth $10.3tn (\u00a38tn) to the global economy by 2050. The findings come as Rishi Sunak\u2019s government attempts to reboot economic growth with a focus on boosting business investment, including with a package of tax reliefs announced as part of the spring budget. Business leaders say political and economic instability, Brexit, high inflation and rising interest rates are deterring firms from investing in Britain. The IPPR said increased public investment could \u201ccrowd-in\u201d private sector investment and give confidence to companies to choose the UK as a place to build the green companies of the future \u2013 provided the government invested with a sense of longevity and certainty, as Joe Biden\u2019s administration had done in the US. George Dibb, an associate director for economy at IPPR, said: \u201cIf the economy is the engine of a country, investment is its fuel. But the UK\u2019s tank is running on empty and it\u2019s harming economic growth, driving inequality and slowing progress towards net zero and energy security. \u201cCurrently, the UK is experiencing a debilitating case of investment-phobia, and the government\u2019s aversion to investing to seize future opportunities is stopping us from getting out of the growth doom loop we find ourselves in.\u201d A government spokesperson said it was \u201cdisingenuous to say the UK is not harnessing the power of green tech and investment\u201d because almost \u00a3200bn of public and private investment had been made since 2010. \u201cWith the lowest corporation tax in the G7, a smart regulatory system and a simplified tax system, the UK is an exceptionally attractive place to do business, and a top destination for investment in Europe.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033199b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/20/fixing-uk-draughty-homes-could-add-40bn-to-economy-by-2030-citizens-advice-energy-efficiency-standards", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fixing UK\u2019s draughty homes could add \u00a340bn to economy, says Citizens Advice", "lead": "Report finds that raising minimum energy efficiency standards by 2030 could have huge impact beyond bills", "author": "Jillian Ambrose Energy correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 23:01:24", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174143", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5dee4f517639daead8979e43ac8a51277d70ebd2/0_0_4368_2621/500.jpg", "body": "Fixing Britain\u2019s draughty homes could add almost \u00a340bn to the economy by the end of the decade by cutting energy use and improving health, according to research by Citizens Advice. The consumer group said raising the minimum energy efficiency standards of Britain\u2019s homes could have a profound impact beyond reducing bills and should be the government\u2019s top priority. Home heating bills could fall by \u00a324bn if the efficiency of 13m homes was upgraded to at least a C rating under the energy performance certificate (EPC) scheme by 2030, according to Citizens Advice\u2019s research. It also found warmer homes could help to avoid 6,000 unnecessary winter deaths every year, which would have an economic benefit of \u00a36.6bn. Better insulated homes could help save the NHS about \u00a32bn by preventing millions of people from developing respiratory conditions including asthma, it said. Using less energy could save an estimated \u00a34bn worth of investment in infrastructure such as new electricity networks and substations needed to meet the UK\u2019s growing demand for electricity. It would also reduce emissions from power plants by 5%, thus cutting air pollution, and bring a \u00a32.7bn benefit to society, the report found. Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cThe impact of raising minimum energy standards would be profound: giving a boost to household budgets, improving people\u2019s health, increasing energy security and helping the UK reach its net zero targets.\u201d The government has been criticised for dragging its feet on enacting proposals that would force landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties to at least an EPC rating of C by 2028. Privately rented homes are only required to meet an E rating. Research by the Energy and Climate Intelligence unit thinktank has found that delaying the measures to 2030 could add \u00a31bn to the energy bills of 2.4m of the UK\u2019s leakiest homes. Moriarty said the Citizens Advice report showed insulating homes was \u201cabout so much more than reducing energy bills. It\u2019s a long-term solution that makes running the NHS cheaper and boosts quality of life in areas that need it most.\u201d \u201cThe government must make improving our draughty homes a top priority,\u201d she added. Ministers began a consultation on raising the minimum EPC requirement for privately rented homes in 2020 \u2013 but the government has so far not turned the proposals into legislation. Elmhurst Energy, which runs an EPC accreditation scheme, said landlords needed clarity on the government\u2019s plans. Stuart Fairlie, Elmhurst\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cPrivate landlords are understandably concerned about the property improvement-related regulatory changes coming their way, but most of these fears are not based on fact. \u201cTo calm concerns, we need absolute clarity on the deadline for making energy efficiency improvements to EPC band C, clarity at a policy level on how our housing stock reaches carbon net zero, and clarity on the level of monetary support landlords will receive for making energy efficiency improvements.\u201d A government spokesman said: \u201cThe government\u2019s record on energy efficiency speaks for itself, with the proportion of homes in England with an EPC rating of C or above up from 14% in 2010 to 47% in 2022. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, an additional 300,000 of the UK\u2019s least energy efficient homes are in line for improvement under the new Great British Insulation Scheme, and we have committed \u00a36.6bn towards upgrades this parliament, plus a further \u00a36bn from 2025.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033199c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/20/note-to-labour-energy-transition-isnt-just-about-power-generation", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Note to Labour: energy transition isn\u2019t just about power generation", "lead": "There are some doubts as to whether Starmer\u2019s publicly-owned energy company will have its emphasis in the right place", "author": "Nils Pratley", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 23:00:25", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174161", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ba578ca139e2d46eaeae8afa332e0c6e034fcf3c/0_101_3936_2362/500.jpg", "body": "A Labour government would establish a new publicly-owned energy generation company in Scotland, Keir Starmer announced on Monday.

Clarity can\u2019t wait for ever. But we are \u2013 at last \u2013 getting more detail on what the company would do. It would, for example, back a \u201clocal power plan\u201d to build clean energy projects at a community level. Since there are numerous examples from Europe of successful municipal networks \u2013 from Germany and Norway \u2013 that seems uncontentious. Other examples where GBE would look to invest are described as emerging technologies, from green hydrogen, floating offshore wind to tidal and so on. And, thankfully, Labour does not imagine that GBE would be a go-it-alone investor. It is talking the language of public-private partnerships and using public money as a way to de-risk projects. That all sounds commendable and pragmatic. Yet, even among supporters of a new publicly-backed enterprise, there are doubts about whether GBE has got its emphasis in the correct place. Labour talks almost exclusively about the new company being a generator of power. But is generation really the top priority? The far trickier bit in energy transition \u2013 and the part where the UK is off the pace internationally \u2013 is decarbonising the industrial base. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, will speak on Tuesday at King\u2019s College London and one hopes he has digested the friendly thoughts of Nick Butler, the college\u2019s visiting professor and energy economist. There is \u201ca serious role\u201d for a publicly-owned enterprise, agrees Butler\u2019s 43-page report (also out on Tuesday), but transition is not all about generation capacity. Here\u2019s a key line from Butler\u2019s report: \u201cMuch of the debate on energy policy focuses on extending the base of supply, but increased volume of low-carbon energy from wind or solar will only make a difference if consumers can use the energy produced as a substitute for their existing use of hydrocarbons.\u201d Exactly. There is no shortage of capital willing to invest in new offshore wind projects (even if one wishes more windfarms in UK waters were UK-owned). And, if a Labour government loosens the planning rules for onshore wind, as Starmer says it would, there would probably be a queue of investors there too. So, if one were prioritising targets for state intervention in the energy system, big generation projects might be near the bottom. \u201cThe full potential of wind power \u2026 will only be delivered if there are significant advances in the use of electricity in areas such as heating, transport and industry \u2013 the sectors which account for the majority of current energy demand,\u201d says the report. Butler has a long list of ideas of priority investment, all of which could be grouped as demand, rather than supply, challenges: ensure the grid can handle large volumes of renewable power and be compatible with two-way transfers from electric vehicles; develop storage capacity to ensure renewable power is not wasted at times of excess supply; complete electrification of the railways, which should have happened years ago; develop a hydrogen network; and support development of a North Sea energy grid with other countries to mitigate challenges of intermittency. Every item on that wishlist sounds fertile territory for a state-backed company \u2013 big stuff that requires heavy lifting and long-term backing. Decarbonising industry, note, is also where the bulk of subsidies under Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act are being directed. Labour isn\u2019t blind to the wider challenges, of course. Monday\u2019s document on the plan to make Britain \u201ca cleaner energy superpower\u201d also recognised the need to upgrade the electricity transmission infrastructure and expand the grid\u2019s capacity. But accelerating rail electrification, for instance, wasn\u2019t mentioned. It\u2019s early days, but one wishes Labour\u2019s vision for GBE was wider than clean energy generation. If the job of the company is to fill gaps in the national decarbonisation programme, there are some yawning holes that aren\u2019t being talked about enough."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033199d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/chris-paul-discovered-he-had-been-traded-to-wizards-in-text-from-14-year-old-son", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chris Paul discovered he had been traded to Wizards in text from 14-year-old son", "lead": "Chris Paul discovered that his career in Phoenix had ended in a text from his teenage son on Sunday", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 22:36:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174202", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/30654134c83a19fc486336816ec5b9a5c78dd266/0_185_5547_3328/500.jpg", "body": "Chris Paul discovered that his career in Phoenix had ended in a text from his teenage son.

Johnson faces being blocked from obtaining special access to parliament after being rounded on by furious Tory MPs in an attempt to \u201crestore faith\u201d in democracy. An overwhelming majority backed the privileges committee\u2019s conclusion that Johnson committed five contempts of parliament, including misleading the Commons and the cross-party group investigating him. Only seven MPs voted against the report, dwarfed by the 354 who voted for it. Rishi Sunak was absent for the debate along with other senior Cabinet ministers, and was accused by Labour MPs of having \u201crun away\u201d. Downing Street said he was busy meeting the Swedish prime minister before being due to attend a dinner in the evening. Despite Sunak\u2019s attempt to dampen the internal Tory row over the report \u2013 by avoiding taking sides in the vote on whether his predecessor lied to MPs \u2013 the Tory bloodletting over the damning privileges committee report into Johnson\u2019s continued misleading of parliament ran late into the evening. Given Johnson quit the Commons last week, the recommended 90-day suspension could not be enforced. Instead, a motion was passed that said he should be blocked from receiving a pass given to most ex-MPs, which allows unfiltered access to the parliamentary estate. Cutting a lonely figure on the government frontbench, Penny Mordaunt, the Commons leader, said there were \u201cmeaningful consequences\u201d to taking action against Johnson. The findings by the privileges committee would protect MPs\u2019 \u201cright not to be misled\u201d or \u201cabused in carrying out our duties\u201d, she stressed. Mordaunt said the \u201cintegrity of our institutions matter\u201d, and also took a swipe at \u201cwider issues, such as the debasement of our honours system\u201d \u2013 in a veiled criticism of the titles and peerages handed out by Johnson and approved by No 10 earlier this month. In a show of strength, Tory grandees lined up to criticise Johnson and endorsed the privileges committee\u2019s report. Theresa May, the former prime minister who Johnson\u2019s supporters helped oust over Brexit in 2019, urged Tory MPs not to let friendship or loyalty to colleagues cloud their judgment. \u201cIt is doubly important for us to show that we are prepared to act when one of our own, however senior, is found wanting,\u201d she told MPs, seemingly in reference to the numerous sleaze scandals that engulfed Johnson\u2019s administration. \u201cFollowing an unsettling period in our political life, support for the report of the privileges committee will be a small but important step in restoring people\u2019s trust in members of this house and of parliament.\u201d Further support for the report against Johnson came from Andrea Leadsom, the former business secretary; the longest-serving male MP, Peter Bottomley; and backbencher Angela Richardson. The extra security that some privileges committee members needed in the face of threats since Johnson stood down was called \u201cdeeply shameful\u201d by Richardson, a Tory MP. She specifically deplored the \u201cattacks\u201d on a Conservative member. \u201cHe is a voluntary magistrate as well as serving his constituents in this place,\u201d she said. \u201cShame, shame, shame on those who are working to undermine him and his future prospects. He is a decent and honourable member, as are all members of the privileges committee.\u201d Johnson\u2019s allies largely declared they would boycott the vote, stating they would not participate in the proceedings adjudicated on by a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. But his critics claimed it was a way to avoid revealing his standing in the parliamentary party had become severely diminished. Government whips had hoped to avoid a formal division by letting the motion pass \u201con the nod\u201d. But several MPs were determined to force a vote, further showing splits in the Conservative party. After the vote, Nadine Dorries said the prime minister did not vote because he \u201cwould have upset\u201d backers of his predecessor. Dorries, who has announced her intention to stand down as an MP, tweeted: \u201cOf course Rishi Sunak didn\u2019t vote, if he did, he would have upset the Tory members and voters who support Boris Johnson \u2013 and more do support Boris than Rishi. \u201cThose people aren\u2019t stupid though and they also have long memories.\u201d Johnson\u2019s backers remained defiant throughout the evening\u2019s debate, continuing to make their feelings known about the report before the house. Jake Berry, the former \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d minister, said the former prime minister \u201ccannot be held responsible for what people thought he may have meant\u201d. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former Cabinet Office minister, suggested there were perceptions of bias in Harriet Harman chairing the privileges committee\u2019s inquiry given she had previously shared critical tweets about Johnson and his conduct. Harman riposted that she had offered to stand down last summer, but had been \u201cassured that I should continue\u201d by the government. The Guardian has been told the assurance came from Johnson\u2019s final chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris. She gave a stark warning about the precedent that would be set if Johnson were allowed to get away with his repeated untruths about all Covid guidance being followed in No 10, and called on MPs to endorse the report to \u201crestore faith in our parliamentary democracy\u201d. Harman said: \u201cBecause he was prime minister, Johnson\u2019s dishonesty \u2013 if left unchecked \u2013 would have contaminated the whole of government, allowing misleading to become commonplace, and thus erode the standards which are essential for the health of our democracy.\u201d Jess Phillips, a Labour frontbencher, accused Sunak of a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d by failing to say how he would vote even if he was unable to attend. \u201cI cannot believe that he couldn\u2019t take five seconds out of parroting his pledges to tell us what he thinks should happen [to Johnson],\u201d she said. As the debate took place, Johnson was giving a speech to the International Democratic Union in which a source said he called the privileges committee \u201cbiased and wilfully ignorant\u201d. The source said he added there was \u201calways another innings\u201d."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c0033199f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jun/19/england-v-north-macedonia-european-championship-qualifying-group-c-live", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England 7-0 North Macedonia: Euro 2024 qualifier \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Minute-by-minute report:</strong> England maintained their perfect record in Euro 2024 qualifying with a dominant win inspired by Bukayo Saka", "author": "Tim de Lisle", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 22:22:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174259", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4d0ccdf95399c0bee7144ad231126f63f6cac4ff/434_280_3024_1815/500.jpg", "body": "It\u2019s not just England who have scored seven tonight. Seven MPs have voted against approving the report on Boris Johnson\u2019s lies about Partygate. That scoreline wasn\u2019t 7-0, though: it was 7-354. Time for me to sign off. Thanks for your company, correspondence and corrections. The English football season of 2022-23 has ended at last \u2013 not with a whimper but a bang. And a hat-trick from a player who had never scored one before. \u201cSo who knew,\u201d asks Bill Jones, \u201cthat all England needed was the Liverpool midfield? Now, if Liverpool could only get their midfield sorted...\u201d \u201cGazball?!\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201c(Sorry).\u201d Bukayo Saka is talking to Channel 4. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy.\u201d Asked which of the three goals was his favourite, he chuckles, says he liked the first, but he has to go for the second. He shares the credit around too. \u201cMe and Rashy, we were really direct\u2026 At half-time, Trent told me he was going to do that pass and he did.\u201d Saka is 21 and he now has 11 goals for England. The pundits are impressed: \u201cI think he\u2019s got another level as well,\u201d says Steven Gerrard. \u201cHe looks as if he\u2019s just having fun with his mates,\u201d adds Jill Scott. Credit to the defence, too. For the second game running, England didn\u2019t let their opponents have a shot. \u201cI am sure,\u201d says James Maslen, \u201cin the postmortem it will be \u2018only North Macedonia\u2019 but this seems very special.\u201d Agreed. North Macedonia are a decent team who had never lost by nearly this many. England have 12 points from four games in their Euro group. They have scored 15 goals and conceded one. In fact, they\u2019ve scored 11 in five days. These are not just numbers: they\u2019re a tribute to the stamina and style and star quality of an admirable squad. And the resilience of a remarkable manager who looked as if he\u2019d had enough only six months ago. The ref decides not to have any added time, which is the best thing to have happened to North Macedonia for an hour or so. A rollicking victory for England: they had so much fun, it was basically Bazball. 90 min A rare touch for Jordan Pickford, from an England throw-in\u2026 87 min A late flurry of chances for England. The best one fell to Foden on the edge of the box from a corner. He hit it well, but a deflection carried it just wide of the post. 83 min England haven\u2019t scored for ten minutes: I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going off out there. 81 min It\u2019s all over bar the emailing. \u201cI think,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cwe\u2019re lucky to be living through an era of incredibly high standards in sport, particularly team sports like cricket and football. The thing about Bazball, and Guardiola\u2019s City side, is that they are not simply philosophies on how the game should be played. Everyone has a philosophy. What makes them different is the rare combination of innovative coaching and tactics, inspirational leadership, individuals with the confidence and skill to deliver on the field without fear of failure, and of course a sprinkling of genius. If only it was that simple all the time.\u201d 78 min Phillips picks up a yellow card for a professional foul. 76 min \u2026 but according to the Sky Sports app, they have had only three clear-cut chances. 76 min England have had nine shots on target and scored with seven of them \u2026 74 min Kane was about to be replaced by Callum Wilson, so if the pen had come a minute later, it would have been Wilson taking it. Kane acknowledges this with a broad smile as he goes off now. High, just wide enough, and handsome. That\u2019s Kane\u2019s 50th goal as England captain. Correction: it was Stones, not Kane himself, who went down at the corner. Kane goes down at a corner and the ref points to the spot. 69 min Another sub for North Macedonia, another member of the Babunski family. David joins his brother Dorian. 68 min Apparently Saka is the youngest man to score an England hat-trick since Theo Walcott. 66 min A nice moment for Phillips, who was in the right place at the right time, in the six-yard box, when the ball came loose after a cross failed to reach Kane. England\u2019s first five goals went to strikers who had had a season to remember; now there\u2019s one for a midfielder who\u2019s had a year to forget, and had never scored for England before. You know you\u2019re in trouble when you let Kalvin Phillips score a goal. 62 min Grealish is making an early impression down the left. North Macedonia made three substitutions, bringing on Serafimov, Atanasov and Dorian Babunski for Zajkov, Ademi and Trajkovski. And there was one at half-time that I missed, sorry \u2013 the captain Ristovski went off to nurse his battered head, and was replaced by Bejtulai. 58 min Off come Rice, Henderson, Rashford and Saka, who will collect one of the match balls later. Southgate is waiting with hugs for them all, and the widest smile for Saka. 57 min Seven subs are coming on. Four are English, and three of those are from the other side of Manchester \u2013 Phillips, Grealish and Foden. The odd man out is Gallagher. It\u2019s a fair cop. 54 min This is the first time Saka, Kane and Rashford have started together, and after taking nearly half an hour to get used to each other, they\u2019ve scored five goals between them in about 25 minutes. Another one! This one is simple, as Kane sends Saka through to the penalty spot and all he has to do is keep cool \u2013 which he does without thinking. 48 min Alexander-Arnold produced a photocopy of the glorious ball to Saka that led to the first goal in Malta. This time Saka didn\u2019t need anyone else. He took one touch, then another, then volleyed the ball into the top corner. Magic. This is a cracker. And so is the assist. 46 min North Macedonia have never lost in England, but they\u2019ll be doing well if that is still the case in 44 minutes. They get the second half under way and keep the ball for about 80 seconds, before a loose cross is cleared by Alexander-Arnold\u2026 Another masterly performance from England, with Henderson and Rashford standing out. Poor old North Macedonia have had a mare of two halves: after conceding three times in the second half against Ukraine, they\u2019ve done it again in the first half here. 45 min There will be three added minutes. For once the ball is in England\u2019s half, where Maguire gets in a tangle and has to be rescued by the whistle. 44 min Kane won the ball back high and released Henderson, who played a simple cross to Rashford. He had just hit a shot straight at the keeper, after a one-two with Maguire of all people, but he made no mistake this time. Game over! 41 min England put a foot wrong at last. Declan Rice, to his dismay, gets a yellow card. He protests politely, saying he won the ball, but he did stand on an instep too. 39 min That move went from Rashford to Kane to Saka, who did a U-turn and played it back to TAA. He slipped the ball wide to Walker, who played it inside to Saka, who had time to hit a right-foot shot high into the net. Lovely stuff. Another one! Classic Saka. 36 min Eljif Elmas, North Macedonia\u2019s star player, has been kept very quiet by Declan Rice. He gets a couple of touches now, but only by dropping so deep that he turns into a fourth centre-back. 33 min Another good move: Henderson to Saka, right across to Rashford. His volleyed cross is too hot for Henderson, who can only let it bounce off him. For such a good all-round footballer, he\u2019s not much of a finisher. 30 min The vision came from Henderson, who spotted Rashford starting a run. And then from Rashford, who waited for Shaw to race past him on the underlap, timing the pass just right. The cross was strong and the finish was excellent, slammed high to the keeper\u2019s left. Kane has now scored in six England matches in a row. The breakthrough! And it\u2019s a fine flowing move \u2013 Henderson to Rashford to Shaw to Kane, who finishes with his left foot. 26 min England win a free kick 40 yards out in the inside-right channel. TAA overhits it but will get another chance as there\u2019s a corner. Maguire gets his head to it, only to nod it wide, and be penalised. \u201cI\u2019m with Graham in Helsinki when it comes to Maguire,\u201d says Julian Menz. \u201cYes he\u2019s been decent enough for England down the years, but Southgate, loyalty aside, should be using matches like these to test replacements for a player who has obvious limitations.\u201d He did give Guehi a start on Friday, and Mings a recall. 25 min Alexander-Arnold gets the ball twice on the right wing, leading you to expect a juicy cross, but he\u2019s now so much of a midfielder that he plays the simple ball to the nearest team-mate. \u201cThe Ashes...bloody hell.\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cBazball isn\u2019t letting anyone down. But let\u2019s not compare Maguire to Broad or Anderson please. We have many options at CB that are playing at the highest level (and just playing is something Maguire isn\u2019t doing). Southgate is pushing it now.\u201d 22 min Yet more possession for England, but it\u2019s all a bit too fiddly and central. Again Rashford is the one threatening to make something happen, wiggling to the byline and getting a cross in. 19 min England are keeping the ball with ease \u2013 66pc possession so far. Rashford dances into the box and gets a cross in, but the keeper swallows it. 16 min England\u2019s turn to counter with some fizzing passes from TAA and Rashford. A cross from Henderson finds the head of Kane, but he goes down after a clash of heads with his opposite number, Ristovski, who goes off to get a bandage. 15 min Rashford goes over to see Saka but can\u2019t quite pull off an ambitious one-two. North Macedonia break down the right and Henderson dives in with a foul, cynical but effective. 11 min An email comes in from Leighton Taylor. \u201cWhile there\u2019s a lot to disagree with Graham who seems upset that the England manager has picked what he considers to be his strongest team for an important game, the main one is that he suggests there\u2019s a player out there who is hungrier than Luke Shaw! Everyone knows that legend loves a pudding more than any young upstart.\u201d 10 min Shaw swings it in, Stones gets the header \u2013 but it\u2019s a loopy one and he didn\u2019t know that Maguire was in a better position, a yard behind him. 9 min Henderson, pressing like a maniac, wins a corner on the left. 7 min Some classy touches from TAA. If you hadn\u2019t seen England play before, you would assume he was a senior player. 5 min Rashford sees that dash to the byline and makes one himself, after some neat passes by Kane and Henderson, but he too is closed down. The wingers are on it. 4 min Something similar up the other end, as Ashkovski breaks up the right wing. He reaches the byline but Maguire closes him down. 2 min A neat turn takes Saka into the area, where he has room to get a shot in \u2013 easily saved by Dimitrievski. This is the first time Saka and Rashford have started together for England. 1 min Alexander-Arnold gets the ball rolling. John Stones goes long, much like City in the opening seconds of the Cup Final, but can\u2019t quite find Kane. The anthems ring out and the players exchange hand-slaps. The England XI, apparently, have 579 caps between them, which means they\u2019re the most experienced team Gareth Southgate has ever sent out. Gareth Southgate is talking to Channel 4. The first question is whether TAA is now undroppable. Gareth responds with a hesitation that speaks volumes (about the question). Finally he says, \u201cWe felt this was the best team to win the game, and he was outstanding in that game [against Malta].\u201d Any concerns over Jack Grealish\u2019s fitness? \u201cNo. We just felt that Marcus [Rashford] has the right attributes. We need strength to come from the bench and the other guys have that depth.\u201d He says North Macedonia have good technical players in midfield and the forward areas and are good at quick counter-attacks. \u201cSo when you\u2019re pressing, which has been a real strength for us in recent games, you have to make sure your decision-making is right.\u201d Last week I went to see Dear England, the new play at the National Theatre about Southgate and how he changed the culture. (It got a standing ovation.) This means I now listen to Southgate talking and think about whether he\u2019s nailed his impression of Joseph Fiennes. A sceptic writes. \u201cI\u2019m just lost,\u201d says Graham in Helsinki, \u201cas to why we still have Maguire, Walker and Shaw playing. Yesterday\u2019s news. We should name younger and hungrier bodies. Even Kane should be dropped and someone like Toney or Watkins picked. Toney just because autocrats shouldn\u2019t pick our team. How dare they ban him while allowing betting shops to advertise.\u201d This raises an important question. What does Graham think about Ben Stokes sticking with Stuart Broad? The football, clearly, can\u2019t compete with the cricket. If you\u2019re on news blackout, please look away now. If not, I can tell you that Australia have finished a fabulous fluctuating day on 107-3, so England are now (whisper it) narrow favourites. Stuart Broad has taken out the top two batters in the world: Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne managed 35 runs in four innings in the match. All the details here with the master of the high-speed verdict, Rob Smyth. Somebody had to mention Macedonia\u2019s most famous name, so I\u2019m handing the baton to Peter Oh. \u201cCould this clash,\u201d he wonders, \u201cbe billed as Alexander the Great versus Alexander-Arnold the Great?\u201d Blagoja Milevski, the North Macedonia manager, makes only one change. Visar Musliu, the defender who was sent off against Ukraine, is replaced by Darko Velkovski. North Macedonia (3-5-2ish) Dimitrievski; Ristovski, Zajkov, Velkovski; Ashkovski, Elmas, Ademi, Bardhi, Alioski; Nestorovski, Trajkovski. Subs: Shiskovski, Iliev, Bejtulai, Serafimov, Atanasov, Manev, David Babunski, Elezi, Dimoski, Doriev, Ristovski, Dorian Babunski. When in Manchester, recall a few Manchester stars. Kyle Walker, John Stones and Marcus Rashford return to the starting line-up in place of Kieran Trippier, Marc Guehi and James Maddison. Trent Alexander-Arnold continues in midfield, as expected \u2013 though you wonder if he and Stones and will tread on each other\u2019s twinkle toes. England (4-3-3-ish) Pickford; Walker, Stones, Maguire, Shaw; Alexander-Arnold, Rice, Henderson; Saka, Kane, Rashford. Subs: Ramsdale, Johnstone, Trippier, Guehi, Mings, Phillips, Gallagher, Foden, Eze, Grealish, Maddison, Wilson. Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends. The 2022-23 English football season has been going on so long, it could be Elton John\u2019s farewell tour. It began with the Charity Shield at Wembley on 30 July, way back when Man City were still capable of losing. It finally comes to an end tonight at Old Trafford, with England\u2019s tenth match of the season \u2013 although if you\u2019re a Scotland fan, or just an admirer of their ability to inflict defeat on Erling Haaland, there\u2019s still tomorrow\u2019s game against Georgia to look forward to. Like Scotland, England have a spotless record in these Euro qualifiers with three wins out of three. Facing North Macedonia at home, they are hot favourites to make it four, but history might say otherwise. North Macedonia, who went 2-0 up against Ukraine last week before conceding three times, have never lost in England. And while they\u2019ve never won either, their two draws \u2013 2-2 in 2002, 0-0 in 2006, both in qualifiers like this one \u2013 probably felt like wins. Will North Macedonia do it again? Or will England enjoy a cruise, as they did in Malta? Will Trent Alexander-Arnold stay in midfield, where he was the star player the other night? Will any of the City contingent come back into the starting XI, after incurring some mild distaste from Gareth Southgate by turning their treble celebrations into a stag weekend? All these questions will be answered from 7.45pm Manchester time (8.45 in Skopje). I\u2019ll be back shortly with the teams."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319a0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/wonders-of-the-world-i-cant-see-review-chris-mccausland-harry-hill", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wonders of the World I Can\u2019t See review \u2013 Chris McCausland makes a rare travel show worth tuning in for ", "lead": "The blind comedian pairs up with comics like Harry Hill to work out if the tourist trail can offer any pleasures to those who can\u2019t see the big attractions \u2013 or the point of going anywhere", "author": "Rebecca Nicholson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 22:05:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174291", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ad9af3e6d121be0b45c416d048f281a7fece5a38/0_71_3050_1830/500.jpg", "body": "It is a rite of passage for any successful TV comedian: pen a hit fringe show, do Live at the Apollo, host Live at the Apollo, and then, if the comedy gods permit, appear in a travelogue with another famous comedian, that\u2019s to say, a holiday you wouldn\u2019t choose to go on but will get paid to joke about. So it is for Chris McCausland, though his travel show isn\u2019t another Travel Man, exactly: he is blind, so his experience of travelling is a little different from most people\u2019s. Wonders of the World I Can\u2019t See pairs him with four celebrity companions to see if they can persuade him that travelling is worth the effort. \u201cWhen it comes to sightseeing, I can\u2019t be arsed,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m blind, so what\u2019s the point?\u201d He starts his odyssey with Harry Hill, who takes him to Athens for a week with the intention of experiencing the Acropolis in all its glory. McCausland admits early on that he likes neither heat nor flying. And having flown to Greece, they find that it\u2019s 40C: McCausland says he\u2019s glad to have Hill, a former doctor, on hand, so it all bodes well. This, says Hill, is his first travelogue with another comedian, which is remarkable given how long he\u2019s been in the business. They quickly fall into an odd-couple routine that relies on McCausland being grumbly and reticent and Hill working out how to get his holidaymate involved without simply explaining what\u2019s in front of them. \u201cWhat is the point of me coming here if you\u2019re just going to describe what it looks like?\u201d asks McCausland, by the Parthenon, and Hill has to admit he has a point. The Acropolis isn\u2019t the high point \u2013 it is heaving, and McCausland feels there is little for him to enjoy \u2013 so the pair opt for more activity-led adventures. These get McCausland involved in a way that doesn\u2019t rely on visual appeal. They visit the Panatheneic stadium and stage a mini-Olympics, with the help of Tanya, an enthusiastic local guide, who encourages them to throw foam javelins and do a standing long jump. They go to an olive oil tasting session, with an olive oil sommelier named Erica, who is amused by their reaction to a strong shot of the stuff. As they splutter and cough (\u201cOh gosh, that\u2019s quite strong, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Hill), she wryly offers them a piece of apple to cut through it. They head off on a fishing boat, which might be their most perilous activity, not because of the practical details of getting on and off, but because of the two taciturn Greek fishermen, who look as if they would rather be anywhere else in the world than sharing their vessel with these two clowns. They eat a very fishy fish soup. They do a pottery class with another expert, Mariana, who patiently guides them through the process of crafting some sort of receptacle on the wheel. Not that Hill needs the help. As well as being a qualified doctor, he has an O-level in pottery, too, which does pile on the pressure somewhat. \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and produce something worse than a blind bloke,\u201d he says, before it all descends into a series of knob gags. At its best, Wonders of the World I Can\u2019t See reveals a more thoughtful sort of holiday, if you can call turning a lump of clay into a small penis more thoughtful. As McCausland can\u2019t see the big tourist attractions, it forces Hill and the programme-makers to come up with a different sort of trip, one that\u2019s busier and more active, but that still feels specific to each place. They end up with a local theatre group, who explain that the ancient Greeks invented theatre, and invite Hill and McCausland to fill in the gaps of an ad-hoc performance of Sophocles\u2019 Antigone. McCausland, ever the curmudgeon for hire, says he\u2019s not really a theatre or a classics person, and doesn\u2019t really like reading anything old. Still, it\u2019s one of the funniest moments of the episode \u2013 along with the pottery class \u2013 because it feels as if they really let loose. It ends with a heart to heart, and though both men resist sentimentality, it is a rare case of the \u201cwhat we learned\u201d section of a travel show being worth sticking around for. It\u2019s been a learning curve for both of them, and while it\u2019s mostly all about the entertainment, there is a gentle nudge to viewers to think outside the box, too."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319a1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/gareth-southgate-praises-elite-saka-after-hat-trick-sinks-north-macedonia", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gareth Southgate praises \u2018elite\u2019 Saka after hat-trick sinks North Macedonia", "lead": "Gareth Southgae praised \u201celite\u201d Bukayo Saka after he scored a hat-trick despite suffering from a sore achilles as England beat North Macedonia 7-0 to make it a maximum 12 points from the opening four games of their Euro 2024 qualification campaign", "author": "Jamie Jackson at Old Trafford", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 22:02:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174319", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dae5c15ee88763cd925ecb71da7265fd560ce032/0_11_1603_962/500.jpg", "body": "Gareth Southgate praised Bukayo Saka as an \u201celite\u201d player after he scored the first hat-trick of his senior career despite a sore achilles.

Saka, at 21, became the youngest England men\u2019s player to score three since Theo Walcott, who was 19 when doing so against Croatia in 2008. The Group C victory was the highest home win since England\u2019s defeat of Montenegro by the same score in November 2019. \u201cI am delighted for him,\u201d Southgate said of the Arsenal forward. \u201cHe\u2019s had a slightly sore achilles \u2013 for a few weeks \u2013 and it\u2019s another one where it would have been easy to pull out of the camp and miss out on a night like this that I\u2019m sure will live with him forever. When you have one of the best nights of your life it\u2019s a reminder to everyone to go through these things.\u201d Saka, who now has 11 England goals, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, I\u2019m just so happy. Me and Rashy [Marcus Rashford], were really direct. At half-time Trent [Alexander\u2011Arnold] told me he was going to make that pass and he did.\u201d While the 40-yard ball from the Liverpool player, operating in midfield, created Saka\u2019s second, Harry Kane registered twice with Rashford and Kalvin Phillips completing the scoring, the latter\u2019s a first international goal. Southgate was asked if Saka can become an elite player. \u201cI think he is already there,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cHe broke into a team [Arsenal] having a difficult time and performing at a high level, then when the team was playing well he\u2019s still performing. That says everything. He\u2019s exceptional to work with. \u201cFor [all of] the players to have the mentality they have to work, at the late stage of this monster of all seasons, there was every excuse to do that and they\u2019ve not done that.\u201d Southgate was particularly pleased with the attitudes of Kyle Walker, John Stones, Phillips, Jack Grealish, who joined the camp as members of Manchester City\u2019s Champions League-winning squad. \u201cThey didn\u2019t come as big shots, they got into the group and mucked in and performed,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319a2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/19/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-keir-starmer-privileges-committee-report-tories-labour-uk-politics-live", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs vote to approve Boris Johnson Partygate report \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Former prime minister censured in his absence, with 354 MPs voting to approve and just seven voting against", "author": "Tom Ambrose (now) and Andrew Sparrow (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 21:46:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174347", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/200651cb53f8f48e318cb2ba26fead9af34b2601/0_23_2042_1225/500.jpg", "body": "Here is a round-up of the main events from a busy evening in Westminster: The House of Commons has voted to accept the privileges committee report on the conduct of former prime minister Boris Johnson during Partygate. It was a resounding result, with 354 MPs voting to approve, while just seven voted against. Johnson\u2019s allies boycotted a vote on the privileges committee\u2019s report, in a move that was widely seen as a tactic to avoid showing how weak support for him in the Conservative parliamentary party has become. An overwhelming majority backed the privileges committee\u2019s conclusion that Johnson committed five contempts of parliament, including misleading both the Commons and the cross-party group investigating him. Boris Johnson faces being blocked from getting a pass allowing him unlimited access to the House of Commons, after MPs backed the punishment for his five contempts of parliament. The former prime minister was censured in his absence, given that he formally quit as an MP last week, for misleading parliament over Partygate and his conduct towards the privileges committee. Chris Bryant, the Labour chair of the Commons standards committee (and chair of the privileges committee until he stood aside for this inquiry, because of his previous comments about Boris Johnson), said people made sacrifices during the pandemic because they felt we were all in this together. That is why they feel so strongly about this, he said. He defended the committee\u2019s conclusion that Johnson would have deserved a 90-day suspension if he were still an MP. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was recently knighted in Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial resignation honours list, said the fixed-penalty notice Boris Johnson received for attending the birthday gathering was not a \u201cconviction\u201d or \u201cadmission of guilt\u201d. The report \u201cdecides to impute a stain on his character\u201d, Rees-Mogg continued. He added that the report \u201cdecides as if it were an Elon Musk particle to insert itself in the brain of Mr Johnson to work out what he must have thought in a particular moment\u201d. Labour\u2019s Karl Turner commended the privileges committee for compiling the report. He said that anybody who reads the report \u201cwould have to conclude the reality that Boris Johnson was a liar\u201d. Turner said: \u201cVery often you would be surprised that he could get away with the things he was saying but it\u2019s proven now that he was dishonest.\u201d Sir Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has given a strong hint that the Met will take action against Tories involved in the lockdown party organised by Shaun Bailey\u2019s mayoral campaign team. In an interview with the News Agents podcast, asked about the video of the event leaked to the Mirror at the weekend, Rowley said: \u201cWe\u2019re not routinely opening every minor historic allegation. So, if you phoned up about your neighbour from three years ago, we\u2019re not going to reopen that. But clearly cases that are particularly serious, particularly concerning, we will do.\u201d Suella Braverman has called on police to increase the use of stop and search powers \u201cto prevent violence and save more lives\u201d. In a statement aimed at all 43 forces in England and Wales, the home secretary said officers who used the powers had her \u201cfull support\u201d. Her comments are likely to alarm critics of stop and search who point out that the technique disproportionately targets black and minority ethnic communities. David Cameron has admitted failures in his government\u2019s preparations for a pandemic but defended the austerity drive that he and his chancellor, George Osborne, imposed, saying \u201cyour health system is only as strong as your economy\u201d. The former prime minister repeatedly told the Covid inquiry it was a mistake that \u201cmore time and more questions\u201d were not focused on tackling what turned out to be a \u201chighly infectious, asymptomatic\u201d pandemic. Liz Truss has described the newspaper stunt in which her tenure as prime minister was measured against the shelf life of a lettuce as \u201cpuerile\u201d. Speaking at a broadcasting conference in Dublin, Truss also complained that the media did not properly understand her economic ideas. She said too much political coverage was \u201cfroth\u201d, while at the same time praising the overall irreverence of the UK. Downing Street has defended Rishi Sunak after a video emerged of the prime minister seemingly making a joke that mocked transgender people, saying the comments were simply aimed at a political opponent. The footage of Sunak addressing fellow Conservative MPs, leaked to PinkNews, shows him making fun of Ed Davey after the Liberal Democrat leader said it was possible for a woman to have a penis, which can happen under the government\u2019s own gender recognition laws. Clean energy companies would be offered up to \u00a3500m a year to set up manufacturing in the UK, to build the wind turbines, solar panels and other infrastructure needed to reach net zero, under plans set out by Labour. But Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, on Monday also gave assurances to the oil and gas industry that production would continue in the North Sea \u201cfor decades to come\u201d, to the consternation of green campaigners. Under plans for a \u201cBritish jobs bonus\u201d, Labour would allocate \u00a3500m a year for each of the first five years of government, to provide capital grants to companies in low-carbon industries, including wind and solar energy, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. That\u2019s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog for tonight. Thanks for following along. The division list showed 118 Conservative MPs voted in favour of the report, while 225 MPs abstained. The Conservative MPs who opposed the privileges committee report were: Sir Bill Cash; Nick Fletcher; Adam Holloway; Karl McCartney; Joy Morrissey; and Heather Wheeler. The division list released immediately after the vote contained six names in the noes rather than seven announced in the chamber. There have been ongoing issues with names being recorded on the division lists, with other votes seeing the Commons authorities issuing updates later on. The ayes list released immediately after the vote contained 352 names rather than the 354 announced in the chamber, but again this could be updated later by the Commons authorities. Andrew Dudfield, the interim chief executive at Full Fact, has responded to tonight\u2019s vote, saying MPs \u201cagree that there should be consequences for misleading parliament\u201d. \u201cBeing able to trust you\u2019re being told the truth, as the committee noted, \u2018goes to the very heart of our democracy\u2019,\u201d he added. But so far this year, only five of the 30 MPs Full Fact has asked to correct themselves have actually done so. \u201cParliament\u2019s corrections process is broken. The public deserves better than a system that acts as if accuracy and honesty are optional.\u201d \u201cMPs must agree new rules to make it easy to correct mistakes officially on the record, and ensure there are consequences for those who do not.\u201d Boris Johnson faces being blocked from getting a pass allowing him unlimited access to the House of Commons, after MPs backed the punishment for his five contempt of parliament offences. The former prime minister was censured in his absence, given that he formally quit as an MP last week, for misleading parliament over Partygate and his conduct towards the privileges committee. Though decisions about blocking ex-MPs from receiving a pass granting special access to the parliamentary estate are for the Commons authorities, the move was recommended by the Commons\u2019 privileges committee and endorsed by MPs on Monday. Johnson\u2019s allies boycotted a vote on the privileges committee\u2019s report, in a move that was widely seen as a tactic to avoid showing how weak support for him in the Conservative party has become. The House of Commons has voted to accept the privileges committee report on the conduct of former prime minister Boris Johnson during Partygate. It was a resounding result, with 354 MPs voting to approve, while just seven voted against. The debate has come to an end and MPs are now voting on whether or not to approve the privileges committee report. It wasn\u2019t certain to have gone to a vote but the results will be due shortly. Stay tuned. Labour MP Jess Phillips says Boris Johnson is either lying or thick when it comes to claiming not to understand the rules. She says: The idea that Boris Johnson didn\u2019t understand the regulations \u2026 I mean, it is a cracking defence on his part I have to say, because it basically means he is too stupid. He is either lying or he is thick. The Birmingham Yardley MP added that the committee report reassured her there was \u201ca lock on the system\u201d, also describing it as \u201ca valve to release the pressure\u201d. She told MPs: What I have seen for the past five years of people lying and deceiving, specifically Boris Johnson lying and deceiving, I felt like oh gosh, it is OK, the system is bigger than this demagogue, it is bigger than this man who thinks he is bigger than the world. A Conservative MP claimed he was \u201cso over Boris\u201d as MPs debated the report setting out how the ex-PM misled parliament. Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely told the Commons he would vote for the report, but also said: \u201cI am so over Boris, and I am pretty over lockdown as well. I think sometimes, and really the point I want to make tonight is that we are in danger of making Westminster look small and petty.\u201d While he described politicians telling the truth as \u201ca keystone to this place\u201d, he added: The scandal of lockdown, or Covid and how we dealt with it, is not only whether there were \u2018wine Fridays\u2019 and cake in Downing Street, and people in protest carrying about pints of milk, but actually whether lockdown worked, the cost of lockdown in terms of lives, in terms of learning, in terms of sanity, in terms of money, and in terms of truth. The Conservative MP Nick Fletcher has told MPs he will vote against the motion, urging members to remember Johnson is \u201chuman\u201d and that during Covid, he \u201cnearly died\u201d. The MP for Don Valley told the Commons: \u201cWe must also remember he is a human, too. In addition to running the country, he dealt with the highs and lows that this life brings. During Covid, he nearly died. He got married. He lost his mum and had a child.\u201d Meanwhile, Conservative MP for Guildford Angela Richardson said: \u201cI deplore the attacks on members of the privileges committee. Whether they come from external commentators or within this House. \u201cThe work of the committee is thankless, there is no need to make it potentially dangerous, too. The additional security that was needed is deeply shameful.\u201d She told MPs that Harriet Harman, the Labour chair of the committee, is \u201can exceptional parliamentarian\u201d. An ally of Boris Johnson said he would abstain from a potential vote on the privileges committee report because the high number of MPs staying away has \u201cmade a bit of a farce of it\u201d. Brendan Clarke-Smith, the Bassetlaw MP who had previously said he would vote against it, told Channel 4 News: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be voting one way or the other. I\u2019m against the report and its recommendations. \u201cIt\u2019s not really right. The number of people that are in here, it\u2019s kind of made a bit of a farce of it, I think to be honest. \u201cIf we had a full house here and everybody was here to vote, I think you\u2019d get a more realistic picture, but you\u2019re not going to get that today. So really, I think I wouldn\u2019t want to legitimise that vote today.\u201d He denied that support for Mr Johnson was so low that the former prime minister\u2019s allies were abstaining to spare him embarrassment. \u201cI think if you actually did have a vote and I think if people were actually on the estate, I think the numbers would actually be quite decent and quite split.\u201d MPs should \u201cback a properly constituted committee\u201d by voting in favour of the report, the former Tory cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom has said. She told Channel 4 News: \u201cIn my view, as a former leader of the Commons but also a real believer in the importance of parliamentary sovereignty, we have to back a properly constituted committee. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not right to simply say: \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like its findings so I\u2019m just going to bring into question its legitimacy\u2019.\u201d She also said she hoped enough MPs would support it so it would not need to come to a vote. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that this will go through on the nod rather than having a division. I want all members to accept the validity of that committee\u2019s findings.\u201d Tory MP Sir Bill Cash accuses the privileges committee of lowering the bar for reprimanding ministers. He says Johnson had to be proven to have been \u201cknowingly misleading\u201d the parliament, not just misleading it. Cash also says lawyers ought to be allowed to represent MPs accused of wrongdoing by fellow MPs. Actor Sir Ian McKellen was present in the Commons for the debate on the Privileges Committee report. McKellen watched the proceedings from the MPs\u2019 guests gallery, occasionally using a pair of opera glasses. However, he declined to comment on leaving the house. Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine says that it is a time to \u201crecognise the significance of supporting this report\u201d. She says Johnson showed contempt for the public and undermined trust. \u201cOur constituents will be looking to us as to how we have stood up for them and protested the way they were let down by the incumbent of No 10,\u201d she says. The honour of this house and this democracy is at stake and we cannot risk it. Labour\u2019s Karl Turner commends the privileges committee for the job done compiling the report. He says that anybody who reads the report \u201cwould have to conclude the reality that Boris Johnson was a liar\u201d. Turner says: Very often you would be surprised that he could get away with the things he was saying but it\u2019s proven now that he was dishonest. He goes on to question why Johnson received taxpayers\u2019 money to fund his legal aid. The former prime minister should \u201cpay up himself\u201d, he says. Turner also raises the issue of honours being handed to \u201cpeople who were boozing it up in central Tory office\u201d. He adds that Rishi Sunak should be \u201cashamed of himself\u201d for not attending the debate. Here comes Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con), who was recently knighted in Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial resignation honours list. He says the fixed-penalty notice Boris Johnson received for attending the birthday gathering was not a \u201cconviction\u201d or \u201cadmission of guilt\u201d. The report \u201cdecides to impute a stain on his character\u201d, Rees-Mogg continues. He adds that the report \u201cdecides as if it were an Elon Musk particle to insert itself in the brain of Mr Johnson to work out what he must have thought in a particular moment\u201d. He infers that the committee \u201cwanted to come to a particular conclusion\u201d about the former prime minister. He says: They go from the vindictive to the ridiculous in not allowing him a parliamentary pass. Rees-Mogg goes on to question the 90-day sanction that Johnson would have received had he not resigned his seat last week. He compares the privileges committee to \u201ccommunist China\u201d\u2026 Dame Margaret Hodge (Lab) is now speaking. She says trust in Westminster \u201ccan only exist if we tell the truth\u201d. She goes on to say that the committee\u2019s conclusions are based entirely on incontrovertible evidence and says it is \u201cshameful\u201d to try to de-legitimatise the report\u2019s findings. Hodge says that reported attempts to \u201cbully or blackmail\u201d are shocking and that the integrity of parliament must come before all else. She says: Boris Johnson allowed this creeping culture of corruption and unchecked executive power to infect our democracy. John Baron (Con) says he will vote to approve the privileges committee\u2019s report if there is a vote. But he hopes there won\u2019t be one, he says. He says the Commons normally approves these reports without a vote. Ministers can only be held to account if they tell the truth at the dispatch box, he says. He says if MPs are saying the Commons cannot regulate itself, they are in effect calling for an outsider to do that job. That should be worrying, he says. Today parliament is putting right a wrong, he says. That is why this is a good day for parliament. That is all from me for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose is taking over now. Bryant is now defending the privileges committee. He says the standards committee (whose MP members are mostly the same as the privileges committee\u2019s) concluded Boris Johnson had not broken rules about the registration of a holiday, even though the parliamentary commissioner for standards claimed he had. And he says Sir Ernest Ryder, the legal adviser to the privileges committee, would not have allowed it to operate an unfair system. Ryder used to run the tribunals service, he says. Chris Bryant, the Labour chair of the Commons standards committee (and chair of the privileges committee until he stood aside for this inquiry, because of his previous comments about Boris Johnson), says people made sacrifices during the pandemic because they felt we were all in this together. That is why they feel so strongly about this, he says. He defends the committee\u2019s conclusion that Johnson would have deserved a 90-day suspension if he were still an MP. He says the closest precedent he could find was Sir Michael Grylls, a Tory involved in the cash for questions scandal in the 1990s. He says Grylls had stood down by the time the parliamentary inquiry into him was over. But the committee said that, if he were still an MP, he should be suspended for a substantial period, \u201caugmented to take account of his deceit\u201d. Sir Jake Berry, a former Tory chair and another supporter, intervenes on Lia Nici. He says Boris Johnson is being criticised for how people interpreted the assurances he gave to MPs, not for what he actually said. Nici agrees. She says the report was not written in an impartial way. She says there is no evidence in the report saying people told Johnson about parties taking place in the building. Johnson is not the caretaker of the building, she says. It was not his job to go around the building seeing what people were doing. She says No 10 is full of police officers. If rules were being broken, that would have been reported to him, she says. Jess Phillips (Lab) asks Nici if she has considered that Johnson might have lied to her. MPs laugh at that. Nici says she does not think that is the case. She is a good judge of character, she claims. She says the opposition to Johnson is being led by people who want \u201ca formidable opponent out of their way\u201d. In the Commons Lia Nici (Con) is speaking now. She is the first MP to defend Boris Johnson. She says she has read the whole report, and cannot see any evidence that Johnson misled MPs, recklessly or deliberately. She also says she used to be Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary. An SNP MP intervenes to gell Nici \u201cthere is none so blind as those who will not see\u201d. Nici says, when Johnson told MPs the rules were followed, he was repeating the advice he had been given. She says many of the people who gave that advice are still working in Westminster, but that we do not know how those people are because they are not well known. Dame Angela Eagle (Lab) is speaking now. She says the privileges committee discharged its duties with honour. MPs should support them. But \u201cthe Boris Johnson-worshipping print and TV media\u201d has traduced them, egged on by Johnson himself, she says. She says MPs who have condemned the committee as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d have committed a contempt of parliament. A reader asks: Can you give us an estimate of how full the chamber is? A colleague who has been watching from the press gallery (I\u2019m watching on TV) says the Labour benches are fairly full. There are fewer Tory MPs in the chamber (several dozen?), but still more than you might expect for business on a one-line whip. Dame Andrea Leadsom, the Tory former leader of the Commons, says she will be supporting the motion tonight. She urges all MPs to approve the motion without a division. Harman ended her speech by playing to tribute to the role of the media in this affair, and particulary to the work done by Pippa Crerar, the former Daily Mirror political editor who is now political editor at the Guardian, and ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. They were responsible for the most important Partygate revelations. Harriet Harman, the former Labour leader who chaired the privilges committee as it carried out the Boris Johnson inquiry, is speaking now. She says an inquiry by the privileges committee is the only means available to the Commons to protect itself against a minister who is not being honest. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Johnson supporter, asks Harman about the perception that the tweets she posted relating to Partygate undermined her inquiry. Harman says she will address that. She says she was appointed by the house as a whole, with the support of the government. After the reports came out (in the Daily Telegraph) highlighting tweets which suggested that Harman was sympathetic to the view that Johnson had lied over Partygate, she says she took action. After the tweets were brought to light, they were highlighted, because I am concerned about the perception of fairness of the committee and I agree that perception matters, I made it my business to find out whether or not it would mean that the government would not have confidence in me if I continued to chair the committee. I actually said I am more than happy to step aside because perception matters and I don\u2019t want to do this if the government doesn\u2019t have confidence in me, because I need the whole house of have confidence in the work that the committee has mandated. I was assured that I should continue the work that the house had mandated with the appointment that the house had put me into and so I did just that. This is the first time Harman has said that. In the chamber it served as a solid put-down. May says the public want to see MPs \u201ccoming to a conclusion\u201d. That seems to be a dig at Rishi Sunak, and all those other Tory MPs are are avoiding taking a position on the committee\u2019s report If they see MPs trying to defend the careers of friends clearly guilty of wrongdoing, their respect for politicians is damaged. MPs are leaders in their communities, she says. With that comes responsibility, she says. She says they all know that in political debate there is \u201cexaggeration, careful use of facts and sometimes misrepresentation\u201d. But when something is said that is wrong, MPs are under a duty not to repeat it, she says. May also says it is important for parliament to punish MPs who break the rules. In a reference to Boris Johnson\u2019s Vote Leave slogan, she says you could call that showing \u201cthe sovereignty of parliament\u201d. Back in the Commons, Theresa May, the former PM, is speaking. She says the report is a rigorous one and she accepts it. She wants to make a wider point, she says. It is not easy to judge colleagues. As PM, she had to take decisions based on the conduct of friends and colleagues. Friendship, working together, should not get in the way of doing what is right. She commends the privileges committee for their work, and for their dignity in the face of slurs. She particularly thanks Harriet Harman for chairing the committee. She says the committee\u2019s work matters because it strikes at the heart of the bond of trust that needs to exist between politicians and the public. Sir Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has given a strong hint that the Met will take action against Tories involved in the lockdown party organised by Shaun Bailey\u2019s mayoral campaign team. In an interview with the News Agents podcast, asked about the video of the event leaked to the Mirror at the weekend, Rowley said: We\u2019re not routinely opening every minor historic allegation. So, if you phoned up about your neighbour from three years ago, we\u2019re not going to reopen that. But clearly cases that are particularly serious, particularly concerning, we will do. As people know, that case has been previously looked at based on a photo. It\u2019s very obvious a video tells a much richer, clearer story than a photo. And so, the team are looking at that with a view to whether that provides a basis for further investigation \u2026 I think we can all see the colourful nature of the video and how much it tells a story way beyond the original photo. I need to let a team work through that but I think we can all guess which way it will go. The Met did not take action about this event when it originally investigated Partygate. Penny Mordaunt is alone on the front bench, the Critic\u2019s Robert Hutton points out. Brock says paragraph 210 of the report is scathing. This is what it says. We have concluded above that in deliberately misleading the House Mr Johnson committed a serious contempt. The contempt was all the more serious because it was committed by the Prime Minister, the most senior member of the government. There is no precedent for a Prime Minister having been found to have deliberately misled the House. He misled the House on an issue of the greatest importance to the House and to the public, and did so repeatedly. He declined our invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the House was truthful. His defence to the allegation that he misled was an ex post facto justification and no more than an artifice. He misled the Committee in the presentation of his evidence Deidre Brock, the SNP spokesperson on Commons matters, says Ian Blackford, the former SNP leader at Westminster, once got thrown out of the Commons for calling Boris Johnson a liar. But at the same time \u201cthe liar himself was protected by procedure\u201d. Sir Peter Bottomley (Con), father of the house, is speaking now. He says Boris Johnson did many good things. He says he personally once got the words \u201cI made a mistake, I apologise\u201d into Hansard after something he did in the 1980s. He suggests Johnson should have done the same. Debbonaire accuses Rishi Sunak of refusing to defend the privileges committee system. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, intervenes, and disputes this. She says Sunak is on the record as defending the committee. (That is sort of true. See 8.47am.) Mordaunt also says Sunak has called out those MPs who have overstepped the mark by attacking the committee. Back in the Commons Bob Seely, the Conservative MP, intervenes on Debbonaire. He says he will vote for the motion. He says his party \u201cgot rid of Boris Johnson a year ago because we lost faith in him because he was probably not telling the truth\u201d. But, Seely says, he is also an Iraq veteran. Addressing Labour, he says Tony Blair \u201clied and lied and lied and you lot covered up for him\u201d. In reply, Debbonaire says only last week Rishi Sunak was too weak to stand up to Johnson over his honours list. Several readers have asked about MPs using the word \u201clie\u201d in the Commons today. This is from one of them. Why can they say \u201clied\u201d in the HOC today? I thought it was a taboo word. The main answer is because Boris Johnson is no longer an MP. It is also the case that, in certain circumstances, when MPs are debating a motion specifically about an MP or minister lying, the speaker will allow the word \u201cliar\u201d to be used. If Johnson were still an MP today, the speaker may have allowed the term on those grounds. Debbonaire says Johnson claimed the rules in No 10 were followed at all time. But the committee compared this against what happened, and what Johnson knew about what had happened. Johnson lied, she says. Debbonaire says there has been a \u201csustained, seemingly coordinated, attempt\u201d to undermine the work of the committee. She goes on: At no point that I can see did Johnson denounce this campaign. Debbonaire says Johnson claims the public don\u2019t care about this. But the public do care, she says. She says a Constitution Unit report found that being honest was the quality people want most from politicians. The privileges committee\u2019s inquiry was fair, she says. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, is speaking now. She says MPs who continue to defend Boris Johnson should think of the people who lost lives during the pandemic. By continuing to insist that birthdays and \u201cmorale-boosting parties\u201d were essential work events, those MPs are hurting relatives, she says. She says birthdays happen every year \u2013 it is Johnson\u2019s today, she points out \u2013 but funerals cannot. She says any MP defending Johnson should consider what they would say to relatives who lost loved ones. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, says the privileges committee found Boris Johnson \u201clied\u201d. She asks if Mordaunt agrees that there should be a law obliging politicians to respect the truth. Mordaunt says the committee report has wider implications. It has asserted the right of MPs not to be misled. She thanks the committee for its work. This matters \u201cbecause the integrity of our institution matters\u201d, she says. She urges MPs to \u201cdo what they think is right\u201d, and says others should leave them alone to do so. Toby Perkins (Lab) intervenes to say, given the amount of work done by the committee, examining the evidence, people who have not done that work should not criticise it. Mordaunt says MPs should be grateful for the work of the committee. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, asks if Mordaunt will vote for her own motion, approving the report. Mordaunt confirms that, as the member for Portsmouth North (ie, as an individual, not in a government capacity), she will vote for it. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, is opening the debate. She says MPs have an obligation to defend the rights of parliament. She says the motion being debated today is amendable. But no amendments have been tabled. The committee found that Boris Johnson misled the Commons, and the committee, and that this amounted to contempt of parliament. It also found that \u201cbreached confidence, undermined the democratic process of this house and was complicit in a campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee\u201d, she says. MPs are now about to debate the privileges committee report on Boris Johnson. But before they start David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, raises a point of order. He mentions last week\u2019s Telegraph story saying Johnson\u2019s allies are threatening to try to deselect MPs who vote in favour of the report criticising Johnson. Davis says this threat is a contempt of parliament. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, acknowledges the point, and says the privileges committee is doing a further report addressing this. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has called on police to increase the use of stop and search powers \u201cto prevent violence and save more lives\u201d. Matthew Weaver has the story here. In a statement on this in the Commons, Braverman said a few minutes ago: It would be a tragic mistake to conclude that stop and search is too controversial to use extensively or that it cannot be used effectively with sensible safeguards. Suggestions that it is a means of victimising young black men have it precisely the wrong way around. The facts are that young black men are disproportionately more likely to be victims of violent crimes. They are the ones most in need of protection. This is about saving the lives of young black men \u2026 It\u2019s always bad policy to place unsubstantiated theories ahead of demonstrable fact. In this case, it would be lethal \u2026 I\u2019m struck by how often mothers of murdered young black men say that stop and search could have saved their sons\u2019 lives. We owe it to them to heed their call. The facts are on their side. Stop and search works and is a vital tool in the fight against serious violent crime. It\u2019s quite a day for former PMs. We have already heard from Liz Truss and David Cameron, Boris Johnson is about to be the first PM in history subject to a Commons debate in effect confirming he is a liar, and now my colleague Aubrey Allegretti says we may be hearing from Theresa May might be speaking in the debate. May reportedly thought Johnson was morally unfit to be PM when he replaced her in 2019. If she does speak, it may be along the lines of \u201cI told you so\u201d. A reader points out that there is a page on the government\u2019s website with details of the forfeiture process that allows honours to be taken away. It includes details of the kinds of behaviour that can lead to an honour being revoked (serious criminal offences predominantly) and information about how members of the public can propose the forfeiture of an honour. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM\u2019s spokesperson told journalists that it was up to the forfeiture committee to decide if people should lose an honour, when asked about the Tories who attended the party held by Shaun Bailey\u2019s mayoral campaign team. (See 1.19pm.) The spokesperson said: It is for the forfeiture committee to consider cases when put to it if there are claims about bringing the honour system into disrepute. It\u2019s not an investigatory body and it does not decide on whether people have committed specific acts, but it reflects on the findings of investigations or makes recommendations about whether the system has been brought into disrepute. It is for their committee to look at, if they wish to. Here is the text of Keir Starmer\u2019s speech in Edinburgh on Labour\u2019s clean energy policy. And here is the 18-page clean energy superpower mission document. The Scottish Conservatives claim the Labour proposal to stop issuing further oil and gas licences would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the north-east of Scotland. Liam Kerr MSP, the party\u2019s spokesperson for net zero, energy and transport, said: There was a reason Keir Starmer delivered this speech in Edinburgh, rather than Aberdeen \u2013 because this is an economically and environmentally illiterate policy that betrays north-east Scotland. Despite his desperate attempts at re-spinning it in recent days, the Labour leader is sticking stubbornly to his disastrously received and catastrophic position of banning all new oil and gas projects. That would cost tens of thousands of skilled jobs and destroy communities across the north-east. That\u2019s madness when we know that renewable sources don\u2019t yet cover our energy needs \u2013 because it would lead to costly foreign imports of fossil fuels, increasing our carbon footprint. Kerr also claimed the policy would \u201cgive Russia even more influence over UK and European energy markets\u201d. The TUC has said that David Cameron\u2019s evidence to the Covid inquiry (see 2.29pm) shows he is \u201cin denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies\u201d. In a statement, Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said: David Cameron is in denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies \u2013 both to public services and the UK economy. The evidence is clear that the cuts he imposed massively damaged the readiness and resilience of our public services. And they shredded our social security safety net \u2013 leaving millions vulnerable. We must learn the lesson that cuts have costs. And we must strengthen our public services and safety net so that we are never left exposed in the same way again. Here is a summary of the main points from David Cameron\u2019s evidence to the Covid inquiry this morning. Cameron defended his government\u2019s austerity policies, saying resilience required economic strength. He explained: Our whole economic strategy was about safeguarding and strengthening the economy and the nation\u2019s finances so we could cope with whatever crisis hit us next. And I think that\u2019s incredibly important because there\u2019s no resilience without economic resilience, without financial resilience, without fiscal resilience. He rejected claims austerity left the NHS unable to provide an adequate service. (See 12.09am.) He would not accept the conclusions of an expert report given to the committee saying health inequalities got worse while he was in power. Asked about the report by Prof Clare Bambra and Prof Sir Michael Marmot, he replied: [Marmot and Bambra\u2019s] conclusion is to look a lot at austerity, and what have you. I\u2019m not sure the figures back that out. We had some very difficult winters with very bad flu pandemics; I think that had an effect. We had the effect that the improvements in cardiovascular disease, the big benefits that already come through before that period, and that was tailing off. And then you\u2019ve got the evidence from other countries. I mean, Greece and Spain had far more austerity, brutal cuts, and yet their life expectancy went up. So I don\u2019t think it follows \u2026 They have got lots of important evidence and I have looked at it very carefully and will think about it very carefully, but I did find that they had leaped to a certain set of conclusions quite quickly, not all of which was backed up by the evidence. Cameron said that, when he was PM, the government did not plan enough for the risk of a non-flu pandemic. (See 11.43am.) He said more time should have been spent assessing the risk of a pandemic with asymptomatic transmission. \u201cWhen you think what would be different if more time had been spent on a highly infectious, asymptomatic pandemic, different recommendations would have been made about what was necessary to prepare for that,\u201d he said. Oliver Letwin, who as Cabinet Office minister in Cameron\u2019s government was responsible for resilience, now thinks he should have spent more time on pandemic planning, the inquiry heard. During his evidence, Cameron was asked about the witness statement from Letwin, who said that he had been told by officials that he did not need to look at pandemic influenza planning because the UK was already well prepared for it. In the statement Lewtwin went on: I now believe, however, that it might have been helpful if I had delved into the pandemic influenza risks myself \u2026 This is not because I believe such a review would have been likely to lead to any significant improvements in our preparedness for a pandemic flu itself, but rather because it might have led me to question whether we were adequately prepared to deal with the risks of forms of respiratory disease other than pandemic influenza. Cameron said there was a failure to learn from Exercise Alice, a \u201ctabletop exercise\u201d was conducted in 2016 to identify any potential threats from Mers [Middle East respiratory syndrome] coronavirus. He said: Having read through Alice \u2013 because ministers weren\u2019t involved \u2013 there\u2019s a sentence in Alice which is \u2018access to sufficient levels of PPE was also considered and pandemic stockpiles were suggested\u2019. That\u2019s a sentence in Alice, but it doesn\u2019t make it into the recommendations. So if you\u2019re asking: \u2018Does it look like there were failures to follow through from this?\u2019 I think the answer to that is yes. But he said he did not think his government had declined a request to surge PPE stockpiles. He said: I\u2019ve thought a lot about this because, having been back through all the paperwork and everything, I haven\u2019t found any moment when I was asked or the Treasury was asked to approve sort of surge capacity for PPE supplies or anything like that. He said that, if asked, his government would have bought three months\u2019 worth of PPE supplies for hospitals. He said: In Jeremy Hunt\u2019s evidence hospitals in Hong Kong had to have three months of PPE supplies. I was never asked: \u2018Can we have funding for three months of PPE supplies for every hospital?\u2019 But had I been asked we would\u2019ve granted it, that\u2019s not expensive, that\u2019s not a huge commitment. The Metropolitan police have confirmed that they are looking at three new sets of complaints about alleged lockdown rule-breaking by politicians \u2013 but it has stressed that full investigations will only be launched if that is deemed \u201cproportionate\u201d. In a statement, it says it is \u201cin the process of assessing\u201d material about three sets of events: gatherings at No 10 and Chequers uncovered by the Cabinet Office when it was looking at Boris Johnson\u2019s diaries as part of its Covid inquiry work; the alleged birthday drinks party attended by Sir Bernard Jenkin in Dame Eleanor Laing\u2019s office; and the party staged by Shaun Bailey\u2019s Tory London mayoral campaign team. The statement says: It would not be appropriate to prejudge the outcome of these assessments or to provide a running commentary on their progress. We will provide further updates at the appropriate time. But it also says, when considering retrospective breaches of Covid rules, the Met will only launch a full investigation \u201cwhen there is evidence of a serious and flagrant breach\u201d and where an investigation would be proportionate, where not investigating would \u201csignificantly undermine the legitimacy of the law\u201d and where there is \u201clittle ambiguity around the absence of a reasonable defence\u201d. No 10 has also said that Rishi Sunak currently is not planning to attend the Commons debate on Boris Johnson \u2013 but that attendance has not been ruled out. Speaking at the lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said Sunak had other engagements this afternoon and evening. He said: I don\u2019t think we know yet whether there will be a vote on this issue. The prime minister is hosting the prime minister of Sweden. He has a series of meetings [and] an evening commitment. Asked whether Sunak planned to attend the Commons if there was a vote, the spokesperson said: It depends on the timings of the day. He has commitments that he can\u2019t move, but obviously it will depend on how the timings in parliament play out. Asked if it was possible Sunak might attend, the spokesperson replied: Currently you\u2019ve got his schedule for today which doesn\u2019t include attending parliament, but obviously we will see how the timings play out. Downing Street has refused to back calls for two of the people who attended the Tory Partygate event featured in a video leaked to the Mirror to lose their honours. (See 9.32am.) At the morning lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said it was for \u201cindividuals to make their own decision\u201d if they wanted to relinquish their honour. Scottish Conservative MPs who fail to vote in favour of the privileges committee report condemning Boris Johnson will be betraying their voters, Humza Yousaf, the Scottish first minister, said. Speaking at his news conference this morning (see 10.32am), Yousaf said: I think those that choose to turn up to the vote and abstain, or indeed vote against the sanctions, any Scottish Tory MP who does that is betraying the people they represent. Boris Johnson, and indeed the Conservative party more generally, have shown flagrant disregard for rules that many of us, most of us, adhered. At the extreme end of that we saw people literally missing the funerals of loved ones, not being able to say goodbye, while they partied in Conservative headquarters. That is a betrayal of people\u2019s trust. Any Scottish Tory MP that is going to abstain or not vote to sanction Boris Johnson, they rightly will face the wrath of the Scottish people at the ballot box, I don\u2019t doubt that for a minute. Liz Truss was often accused of deliberately dressing like Margaret Thatcher as her career in government progressed on the way to becoming prime minister. But it was never intentional, she told a media conference in Dublin this morning. Truss, who was PM for just a few weeks last year, said that female politicians were often compared with one another because \u201cthere aren\u2019t that many of us\u201d. Speaking about the Thatcher comparison, she said: I just think, frankly, it\u2019s lazy thinking on people\u2019s part. It\u2019s not something I have ever consciously sought to do at all. Truss also complained about some media outlets treating politics as \u201ca branch of the entertainment industry\u201d and she described the Daily Star\u2019s decision last year to set up a livestream to see if her premiership would last longer than a lettuce (it didn\u2019t) was \u201cpuerile\u201d. A cross-party group of British MPs and peers has written to Rishi Sunak him to reconsider a decision to allow a visit this week by a senior Chinese government official accused of overseeing the forcible repatriation of hundreds of dissidents back to China, including some from the UK. Patrick Wintour has the story here. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti says the Boris Johnson debate could run for about four hours, judging by the number of MPs who have indicated they want to speak. That suggests a vote at about 8.30pm. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, will make a Commons statement on stop and search. There are no urgent questions, and this means that the Braverman statement will start at 3.30pm, and that the debate on Boris Johnson and the privileges committee report will start at about 4.30pm. Cameron says there are always pressures on the NHS. But he says that by the time he left office public satisfaction with the NHS was extremely high. The King\u2019s Fund described it as one of the most successful health systems in the world. He goes on: We\u2019d virtually abolished mixed-sex wards, we\u2019d got hospital infections down, we were carrying out 40% more diagnostic tests every week. There were successes in the NHS as well as pressures. Asked about expert reports criticising the state of the NHS, he said they tended to measure outputs (performance) by inputs (money spent on health). He says these experts did not recognise the role reform could play. Q: Do you accept health inequalities increased during your time in office? Cameron says after 2011, in many countries around the world life expectancy improved, but at a lower rate than before. Countries such as Greece and Spain had far more austerity, \u201cbrutal cuts\u201d. But life expectancy went up in those countries, he says. He says he has read the report by Prof Clare Bambra and Prof Sir Michael Marmot on health inequalities that was submitted to the inquiry. As an example, he says the report said child poverty increased during his term in office. He goes on: Well, actually, the number of children living in absolute poverty went down. The number of people living in absolute poverty went down. The number of pensioners living in absolute poverty went down very considerably. (Absolute poverty is a measure of poverty benchmarked to the relatively poverty figure in a particular year, normally when a government takes office. Over time it almost always goes down, because inflation means household incomes go up in cash terms for the poorest families, even if they do not go up in relative terms.) He says he thinks Bambra and Marmot in their report came to \u201ca certain set of conclusions quite quickly, not all of which was backed up by the evidence\u201d. In their report Bambra and Marmot say: The UK entered the pandemic with increasing health inequalities and health among the poorest people in a state of decline. We knew from previous pandemics and research into lower respiratory tract infections that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, people living in areas or regions with higher rates of deprivation, and people from minority ethnic groups and people with disabilities, are much more likely to be severely impacted by a respiratory pandemic. Kate Blackwell KC is now asking David Cameron about his government\u2019s austerity policies. She says she does not want to examine whether they were right in principle; she just wants to ask about their impact on health, inequality and societal resilience. Q: Do you accept that the health budgets passed by your government were inadequate, and let to a depletion in its ability to provide an adequate service? Cameron says he does not accept that. He says, if the government had lost control of the public finances, it would not have been able to protect the NHS. He says health spending went up. The number of doctors increased. But it was \u201cessential\u201d to get the public finances back to health. Q: In a witness statement, Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has talked about his concerns about capacity in the NHS. Cameron says he knows of Hunt\u2019s concerns. He was a very capable health secretary. He was always battling for the NHS. But financial decisions had to be taken collectively. Q: Hunt sets out in his statement matters that should have been addressed. Cameron says, without his government\u2019s action, government debt might have been \u00a31tn higher. There would have been a financial and fiscal crisis, as well as the pandemic. He says government needs to have a strong economy, and also to prepare for pandemics. It did not end up spending enough time on the sort of pandemic the UK experienced. Q: Do you accept you failed in putting in place \u201cwhole-system resilience\u201d? Cameron says he does not accept that. He says he put in place the national risk register, and the national security council. Q: Evidence heard by the inquiry last week included the question from witnesses: \u201cWho is in charge of keeping the country safe?\u201d Cameron says, as PM, he was in charge of keeping the country safe. He says he set up the national security council to help him to that. He says all his experience of dealing with matters such as Ebola showed that the system worked well, but that it worked best \u201cwhen the prime minister is in the chair, asking questions, driving changes, and making sure decisions are made\u201d. This may be a dig at Boris Johnson. Cameron is now being asked if he accepts that, by the time he left office, there had been no planning for the impact of a pandemic. For example, was there any school planning? In reply, Cameron says he thinks the possibility of school planning came up in the Operation Cygnet exercise. Kate Blackwell KC, who is questioning Cameron on behalf of the inquiry, says the Cygnet report said that work should be looked at. That does not mean it was done. Q: Was there any planning for restrictions? Cameron says his government was focused on safeguarding the country\u2019s finances. There is no resilience without economic resilience, he says. He says the national risk registers talked about how government might respond to various catastrophic events. But a plan is \u201conly as good as the economic and financial capacity of a country to deliver it\u201d, he says. David Cameron is giving evidence to the Covid inquiry since 11am. He was prime minister from 2010 until 2016, and he said that although pandemics were seen as a \u201ctier 1 risk\u201d, there was too much focus on the risk of a flu pandemic, and not enough on the risk of another type. He said he had been asking himself why that happened, and it was \u201cvery hard\u201d to give an answer. He said: This is the thing I keep coming back to, which is that pandemic was a \u2018tier 1 risk\u2019 \u2013 pandemics were looked at, but \u2026 much more time was spent on pandemic flu and the dangers of pandemic flu rather than on potential pandemics of other more respiratory diseases like Covid turned out to be. And, you know, I think this is so important because so many consequences follow from that. And I\u2019ve been sort of wrestling with \u2026 I think the architecture [to deal with large-scale emergencies] was good \u2013 the national security council, the national security adviser, the risk register, and also this new security risk assessment, which was perhaps a bit more dynamic. But that\u2019s where I keep coming back to \u2026 is, so much time was spent on a pandemic influenza and that was seen as the greatest danger \u2013 and we had very bad years for flu so it is a big danger. But why wasn\u2019t more time and more questions asked about what turned out to be the pandemic that we faced? It\u2019s very hard to answer why that\u2019s the case. And I\u2019m sure this public inquiry is going to spend a lot of time on that. These are from ITV\u2019s Anushka Asthana on Cameron\u2019s evidence. Q: Will the HQ of GB Energy be based in Aberdeen? [In his speech, Starmer announced it would be in Scotland.] Sarwar says it has not been decided where the HQ will go. But he says the energy plan will be good for Aberdeen. And that was the final question. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: At the weekend Panelbase said Labour is on course to win 26 seats in Scotland. Is that realistic? Starmer says he is very, very conscious of the fact that Scotland matters to Labour. Of course the party needs seats in Scotland to win. But he wants to be the prime minister \u201cnot just of the UK, but for the UK\u201d, he says. That is why having seats in Scotland matters to him. He says he wants his party to be able to say it has representation across the UK. His missions will be succeed unless they have support across the whole of the UK. Sarwar says he is not complacent \u201cfor a second\u201d. They have made significant progress, he says. They had had to demonstrate Labour is changing, build campaigning infrastructure, show they can be a credible opposition \u2013 but also show why they deserve to win. He says the announcement today is crucial in that respect. He says Labour has to win for the sake of the NHS. There are 750,000 Scots on a waiting list, he says. Q: How long can someone working in the oil and gas industry expect to have their job? Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, says that sector will pay a significant role for decades to come. The jobs will be protected, he says. Q: If you do not commit to rescinding the Rosebank licence, aren\u2019t you just letting the Tories do your dirty work? Starmer does not answer the question directly. Instead he says the trade unions support Labour\u2019s desire to promote jobs in the green energy sector. He says in Scotland there is resentment that they have offshore wind, but they have not got the jobs that went with it. He recalls visiting a windfarm where all the turbines were built outside the UK. The Tories let coalmining die and had no plan for the future. Labour won\u2019t allow the same thing to happen as the oil and gas industry winds down. Q: Would you back higher windfall taxes? Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, says energy companies are making record profits. He says it is right to have a windfall tax that puts that money back in people\u2019s pockets. Q: If you were PM today, would you give the go-ahead to the Rosebank oilfield? Starmer says his policy is to say no to new licences. But it would not rescind existing licences. He says it is important for investors to have certainty (ie for them to know that licences awarded under this government would be withdrawn). But he says the Rosebank licence is expected to be approved very soon. So that would count as an existing licence by the time Labour came into office, he says. Q: Can you confirm that you would no longer issue oil and gas exploration licences for the North Sea, but would allow existing drilling to continue? Starmer says Labour has been clear about wanting to stop further exploration. But he says oil and gas will continue to be part of the energy mix for decades. Back in Edinburgh Keir Starmer has just finished his speech, and is now taking questions. Q: Hasn\u2019t the shift on your \u00a328bn green energy pledge shown that you cannot be trusted? Starmer says Labour has not abandoned this plan; it is doubling down on it. But he says the context for borrowing has changed since the party announced it. Q: Everything is going well for you. It is impossible for you to lose now? Starmer says there is a reason why the Tories at Westminster, and the SNP in Scotland, are failing. The question is, are people better off? And under both these governments, they are not. But he says Labour has to earn every vote. When Boris Johnson was prime minister, and facing a fresh blast of Partygate negative headlines, they often seemed to coincided with No 10 announcing that Johnson had just had a call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. We have a new prime minister, but some traditions (or coincidences \u2013 No 10 always denied that the calls were part of a distraction strategy) endure. Downing Street has just announced that Rishi Sunak spoke to Zelenskiy this morning. In a readout, No 10 said: The prime minister paid tribute to the bravery of the Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline of the counteroffensive and said it was clear they were making good progress. He told President Zelenskiy that the UK was firmly behind Ukraine as it continued to push back invading Russian forces. Small steps forward would bring success, the prime minister added. The prime minister updated on his recent visit to the US and his meeting with President Biden, and said it was clear the US and UK were in lockstep in their unwavering support for Ukraine. Both the prime minister and President Zelenskiy looked forward to speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference, which is being hosted in London this week. Starmer develops the attack on the Conservative\u2019s approach to green energy, accusing them of just adopting a \u201csticking plaster\u201d approach. He says: I\u2019ll give an example: \u201cGreen crap.\u201d That\u2019s what they said \u2013 \u201ccut the green crap\u201d. And so they scrapped investment in home insulation, stalled nuclear energy, banned onshore wind. The result? When the crisis hit last year and when Russia invaded Ukraine, not only did the bills of businesses and working people go through the roof, we had to borrow \u00a340bn with no new infrastructure to show for it. That\u2019s not green crap, that\u2019s Tory crap! \u201cGreen crap\u2019\u201d was the phrase attributed to David Cameron, who reportedly used it to dismiss green policies. Starmer says that the UK can be a world leader on green energy, but the government has to be proactively supporting the industry. We have tremendous advantages here: our coast, our shallow waters, our universities, our creativity, the depth of our skills, the graft of our people, the superpower sciences, the technological edge, and yes \u2013 if you can believe it, even our weather. Financial strength here in Edinburgh and yes, in the City of London too, but nonetheless the world leader for green finance which is a massive advantage for all of us. Seriously \u2013 there are no grounds for the defeatism which says we can\u2019t lead the world on this. That our prospects will always be squeezed out by the US and the EU is declinist nonsense. But at the same time, we\u2019ve got to get moving. At the moment we\u2019re standing on the side-lines, wringing our hands and falling behind because our government talks about economic stability yet understands nothing of what this requires in times like ours. When the winds of change are blowing this fiercely, you need a government that gets involved and intervenes, on behalf of working people, to secure stability and growth. Drift equals chaos. This is about Tory ideology, of course it is. Their impulses are totally out of step with the challenges of the modern world. They still cleave to the set of ideas that came out of the 1980s: the dismissal of industrial strategy, the contempt for active government, and a complacency that says only the market decides which industries matter for working people and national security. Starmer says he understands the concern felt by people working in the oil and gas industry about the transition to a green energy future. But he says it would be a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d to delay. He says: I know the ghosts industrial change unearths. As a young lawyer, I worked with mining communities to challenge the Tories\u2019 pit closure programme but deep down, we all know this has to happen eventually and that the only question is when. So in all candour, the reality is this, the moment for decisive action is now. If we wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out, the opportunities this change can bring for Scotland and your community will pass us by, and that would be a historic mistake. An error, for the future of Scotland, as big as the Thatcher government closing the coal mines, while frittering away the opportunity of the North Sea. My offer, the Labour offer, is this; a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs. No cliff edges. At the Labour event Keir Starmer is now speaking. He starts with a jibe at the SNP, saying the tide is turning in Scotland. Turning to energy policy, he says Labour wants to promote security. People want to know if the UK is still a great nation, he says. Can we still achieve great things? Can we unite and move forward? Can we still change, can we grow, can we get things done, can we build things? New industries, new technologies, new jobs; will they come to our shores, or will the future pass us by? You can put it even more starkly. Around the world people want to know, are we still a great nation? If the question is about the British people, the answer is emphatically: yes. But if it\u2019s about British politics \u2013 I don\u2019t even need to answer that, do I? This is what we\u2019re taking on, the Labour offer at the next election: a new government and a new way of governing, a plan for change, a plan to use clean power to build a new Britain, a plan to get our future back and say, to those who doubt we can still be great: we are, we can, and we will. As the BBC\u2019s David Wallace Lockhart reports, Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has been holding a news conference marking the publication of a paper on the SNP\u2019s plans for a written constitution for an independent Scotland. There is a summary on the SNP\u2019s website. And here is the full 62-page paper. Yousaf said: Independence would give Scotland the ability to continue its progressive approach to human rights and equality, without the current restrictions of the devolution settlement and without the threat of Westminster overruling our decisions or unwinding our advances. This would ensure that our human rights and equality protections could cover all policy areas, including those currently reserved to the Westminster parliament. In Edinburgh there is a high-powered turnout for the Keir Starmer energy speech. Two members of the shadow cabinet, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, have already delivered warm-up speeches, and Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, is now doing his bit too. Starmer will be up soon. David Warburton has formally quit as an MP after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use, PA Media reports. PA says: The decision means Rishi Sunak faces another potentially difficult byelection in the Somerton and Frome seat vacated by the former Tory MP. Warburton\u2019s exit from the Commons was confirmed by the Treasury following his appointment as steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead \u2013 one of the procedural routes for an MP to quit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Warburton admitted to taking cocaine after drinking \u201ctons of incredibly potent\u201d Japanese whiskey, but denied claims he harassed a female political aide in his Westminster flat. When he announced his resignation on Saturday, Warburton hit out at the investigation conducted by parliament\u2019s independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS), claiming he had been denied a fair hearing. The BBC\u2019s Iain Watson posted Warburton\u2019s resignation letter on Twitter at the weekend. As the Financial Times\u2019s Stephen Bush has argued, the Liberal Democrats are in a very good position to win the seat, which Warburton won for the Tories in 2019 with a majority of 19,213. Keir Starmer is about to deliver his speech on Labour\u2019s green energy mission in Edinburgh. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. The contents of the speech have been trailed by the party in some detail overnight. Fiona Harvey and Severin Carrell have a summary here. Readers have been asking about the vote in the Commons later on the privileges committee reporter. Several people have raised this question, or versions of it. If the Conservatives are trying to push through the report with a nod, could of the opposition parties interject to cause a division and force reluctant MPs to vote? Is there any precedent for an opposition to a motion you support, just to force a vote to embarrass another party? Yes, they could, and yes, it happens quite often. There is more about this issue here. Another person asked: I wonder if you could write a few words on what is/are (if any) the downside(s) of the Partygate motion going through on the nod? I\u2019m sure I heard there are some, but can\u2019t recall what! The motion, \u201cThat this house approves the fifth report from the committee of privileges\u201d, can pass either on the nod, or as the result of a division. There would be no impact on the practical effects of the vote, which are very limited anyway (amounting to no more than Boris Johnson losing his ex-MP\u2019s pass to the Commons). A motion passed on the nod is arguable more authoritative. You cannot say it has been passed unanimously, because most MPs won\u2019t be in the chamber, and won\u2019t express a view when the speaker asks MPs to approve the motion by acclamation (\u201call those in favour say aye\u201d etc). But if no MP shouts no, you can say it has been passed without opposition. But if there is a division, people will be able to find out who voted in favour and who voted against. They won\u2019t, however, be able to find out who has deliberately chosen to abstain. The list of MPs who do not vote gets published when there is a division, but no distinction is made between people deliberately abstaining, and people who have another reason for missing the vote. Keir Starmer also told the Today programme that, as PM, he would be willing to block Rishi Sunak\u2019s resignation honours list if he thought it included questionable names. After Starmer told the programme that Sunak should have blocked Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours (see 9.32am), the presenter, Mishal Husain, put it to Starmer that, in rubber-stamping the list, Sunak was just following precedent. She asked Starmer if he would be willing to intervene if he had an issue with names on Sunak\u2019s resignation honours list. Starmer replied: Yes. I think that what Rishi Sunak did was wrong. Starmer also said, if he were PM, he would not have a resignation honours list himself. Asked about the prospect, he replied: There are other opportunities [to reward people] but Tony Blair didn\u2019t have a resignation list. It is very hard to justify. If it was reserved for people who had given incredible service \u2013 perhaps picking out people who had been involved in the development of the vaccine or some other real element of public service \u2013 but it is very hard to see how it is justified. There are other avenues for that and I think it is easier to be clean about this and say no, I wouldn\u2019t do it. Tony Blair didn\u2019t do it and I wouldn\u2019t do it. Keir Starmer argued this morning the release of a video showing Tory activists, including one given an OBE in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list, partying during lockdown was an example of why Rishi Sunak was wrong to approve it. Sunak has defended waving through the resignation honours, saying in not seeking to remove any names he was just following precedent. But Starmer told the Today programme this morning that Johnson\u2019s reputation was so tainted that Sunak would have been justified in blocking his list. He said: Everybody knew that the privileges committee was about to report on the behaviour of the former prime minister. Why on earth didn\u2019t Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, take the provisional list from Boris Johnson and say \u2018Thank you very much, I will put that on one side and I\u2019ll come to it and look at it when I know the findings of the privileges committee\u2019? Because whatever the previous conventions, we\u2019ve never had a situation like this where a previous prime minister has been found to have lied to parliament, not once but repeatedly. He has now pretty well been stripped of any involvement in parliament. That is unprecedented. Why on earth didn\u2019t Rishi Sunak say \u2018I\u2019ll put your list on one side, former prime minister. I will get to it but I am determined to see the findings of the privileges committee before I do so. Because if, for example, the privileges committee says you lied to parliament, then I\u2019m not going to put your list through\u2019. Ben Mallet, who got an OBE in the honours list, is featured in the video obtained by the Mirror. He was at a party also attended by Shaun Bailey, the Tory candidate for London mayor in 2020. Bailey was made a peer in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours, but he left the party before the video was recorded. Starmer made his point about why Sunak should have blocked the list after being asked if it was possible Mallet and Bailey could have their honours withdrawn. Starmer told Today that he was not sure that was possible. But Josiah Mortimer from Byline Times says that in fact it could be done. Rishi Sunak has ruled out extra help for homeowners struggling to pay soaring mortgage costs, as the average two-year fixed-rate loan rose above 6%, Alex Lawson reports. Good morning. This afternoon MPs will be debating a report saying that Boris Johnson lied to parliament about Partygate (\u201cdeliberately misled\u201d is the way the report puts it, but it means the same thing), and that by doing so, and by attacking the subsequent inquiry, he committed serious and multiple contempts of parliament. There is no precedent for a parliamentary inquiry saying this as about former prime minister, and so you might expect the current prime minister to have a view on a conclusion this momentous. But Rishi Sunak is not taking sides. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain broadcast this morning, he said that he respected the work done by the committee. This committee was established under the former prime minister. It commanded the confidence of the house at the time and I\u2019m sure that they have done their work thoroughly and I respect them for that. But he said he would not be saying whether he backed the privileges committee\u2019s report, and its recommendations, because this was a Commons matter, not a government matter, and he did not want to \u201cinfluence\u201d MPs. He said: This is a matter for the house rather than the government, that\u2019s an important distinction and that is why I wouldn\u2019t want to influence anyone in advance of that vote. It will be up to each and every individual MP to make a decision of what they want to do when the time comes, it\u2019s important the government doesn\u2019t get involved in that because it is a matter for parliament and members as individuals, not as members as government. Given that the whole point of becoming PM is to \u201cinfluence\u201d how MPs vote, this may be another constitutional first. But Sunak is clearly worried about antagonising Johnson\u2019s small but vocal and toxic band of supporters in the party, and their more powerful allies in the Tory media. Downing Street has not said whether Sunak will be in the Commons for the debate later. The Swedish government is reporting that Sunak is meeting Ulf Kristersson, the Swedish PM, in London later today, and so he may have a good excuse not to be there. MPs are expected to approve a motion saying they approve the privileges committee\u2019s report but, with Johnson urging his supporters not to vote against, it could well go through on the nod. This morning Keir Starmer said Sunak should \u201cshow leadership\u201d and back the report. Asked if he thought Sunak should vote in favour of it, Starmer told Good Morning Britain: Yes, I do. We need to know where Rishi Sunak stands on this. He should show leadership, come along, get in the lobby and show us where he stands on this. Starmer has been doing a series of interviews this morning, ahead of a speech later. I will post more from them shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Liz Truss, the former PM, speaks at the Xchange conference in Dublin. 10am: Keir Starmer gives a speech in Edinburgh on Labour\u2019s green energy mission. 10am: Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s first minister, holds a press conference. He is publishing a paper on the SNP\u2019s plans for an independent Scotland to have a written constitution. 11am: David Cameron, the former PM, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 3.30pm: MPs debate the privileges committee report saying Boris Johnson deliberately misled the Commons about Partygate. They are expected to approve a motion tabled by Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, saying \u201cthis house approves the fifth report from the committee of privileges\u201d. In theory the debate could run until 10pm, but it is expected to wrap early evening. If you want to contact me, do try the \u201csend us a message\u201d feature.

With this excellent report I\u2019ll sign off. Thanks for keeping me company. Hope you enjoyed that. Catch you soon. England were absolutely electric this evening. I didn\u2019t see it live, of course, but every time I looked up they\u2019d bagged another goal. And David Hytner\u2019s report from Old Trafford is as sparkling as Bukayo Saka\u2019s future. Give it a read why don\u2019t ya. \u201cAs a Stuttgart fan, I\u2019m familiar with the good and bad sides of Konstantinos Mavropanos as a player, and Greece got the latter today, with him both giving away the penalty France scored their one goal from, and getting sent off.\u201d Not a great night for the Greek centre back, was it K\u00e1ri Tulinius. His error and Mbappe\u2019s penalty was the difference tonight as France went six points clear at the top of Group B. Here\u2019s James picking up from the Darren Moore chat: So, where does that leave Wales and Northern Ireland after those two disappointing defeats? Wales are fourth in Group D with four points but they\u2019ve played four games. Croatia above them have as many points but with two games in hand. If Wales have any hope of qualifying they\u2019ll need to beat Croatia at least one and get the better of Turkey at home. It\u2019s not much better for Northern Ireland who are fifth in a six team Group H. And considering the team below them is San Marino, it\u2019s not looking pretty. Northern Ireland have three points from four games having lost three on the bounce. There\u2019s already a four point gap between themselves and Slovenia in fourth. Group B: France 1-0 Greece Republic of Ireland 3-0 Greece Group C: Ukraine 1-0 Malta England 7-0 North Macedonia Group D: Armenia 2-1 Latvia Turkey 2-0 Wales Group H: Finland 6-0 San Marino Northern Ireland 0-1 Kazakhstan Slovenia 1-1 Denmark Group I: Belarus 2-1 Kosovo 1 Israel 2-1 Andorra Switzerland 2-2 Romania That\u2019s that. Wales rode their luck. Turkey had two goals chalked off after VAR reviews and Ward saved a penalty but in the end, the pressure told and Wales, who were reduced to 10 men after 41 minutes, couldn\u2019t hold on. 90+3 min: Turkey are taking the mick now. They\u2019re playing keep-ball. And why not? They\u2019re heading top of group D. They\u2019re calling Kazakhstan\u2019s win a \u201csucker punch\u201d on Sky Sports. Not sure about that. Northern Ireland were poor. Proper poor. If anything they got what they deserved. And besides, that\u2019s Kazakhstan\u2019s third win on the bounce in the competition. 90 min: Five extra minutes for Wales to endure. Boos ring out at Windsor Park. They had 59% possession. They had 12 shots to Kazakhstan\u2019s two. They had more passes and were the better side. But they spluttered when it mattered and they\u2019ve paid the price. Poor show. 89 min: Wales are spent. They now need home wins against Turkey and Croatia if they want to take part in Germany next year. 90+4 min: Northern Ireland have a corner. Can they do anything with it? No, it\u2019s cleared. But they keep the ball. One last chance\u2026 90+2 min: A Northern Ireland cross is too long and goes out for a goal kick. That has been a feature of this game. 90 min: Five minutes of added time for Northern Ireland to get something back. 85 min: Not that it will help much now, but there are a couple of changes for Wales with Wilson and Ramsey replaced by Broadhead and Jordan James. My goodness! Kazakhstan have stolen this! A counter attack goal completely against the run of play. A ball through the middle, he\u2019s found himself one on one with the \u2018keeper and he\u2019s slotted it home. He skipped past two desperate tackles en route. Unreal! Wales\u2019 hopes of taking part in Germany next year are dangling by a thread as Guler is allowed all the time in the world to pick his spot and shoot past Ward into the top corner. Questions about Ramsey there. Could he have closed down the space? Probably. Game over. 86 min: Bleeeurgh! Just so disappointing. Price has the chance to deliver with a free-kick from the left but he overhits it and it bobbles away for a goal kick. They don\u2019t deserve to win it. Watch them absolutely steal this now. 83 min: Brown comes on for Thompson as O\u2019Neill rolls the dice one last time. OK David Manby, you win: \u201cWatching the game here in Turkey - not in the stadium, but up the Barhal Valley which is in the mountains at the other end of the Black Sea. In a tiny village some 600 kms away but the pension owner\u2019s mobile phone has the game on and my partner is shouting at this phone to tell her former pupil, Ward, to get in position! Meanwhile a major rainstorm is clattering on the corrugated iron roof. All very surreal!\u201d 75 min: I\u2019ve loved this game in Turkey. It\u2019s so fiery. Irfan Kahveci is booked for putting his hands in Connor Roberts\u2019 face. File that under things you don\u2019t like to see but really do. Roberts kicked the ball (softly) into a Turkish player lying on the floor. It\u2019s becoming silly and I\u2019m loving it. 80 min: Northern Ireland have 10 minutes plus added time to win a game they\u2019ve dominated. McMenamin\u2019s in swinger is punched away from Shatskiy. Not clinical enough. 74 min: Turkey are now going for the jugular. Yilmaz is causing havoc on the right and chooses to pass to Kokcu on the run. His first time shot is sliced wide. Wales in trouble here of a rout. This one will count. A cross from the right is well met by Nayir who beats Mepham in the air. Ward gets something on it but can\u2019t keep it out. Three centre backs and no one was there it prevent the header. I\u2019m almost 100% confident that this will stand. 78 min: A top class save from Shatskiy keeps McMenamin\u2019s stinger out with his left foot. Superb stop. Northern Ireland pressing. I DON\u2019T BELIEVE IT! Honestly what is going on. Wales get another life as this one is ruled no good after a VAR check. Nayir controlled with his arm. Astonishing scenes! It was only a matter of time. Wales survived an own-goal, they\u2019ve held on with 10 men, they saved a penalty, but they couldn\u2019t keep this strike out. Ward perhaps should have as he meekly wafted at a cross that landed at the feet of the substitute Umut Nayir who swept home into an unguarded net. It\u2019s England 6-0 North Macedonia! Crikey. 72 min: A couple of changes for Northern Ireland. D. Charles and McCann are replaced by Taylor and Lavery. Charles\u2019 last act was a busting run upfield before he was cut down by Tagybergen. Price had a pop shot from distance from a free-kick. Looking a little grim for the home side who seemingly lack any imagination with the ball at their feet. Justice! I didn\u2019t think it was a fair penalty and Ward guesses the right way to keep it level. Wales hanging on but they\u2019re giving themselves a massive chance to nick this. 63 min: Penalty for Turkey! It\u2019s for a hand ball against Ramsey. One of those ones where you have to ask what the player is supposed to do there. He\u2019s got arms. His right hand is outstretched but it hits his left. Unlucky. 62 min: James can\u2019t keep up the energy and is subbed for Bradshaw. Arda Guler, a substitute himself, blazes over with his first touch of the game. 67 min: Some heat at last. A yellow card each for Northern Ireland and Kazakhstan as first Saville is cautioned for a high boot and then Alip joins him in the book for a lunge on McMenamin. 65 min: There\u2019s an appeal for a Northern Ireland penalty as McMenamin sends the ball into the box. Price goes down under contact but referees just don\u2019t give those. Play on son. 59 min: Fair play to Wales. I thought they\u2019d get stuffed in this second half but they\u2019ve rallied and are enjoying themselves. James has been tremendous, running around like a headless chicken up front and annoying Turkey with his little darts here and there. Some score updates for you from around the continent: England 5-0 North Macedonia (Saka hat-trick btw) Republic of Ireland 2-0 Gibraltar (two quick goals has changed this one fast) France 1-0 Greece Slovenia 1-1 Denmark Belarus 0-0 Kosovo Israel 1-1 Andorra Switzerland 2-0 Romania 56 min: Dan James is operating as a striker and he draws another foul from a ref who is more than happy to oblige. That\u2019ll suit Wales and will frustrate Turkey. 59 min: Kazakhstan bossing it now. Samorodov cuts in from the left and puts his laces through one. It starts on target but rises over the bar. Northern Ireland getting hammered. 54 min: Maybe Wales should always play with 10. They\u2019ve certainly been the brighter of the two sides this half. James is enjoying more room to do his thing with Ramsey seeing more of the ball as well. 52 min: Another booking for Turkey. This one seemed soft as well but at least the ref is consistent. Under is cautioned for the slightest contact on Williams, 57 min: Just when you thought Peacock-Farrell was just the name of a spectator, he\u2019s asked to come off his line and punch clear a cross. Kazakhstan (no doubt feeling the sting of my earlier rebuke) are enjoying a little spell of possession. 54 min: Yuck! Man this has been a drab match at Windsor Park compared to the cracker we\u2019ve got in Turkey. Tagybergen shoots from the dark side of the moon and it dribbles wide for a goal kick. About sums it up. 48 min: That gives Wales a chance to shoot from the free-kick and Harry Wilson almost gives his team the lead. It\u2019s a delightful curling effort with his left boot but it\u2019s not good enough to beat this wonder save from Mert Gunok who sticks out his left hand to get it clear. The \u2018keeper then gets up quickly to snuff out the rebound. Excellent work from the shot-stopper. 48 min: Wales stick with a back three. Remember, they need a point at least to get their campaign going again. James finds a bit of space and holds the ball well before buying a free kick. Merih Demiral clattered him and gets a yellow card for his troubles. 51 min: Northern Ireland on the attack but there\u2019s a distinct lack of penetration. Kazakhstan are well organised and they\u2019re holding firm. 45 min: There is a change, though, for Wales as they begin the second half. Brennan Johnson is replaced by Ben Cabango. Turkey, sensing blood, also make a change. Umut Nayir for Kerem Akturkoglu. No changes for either side after the break in Windsor Park, by the way. 47 min: Northern Ireland have started the second half the way they ended the fist \u2013 on the attack but lacking precision in the final third. Saville delivers a delicious whipped cross around shin height but no one is there to meet it. Would have been a tap in. You\u2019ve got to show desire and bravery to make those runs. 45 min: We\u2019re back underway at Windsor Park. Northern Ireland need to find their groove. I\u2019ve got Sky News on in the background and the message is unanimous. Darren Moore was harshly treated and should have been given a chance to lead Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship. What do you reckon? Right call or something fishy in Yorkshire? Thibaut Courtois doesn\u2019t want to play anymore. He\u2019s packed up his toys, called his mum, and asked her to bring a premature end to the play date. Childish, right? Well, get a load of this: Half-time scores: Turkey 0-0 Wales Northern Ireland 0-0 Kazakhstan England 3-0 North Macedonia Republic of Ireland 0-0 Gibraltar Slovenia 1-1 Denmark France 0-0 Greece Switzerland 2-0 Romania Israel 1-0 Andorra Belarus 0-0 Kosovo \u201cOh come on Daniel it\u2019s a clear red.\u201d So says Cem Erkul. I think it\u2019s one of those one where I wouldn\u2019t mind too much either way. The studs were high and it looked nasty. I just think the impact wasn\u2019t as violent as it perhaps seemed. But no complaints from me. Nor would I have complained if it was just a yellow. Another argument for orange cards? So Wales make it to half-time but will have to play the second 45 with 10 men. That\u2019s two red cards in as many games. Turkey have had 70% of the ball, have had eight shots to Wales\u2019 three and have a pass rate of almost 90% (Wales are struggling with less than 70%). 45+5 min: Turkey are all over Wales. Cengiz Under snaps at a shot and lifts it over from close range. He wasn\u2019t expecting it to come to him after Williams could only flick his clearing header. Seconds later Turkey show more patience until Orkun Kokcu shoots from miles away. he catches all of it but it\u2019s straight to at Ward. Northern Ireland were clearly the better team but the two best chances fell to Kazakhstan. 45+3 min: Celik cuts onto his right foot and looks to curl one towards the top corner. Ward saves comfortably. Spotted it all the way. 45+2 min: Oh my goodness. Another great chance for Kazakhstan just before the half time whistle. They seriously could be 2-0 up in this one. Zaynutdinov waits patiently before spotting the chance to shoot from the edge of the area and flashes one just wide with a left footed strike. 45 min: Two extra minutes in Northern Ireland. 45 min: Wales need to make some changes. Johnson has switched over to the right with Williams dropping deep. No designated striker. More of a 4-5-0. Six extra minutes. 43 min: Northern Ireland still can\u2019t hit the target. Saville\u2019s delightful run sees him meet Charles\u2019 clipped cross with a firm header at the back post but he fails to keep it down. 42 min: So disappointing for Wales and for Morrell who came into the side after Moore was shown a straight red against Armenia. And just as Wales were starting to stitch something together with Wilson hitting the wall from a direct free-kick. For the second game in a row, Wales will play with 10 men! Possibly a little harsh but his wild lunge looked reckless and the studs were up. He caught Ferdi Kadioglu high on the leg and you can see why the ref showed red, even though there wasn\u2019t much force at the point of contact. I missed a few games earlier. So here they are in full after 38 minutes: Slovenia 1-0 Denmark Belarus 0-0 Kosovo Israel 0-0 Andorra Switzerland 1-0 Romania France 0-0 Greece Northern Ireland 0-0 Kazakstan Turkey 0-0 Wales England 2-0 North Macedonia Yup, England have doubled their lead. 38 min: All the air has left Windsor Park. Things have become pretty stale as both teams struggle for any fluency. 37 min: Wales under the cosh. They\u2019re very narrow, clearly backing themselves to deal with crosses into the box. James can\u2019t get any go forward ball and is essentially operating as an extra wingback. 33 min: And just like that, Turkey show that they\u2019re in charge. Yilmaz beats Mepham and canters towards goal. Thankfully Rodon is there to make the tackle. Turkey are back at it again and after stealing possession they raid forward and Kerem Akturkoglu meets a cut-back with a first time shot that lifts over the bar. 32 min: Johnson returns. Not that Wales needed him. They\u2019ve looked good with 10 men and have the chance to cross but James can\u2019t find his radar and it\u2019s an easy take for the goalkeeper. Besides England, who have just taken the lead, we\u2019ve got two other games on. Both goalless: Republic of Ireland 0-0 Gibraltar France 0-0 Greece 30 min: Back to Turkey. Johnson has yet to get back on the field. Wales playing with 10 men. He\u2019s getting some heavy strapping around his foot. He\u2019ll give it one more go. 30 min: After half an hour Northern Ireland are certainly on top. They\u2019ve created one big chance from six shots at goal and have an xG of 0.6 (if you\u2019re that way inclined). But Kazakhstan had the clearest chance and probably should be ahead. But the hosts are sharp on the ball. They\u2019ve made 143 passes to 85. 28 min: The physio leaves and play goes on but Johnson goes down again. He doesn\u2019t look good. Page with a decision to make soon. 27 min: Brennan Johnson flies into a challenge but comes off second best. The physio is on the field. That didn\u2019t look smart. 26 min: A chance for Northern Ireland. Again with a header. McCann rises high but can\u2019t steer it on target as it drops just wide. 25 min: Turkey bossing it. 70% possession now. Wales looking to play on the counter. 23 min: Williams has been the main character in this game. He\u2019s provided some slick passes to spark attacks down his flank but he\u2019s also been targeted by Celik who has twisted him round with the ball at his feet. He\u2019s smashed Calhanoglu with studs up. Again, no card. 24 min: Delay in Windsor Park as Hume receives some treatment. He\u2019ll be alright. Two absolutely cracking games so far but easy to see why Wales and Northern Ireland are struggling in their respective groups. Plenty of chances already but no one has found the back of the net. 21 min: Northern Ireland come close twice! First Price takes a snap shot that is deflected just past the post. The corner is then well worked before Cathcart head over from the middle of the box. He was unmarked and should have done better. 18 min: James dusts himself off and delivers the ball into a crowded area but he\u2019s over hit it. What a waste. 17 min: We\u2019ve got our first booking. Celik, perhaps peeved over the offside call, has nailed Dan James. The flying winger was put into space by a great pass from Neco Williams. Wales looking good. 15 min: How is it still goalless in Northern Ireland. Charles created some space for himself and shanked an effort wide from the edge of the box. He should have done better. A minute later Samorodov missed a sitter at the other end after jinking past a few defenders and dragging wide from 12 yards. It\u2019s a cracking game. Shame no one brought their shooting boots with them. For some reason Fabio Maresca wasn\u2019t shown the VAR offside lines on the monitor. Some debate whether or not that was onside. Perhaps Turkey have just been robbed? Feel like this talking point will run and run. Headline is it\u2019s still all square. I don\u2019t believe it! VAR has come to the rescue. After an age, the referee has rightly ruled Zeki Celik\u2019s run offside and Mepham is a very relieved man. Oh no! Just when things were looking good for Wales. It\u2019s bad enough they shipped four against Armenia now they\u2019re bulging their own net with an own goal. It\u2019s a horrible mistake from Chris Mepham who slices the ball after getting his feet in a tangle. 9 min: Over to Windsor Park and Hume comes close with a 25 yard screamer that almost finds the top corner. Kazakhstan disrupt another attack and launch a counter but Charles cuts it down with a foul. 7 min: All Wales at the minute. Johnson takes a shot on the angle that finds the side netting. It\u2019s raining heavily and it seems as though he\u2019s slipped. Either way, he\u2019s holding his right foot. Speaking of fiery reactions, Matthew Dony is calling for some heat from the Welsh: \u201cKieffer Moore is a fantastic presence up front, even though referees do love giving free kicks against him. Obviously he\u2019ll be missed. Without him, though, that is a quick and mobile forward line. I won\u2019t go as far as to say I\u2019m quietly confident, but I\u2019m certainly expecting a reaction.\u201d 4 min: A fiery start in Turkey. Joe Morrell smashes the Turkish captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, as they both leap for a header. No card. Just a stern talking to. Without sounding barbaric, that\u2019s the sort of spirit that\u2019s needed. 2 min: Ramsey takes a hopeful shot from miles for Wales. It\u2019s blocked. 2 min: It\u2019s a good start for Northern Ireland. They\u2019re moving the ball around with precision and win a corner. A poor delivery comes to nothing but it\u2019s a promising opening, Right then. All set at the Samsun Yeni 19 Mayis Stadyumu and Windsor Park. Let\u2019s gooooo\u2026. This is Wales\u2019 first visit to Turkey since 1997. Which seems bonkers to me given the number of international games they play nowadays. Let\u2019s hope for anything like the pandemonium of 26 years ago when Turkey won a 6-4 thriller in their World Cup qualifying game. Hakan Sukur scored four of his own and Wales were actually 4-3 up after 52 minutes when Andy Melville scored. But a goal from Cetin Oguz and a couple more from Sukur sealed the classic encounter with eight minutes to spare. Speaking of O\u2019Neills, well, in this case, an O\u2019Neil, Bournemouth have a new manager. It\u2019s a tough one, the Martin getting the boot has upset a few people, not least the man himself who was only informed of the decision this morning. But this is a shrewd and ruthless move from the Cherries. Want to know more? Ben Fisher has you covered: It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Northern Ireland could have left Copenhagen with a point were it not for a cruel VAR decision in the 94th minute. Michael O\u2019Neill thought that the teenage debutant, Callum Marshall, had bagged the late equaliser, only for the goal to be disallowed for Jonny Evans being offside following a VAR check that lasted five minutes. \u201cI think a lot of it is about the consistency of the work we do. What we were very pleased about was a lot of what we did out of possession on Friday night,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cIt\u2019s about not trying not to be passive at any point in the game. We\u2019ve worked consistently in a short space of time, both in March and this month, to try to make ourselves better out of possession. \u201cUltimately, our quality of play will be determined by our own individual players and the structure of our team. And then confidence. A positive atmosphere in here [Windsor] generally leads to a positive performance and that\u2019s hopefully what we will get.\u201d Perhaps playing on their own patch can give them the lift they need. \u201cFriday was a massive bump, but now we stick together as a group.\u201d So said Wales\u2019 boss, Robert Page. Not sure I\u2019d call losing at home to a team ranked 71 places below you a \u2018bump\u2019, but then again if I was in charge I\u2019d also want to downplay the result. \u201cWe\u2019ve put it to bed and full focus is on the challenge tomorrow evening and we\u2019ll all be ready for it. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term plan, we are in a transition; since the World Cup there have been some senior players who have left, big characters in the changing room. \u201cWe are going to have moments like we had the other night, it\u2019s about how we manage those defeats. \u201cGet both sides of our game right and we will be a force to be reckoned with, and we will be able to compete with top nations.\u201d Here\u2019s a run through of all the fixtures tonight. If you\u2019re keen to keep an eye on the England game (and you promise to come back here once you\u2019ve taken a glance), you can follow the action with Tim on other the MBM. Republic of Ireland v Gibraltar England v North Macedonia Turkey v Wales Northern Ireland v Kazakhstan France v Greece Three games have been completed already this evening with Armenia proving their victory over Wales was no one hit wonder. They\u2019ve just edged Latvia 2-1 to move ahead of Croatia into second place in Group D. Poor old San Marino got stuffed 6-0 by Finland to leave them winless at the bottom of Group H having conceded 13 goals in four games. The Finns are top now with three wins from four. Elsewhere, Ukraine squeezed past Malta 1-0 in England\u2019s group. Armenia 2-1 Latvia Finland 6-0 San Marino Ukraine 1-0 Malta And here\u2019s Turkey: Gunok, Celik, Demiral, Ozcan, Kokcu, Akturkoglou, Kadioglu, Under, Bardakci, Calhanoglu, Yilmaz. Subs: Sengezer, Cakir, Akaydin, Kahveci, Nayir, Elmali, Kabak, Yuksek, Ucan, Karaman, Guler, Ozkacar Only the most cynical Wales fans would have predicted the 4-2 reverse to Armenia and now a statement is needed against a handy Turkish side. Kieffer Moore is absent after being sent off on Friday and Ben Davies has stayed at home for the birth of his first child. That means Neco Williams slots in at left back with Joe Morrell joining the starting XI. Wales: Ward, N. Williams, C. Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Ampadu, Morrell, Ramsey, Johnson, D. James, Wilson. Subs: Hennessey, A. Davies, Fox, Low, Brooks, Harris, Cooper, James, Cabango, Bradshaw, Cullen, Broadhead. And here\u2019s the Kazakhstan team that will take on Northern Ireland: Kazakhstan: Shatskiy, Gabyshev, Bystrov, Marochkin, Alip, Vorogovskiy, Zainutdinov, Beysebekov, Tagybergen, Orazov, Samorodov. Subs: Shaizada, Ustimenko, Malyy, Kuat, Tapalov, Shvyrev, Astanov, Skvortsov, Kenessov, Aimbetov, Dosmagambetov, Yerlanov. Michael O\u2019Neill has hooked three of the players who started in the 1-0 defeat to Denmark on Friday. Craig Cathcart returns from injury and slots into a back three. Jordan Thompson provides width on the left and Dion Charles makes it a front two with Isaac Price up front. Ciaron Brown, Conor Bradley and Shayne Lavery all drop out. Hello folks and welcome to today\u2019s Clockwatch. We\u2019ve got a bunch of Euro qualifiers on the go with England, Wales and Northern Ireland all in action. My focus will be on Wales and Northern Ireland and both teams are in desperate need of a lift this evening. Wales were dismal against Albania on Friday, going down 4-2 after taking an early 1-0 lead against a team ranked 71 places below them. What\u2019s more, they ended the chaotic contest with 10 men after Kieffer Moore was shown his marching orders and their manager, Robert Page, will want a statement performance away to Turkey. So too will Northern Ireland boss, Michael O\u2019Niell, whose team succumbed to their second successive 1-0 reverse to a Scandinavian side when they went down to Denmark three nights ago. It doesn\u2019t get any easier as they host a Kazakhstan team that edged the Danes 3-2 last month. That all means that both teams are facing a stiff challenge to qualify for the continental showpiece in Germany next year. Wales are fourth in their group and Northern Ireland are fifth. Three points tonight is essential for both sides. My name is Daniel and I\u2019ll keep you company throughout. If you\u2019ve got a line you want to run past me and share with the group, please do get in touch."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319a6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/19/rashford-ignites-rout-by-southgates-england-at-their-most-merciless", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England enter era of Total Gazball with merciless measure of control | Jacob Steinberg", "lead": "With a resurgent Marcus Rashford on the left and Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield, England suffocated North Macedonia", "author": "Jacob Steinberg at Old Trafford", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 21:06:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174470", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/54baf718a66ffc2086237888383334b885208a8d/0_144_4320_2593/500.jpg", "body": "Over on the left, Marcus Rashford was busy softening North Macedonia up with his direct running and mazy dribbles. Further back, Declan Rice was holding his position in defensive midfield, maintaining his discipline and making sure to keep possession ticking over. Meanwhile Jordan Henderson was in ultra-pest mode, all boundless energy as he charged down every lost cause, a one-man pressing machine who appeared to be on a mission to prove that meaning can be found even in a facile mid-June Euro 2024 qualifier played on a Monday night in Manchester. This was England at their most merciless. There is a remorselessness to the way they squeeze lesser teams, control territory and shut down space now. It was as if they knew there would come a point when Trent Alexander-Arnold, revelling in his new midfield role, would be sweeping a wonderful first-time pass over a ragged North Macedonian defence and Bukayo Saka, cutting in from the right and letting fly with his left foot, would be making it 4-0 by crashing in a stunning shot from 25 yards. It would be five before long, Harry Kane sliding a rampant Saka through to complete his joyous hat-trick, and at that stage it was interesting to consider the difference between this England side and past, choked generations. After all there was a time when England would have panicked when, to the naked eye, it seemed they were struggling to break down limited but stubborn opposition. The passing would have been in unimaginative straight lines and the runs down the flanks would have been too predictable. Everything would have become angry and frustrated, and the night would have ended in another lament about England\u2019s technical failings. The danger was clear. England have come unstuck against Macedonia during previous qualifying campaigns, drawing at home with them in 2002 and 2006. Gareth Southgate had warned that Blagoja Milevski\u2019s side, who have triumphed away to Germany and Italy recently, were not to be taken lightly. In that context Southgate had to be satisfied with England\u2019s patience when the game was in the balance. There was no wasted energy, no loss of shape. England made sure not to force the issue and, with Alexander-Arnold\u2019s passing range allowing them to vary the angles of their attack, the sense was that they would pick the right time to go in for the kill. It was Rashford who provided the moment of ignition in the 29th minute. Handed a start on his home ground, this was a big game for the Manchester United forward. Much has been made of Rashford\u2019s repeated withdrawals from England camps. It meant he was under pressure to impress after starting on the bench during the 4-0 win in Malta last Friday. Southgate, after all, has more than enough options in attack. There was no room in this squad for Raheem Sterling \u2013 can he force his way back in? \u2013 and, with Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and James Maddison in reserve, Rashford could not afford to freeze. Yet it soon became clear that he was in the zone. Rashford terrified his markers every time he had the ball, but his part in the opener was a reminder that speed is far from his only asset. Instead, having repeatedly tried to go down the outside and reach the byline, he slowed down after taking a pass from Henderson and proceeded to open the visitors with a subtle touch, threading the ball through Stefan Ristovski\u2019s legs and sending Luke Shaw through to provide Kane with a simple chance. The floodgates opened after Kane\u2019s first goal of the night. Southgate must have loved it. The next 12 months are about evolution, about exploring the depth of the options at his disposal before the Euros. A 7-0 win after picking Rashford, Kane and Saka together for the first time was a good sign. So, too, was the way England went through the gears after going ahead. Soon Alexander-Arnold was popping up on the edge of the area and combining with Kyle Walker. Saka, who is fast becoming undroppable on the right, jinked inside and lashed in the second. It became a rout. Two minutes before half-time England produced something that may come to be known as Total Gazball, as Rashford played another pass down the left and Harry Maguire rumbled up from centre-back to create a chance. Moments later Henderson set up Rashford for the third. With Alexander-Arnold retrieving possession and growing more comfortable in midfield, England were devastating. Playing in between Rashford and Saka suited Kane, who kept dropping deep to pick out their runs. Yet England, who did not even have Jude Bellingham, were a multi-dimensional proposition. There was more trickery when Grealish and Foden came on in the second half. Southgate has so many ways of winning a game. It all starts with England\u2019s suffocating control."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319a7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/turkey-wales-euro-2024-qualifier-match-report", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wales hopes hang by a thread after Morrell sees red in Turkey defeat", "lead": "Goals from Umut Nayir and Arda Guler gave Turkey a 2-0 win against Wales, who had Joe Morrell sent off in the first half, in a Euro 2024 qualifier", "author": "Ben Fisher at Samsun Stadium", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 21:04:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174503", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/df24edd9cc8e1e3e6f5cb5e2a3a055329c8f68b5/384_123_3074_1844/500.jpg", "body": "After hanging in this game valiantly with 10 men for so long, for Wales how, in unforgiving surroundings, this quickly unravelled into another thoroughly demoralising evening. Turkey had a goal disallowed either side of Danny Ward superbly denying Hakan Calhanoglu from the penalty spot midway through the second half but the hosts eventually got on the scoreboard legitimately via a smart header by the substitute Umut Nayir on 72 minutes. Then came a second, courtesy of another substitute, a wonderful bending effort from 25 yards by Arda Guler, the highly-rated 18-year-old Fenerbahce forward. Suddenly, that was that. Other adjectives would probably spring to mind for Wales, who played more than 60 minutes with 10 men after Joe Morrell was given a straight red card. Ward looked like being the hero for Wales after keeping out Calhanoglu\u2019s spot-kick, awarded after Aaron Ramsey was harshly penalised for handball, low down to his right, but Turkey did not relent. Nayir, who had a goal disallowed for handball three minutes earlier, towered above Chris Mepham and his header was too powerful for Ward, whose right hand could not prevent the ball nestling in the corner after it kissed a post. At the halfway stage of this qualifying campaign, Wales are fourth in Group D, behind Turkey, who return top, Armenia and Croatia. Wales\u2019s hopes of reaching Euro 2024 look precarious at best, which is why their manager, Rob Page, admitted his team probably need to take maximum points from all four remaining games to have any hope of reaching Germany next summer. Wales travel to Latvia in September before hosting Croatia a month later. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win every game now to give ourselves a chance, that\u2019s got to be the mentality,\u201d the Wales manager said. \u201cIt has been a frustrating camp but there have been so many lessons to learn.\u201d Costly ones at that. Kieffer Moore missed this match through suspension after a petulant kick on the Armenia goalkeeper on Friday and Morrell was dismissed for a naive, high challenge on Turkey\u2019s lively left-back, Ferdi Kadioglu. Wales had to contend with a supercharged atmosphere and a partisan crowd made their feelings plain after Morrell caught the full-back. Turkey\u2019s substitutes poured from the bench into the technical area in tandem. Page sought a reaction from his squad but it was always an uphill task from that point. \u201cEven with 11 players it was going to be a big ask but before the sending-off I thought we matched them,\u201d he said. Wales\u2019s last trip to Turkey, in Istanbul for a 1998 World Cup qualifier 26 years ago, began with bricks being thrown at the team bus before the players emerged for the warmup protected by a blanket of riot shields and culminated in a topsy-turvy 6-4 defeat. Wales arrived in Samsun, on the Black Sea, having taken their fair share of pelters following an embarrassing defeat by Armenia, even if it was only their first defeat in a home European Championship qualifier for 12 years. Turkey understandably dominated possession but in the second half seemed weighed down by the pressure of the numerical advantage. There were, then, a few gasps among an increasingly restless home crowd as Wales went close to scoring a shock opener. Dan James skated upfield and was crudely taken out by Merih Demiral more than 35 yards from the Turkey goal. Harry Wilson stood over the ball and sent a superb left-foot free-kick arcing towards the top corner, only for Turkey\u2019s goalkeeper, Mert Gunok, to claw the ball to safety. Turkey jeered any time Wales got anywhere near their 18-yard area but all the drama came inside the Wales box. Calhanoglu failed to take advantage from the penalty spot and then Nayir\u2019s close-range finish was chalked off after another VAR review. At that point Wales could be forgiven for thinking they were going to secure an unlikely point against all odds, only for Nayir and Guler to ensure otherwise."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319a8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/crashed-800m-festival-fail-review-the-awful-tale-of-how-a-disappointing-justin-bieber-gig-led-to-a-missing-78m", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Crashed: $800m Festival Fail review \u2013 the awful tale of how a disappointing Justin Bieber gig led to a missing \u00a378m", "lead": "Weirdly lavish staff retreats, a genius founder and thousands of furious, overcharged customers.

WeCrashed, starring Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway, traced the rise and fall of WeWork (valued at at $47bn until it very suddenly wasn\u2019t). The Dropout put the boggling madness and eventual collapse of the healthcare company Theranos, built on hope, fraudulent data and the charisma of Elizabeth Holmes (now at the start of an 11-year prison term for defrauding investors), on fully illuminated display. The implosion of the ticketing platform Pollen was on a smaller scale \u2013 the company was valued just shy of $1bn at its height \u2013 but still worthy of note. The makers of the hour-long BBC Three documentary Crashed lay it all out neatly. Pollen was founded in 2014 by Callum and Liam Negus-Fancey (Callum, former employees interviewed for the programme agree, was a marketing genius and Liam was \u2026 his brother) and built on the innovative idea of creating networks of \u201cambassadors\u201d who would sell gig tickets to their friends and earn free ones for themselves in the process. It was a good idea and Pollen became a successful global brand. Things were going well \u2013 though some staff did wonder if the company retreats (\u201cwhen there was all this work to do\u201d) needed to be quite so frequent and lavish, even if the brothers believed that bonding was the key to creative collaborative work and productive employees. Then the pandemic hit. Rather than hunker down and wait for better times, as most of the entertainment and hospitality industry was doing, Pollen decided to diversify. They planned to put on events themselves, bundled with travel packages, so they would be ahead of the pack when Covid restrictions lifted. The first event went really well. The next \u2013 which promised a weekend in Las Vegas with Justin Bieber readily available to fans, but which apparently neglected to contract the singer into anything of the sort \u2013 did not. Bieber did an hour-long show before departing, leaving frontline staff deluged with thousands of calls from outraged customers demanding refunds. It was to become a familiar experience, as more and more events failed or were cancelled, and it became increasingly clear that the company was unable or unwilling to provide either the promised services or refunds. Suppliers, too, noticed that proofs of payment sent by Pollen did not result in actual payments nearly as often as they would like. Then there was a code malfunction that led to extra money taken from customers\u2019 accounts \u2013 coincidentally totalling the exact amount needed to meet that month\u2019s Pollen payroll \u2026 On and on it went until the wheels finally came off and the administrators were called in, to discover that the company owed about \u00a378m to various parties who were unlikely to recover what they were owed. Callum sent a breezy email to staff saying that he was sorry it hadn\u2019t worked out. When Emily, senior manager of paid social (Don\u2019t ask me what that is. I stopped acquiring new tech knowledge after email), who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer a month before her job and health insurance disappeared, was asked what she would say to Callum if she saw him now, she was clear. \u201cI would say: \u2018I want you to eat a bag of my shit.\u2019\u201d She has a delivery system worked out and everything. Although it has managed to secure what seems like fairly damning evidence of the company\u2019s rumoured mismanagement (at best) \u2013 including figures showing the extravagant expenses that continued to be racked up long after money was running short and exchanges about the code change that resulted in multiple payments taken from accounts \u2013 Crashed lacks any confrontation with the brothers or anyone else in a leadership role in the company, which leaves the viewer slightly underwhelmed and unsatisfied. No one interviewed \u2013 apart from Emily, and even her difficulties are largely glossed over \u2013 seems to have personally suffered much more than a few missed wage payments and a sense of betrayal by the boss who created an effective cult of personality. They are all young and able enough to have bounced back, and although Rosie, the former strategy and operations manager, mentions the losses (of rental apartments, mortgages and so on) of those further down the food chain, we do not hear directly from any of them. The programme takes no broader view of the startup phenomenon, the investor madness, the lack of expertise that seems so common and yet seems to take these people so far \u2013 or what it means for us all to live in an economy in which financiers seem so easily persuaded to pour their \u2013 ultimately, our \u2013 money into snake-oil sales. I suspect many more bags of shit need to be eaten. \u2022 Crashed: $800m Festival Fail aired on BBC Three and is available on BBC iPlayer."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319a9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/morning-mail-titanic-tourist-submarine-goes-missing-indigenous-plea-on-fracking-ashes-test-a-thriller", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Morning Mail: Titanic tourist submarine goes missing, Indigenous plea on fracking, Ashes Test a thriller", "lead": "Search for missing Titanic tourist sub with five on board; Northern Territory community in desperate fight to stop gas expansion", "author": "Martin Farrer", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:57:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174565", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ae56c204e01a57345c199d662c89b10e2a17be54/0_50_1500_900/500.jpg", "body": "Morning everyone. \u201cMy concern is water, the environment and our land.

This Euro 2024 qualifier was only in the 51st minute but the England winger had completed a stunning hat-trick and so why wait for the traditional post\u2011match ritual? The only problem for Saka \u2013 and North Macedonia \u2013 was that he had to hand it back. For a while, at least. The strange thing about this game was that England had rather laboured for the opening 29 minutes. It felt as if it could turn into one of those long nights. The way they set about the notion and dismantled it, together with the opposition, said everything about the poise and belief that Gareth Southgate has instilled. England refused to panic. They continued to push high, to pen back North Macedonia. And then they found the new angles, Harry Kane\u2019s opening goal the trigger for them to run riot \u2013 Saka especially. North Macedonia were reduced to wrecks and this, remember, was a team that had won away against Germany and, famously, Italy in qualification for the last World Cup. England were too quick, too assured and they accelerated smoothly to a fourth win of this campaign in four attempts, bringing the season to the most satisfying of conclusions. It was certainly a far cry from the end of the previous one. Hungary at Molineux, anyone? Saka was electric, his finishing lethal; the second surely one of the goals of his career. The pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold was eye\u2011catching enough, flighted first time up the inside right channel but what Saka did next took the breath. Everything was perfect, starting with the first touch, a caress inside with the outside of his left boot on the half volley, which threw his marker. The second was with his chest to set himself. Then, after a bounce and a pause, there was the screaming finish into the far corner from the edge of the area. It felt as though the crowd had most wanted to see Jack Grealish, who has plainly won even more hearts with his all-drinking, all\u2011dancing Manchester City treble-winning celebrations. His name drew the loudest pre-match cheer but he was only a substitute, coming on for Saka, embracing him as he did so, the game over. \u201cJack Grealish, he\u2019s still on the piss,\u201d chanted the fans, and there would be something from him \u2013 a cross that broke for another substitute, Kalvin Phillips, to make it 6-0 with his first England goal. There were eye-catching performances elsewhere. Marcus Rashford flickered early on and he scored the third. Kane added his second from the penalty spot for 7-0 \u2013 the prompt for Southgate to remove him; no hat-trick for the captain. Alexander\u2011Arnold was again polished as the right-sided No 8 after his excellent performance there in the 4-0 win against Malta on Friday. Saka, though, was the undoubted star. Rashford was in the mood to run at his markers, to try his tricks and body swerves, but it was a short pass from him that opened up North Macedonia for the breakthrough. The player that he exposed was the visiting captain, Stefan Ristovski who, moments earlier, had returned to the pitch after lengthy treatment to fix a bloody head wound \u2013 the result of a shuddering aerial collision with Kane. Ristovski was dizzied further when Rashford fizzed a pass through his legs for Luke Shaw, who had burst up the inside left into the area. Southgate had needed a solution to prise open North Macedonia. Here it was. Shaw crossed low and, when the ball deflected slightly off Ezgjan Alioski, Kane was well placed to finish. North Macedonia had held their own. Now England turned the screw. Ruthlessly. It has been the longest of seasons but how Southgate\u2019s players put it in until the last. The second goal had echoes of the first, England interchanging slickly on the other flank to create a space in the area for Saka, the quick low pass inside coming from Kyle Walker. Saka had gone back to Alexander-Arnold, who moved it wide to Walker. Saka slammed his shot high into the roof of the net from an angle that was not entirely kind. Suddenly England were rampant. Jordan Henderson had gone close at 1-0. Now Rashford played a one-two with Harry Maguire inside the area only to shoot too close to Stole Dimitrievski. Rashford would not be denied. It was Kane who won the ball high up, intercepting a pass from Ristovski that was meant for Darko Velkovski and turning it inside for Henderson. He pulled back; Rashford did the rest. North Macedonia needed to shake their heads clear at half-time. And yet the punches continued to come their way upon the restart, Saka following his masterpiece with a neat low finish, which never looked in doubt from the moment that Kane released him. Kane\u2019s penalty would be awarded for a pull on John Stones by the North Macedonia substitute, Egzon Bejtulai, as he attacked an Alexander-Arnold corner, and it seemed out of mercy that the referee, Istvan Kovacs, blew for full-time bang on 90 minutes. All that remained was for Saka to locate the ball. This time it was for keeps."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ab", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/19/juneteenth-commemoration-celebrations-reflection-us", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Americans mark Juneteenth with celebrations, parades and reflection", "lead": "US\u2019s newest federal holiday commemorates emancipation of last enslaved people after civil war", "author": "Guardian staff and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:35:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174627", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c077710c15c5c358743e895ffb41a90243e80550/0_144_4320_2592/500.jpg", "body": "Americans across the country celebrated Juneteenth, marking the relatively new national holiday on 19 June with cookouts, parades and other gatherings as they commemorated the end of slavery after the civil war. While many have treated the long holiday weekend as a reason for a party, others urged quiet reflection on America\u2019s often violent and oppressive treatment of its Black citizens. And still others have remarked at the strangeness of celebrating a federal holiday marking the end of slavery in the nation while many conservative leaders are trying to stop parts of that history from being taught in public schools. Monday\u2019s federal holiday commemorated the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed \u2013 two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued during the bloody civil war. On Juneteenth weekend, a Roman Catholic church in Detroit devoted its service to urging parishioners to take a deeper look at the lessons from the holiday. \u201cIn order to have justice we must work for peace. And in order to have peace we must work for justice,\u201d John Thorne, executive director of the Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance, said to the congregation at Gesu Catholic Church in Detroit. Standing before paintings of a Black Jesus and Mary, Thorne said Juneteenth is a day of celebration, but it also \u201chas to be much more\u201d. It was important to speak about Juneteenth during Sunday mass, the Rev Lorn Snow told a reporter as the service was ending. \u201cThe struggle\u2019s still not over with. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done,\u201d he said. Most Black Americans agree, according to a recent poll. A full 70% of Black adults queried in a AP-NORC poll said \u201ca lot\u201d needs to be done to achieve equal treatment for African Americans in policing. And Black Americans suffer from significantly worse health outcomes than their white peers across a variety of measures, including rates of maternal mortality, asthma, high blood pressure and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Other events to mark the holiday included a CNN special where Vice-President Kamala Harris was scheduled to appear, along with with musical guests including Miguel and Charlie Wilson. Although end-of-slavery celebrations are new in many parts of the country, in Memphis, where the slave trade once thrived, the Juneteenth holiday has been celebrated since long before it became a designated federal holiday in 2021. Events there include a multi-day festival including food, music, arts and crafts, and cultural exhibitions in a tree-lined park in the city\u2019s medical district. Memphis is home to the National Civil Rights Museum located at the site of the old Lorraine Motel, the former Black-owned hotel where the civil rights leader the Rev Martin Luther King Jr was killed in 1968. Ryan Jones, the museum\u2019s associate curator, said Juneteenth should be celebrated in the US with the same emphasis that the Fourth of July receives as Independence Day. \u201cIt is the independence of a people that were forced to endure oppression and discrimination based on the color of their skin,\u201d Jones said. The Juneteenth holiday, Jones said, should also be viewed as more than a day when people attend parties and cookouts. In fact, he said, it is a time to reflect on the past. \u201cIt acknowledges the sacrifices of those early civil rights veterans between World War I and World War II, and of course in the modern society, the protests, the demonstrations, the non-violence, the marches,\u201d Jones said. In New York, a hybrid event in Central Park on Monday celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop, with an emphasis on the local Black\u2019s community\u2019s impact on the genre. As Americans gathered to mark the holiday, at least one event was marked by violence. In the Chicago suburb of Willowbrook, Illinois, on Saturday night, one person was killed and 22 were injured in a shooting where hundreds had gathered for a Juneteenth celebration."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/19/rory-mcilroy-must-keep-the-faith-it-is-only-a-matter-of-time-before-he-earns-his-fifth-major-golf", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rory McIlroy must keep the faith, his next major title is just a matter of time | Ewan Murray", "lead": "All evidence suggests the Northern Irishman is close to winning another major \u2013 he just needs to believe it himself", "author": "Ewan Murray", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:21:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174659", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/03831e1404e34937578616355ba4bb39e236f6a5/0_46_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Rory McIlroy spent much of 2013 in professional turmoil.

He admitted last week to watching YouTube videos of the Open of nine years ago, where the range of shot-making has taken a now 34\u2011year\u2011old McIlroy by surprise. It seems preposterous that Rory McIlroy may have to convince Rory McIlroy how good he is but we are living in the weirdest of golfing times. This should not be about what he was. Instead, what he is and can be. McIlroy departed Los Angeles and the 123rd US Open while still unable to scratch his itch. The wait for major No 5, which would place him alongside Seve Ballesteros \u2013 or, more contemporaneously, Brooks Koepka \u2013 goes on. McIlroy could never admit it, but losing out to Wyndham Clark, an individual only seasoned golf fans could pick from a lineup, can only add to his sense of frustration. Falling short to Scottie Scheffler would have been easier to swallow. Koepka, the US PGA champion, started US Open week rather sneering at those in his competitive domain who let external factors impinge upon their golf. This was a supposedly superior approach to McIlroy, who purposely avoided pre\u2011tournament media duties in a deliberate bid to avoid the Saudi Arabian elephant in the room. Koepka, who later did not hide his disdain for the LA Country Club course, finished in a tie for 17th. Cliches have already appeared in abundance: McIlroy bottled it, McIlroy lacks the X factor of his youth, McIlroy will stagnate on four majors (hardly a total to be sniffed at, if not the point) forever. The theories are invalid. For some reason, McIlroy\u2019s failure to win on demand seems to spark venomous anger among those who should admire him. All evidence suggests McIlroy is closer to sealing a quintet of majors than ever before. When that happens, it would also be wise to bank on floodgates opening. With a psychological weight off his mind, McIlroy can enter a new and prosperous phase in his career. McIlroy likened Sunday at the LA Country Club to the same day at St Andrews when the Open passed him by last July. There was one key similarity; McIlroy\u2019s putter refused to behave. Yet his demeanour during round four in California was in complete contrast to Fife. On Open Sunday, he looked tight and tense. On US Open Sunday, so much of his golf and strategy was first class. It is important to note he could not directly affect Clark, who was playing in the group behind alongside a stumbling Rickie Fowler. When Fowler hit a career low, he was 185th in the world. It is seen as an emergency if McIlroy slides outside the top five. The Northern Irishman finds himself on the wrong side of tiny margins. Putts for birdie at the 2nd, 9th and 10th holes on Sunday could easily have dropped. That the ball stayed above ground on each occasion meant aberrations \u2013 and there were only two of them, at the 8th and 14th \u2013 were amplified. It is easy to overanalyse McIlroy but the difference between a 68, which would have won him a second US Open, and the 70 he signed for was incredibly marginal. He is not a poor putter but he can be a streaky one. He did not \u201cbottle\u201d the opportunity of victory because he was never in control of the tournament during an engaging final day. There have been times during this run when it may have looked as if McIlroy\u2019s major run was over. In 2021, for example, his results in golf\u2019s marquee four events were: missed cut, tied 49th, tied seventh, tied 46th. Last year, conversely, his worst outcome in the same set of events was eighth. An early exit from the Masters in April was an undoubted blow but McIlroy responded, when not playing particularly well, with a share of seventh at the US PGA. When his brush with glory in Los Angeles is factored in, it is clear this is a golfer trending in the right direction rather than one for whom we should all be fearful. With the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund promising to live happily ever after, McIlroy can also apply a single-mindedness to his golf that has possibly been missing during golf\u2019s civil war. McIlroy rails against any sense golf would ever owe him one. He dismisses notions about what is written in the stars. Point out that he was born with a God\u2011given, exceptional talent and he will offer counterpoints about sacrifices made to let him realise his dreams. McIlroy works far harder than for which he is widely given credit. It can be guaranteed he will believe he has to earn major No 5, rather than it landing on his lap because someone in the great clubhouse in the sky believes he has paid his dues. Still, any other golfer delivering the consistent level of optimum performance associated with McIlroy would be regarded as an inevitable major champion. And soon. He must keep the faith. McIlroy should not require YouTube to realise just what he can accomplish and, surely, will do soon. Only a fool would write him off at this juncture."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ad", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/hamish-harding-the-british-explorer-missing-at-sea-near-the-titanic", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hamish Harding: the British explorer missing at sea near the Titanic", "lead": "The adventurer is, among other things, an aviator, skydiver and astronaut, and once took Buzz Aldrin to the south pole", "author": "Tom Ambrose", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:01:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174685", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a4e3399a2ae9411a48a07b9f41ead222795c516f/0_150_1268_761/500.jpg", "body": "A British adventurer is among those aboard a submarine which has gone missing near the wreckage of the Titanic. Hamish Harding, 58, is understood to be aboard the five-person OceanGate Expeditions vessel, which was reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Harding is the chair of the private plane firm Action Aviation. His wife is called Linda, and he has two sons named Rory and Giles, as well as a stepdaughter named Lauren and a stepson, Brian Szasz. As a student, he left Cambridge with a degree in natural sciences and chemical engineering. Harding is an aviator, holding an airline transport pilot\u2019s licence and business jet type ratings, including the Gulfstream G650. He is also a skydiver, was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2022, and is a trustee of the Explorers Club. He also previously worked with the Antarctic VIP tourism company White Desert to introduce the first regular business jet service to Antarctica. Harding has made many trips to the south pole and, in 2016, accompanied Buzz Aldrin, who became the oldest person to reach the south pole at 86. He also went into space last year with Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin company. Harding is the current holder of three Guinness world records, relating to his work as an adventurer. In 2019, he was commended for the fastest circumnavigation of the Earth via both poles. As part of a crew of eight astronauts and aviators in a Qatar executive Gulfstream G650ER ultra-long-range business jet, Harding led the mission to mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. He achieved the feat in 46 hours, 40 minutes and 22 seconds. In 2021, he achieved the greatest distance covered at full ocean depth and the greatest duration spent at full ocean depth. Alongside Victor Vescovo, Harding dove in a two-man submarine to the lowest point in the world\u2019s oceans, the deepest point of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep \u2013 a depth of about 36,000 ft. The 13-hour underwater mission was also the longest duration spent at full ocean depth (four hours and 15 minutes) and the longest distance traversed at full ocean depth (4.6 km). On social media at the weekend, Harding said he was \u201cproud to finally announce\u201d that he would be aboard the mission to the wreck of the Titanic \u2013 but added that due to the \u201cworst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023\u201d. He added: \u201cA weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/stuart-broad-says-england-are-massively-inspired-by-spirit-of-2005", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Stuart Broad claims England are \u2018massively inspired\u2019 by spirit of 2005", "lead": "Stuart Broad described the first Test as \u2018cricket on a knife edge\u2019 as Australia head into day five needing 174 runs to win with seven wickets remaining", "author": "Simon Burnton at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 19:57:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174725", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c689b0fc95af86bde06ed4d1ae602ec8cdc8f2a5/0_267_4000_2399/500.jpg", "body": "Stuart Broad described the situation as \u201ccricket on a knife edge\u201d as Australia head into the final day of the first Ashes Test needing 174 runs to win, with England seeking seven more wickets to stop them. Broad said the home side were motivated by the spirit of 2005, when England won a thriller at Edgbaston by two runs after setting their opponents a target of 282, just one more than they are chasing on this occasion. Highlights of that game were shown on television \u2013 and closely followed in the England dressing room \u2013 during a rain break on Sunday. \u201cYou can tell this group is massively inspired and motivated by that series,\u201d Broad said. \u201cWe were all watching that [at the time] and wanting to play Ashes cricket, and to have this series being talked about in the same sentence gives us a huge boost.\u201d Australia\u2019s openers, Usman Khawaja and David Warner, calmly put on 61 runs before Warner fell to Ollie Robinson, with both Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith dismissed by Broad soon afterwards. Broad said he \u201cloved every second of that last hour, running in hearing that roar\u201d, though it was less well received in the other dressing room. \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t our greatest 40 minutes but I\u2019m backing our boys,\u201d Nathan Lyon said. \u201cI\u2019m confident our boys can go out there and bat well but it\u2019s set up to be a thrilling Test match, and it\u2019s been one hell of a way to start the series.\u201d Broad described Australia\u2019s target of 281 as \u201calmost the perfect number\u201d, which means \u201cboth teams really fancy their chances\u201d and Australia\u2019s optimism will lead to wicket\u2011taking opportunities. \u201cOn pitches like this you need a batter to be positive,\u201d Broad said. \u201cIf a draw was on the cards and someone decided to block every single ball I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get them out. You need a team to play a couple of shots to create chances.\u201d With the pitch offering a bit of turn the fitness of Moeen Ali could be crucial. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bit of a gouge out of his finger but he\u2019s doing as much as he can to heal that and deal with the pain,\u201d Broad said.

You\u2019d have thought that wild horses wouldn\u2019t have kept Rishi Sunak away from the Commons for the debate on the privileges committee report on Boris Johnson. After all, Sunak had promised when he took office in October last year that he would govern with integrity, accountability and professionalism. And since then we\u2019ve all been waiting for a sign. The smallest nod that he had meant what he said. And here was the perfect opportunity. The most binary choice imaginable. Boris Johnson had been definitively found to have lied and lied and lied again. To parliament. To the country. To just about everyone he had ever met. Lying is what he does. What he always has done. Quite why it took so many MPs so long to realise what had been blindingly obvious to some of us for years and years is another question. But hey! They got there in the end. Just rejoice at that. So Rish! had the simplest of tasks to establish his moral credibility. Just turn up to parliament and vote to accept the report\u2019s findings. Of a committee parliament had elected with a Conservative majority. He didn\u2019t even have to speak. How difficult was that? This could have been integrity in action. A physical recognition that a proven liar was a proven liar. The sort of thing that barely requires the memory of a conscience. And Rish! is an honourable man. Hell, he\u2019s told us so often enough. Only come the big day, there was no sign of Sunak. Yet again, when push comes to shove, he had gone missing in action. The first sign of his impending cowardice came when he phoned Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday morning to assure him that nothing had changed since last week and that the UK was still fully behind Ukraine. A sure sign the prime minister was desperate to look busy. He always calls Zelenskiy when he\u2019s feeling guilty. Next we were told Rish! just had to meet the Swedish prime minister in the afternoon. Even though he couldn\u2019t remember who the Swedish prime minister was or why he had to see him. Maybe he could invent an imaginary trade deal that no one was going to agree. Just as long as the meeting took place some time late in the afternoon. Then there was the evening speech to a charity. That had taken some arranging. A global email to all organisations to see if anyone wanted a prime minister to talk to them that evening. And he wasn\u2019t even going to charge for it. The deal of the century. There had been only the one taker. But one was all he needed. His diary was officially full. It had taken some ingenuity. That just left a bit of time to have a pedicure and take the dog to the groomer\u2019s. Essential government business. And that was the last we saw of honesty, integrity and accountability. Sunak had failed at the lowest possible hurdle. There would have been some virtue if he had been able to tell the truth. That he was doing everything possible to stay away because he was too timid to risk upsetting Johnson and his supporters. But they are too few on the ground for Johnson to risk mobilising in case anyone noticed his sinking popularity. Just Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nadine Dorries and a few other losers. But Rish! couldn\u2019t even manage that. In his desperation to remain invisible, he had been seen by everyone for what he was. A fraud. A man too weak to stand up for himself against Johnson. Rish! wasn\u2019t the only one to go missing in action. Michael Gove had retreated to his department\u2019s roof, trying to square his lack of backbone with his imagined virtue. Something only drugs can achieve. Jeremy Hunt was nowhere to be seen. He never is these days. Not even Suella Braverman could be bothered to hang around and she had just given a ministerial statement in the previous business. So the government frontbench consisted of just Penny Mordaunt. Someone had to do it, but she did it with style. She accepted the committee, she accepted the report and would vote for it. She also took a swipe at Johnson\u2019s dishonourable honours list. Much of the rest of the debate quickly fell into a pattern. Opposition MPs \u2013 including Harriet Harman, the privileges committee chair \u2013 forensically went through Johnson\u2019s history of lying. The contempt for parliament. Worse still, the contempt for the country. People had obeyed the rules, relatives had died alone. Johnson not so much. It would be hard to think of a worse prime minister in living memory. Or at all. The Tory benches were sparsely populated. It wasn\u2019t just Rish! that was running scared. Not even Andy Carter, Bernard Jenkin and Alberto Costa \u2013 three of the Conservative members of the committee \u2013 could be bothered to show their faces. But some, like Theresa May, were vocal in their support for the committee. Not so long ago she was a deadbeat prime minister. Now she sounds like a parliamentary colossus. We live in desperate times. Johnson wasn\u2019t totally bereft of support. Rees-Mogg attacked Harman\u2019s bias \u2013 something she convincingly refuted \u2013 while Lia Nici was positively deranged. She said that she had been a parliamentary private secretary to Boris which made her a neutral in the game. And she was adamant there hadn\u2019t been any parties because Johnson had assured her of this. But at least there was an honesty to Rees-Mogg and Nici. They were wrong but they were prepared to defend their man in their speeches, even if they didn\u2019t follow through by voting against the report. Not so all those other Tories who were going to abstain. They knew Johnson was lying but couldn\u2019t bring themselves to act on it or speak out on his behalf. Labour was determined to flush them out. To force a vote. Come the next election their shame should not be forgotten. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2023 to remove wording indicating that Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lia Nici had voted against the committee\u2019s report; in fact both abstained."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319b0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/marcus-rashford-close-to-agreeing-new-contract-at-manchester-united", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Marcus Rashford close to agreeing new contract at Manchester United ", "lead": "Manchester United are on the verge of reaching an agreement with Marcus Rashford over new long term deal, with the England forward expected to become one of the club\u2019s highest earner", "author": "Fabrizio Romano and Ed Aarons", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 19:43:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174790", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ce8f66d2256ac8b562e450835c22f87f47cbeaac/0_166_4982_2989/500.jpg", "body": "Manchester United are on the verge of reaching an agreement with Marcus Rashford over new long-term deal, with the England forward expected to become one of the club\u2019s highest earners.

Legalise Cannabis says it is the first time the same bill has been introduced across three states on the same day. The reform, which would allow adults to possess and grow small quantities of cannabis at home, is similar to ACT\u2019s model that came into effect in 2020. Rachel Payne, a Victorian Legalise Cannabis MP, said the bill encouraged state governments to be on the \u201cthe right side of history when it comes to cannabis law reform\u201d. She said longstanding prohibition meant Australians were criminalised for consuming cannabis, which was particularly prevalent among First Nations people, who are over-represented in the criminal justice system. \u201cThese laws are currently causing real harm and we should as a society come together to prevent any further harm,\u201d she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Legalise Cannabis NSW MP Jeremy Buckingham said the party wanted consistency on cannabis across Australia to ensure there was a national debate about responsible use of the drug. \u201cAt the moment each state has a set of laws that are being deregulated \u2013 that\u2019s the trajectory of cannabis law reform. But in a very ad hoc way,\u201d he said. Buckingham said he believed cannabis law reform was inevitable in NSW. He pointed to previous commentary by the NSW premier, Chris Minns, who while in opposition argued for the legalisation of cannabis in 2019. Minns ruled out decriminalisation in the lead-up to the March state election. Payne, Buckingham and Legalise Cannabis WA MP Dr Brian Walker will introduce the bill in their respective parliaments on Tuesday. The party calls for states to amend existing legislation to make it legal for adults to possess small quantities of cannabis for personal use and cultivate a maximum of six cannabis plants for personal use. Titled \u201cRegulation of Personal Adult Use of Cannabis Bill 2023\u201d, the bill would also allow an adult who is lawfully in possession of cannabis to gift the drug to another adult. It would not allow people aged under 18 to access the drug and would make no changes to the offence of selling cannabis. The reform is similar to the ACT\u2019s reforms that came into effect in 2020. Under the territory\u2019s legislation, an adult can lawfully possess up to 50g of dried cannabis or up to 150g of fresh cannabis, grow up to two cannabis plants per person (a maximum of four plants per household) and use cannabis in a household. Payne pointed to a recent study that concluded there was no evidence that cannabis use had a significant effect on the incidence of psychosis for people at high risk of it. The authors of that report, published in the Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience journal, noted their findings were not consistent with epidemiological data linking cannabis use to an increased risk of developing psychosis. The researchers said they could not exclude the possibility that an association between cannabis use and transition to psychosis might have been evident if the follow-up period had been longer than two years. But they said most transitions to psychosis occurred within the two-year timeframe. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has previously said he has no plans to legalise marijuana beyond medical use, saying drug-induced psychosis was a \u201csignificant\u201d issue for some in the community."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319b2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/19/jonny-bairstow-wicketkeeper-england-australia-first-ashes-test", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bairstow is Bazball\u2019s spirit animal but maybe it\u2019s time for the gloves to come off | Barney Ronay", "lead": "Even if they win this first Test, England have a tender spot at wicketkeeper.

And of course it wasn\u2019t about the catches, walloped into the gloves with a deliciously grizzled bat. This was all about the hugs, the words in the ear, the million\u2011dollar smile, the sense of voodoo, bro\u2011vibes, man\u2011feelings. Bairstow laughed and leaned in close, feeling the good stuff. And from a distance it felt like something a little targeted and forensic, emergency mid-game repairs to a tender spot in this team. Because whatever happens on the final day of this relentlessly gripping Test it is probably also time to talk about Jonny. Although, not in a way where anyone has to feel bad. Certainly his place in this team is utterly nailed down. Bairstow is the spirit animal of Bazball, and not just for the dam-burst of adrenal, biceps\u2011flexing runs over the past year; the rage-hundreds; the way his bat slaps through the ball like a man gleefully demolishing a stud wall with a polo mallet. Bairstow is 34 this year. It feels these days that his brilliance comes from a place of scars already acquired, of mid-series droppings and points proved. This is very much the Bazball emotional landscape, a sense of something that feels like a balm to the bruises of the sport. This is not the cricket of some cloudless crop of young guns, more a middle\u2011aged catharsis, out there in their Spiderman suits, hitting sixes off Tower Bridge. To great effect, too. England have played with wonderful verve and skill for four days of this game, have co-curated a sensational Test, and now look like they might just go and win it. And of course the way they play is by its nature messy, ragged at the edges, a departure from the old, punishing ideal of the perfect performance, of only clean orderly lines. If England play most of the time like a group of men in a raging hurry to get to a round of golf, then this is in part because they are. But it is also about not seeing those joins, accepting the flaws, seeing only additions and not subtractions. There is a limit to these things, however. And that tender spot was there again 15 minutes after those warmups as Usman Khawaja played half a shot to a ball from Jimmy Anderson, edging low and hard between Bairstow and first slip. It was a wicketkeeper\u2019s catch, if only on the principle that, basically, you\u2019re standing there with a massive pair of gloves and it is your job. It would have been a brilliant catch. But that is no excuse. The England Test team should expect to field a brilliant wicketkeeper. Instead Bairstow didn\u2019t move, watching the ball fizz past. And in that moment the total ticked up to five missed opportunities, with two missed stumpings and two edges grassed in the first innings. It is tempting to make excuses for Bairstow here. He is just back from serious injury (and a bizarre leg-break incident while playing golf is in itself deeply Bazball). He has also kept in two first\u2011class matches for Yorkshire plus the Ireland Test. This isn\u2019t a Moeen\u2011style mates-pick. There had been some unhappiness at his selection ahead of Ben Foakes. But then the world of marginal cricket picks is, like everything else, shot through with wildly enraged binary voices. For a while there seemed to be a genuine conviction that to pick Bairstow ahead of the deserving Foakes was to back cronyism, elitist schooling, Matt Hancock jogging in a Vodafone shirt and so on. The reality is it made sense as a choice. On his record Bairstow at seven and taking the gloves is a serious plus in any team. Is it still? Even if they go on to win this match, England\u2019s governance regime will face a test of the true nature of its fluidity. The fact is Bairstow has kept below his level, has looked heavier, slower on his feet. Bazball is fraternal, trust-based, non-punitive. But if it really is not just about throwing the rulebook out of the window, but not having a rulebook in the first place, not even having a window, then it would be progressive, not regressive, to bring Foakes into this team. He is, after all, a grand talent with the gloves, and England are all about backing talent. The numbers also suggest Bairstow\u2019s most effective role is still as a plain old high-class No 5, where he averages 44 with four hundreds. Who knows, taking the gloves might have the side benefit of making him cross \u2013 and angry Jonny is always the best Jonny, to the extent the England and Wales Cricket Board might want to look into hiring a shadow media team to constantly question his place in the team just to keep him on a rolling boil. England may well go on to win this game. But there have been errors too and a little slackness in places. What happens at Lord\u2019s will test the boundaries of how ruthless this regime can allow itself to be."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319b3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/mysterious-pile-of-dumped-ppe-angers-people-in-calmore-new-forest-hampshire", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mysterious pile of \u2018dumped\u2019 PPE angers people in New Forest", "lead": "Inquiry launched by Environment Agency into huge pile of medical aprons found in Calmore, Hampshire", "author": "Emine Sinmaz", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 19:00:37", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174893", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/15539605c634edd5b26265c9a176714b3f2e5f30/0_174_5264_3158/500.jpg", "body": "The \u201cdumping\u201d of hundreds of thousands of pieces of unused personal protective equipment near a nature reserve on the edge of the New Forest has mystified and angered local people. But the council has revealed the giant pile of boxes containing medical aprons in Calmore, Hampshire, will be recycled into plastic bags. Councillors said they reacted with horror after the discovery was made public at a Hampshire county council (HCC) meeting last week. It is not yet known if the items are linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the council has asked the Environment Agency to investigate. The large-scale discovery in Calmore, near Testwood Lakes Nature Reserve, came after an investigation by New Forest District Council (NFDC) into use of land at Little Testwood Farm Caravan Park. A report from HCC\u2019s regulatory committee said: \u201cIt became apparent that thousands of packs of medical aprons had been dumped on the land with no obvious signs that they were being protected or stored for some future use. The concern is that they have been dumped with no intention of removal to a proper facility. \u201cThe Environment Agency have been contacted to see if they can determine where the PPE originated and whether it was discarded by a health trust as substandard during the Covid procurement.\u201d Councillor Peter Latham, the committee chair, said: \u201cIt was a surprise, to put it mildly \u2013 a reaction of horror \u2013 that something like that could have happened in Hampshire and nobody knew about it.\u201d Councillor Neville Penman said: \u201cI\u2019m totally amazed at how much has been dumped. I just can\u2019t believe it because somebody must have seen it being put there, but I\u2019ve never seen so much waste in all my life \u2026 To be honest with you, I\u2019m distraught over it.\u201d A report last year revealed that protective clothing worth \u00a34bn bought early in the pandemic was set to be burned because it was substandard. The Commons public accounts committee\u2019s report said the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had so much unneeded PPE that it had appointed two commercial waste firms to help it dispose of 15,000 pallets a month \u201cvia a combination of recycling and burning to generate power\u201d. On Monday, thousands of boxes \u2013 some labelled \u201capron\u201d and \u201cmade in China\u201d \u2013 containing more than 100 units apiece remained piled on pallets near the caravan park. People living near the site said they did not see the pallets being unloaded and did not know how long they had been there for. But one man who lives in the caravan park said he was shocked by the amount of waste. The man, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just a load of crap dumped there. Taxpayers\u2019 money just dumped there. I\u2019m shocked.\u201d A nurse who lives nearby added: \u201cI am surprised because I work as a nurse and I know during the pandemic how we didn\u2019t have enough PPE and how difficult it was to find it. It\u2019s shocking to find out some has been dumped here.\u201d A NFDC spokesperson said the discovery was made after an inspection at the caravan park on 4 April. \u201cThis inspection revealed that a large quantity of PPE was being stored on the land in contravention of the caravan site licence conditions. The council, in its licensing capacity, has requested that the stored items be removed from the land,\u201d they added. \u201cSubsequent inspections have been carried out by Hampshire county council and The Environment Agency. All the material is packaged and palletized and is due to be removed from the site for processing and recycling into plastic bags over the coming weeks. The Environment Agency will continue to carry out further enquires as to source of the material and how it came to be present on the land.\u201d An inspector from The Environment Agency was seen taking samples of the equipment on Monday. A spokesperson added: \u201cWhile any investigation is ongoing, we are unable to comment further in order to not prejudice any investigations or subsequent enforcement decisions.\u201d HCC confirmed it was working with the agency to investigate."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319b4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/20/miles-franklin-award-2023-shortlist-revealed-australia-literary-prize", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Miles Franklin award 2023: shortlist revealed for Australia\u2019s prestigious literary prize", "lead": "Five first-time nominees are among the six authors competing for $60,000 award for novels that \u2018present Australian life in any of its phases\u2019", "author": "Michael Sun", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 19:00:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174933", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0055fdaa8fafd7d6552678be1ee705256878df39/0_27_960_576/500.jpg", "body": "Five first-time nominees \u2013 including a debut novelist \u2013 are among the six authors shortlisted for the 2023 Miles Franklin award, Australia\u2019s highest literary honour. Announced on Tuesday, the six books up for the $60,000 prize are Jessica Au\u2019s Cold Enough for Snow, Robbie Arnott\u2019s Limberlost, Yumna Kassab\u2019s The Lovers, Fiona Kelly McGregor\u2019s Iris, Shankari Chandran\u2019s Chai Time at the Cinnamon Gardens and Kgshak Akec\u2019s Hopeless Kingdom. First awarded in 1957, the Miles Franklin is given to a novel \u201cof the highest literary merit which presents Australian life in any of its phases\u201d. The slipperiness of time is a core theme in each of the books. All six works on the shortlist \u201cdelve deeply into the archives and memory\u201d, the judges observed in a joint statement. Robbie Arnott is the only author who has been previously nominated, for his 2020 book The Rain Heron, an ecological fable about a shape-shifting bird. His latest novel Limberlost shares his previous work\u2019s mythic overtones, following a 15-year-old boy over one summer in midcentury Tasmania. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A similar meditative quality permeates Jessica Au\u2019s Cold Enough For Snow, which won both the $100,000 Victorian prize for literature and the $25,000 fiction category at the Victorian premier\u2019s literary awards earlier this year and was the inaugural winner of the Novel prize, which guarantees publication in the UK, Ireland, US, Australia and New Zealand. Au\u2019s novella is a sparse, wintry tale of a mother and daughter\u2019s brief visit to Japan, on a trip in which the daughter attempts to connect with her mother, with whom she has a fragile relationship. Fiona Kelly McGregor has been nominated for her fourth book, Iris, a historical novel set in 1930s Sydney. Longlisted for the Stella prize, it follows the real-life figure Iris Webber, a lifelong miscreant and petty criminal. The novel \u201crehabilitates a once notorious denizen of the lower order,\u201d the judges wrote, \u201cadmiring of the intelligence required for her to survive there\u201d. Twenty-six-year-old South Sudanese writer Kgshak Akec has made the shortlist with her \u201cimpressive and expansive debut\u201d, Hopeless Kingdom, which draws from Akec\u2019s experience to tell the story of an eight-year-old girl and her mother as they migrate from country to country before arriving in Geelong. The judges praised it as a \u201cnovel of national significance\u201d. Western Sydney author Yumna Kassab is nominated for her third novel, The Lovers, which mirrors the cadences of folklore to explore a couple\u2019s relationship, which has been challenged by cultural and class barriers. And rounding out the shortlist is Shankari Chandran\u2019s third novel Chai Time at Cinnamon Gardens, following a diverse group of elderly Australians who live in a nursing home. Interspersed with flashbacks to the Sri Lankan civil war, Chandran\u2019s novel deals with the \u201cunaddressed trauma of the past\u201d, said judges. \u201cIt treads carefully on contested historical claims, reminding us that horrors forgotten are horrors bound to be repeated.\u201d This year\u2019s Miles Franklin judging panel is chaired by Richard Neville, the Mitchell Librarian at the State Library of New South Wales and also features literary critics Bernadette Brennan and James Ley, literary scholar Mridula Nath Chakraborty and author and editor Elfie Shiosaki.

First it was in the face of Joe Root\u2019s early onslaught, one that would have been withering not just for its rate of scoring but the cheerfully insouciant air with which it was carried out. England had piled on 49 runs in 39 balls before Cummins produced magic, the quintessential booming yorker that swung in at Vin Diesel pace and demolished Ollie Pope\u2019s off stump. Root carried on with Harry Brook, at times making Cummins rejig the field every few balls, while also bowling a seven-over spell to start the day. Despite Brook laying into Nathan Lyon, Cummins backed his spinner and kept enough fielders up, letting Lyon dislodge both batters for 46 each. So far so good, an on-field reflection of his pre-match words when asked about keeping cool if England reached the boil: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some moments of tension for everyone, which is exciting. You hopefully have a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and at times you just go on your gut. There\u2019s going to be high pressure moments but you wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else but out there in the middle of it.\u201d He was in the middle constantly, as England kept swinging. And when he resumed bowling after lunch, he struck, some brilliance from around the wicket to nail Ben Stokes on the pad. England\u2019s talisman of attacking cricket followed the exit of Jonny Bairstow, another for Lyon. England led by 217 with only the bottom four to hand. That\u2019s where things went awry. Captaincy is a hard game, routinely judged in hindsight, but the bouncer-only plan to tailenders has failed enough times before that it can fairly be questioned in advance. Sure, Moeen Ali nailed a couple before gloving one to the keeper. But at times to follow, Ollie Robinson and even Stuart Broad had a ring of players on the boundary, waiting for a shot flapped their way. Runs were easy in singles. Fielders came up, dropped back. Cummins wore criticism for defensive fields on day one, but that had a tactical application against England\u2019s aggressive top order. For No 10 it was something else. Among the confusion, England added 63 runs after Stokes was out, including 44 from the stands between Broad, Robinson and James Anderson. It took the target from a comfortable 218 to a more challenging 281. Australia may yet run it down on the fifth day, three wickets down for 107 at stumps. If they do, it will be a significant effort. Recent years have seen a surge in large chases: Sri Lanka in Durban, West Indies in Chattogram, Pakistan in Galle. Several have been against Australia: England at Headingley, India in Brisbane, and earlier this century, the two highest chases ever of 418 and 414. What we haven\u2019t seen is an Australian team doing any of the chasing. They\u2019ve tended to win by a distance or lose by the same. The last time an Australian team chased a target near this week\u2019s one at Edgbaston was on Cummins\u2019 debut, when South Africa set 310 in Johannesburg in 2011. The 18-year-old hit the winning runs while batting with Mitchell Johnson, eight wickets down. Since then Australia have had 39 fourth-innings chases. Sixteen have been won, half of those with a target in double figures, and only two exceeding 200. The highest is the 231 in the Boxing Day Ashes Test of 2013, when Shane Watson and Chris Rogers made it look easy against an England side that had already lost three matches. There have been two draws when the target was beyond reach: Usman Khawaja\u2019s Dubai epic of 2018 that spanned most of two days, and a lucky escape through two sessions when Jofra Archer was firing at Lord\u2019s in 2019. The other 21 attempts at a target in that time have failed, ranging from 188 set by India in Bengaluru to the fanciful 632 by a ruthless South Africa in Perth. The attainable ones include 241 against New Zealand in Hobart, 299 to concede the 2013 Ashes in Durham, 268 and 324 on the 2016 tour of Sri Lanka, 265 against Bangladesh in Mirpur, and the narrowly missed 323 when India visited Adelaide in 2018. Which is all to say that making scores like 281 batting last is difficult work, whatever the conditions, whatever the opponent. Even more so when Stuart Broad goes off on one his tears in the last hour of a day, with the crowd behind him and the light draining from the sky. The pressure ratchets up as each wicket falls. Rain is forecast for the fifth day, but hopefully not enough to ruin a finish. Either team could get the job done within a couple of sessions of play. If England end up on the losing side, people will no doubt point to their first-day declaration and the chance of runs foregone. If Australia lose, one might well point to the hour when they let England\u2019s tail thrash away."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319b6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/19/stokes-the-captain-is-a-fine-thing-but-soon-england-will-need-stokes-the-player-again-ashes", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Stokes the captain is a fine thing, but England will need the player again | Jonathan Liew", "lead": "Amid all the razzle and dazzle of Bazball there is a curious gap \u2013 a defining performance from the captain himself", "author": "Jonathan Liew at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:43:24", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174981", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0152b78f7c47dc1603b89812b76e40ed13f629c0/0_200_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Ben Stokes walks to the wicket slowly. This is pretty much the only thing he does slowly these days. Harry Brook tries to say a few words to him as he arrives, but Stokes isn\u2019t really listening. There\u2019s a little poke and a nudge of the pitch, dust and debris swept away with a swish of his bat, a kind of purification ritual, like a sumo sanctifying the dohyo. He takes his time, makes us wait, makes us watch: a man who has long since made his peace with the gaze of others. This is his turf, his team, his time, and there is a certain theatrical flourish to the way he stretches out the moment for all it is worth. There is a frisson around the ground, and of course there always was when Stokes walked in to bat, but ever since he became captain and began to mould this team in his image he has also batted with the expectation of leadership. With the knowledge that his teammates on the dressing\u2011room balcony are taking their cue from him, that an entire playing philosophy has been built around his approach. These days when Stokes bats we don\u2019t simply demand to be entertained, but enlightened. We want him to set an example. We want him to blaze the righteous path to truth, ideally by smashing it as hard as possible as soon as possible. Instead, something else happens. Stokes blocks his first two balls, prods at his third, defends his fourth, taps his fifth away for a no-vibes single. Nathan Lyon has been bowling brilliantly all Test, mumbling and shuffling away like a hipster Dominic Cummings. He demands maximum respect, which is all very well unless you are playing a style of cricket that dictates minimum respect at all times. Josh Hazlewood comes on at the other end and Stokes brazens out a maiden. Another block off Lyon. Another block off Hazlewood. All of a sudden England\u2019s captain is one off 13 balls. What\u2019s the matter, Ben? What\u2019s going on? Do you not realise there\u2019s a Tuesday golf game at stake here? On he goes: two off 14 balls, three off 19 balls, nine off 29 balls, and still not a hint of aggression to be seen beyond the odd exploratory waddle up the pitch. And of course seen through a rational lens this is exactly what the match situation demands from Stokes at this point, with England effectively 140 for four, the game in the balance and plenty of time left. Perhaps, you wonder, this is the logical next step for Bazball: meta-Bazball, violating everyone\u2019s hackneyed expectations of Bazball by playing immaculate conventional Test cricket. Ladies and gentlemen, he\u2019s done us again. But then zoom out a little and there is a curious missing ingredient from England\u2019s Ben Stokes era: a defining or match-winning performance by Stokes himself. Try to remember the outstanding individual displays of the Bazball era and you will probably be able to reel off Brook\u2019s centuries, Jonny Bairstow\u2019s trail of destruction, the genius of Joe Root and Stuart Broad, match-winning spells by Jimmy Anderson and Ollie Robinson, Jack Leach\u2019s 10 wickets at Headingley. Stokes, by contrast, has offered plenty of little cameos and support acts, brief blitzes and crucial wickets. There has been one century, at Old Trafford last summer, a knock later surpassed by Ben Foakes. The batting average of 35 is roughly in line with his career mark. But perhaps the real clincher is the fact that since becoming permanent captain Stokes is only 14th on the list of England strike rates. These days Root \u2013 a batter who openly questioned his relevance in the Bazball era \u2013 is scoring more quickly than Stokes, who literally invented it. Quietly, almost imperceptibly, the architect of England\u2019s new style has retreated into a kind of ceremonial figurehead status: a man of word as much as deed, Mike Brearley in a bucket hat. Why this might be is another issue altogether, and this skittish and uneven innings of 43 offered a few clues. Eventually Stokes began to play some chords: stepping out to mow Pat Cummins through midwicket for four and then stepping back to carve him through third, cutting Scott Boland in front of square, sweeping Lyon powerfully behind. But the rhythm and flow was never quite there: the feet not really moving, or moving too much, a batter caught between pure instinct and self-expectation, between playing the way he should be playing, and just \u201cplaying\u201d. And it was with a certain inevitability that eventually Cummins cleaned him up: an indeterminate prod on the crease, a thud of the pads, a ball he could have played in his sleep. Perhaps it should not be surprising that a man who has spent most of the past year trying to empower others has apparently forgotten how to empower himself. And in large part this is a dilemma encountered by captains through history: how to synthesise their own needs with that of the team, the selflessness of leadership and the selfishness of batting. English cricket badly needed Stokes the captain. There will come a time soon when they need Stokes the cricketer again."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319b7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/serving-met-officer-raped-woman-on-his-stag-night-court-told", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Serving Met officer raped woman on his stag night, court told", "lead": "Sgt Laurence Knight met woman in Brighton last July and allegedly raped her in the sea, jury hears", "author": "Jamie Grierson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:31:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.174999", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dc7d801192b5e779b5c94a6bfa97c20133bc5fbe/0_66_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "A serving Metropolitan police officer raped a woman in the sea on Brighton beach on his stag night, a court has heard. Sgt Laurence Knight, 34, is said to have met the woman, a stranger, in the early hours of 17 July 2021 while in the city centre. Prosecutors say the pair walked to the beach together, undressed to their underwear and ended up in the sea. Maryam Syed, prosecuting, said that while in the sea the woman said to the defendant, who the jury heard is sometimes called Larry, \u201cyou\u2019re getting married in two weeks\u201d. After the alleged incident, a friend of the defendant said to the woman that \u201cLarry wants me to tell you that he\u2019s sorry\u201d, the prosecution said. The defendant, who denies the allegation, and his group left and the woman called the police, meeting officers nearby. Syed said the alleged victim told police that Knight wanted to go into the sea and she did not wish to but he persuaded her, telling her \u201cit was his stag night, he was meant to be having fun but it was turning into a rubbish night\u201d. The woman thought the defendant looked as if he was going to cry, the prosecution told the jury, so she said yes and took off her dress as she did not want it to get wet. Knight moved behind the woman in the water then moved her underwear and that is when the alleged sexual activity took place, Syed said. The woman asked the defendant \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d and said \u201cstop\u201d and he did not reply, she said in her police interview. \u201cI said \u2018you\u2019re getting married in two weeks, just stop, don\u2019t do that\u2019 and he just didn\u2019t stop,\u201d the prosecution said, reading from the interview. Syed said the woman was then raped. The woman said \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d to the defendant and she did not move, saying later she thought she was in shock, the jury was told. The woman said the defendant then got out of the water. She put her dress back on and went to sit by a friend, the court heard. She said in the police interview: \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything and then the guy who I was in the sea with, his friend came over to me and said \u2018oh Larry, Larry wants me to tell you that he\u2019s sorry, Larry wants to say, like, sorry.\u2019 I didn\u2019t look up at him, I didn\u2019t want to engage with any of them.\u201d The woman said she then told her friend what had happened and called 999, the prosecution said. Knight, of Leyton, east London, who the Met said had been suspended from duty, was arrested on 28 July 2021 and provided a prepared statement in which he said the woman was being \u201cflirtatious with all of them\u201d. He said she had suggested they go into the sea, she reached behind and touched his genitals and he did not penetrate her. The defendant returned for a second interview on 5 January 2022 and provided another prepared statement saying he moved her underwear and it was consensual, but then she said \u201caren\u2019t you getting married\u201d and he stopped. The prosecution said the defendant \u201ctook advantage of this young woman who was clearly in drink\u201d.

I sit next to Rooty in the changing-room actually and he said, \u2018I fancy a reverse scoop for six first ball.\u2019 I said, \u2018If it\u2019s in your gut, you\u2019\u2019ve gotta go for it.\u2019 It made us smile in the changing room. Baz says he\u2019d prefer us to get caught at long on than be out defending. For our leading batter to show that intent is really powerful for us. In the past this would have been a draw, on this type of pitch. Us forcing the game forward makes a result possible tomorrow. We\u2019ll turn up, see what happens. There\u2019s supposed to be a bit of cloud around in the morning. If you can get lucky as a bowling group and get an hour of that you can break the game open pretty quickly. We feel pretty confident. And if we turn up and there\u2019s a bit of cloud, I\u2019ll have a smile on my face. A bit more from Stuart Broad Stokesy mentioned it to us out there: was our first hour quite good enough? Were we really up and at the Aussies? Probably not as much as we could have been, so we had to get everything moving in our direction. Any day that you\u2019ve got Smith and Marnus back in the hut \u2013 and Warner to be honest \u2013 we\u2019re delighted. But there\u2019s still two results on the table. [On the Labuschagne wicket] That was a nice one, I\u2019m happy with that one actually. It just seamed off the dryness; I tried to wobble it with the shiny side to move away. [On Smith\u2019s wicket] To be honest I could have sworn he was LBW from the first ball of that over, but everyone said it hit the bat. It was slightly overpitched but on a pitch like this you don\u2019t mind going a touch fuller. Here\u2019s Andy Bull on Joe Root, who started the day by trying to reverse scoop Pat Cummins\u2019 first ball for six. Match report More from Stuart Broad To be honest I didn\u2019t go into the spell feeling that we desperately needed wickets. We know the new ball has almost been the best time to bat, because you can actually hit it, and when it gets softer it becomes harder to score. I just thought if I can whack the pitch as hard as I can, try and get a bit of movement and create a bit of theatre. In Ashes cricket at Edgbaston you can create a bit of theatre, you almost feel like something\u2019s happening even when it\u2019s not. Stuart Broad speaks I wanted one more tonight really, that would have been ideal. The ball was moving a nice amount but I thought those two scrapped really well. It\u2019s a dry surface but it feels like if you can bash away then one will move. That was another cracking day, with the momentum seesawing throughout. Enough of that because here\u2019s Stuart Broad, armed with a water bottle and a bucket hat. The equation: Australia need 174 runs, England need seven wickets. If the weather forecast is correct, batting could be very tricky in the morning and easier in the afternoon. But then it might rain so much overnight that there\u2019s no play in the morning. In short, nobody knows anything. Not even WinViz. \u201cIan Copestake (24th over) properly made me laugh with that,\u201d writes Liz Rippin. \u201cI do wish people would stop griping - this is thrilling, knife-edge stuff. The Aussie in our WhatsApp group is loving it, but I don\u2019t think we Brits are as accustomed to excitement as they are.\u201d 30th over: Australia 107-3 (Khawaja 34, Boland 13) Boland is on strike for Broad, which Usman Khawaja will join the short list of players who have batted on all five days of a Test. He\u2019s doing an admirable job, and moves into double figures with an edge along the ground for four. The ball barely moved off the straight in the first 20 overs, but Broad has swung it dramatically in his second spell. Boland survives the rest of the over, and so ends another pulsasting day\u2019s play. Broad gets on his haunches, absolutely shattered, before being congratulated/thanked by his teammates. After an ominous Australian start, he has dragged England back into the game with another memorable spell of bowling. The consensus in the Sky commentary box is that England are slight (italicised, underlined) favourites. 29th over: Australia 103-3 (Khawaja 34, Boland 9) Moeen replaces Anderson, presumably in the hope there will be time for Broad to have one more over. Khawaja edges the penultimate delivery wide of slip and turns down a single; he has no interest in facing Broad tonight. Yep, there\u2019s time for Broad to have one more over. 28th over: Australia 103-3 (Khawaja 34, Boland 9) Yes, it seems play will finish at 7pm local time, so in about five minutes. Broad is sprinting back to his mark between deliveries. Khawaja flicks an inducker off the pads for four, then Boland does likewise, although his four runs came from two twos. They turned down a third run on each occasion because Boland is protecting Khawaja. \u201cCan we all thank Fran Collins for that email?\u201d says Marie Meyer. \u201cJust what the doctor ordered.\u201d 27th over: Australia 94-3 (Khawaja 29, Boland 5) There are 16 overs remaining, though only in theory. I was sure play was scheduled to finish at 7.30pm local time; if so, that\u2019s very early for a nightwatchman. Mind you, Boland has started confidently. He knocks four off the target with a muscular cut stroke off Anderson and defends the rest of the over without alarm. I\u2019d get Robinson back on at this end; Anderson is struggling for rhythm. 26th over: Australia 90-3 (Khawaja 29, Boland 1) Boland takes a single off the last ball to keep the strike, and get off the mark. When Stuart Broad dies, he should donate his competitive juices to the MCC Museum. He\u2019s been seizing initiatvies in big games for 14 years now, since the Oval 2009, and it\u2019s still utterly exhilarating to watch. Scott Boland has come in as nightwatchman. I thought there were 45 minutes of play remaining, but that can\u2019t be right because they wouldn\u2019t send him in for that long. Broad has got Steve Smith with a brilliant piece of bowling! He almost had him earlier in the over with a huge inswinger that shaved the outside edge, hit the pad in front of off stump and bounced just short of Bairstow. No matter: two balls later he produced another big inducker that found the edge as Smith lunged into the drive. Bairstow took a comfortable catch. That is just magnificent from Broad. Stuart Broad + Ashes cricket = theatre and majesty. 25th over: Australia 89-2 (Khawaja 29, Smith 6) Just one over for Joe Root, with Jimmy Anderson returning to the attack. He bowled a shoddy first spell by his standards (5-0-23-0), but all will be forgiven if I can pinch a wicket or two here. All will be forgiven anyway; he has nearly 700 credits in the bank. His first over is harmless, and he\u2019s not happy with the footholes. Anderson even bowls a no-ball, which hardly ever happens. He\u2019s got his grump on. \u201cAmazing to see how quickly people are jumping on Stokes - he may not have got the calls right this match, but how many times were people moaning and groaning about his predecessors\u2019 rote captaincy, timid declarations and passivity in the field,\u201d says Will Vignoles. \u201cWe did tried and tested and it got us extreme mediocrity. I\u2019d much rather a captain and team who don\u2019t look scared to win, even if that means they lose sometimes. Plus let\u2019s not forget that the Aussies are a champion team and are allowed to play good cricket too\u2026\u201d And they haven\u2019t even lost! I can understand the criticism, and I didn\u2019t like the declaration at all, but I still think he\u2019s touched by genius as a captain. 24th over: Australia 84-2 (Khawaja 27, Smith 4) Broad has kept the umbrella field for Khawaja, and puts his hands to his head when Khawaja inside-edges his first ball into the leg side. This is a tricky spell for Australia, more because of the mood than the pitch. Khawaja works a single into the off side, then Smith gets off the mark with a handsome pull for four. The fielder at deep backward square lost sight of the ball, though I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d have stopped it. Broad is England\u2019s leading wickettaker against Australia, and surely their greatest Ashes competitor since Lord Beefy. And not even Ian Botham was man of the match in three Ashes-clinching victories, as Broad was in 2009, 2013 and 2015. \u201cI wonder how many generations of Bazball would be necessary to instil positivity into England supporters!\u201d writes Ian Copestake. \u201cGrind the good Aussie players out then work on the long tail. Is a tad early to be calling it!\u201d 23rd over: Australia 79-2 (Khawaja 26, Smith 0) Well, Moeen is back on the field but he\u2019s been replaced by Joe Root. A quiet first over, which is to say I\u2019ve been looking up a Stuart Broad stat. 22nd over: Australia 78-2 (Khawaja 25, Smith 0) Broad whips up the crowd before his first delivery to Steve Smith. It\u2019s angled in from wide of the crease and Smith defends confidently. We\u2019ve just seen a few replays of Labuschagne\u2019s dismissal. Broad might be in his head because that was the kind of ball he ignores all the time. He was beaten earlier in the over and seemed unsure as to the whereabouts of his off stump. In this match Broad has bowled four balls to Labuschagne, conceded no runs and dismissed him twice. Stuart Broad does it again! Labuschagne feels tentatively for a full, widish delivery that he had no need to play, and Jonny Bairstow takes a comfortable catch. Broad doesn\u2019t go wild, instead celebrating as if it was all part of the plan. I suppose it was: he\u2019s been working on that outswinger with Labuschagne in mind. 21st over: Australia 77-1 (Khawaja 25, Labuschagne 13) Moeen starts with a low full toss that Labuschagne whacks straight into Pope at short leg. He\u2019s okay. But Moeen isn\u2019t: a horrible long hop is pulled almost apologetically for four by Labuschagne. Moeen is really struggling with his finger, and he leaves the field at the end of the over. The poor guy has had a difficult match: scores of 18 and 19 and match figures of 39-5-170-2. \u201cRob, you say the field for Labuschagne\u2019s first ball was pure funk,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cMay I disagree and say it\u2019s all about Stokes drawing attention to himself, it\u2019s not a field designed for anything other than for people to say \u2018Look how clever that Stokes captain is\u2019. He has already cost England probably up to 50 runs if not more, now, to use an Irish expression, he is acting the maggot with his field placements. For the good of England, or for his own ego?\u201d I take your point, and I do think there are times when he has got a bit carried away, but I don\u2019t see him as an egotist at all. And we can\u2019t ignore that a number of these funky fields have worked. Anyway, let\u2019s save the postmortems until it\u2019s 3-0 rather than 0-0. 20th over: Australia 72-1 (Khawaja 25, Labuschagne 8) Khawaja looks comfortable against Robinson, umbrella field or not, and gets two more with an open-faced steer. Australia are 201 runs away from a 1-0 lead. \u201cEngland have probably lost this,\u201d says Fran Collins. \u201cNeeded a couple of earlyish wickets at least. How\u2019s the weather tomorrow?\u201d Gloomy in the morning, so the lights may well be on if England bowl. As we saw yesterday, that would make life tricky for the batters. But after lunch it\u2019s supposed to be much brighter. Read Simon Burnton\u2019s Ashes diary: day four 19th over: Australia 70-1 (Khawaja 23, Labuschagne 8) Khawaja turns Moeen off the pads for a single; he\u2019s now scored 164 from 376 balls in this match. Labuschagne pushes awkwardly at his first ball from Moeen and is hit on the pad, though he\u2019s well outside the line. He addresses the next two deliveries more decisively, reverse-sweeping both for four. Fine batting. \u201cEveryone always focuses on the runs Bairstow scores in the Bairstow vs Foakes debate,\u201d says Oliver Smiddy. \u201cBut he\u2019s cost us an awful lot this game through missing some pretty regulation chances. Leftfield suggestion \u2013 ask Foakes to open and keep, if Jonny is too scared to bat above 7, and drop Duckett (if you want Crawley to be the swashbuckling opener)? It\u2019s sufficiently wacky to align with Bazball. He could be the new Alec Stewart! \u201cAny chance of a charity plug too? We\u2019re trying to raise \u00a3150,000 for seven charities by successfully conveying a bunch of colleagues up and down some mountains in the Chamonix valley. Any generous OBOers can donate here. If it makes any difference, I\u2019m going to run halfway up Mont Blanc first to make life a bit harder.\u201d I wondered about Foakes opening but I don\u2019t think he could do it. One point in defence of Bairstow is that this is one of his worst keeping performance for England. He\u2019s usually a lot more reliable than this, though not in Foakes\u2019s class, and he is coming back from a horrible injury. 18th over: Australia 61-1 (Khawaja 22, Labuschagne 0) The field for Labuschagne\u2019s first ball is 100 per cent pure funk: slip, gully, leg slip, short mid-on, leg gully and short leg. He defends solidly and a couple of those fielders scatter. \u201cIt\u2019s reached that time of day where my patient non-cricket-watching wife gets to have Pointless on TV, whilst I switch to the iPad in forlorn search of a wicket,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cInvited to name the Italian director of such films as \u20188 1/2\u2019 and \u2018La Dolce Vita\u2018 with initials \u2018FF\u2019, I\u2019m guessing that for all you post-neorealism cinema buffs the name \u2018Franz Ferdinand\u2019 didn\u2019t immediately spring to mind, he chuckled pompously.\u201d \u2018Yes, here it is: 9 1/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke. That would be in the \u2026 erotic drama section.\u2019 Drinks The new batter is Marnus Labuschagne, who is on a king pair. Goddim! That\u2019s a vital wicket for England. Robinson, slammed for four earlier in the over, found Warner\u2019s outside edge with a textbook wobble-seam delivery from round the wicket. Jonny Bairstow did the rest and Warner is on his way for a purposeful 36. 17th over: Australia 57-0 (Khawaja 22, Warner 32) Stokes positions himself right behind the bowler Moeen, two-thirds of the way back to the boundary. After a couple of balls he walks in maybe five yards. Khawaja resists the temptation, and it\u2019s another maiden. \u201cDrinking game suggestion,\u201d says Darren Hall. \u201cHave a gulp every time a commentator says \u2018finger\u2019.\u201d 16th over: Australia 57-0 (Khawaja 22, Warner 32) Moeen\u2019s pain is becoming more obvious as he gets into his spell. It\u2019s a problem for England, because the ball is doing very little for the seamers. A shortish delivery from Robinson is belted through midwicket for four by Warner, who then beats the cover ring with a cut stroke for two more. He\u2019s playing superbly. 15th over: Australia 50-0 (Khawaja 22, Warner 26) Khawaja skips down the track to crash Moeen down the ground for four. That\u2019s beautiful batting, both in execution and intent, and it brings up a fifty partnership that has quietened the crowd. It\u2019s nearly 6pm, and it\u2019s easy to forget that there are nearly two hours remaining tonight. Bowling conditions may well be friendly in the morning, but that won\u2019t be much good to England if Australia are 150 for none. \u201cIf we stick to tradition, Bairstow will play as a keeper in the next Test,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cShould he have another shocker (and continue to miss chances here), he might then be replaced by Foakes, but under B*zball, who knows?\u201d Injury aside, I can\u2019t see a way Foakes gets into the team this summer. Maybe if Harry Brook has a shocker and they go back to last summer\u2019s middle order. 14th over: Australia 45-0 (Khawaja 18, Warner 25) No umbrella field for Warner, who cuts Robinson witheringly for four. Khawaja then gets his first runs off Robinson in this innings, and his first boundary, with a classy square drive. Since we\u2019ve left an important part of our brain somewhere in a field in Hampshire in Edgbaston 2005, Australia were 47 for none after 12 overs when Andrew Flintoff came on to bowl the over of his life. \u201cGreetings from a parallel universe,\u201d writes my erstwhile Wisden.com colleague Tom Bowtell. \u201cAm listening on a train in Filey with dodgy reception and somehow switched to the TMS commentary replay from day 2 without knowing. Screamed with loud astonishment as history repeated with Warner playing on to Broad and Marnus going first ball. Sheepishly disappointed to discover the more mundane realty of the score. Fellow travellers, Yorkshirefolk all, eyeing me suspiciously.\u201d And most of them don\u2019t even know there\u2019s a game on, har har. 13th over: Australia 36-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 20) Nathan Lyon got a few to turn sharply, particularly to the left-handers, but then his spinning finger wasn\u2019t seeping. Moeen gets one to turn away from Khawaja, who bats it slightly cautiously into the leg side, and then beats him with a nicely flighted delivery. Khawaja, who has now gone 23 balls without scoring, tries to cut the last ball and is beaten the lack of bounce. That was a risky shot on both line and length. \u201cGreetings from a parallel universe,\u201d writes my erstwhile Wisden.com colleague Tom Bowtell. \u201cAm listening on a train in Filey with dodgy reception and somehow switched to the TMS commentary replay from day 2 without knowing. Screamed with loud astonishment as history repeated with Warner playing on to Broad and Marnus going first ball. Sheepishly disappointed to discover the more mundane realty of the score. Fellow travellers, Yorkshirefolk all, eyeing me suspiciously.\u201d 12th over: Australia 35-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 19) Robinson bowls another maiden to Khawaja, who is a little becalmed: 14 from his first 16 balls, 0 from the next 18. He looks secure, though, and that\u2019s Australia need him to be at this stage. Robinson is also bowling well, with a fullish length and a bit of movement into the left-hander, so there aren\u2019t many runs on offer. \u201cSpeaking of people jettisoned too soon, as a neutral, I am still bemused about what happened to Steve Finn,\u201d says Digvijay Yadav. \u201cHe was rampaging in 2015. Bowled well against Pakistan the following year, particularly at Edgbaston. And then got dumped.\u201d It\u2019s a complicated story, and I really hope he writes an autobiography because he talks so well about the mental challenges he faced, but I think it was a combination of injury and loss of confidence. The interesting thing, as you say, is that he bounced back thrillingly from Finn\u2019s Law and his Ashes horribilis; I\u2019ve rarely been more thrilled for an England cricketer than I was for him when he came back with a six-for in the 2015 Ashes. He also bowled beautifully when England won in South Africa that winter; I remember thinking that, at the age of 26, he had cracked it and would be an unplayable monster for the next few years. But then he had an inexplicably poor series against Sri Lanka at the start of 2016 \u2013 a cousin of Graeme Hick\u2019s unforseeable loss of form against India in 1996 \u2013 and that was pretty much it. 11th over: Australia 35-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 19) This is a big moment: Moeen Ali, blistered finger and all, is coming into the attack. Australia will surely go after him straight away. Actually, they don\u2019t. Warner is content to work a pair of twos and defend the rest. Moeen didn\u2019t seem in too much pain during that over, though he is looking at his finger as he walks back towards the boundary. \u201cPerhaps to help calm the sphinctal motions of the faithless,\u201d interjects Ian Copestake. \u201cEngland should take a leaf out of the baseball book and assign a designated hitter to play time and drop anchor.\u201d 10th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 15) Warner has seen off Broad, who is replaced by Robinson after a spell of 4-0-8-0. Robinson starts with his umbrella field to Khawaja: three short extra covers, a short midwicket and a shortish square leg. After two balls, Stokes adds another man at short mid-on. Somewhere in the next life, Keith Miller has a big smile on his face. Robinson pitches everything up to Khawaja, with a hint of shape back in. Khawaja\u2019s judgement of what to play and what to leave is immaculate, and it\u2019s a maiden. \u201cKhawaja,\u201d says Simon Gates, \u201cis in with a chance of batting on all five days.\u201d That\u2019s a great spot. It\u2019s a pretty short list, and I\u2019d completely forgotten that Rory Burns was on it. 9th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 15) A short ball from Anderson, who is going at five an over for the first time in years, is swivel-pulled sweetly for four by Warner. This has been a perfect start for Australia. 8th over: Australia 27-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 11) On Sky Sports, Nasser Hussain argues that England\u2019s bowling has been a bit too straight. The number of runs scored on the leg side \u2013 20 out of 25 off the bat - would support that argument. Warner is beaten on the inside by a beauty from Broad, and England plead desperately for a caught-behind decision. It\u2019s not forthcoming and they wisely decide against a review. It hit something, possibly Warner\u2019s elbow, but it wasn\u2019t the bat. \u201cI\u2019m a convert to the One True Faith of Bazball, with all the zeal that comes with such a status,\u201d writes Gary Naylor. \u201cBut even I\u2019m having doubts about the declaration, some of the shot selections and the ultra-attacking fields. I guess I\u2019m asking myself, \u2018Is it cowardly to pray for brain?\u2019\u201d 7th over: Australia 26-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 10) Two more to Warner, worked behind square off Anderson, and he repeats the shot for a single off the penultimate ball. Warner knows, with the ball not moving, he has a real chance here. From England\u2019s perspective I think it\u2019s time for Ollie Robinson in place of Anderson, who isn\u2019t quite at his best. 6th over: Australia 23-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 7) Warner\u2019s resists a wobbling tempter from Broad. But he knows he\u2019s safe with anything on the pads, and another crisp clip through midwicket brings him three runs. This is good stuff, a rugged arm-wrestle between three 36-year-olds and a quadragenarian. Australia need another 258 to win. 5th over: Australia 20-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 4) Khawaja is beaten, chasing a wide delivery bowled from round the wicket by Anderson. The next ball is fractionally short, no more, and Khawaja pulls for four with a flourish. He is ruthless with that shot. An eventful over concludes with another play and miss outside off stump. \u201cSkulking in a basement in southwestern Ontario, and remembering Belly at his cover-driving best,\u201d says Alex McGillivray. \u201cJettisoned at 33 - seems way too early for a batsman of his talents. Wonder why?\u201d I suspect that when they dropped him for the South Africa series in 2015-16, a fair enough decision on form, they expected him to be back the following summer. We all assumed Bell would score millions in county cricket, but it didn\u2019t happen \u2013 from memory he struggled - and the door never opened again. There was a vacancy in the team in 2016 because of the shock retirement of James Taylor. With Bell not scoring any runs for Warwickshire, they gave it another glorious cover-driver: James Vince. 4th over: Australia 16-0 (Khawaja 10, Warner 4) Stuart Broad is sticking two fingers to the data by bowling round the wicket to Khawaja as well as Warner. It\u2019s another purposeful, accurate, aggressive over from Broad, but it\u2019s met with secure defence from the Australian openers. There hasn\u2019t been much movement for England. 3rd over: Australia 14-0 (Khawaja 9, Warner 4) England have four men in the covers for Warner, but he has more joy on the leg side when Anderson drifts onto the pads. A crisp clip brings him two runs. Warner is looking good, busy and light on his feet. \u201cIf we\u2019re even in vague danger of going down that nail-chewing route again during Australia\u2019s fourth innings\u2026\u201d says Boris Starling, referring to the joyous torture of Edgbaston 2005. \u201cI can never think of that match without remembering my friend Tom, who on that final morning as the target came closer and closer sent me a series of staggeringly offensive and beautifully inventive texts raining down invective on Australians (for obvious reasons), England cricketers (for equally obvious reasons, plus having had the temerity to invent the sport which was causing us such conniptions), Welshmen (Simon Jones spilling the catch at third man which would have won the match), and so on. A few weeks later, he and I were in the crowd at Trafalgar Square to salute Our Ashes Heroes\u2122\ufe0f. \u201cTom died a few years ago, and when the Ashes come round I always think of him and his three non-negotiables for life: a cigarette, a glass of red, and laughter.\u201d 2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Khawaja 9, Warner 2) Warner clatters Broad\u2019s first ball into the covers, where Pope does well to save four runs. It\u2019s also a no-ball from Broad. Australia have started with intent \u2013 but so has Broad, whose last ball kicks encouraingly Warner\u2019s off stump. \u201cEngland have scored 666 runs in the match,\u201d notes Christopher Phillips, \u201cbut is it enough to beast the Aussies.\u201d 1st over: Australia 10-0 (Khawaja 9, Warner 1) A chance straight away! The ball after pulling Anderson round the corner for four, Khawaja edges straight between Bairstow and Root at first slip. They left it to each other. It was a beautiful delivery from Anderson, and it cost him four runs. Replays show it was closer to Bairstow than Root; it was his catch. The poor guy is having a bad game with the gloves. \u201cThe downside of England scoring so quickly in the new exciting era is the pitch hasn\u2019t deteriorated as much as you\u2019d expect for a fourth innings,\u201d says Mark Hooper, \u201cso record run chases aren\u2019t that informative.\u201d Indeed. I think that applies generally over the last 20 years or so, not just to this England team. For reference, though, here are all Australia\u2019s successful runchases in England. Jimmy Anderson is happy with his new new ball, and he\u2019s going to open the bowling. England aren\u2019t happy with the new ball. Stuart Broad is peering at it quizzically, and a few of the players are in conversation with Marais Erasmus. Mike Atherton thinks that England chose a different ball to the one they\u2019ve been given. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s going to be changed. The commentators are discussing how dangerous one of the Australian openers could be tonight. It\u2019s not the man who scored 141 in the first innings; it\u2019s the guy who scored nine. Here come the players. Buckle up, buttercup. This will be an extended evening session, just under three hours. Not quite Melbourne 1998 but that\u2019s still a lot of cricket. There are 42 overs remaining; we should get at least 35 of them. \u201cThose extra runs from Robinson, Broad and Anderson might mean England get a second new ball tomorrow,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cI reckon those two partnerships have won England the game. Fancied Aus to chase anything up to about 250. 280 feels like a lot though.\u201d I suppose you can argue it both ways \u2013 the relative comfort with which they got the runs will make Australia\u2019s top order feel good about life. As is this from Mr Bazball This is a good point from Brendan Murphy \u201cEngland\u2019s frenetic pace means that they spend far more time on the field than Australia, with their more methodical approach,\u201d writes Brendan. \u201cAustralia batted 116 overs, England\u2019s two innings lasted 144 overs. Cummings, Hazlewood etc. will be getting more rest in this series than Anderson and Broad.\u201d Teatime reading Another good spot from Tim de Lisle \u201cJimmy Anderson\u2019s highest score in his past 35 Tests, since Pallekele, Nov 2018 (another 12).\u201d It\u2019s 2005 all over again. In that legendary Edgbaston Test, Australia needed 282 to win; today it\u2019s 281. Pat Cummins bowled beautifully in that innings, finishing with four for 63, and Nathan Lyon emerged from a predictable onslaught with admirable figures of 24-2-80-4. Pat Cummins ends the nonsense. He comes back into the attack and rams in a short ball that Anderson can only fence to the left of Carey, who dives to take a good two-handed catch. Australia need 281 to win. 66th over: England 273-9 (Broad 10, Anderson 12) Broad gets outside the line, negating an LBW appeal from Lyon. Two more singles add to Australia\u2019s burgeoning frustration; this partnership is worth 17. 65th over: England 271-9 (Broad 9, Anderson 11) My word: Anderson, on the charge, smashes a length ball from Boland to the cover boundary! Australia haven\u2019t chased this many to win an Ashes Test since the famous Headingley Test of 1948. Those fourth-innings stats feel pretty irrelevant these days, and we shouldn\u2019t forget there have been plenty of times when Australia\u2019s target to win an Ashes Test has been in double figures. Doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t have made 280-300. A bit of housekeeping. Tea will be delayed until the fall of the tenth wicket, although if these two are still batting at 4.40pm it will be taken then. 64th over: England 264-9 (Broad 7, Anderson 6) This is a nice little interlude before the serious business of Australia\u2019s runchase begins. Broad is well beaten by a ripper from Lyon that growls out of the footmarks. \u201cI see WinViz has been whirling like the proverbial dervish today,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cDoes it have any knowledge of the wretched state of Mo\u2019s finger, or access to the Met Office supercomputer? I\u2019m also suspecting it knows nothing of how badly the Australians want to ram B**B*** down the collective English gullet\u2026\u201d I think it takes into account the weather but not Mo\u2019s finger unless he officially withdraws from the game. You raise a good point, though. I wonder how WinViz might have reacted when Patrick Patterson walked into the Australian dressing-room on the fourth evening at Melbourne in 1988 and promised to kill them all the next day? I suppose West Indies\u2019 chances of victory would have increased from 99 per cent to 100. 63rd over: England 263-9 (Broad 6, Anderson 6) \u201cThat 2013 series still irks me,\u201d says Max Williams. \u201cIt deserves to be celebrated as the final hurrah of a truly great England side. Instead the ridiculous decision to play the Down Under series a few months later \u2013 can\u2019t even remember the reason now \u2013 means our 3-0 win has been buried beneath the subsequent whitewash. Poor Ian Bell.\u201d Yes, two points on that. Bell\u2019s batting in that series was possibly the finest I\u2019ve ever seen by an England batter across a whole series, because he made three totally different hundreds on three spicy pitches against a high-class seam attack. The other thing is that, while I agree with you, I vividly recall the negativity towards England during that series. And even before it, when they took their time to declare against New Zealand at Headingley. Actually, three points \u2013 the reason they brought the second series forward by a year was so that it wouldn\u2019t be in the same winter as the World Cup. 62nd over: England 260-9 (Broad 5, Anderson 4) Jimmy Anderson reverse sweeps his first ball nonchalantly for four! He walks down the wicket deadpan, looking like a gunslinger, to touch gloves with Broad. England lead by 267. Since you asked, Australia\u2019s target on this ground in the 2005 heartstopper was 282. \u201cBasically in old money we\u2019d have scraped to the same score then been blown away by the new ball,\u201d says Dan. \u201cBy attacking relentlessly it turns bowlers from attacking lines and lengths (two innings cricket) to inherently defensive and a one-day mindset. Could\u2019ve run more singles though!\u201d This is the thing \u2013 we\u2019ll never be able to quantify Bazball, partly because so much of it is psychological. I do know that the last year has been the most fun I\u2019ve had watching England since 2004-05. Ollie Robinson\u2019s fun is over. The ball after driving Lyon back over his head for two, he tried again and holed out to Cam Green at long-on. Canny stuff from Lyon, who has his fourth of the innings and his eighth of the match. 61st over: England 254-8 (Robinson 25, Broad 5) Scott Boland replaces Hazlewood, which should mean a ceasefire in the bouncer war. The upside of this irritating partnership for Australia is that two lower-order batters look relatively comfortable against the old ball. Robinson has plenty of time to glide Boland\u2019s last ball for a single. \u201cI\u2019m sitting on an Alicante veranda, sweating bullets in 31C,\u201d writes Joe Varley, \u201cbut am I correct to assume tomorrow\u2019s play will be more of a scorcher?\u201d Not necessarily \u2013 heavy rain is forecast in the morning, sunny intervals thereafter. 60th over: England 253-8 (Robinson 24, Broad 5) Robinson charges Lyon and chips a safe single to long on, one of two runs from the over. With 17 minutes to go until tea, England lead by 260. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Jon Salisbury. \u201cRobinson has superb temperament. Cheers.\u201d He does. I\u2019m still not 100 per cent sure what I think of him as a bloke \u2013 he came across well in this interview with Don McRae \u2013 but he\u2019s a fantastic cricketer. Weird that he was hiding in plain sight in county cricket for all those years. As long ago as 2018 he was taking 74 first-class wickets at an average of 19. 59th over: England 251-8 (Robinson 23, Broad 4) With Robinson backing away in anticipation of a short ball, Hazlewood slips in a surprise yorker. Robinson does well to adjust and dig it out. The next ball is short, and Robinson deftly uppercuts it to third man for four! Robinson makes room to cut the next ball for two more, with Lyon scrambling to save the boundary at deep point. Lyon hurt his right shoulder in the process but he\u2019s going to continue bowling. Those runs take England past 250. This is a valuable cameo from Robinson, 23 from 30 balls. \u201cI think Stokes is about to declare again,\u201d says Gervase Greene. \u201cThat\u2019ll mess with their heads\u2026\u201d That would be a dreadful idea, the moment Bazball jumped the shark. But, if we\u2019re looking to take the positives, it might just break Twitter once and for all. IN OTHER NEWS 58th over: England 243-8 (Robinson 16, Broad 3) Broad survives another LBW appeal after missing a lap at Lyon. I think it was missing off, though I wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on it. Three from the over. Robinson, who has underachieved a touch with the bat in his short Test career, is playing pretty well and has 16 from 25 balls. \u201cI prefer my retreats without digital, ta,\u201d replies J.A. Hopkin, \u201cbut winning a Test match is not about scoring faster than the other team, it\u2019s about amassing an unassailable total. Stokes\u2019 blokes provide entertainment, alright, but I can\u2019t help feeling they\u2019re gonna traipse off the ground at some point tomorrow looking like dejected morris dancers.\u201d You might be right \u2013 I just fancy Australia at this point \u2013 but England\u2019s approach has brought them 11 victories in 13 games, and now they are competing with the world\u2019s best team. It\u2019s a yes from me. 57th over: England 240-8 (Robinson 15, Broad 2) It looks like England have decided to take on the short ball. Both Robinson and Broad miss big yahoos, then Carey saves four byes with a superb diving stop down the leg side. Robinson gets four of his own off the penultimate ball, making room to swat Hazlewood back over his head. Whatever you think of Robinson\u2019s mouth, he\u2019s got plenty of ticker. England lead by 247. \u201cThe Aussies have been outstanding since the first hour,\u201d says John Jones. \u201cThe commentators have been overly critical of their approach. Still in the game after losing the toss on a road and in with a real chance. What a Test match.\u201d The momentum shifts (and DRS drama) remind me a little of Trent Bridge in 2013, the forgotten classic of modern Ashes cricket. 56th over: England 232-8 (Robinson 8, Broad 1) \u201cWell this is extraordinary stuff isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI confess that I\u2019ve never wanted England to win a Test more than I do right now. Yes it\u2019s the Ashes, yes it\u2019s the first Test, but mainly it\u2019s to deny the millions lining up to say, \u2018I told you so\u2019. Nobody gets every decision right in sport - what matters is what you do with them.\u201d There\u2019s no way of knowing, but I really hope that\u2019s not the case. I thought it was one of the worst declarations in Test history; I\u2019m also desperate to have humble pie for tea tomorrow. Broad misses a reverse-sweep at Lyon and is given out LBW. That\u2019s plumb. Broad reviews, more in hope that expectation, and quite right too: replays show the ball brushed his glove on its way through. 55th over: England 229-8 (Robinson 6, Broad 0) Broad is dropped by Smith! He fenced another excellent short ball up in the air on the leg side. Smith charged after it, grimacing with determination, but couldn\u2019t hold on at full stretch. It would have been a great catch. One thing is abundantly clear: the lower order batters on both sides won\u2019t be getting many drive balls for the rest of the series, and I\u2019m tempted to delete the \u2018M\u2019 in \u2018many. But Moeen has gone! He tried to pull a leg-stump short ball from Hazlewood and gloved it through to Alex Carey. That\u2019s yet another timely wicket for Australia, who have almost taken them to order today. Every time England have threatened to get away, somebody has made the breakthrough for Australia. 54.3 overs: England 229-7 (Moeen 19, Robinson 6) Robinson fends a vicious short ball from the new bowler Hazlewood towards short leg, where Labuschagne swoops forward to take a brilliant one-handed catch. He throws the ball up but doesn\u2019t seem entirely sure that it\u2019s a clean catch. The umpires go upstairs, and replays show that, though Labuschagne took the ball cleanly, he then scraped the ball along the ground as his hand twisted. Robinson survives. 54th over: England 228-7 (Moeen 19, Robinson 5) Lyon has an LBW appeal against Robinson turned down by Marais Erasmus. That turned a long way, probably too much. Australia have no reviews left anyway. A single brings Moeen on strike, and he clouts a sweet slog-sweep over midwicket for six. Shot! Lyon responds with a jaffa that spits past the outside edge as Moeen props forward. Carey has the bails off in a trice \u2013 he\u2019s kept beautifully in this game, as he did in India \u2013 but Moeen\u2019s back foot was grounded. \u201cReally can\u2019t fathom why England is playing this like a one-dayer,\u201d writes J. A. Hopkin. \u201cIs it going to rain all day tomorrow? Three batsmen out in their 40s. Old Father Gooch must be distraught.\u201d Have you been at a digital retreat in the Kerguelen Islands for the last 12 months? This is England 2023. Blimey. Thanks to Romeo for pointing out that Oman are on course for a stunning win over Ireland in the World Cup qualifiers. 53rd over: England 221-7 (Moeen 13, Robinson 4) Moeen chases a wide ball from Cummins and slices it down to third man for four. He isn\u2019t middling much but he\u2019s found his way into double figures. Every little helps. \u201cAssuming the bowlers manage a few,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cwould you care to estimate what would be a winning lead amid a rain-soaked Tuesday?\u201d I would not, largely because I have nary a clue. 52nd over: England 217-7 (Moeen 9, Robinson 4) There hasn\u2019t been any sign of verbal aggression towards Robinson, just a few zesty bumpers from Cummins. Moeen tries to slog-sweep Lyon and is beaten by a bit of extra bounce. Lovely bowling. It feels like a matter of time before he gets Moeen for the 11th time in Tests. Only one other bowler, Ravi Jadeja with seven, has dismissed Moeen more than five times. WinViz has Australia slight favourites: 50 per cent to England\u2019s 46, with four per cent chance of a draw. 51st over: England 215-7 (Moeen 8, Robinson 3) Cummins has bowled tremendously in this innings. He almost gets his fourth wicket with a beauty that vrooms off the seam to beat the driving Moeen through the gate. That could easily have bowled him. Drinks. England lead by 222. Australia review for caught behind against Robinson! And it\u2019s a stinker. Robinson avoided a bumper from Cummins, taking his eyes off the ball, but Alex Carey thought it might have clipped his glove on the way through. Cummins reviewed, a little reluctantly, and replays showed that it missed everything. Australia have no reviews left, a state of affairs that cost them dearly at Trent Bridge in 2013 and Headingley four years ago. 50th over: England 214-7 (Moeen 8, Robinson 2) Moeen tries to drive Lyon and edges the ball not far wide of Boland at backward point. Lyon has made himself at home in Moeen\u2019s subconscious ever since the start of the 2017-18 Ashes, and Moeen doesn\u2019t seem entirely sure whether he should run towards this particular danger \u2013 figuratively and literally. Four singles from the over. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. It looks like Ollie Robinson\u2019s use of the mouth has gone down about as well as Tony Greig\u2019s bouncers at Dennis Lillee in 1974-75. \u201cIt\u2019s like the song We Didn\u2019t Start the Fire,\u201d said Lillee, although he and Jeff Thomson did pour about 500 gallons of petrol in it. 49th over: England 210-7 (Moeen 6, Robinson 0) Spicier and spicier. The lead is 217. Australia are pretty bad at fourth-innings chases. Moeen could still clobber some. The Nighthawk is not called upon. Robinson gets promoted. Keeps out a Cummins yorker. Sees out the over. That\u2019s it from me! Need to catch my breath before working out what to write about for this evening. I have no idea yet, so much still could change. From here, the rest of the day is between you and Rob Smyth. The biggest blow is struck! Stokes goes, Cummins from around the wicket with another snorter, in with angle, further off the seam, beats the shot and pulverises the knee roll. Umpire\u2019s finger goes up. Stokes reviews, he has an orange light on contact at the stumps, but it\u2019s smashing the leg bail so it\u2019s not exactly a close one either. 48th over: England 209-6 (Stokes 43, Moeen 5) Stokes whacks a couple more, cutting in front of point. Lyon still has this field with two covers and a long off, so they do want him to play off side presumably. Slip waiting. Stokes finds the squarer cover, Khawaja. Then defends from the crease. Lyon bowls a rare bad ball, overpitches, and Stokes sweeps for four. Cuts two more. England\u2019s brand ambassador is doing his work. 47th over: England 201-6 (Stokes 35, Moeen 5) Luck for England! Cummins short and nasty at the body, Moeen gloves it just past a diving Carey for four. Whose day is it going to be? 46th over: England 197-6 (Stokes 35, Moeen 1) Nip and tuck, nip and tuck. Gosh this is a good Test match. Moeen Ali to join Stokes. The hometown lad, could make himself a hero here. Might even do it with an innings of 30. The lead is 204. Lyon does it again! His classic style, the straightening down the line, Bairstow goes down to sweep, reverse style, and misreads the bounce. Hit in front of middle and leg. Erasmus takes as long to give it as Raza did to get his finger up earlier, a long delay. But does. Bairstow reviews, but that ball is going on straight enough to be flush on leg stump, three reds. 45th over: England 196-5 (Stokes 35, Bairstow 20) Frustration growing for Cummins! First gets belted through point, square of a wrong-footed Green, then he gets Bairstow\u2019s nick off a flailing cut and sees it go just by slip. The Hollies Stand is in full voice. Bumper time, decides Cummins, bringing Smith from slip to midwicket. Labuschagne is at a striagther midwicket, Khawaja at mid on, Head at deep square leg. Plus Boland at fine leg. Bairstow evades the first one. Knocks away a single from the second. Stokes blocks. Another over goes for ten runs. This scoring rate is incredible. The lead is 203. 44th over: England 186-5 (Stokes 34, Bairstow 11) This pair still haven\u2019t gone at Lyon. Bairstow defending, back and across. Lyon around the wicket to the right-hander, wanting to turn down the line of the stumps. Reverse sweep, single to deep point. Then Stokes is caught \u2013 or so it seems, but it\u2019s a bump ball. Top edge, reverse sweep, looping to Boland at short third, who dives forward and comes up saying he held it cleanly. Which he did, but the umpires check the replay and find it hit ground just under the bat before looping up. 43rd over: England 184-5 (Stokes 33, Bairstow 10) Cummins replacing Boland, and after a couple of sighters, Stokes goes hard. Walks at him to whack one ball through mid on, waits back to flash a top-edged cut behind point. Eight runs. Long on is sent back, joining deep square, fine leg, and deep point. Stokes glances one. Bairstow another. Just the 10 off the over then. 42nd over: England 174-5 (Stokes 24, Bairstow 9) Lyon keeps working. The lead is 180. Australia need to break the partnership. England need at least another 70. Bairstow fiddles down the leg side and misses, but keeps his back foot down as Carey gets across to take. Only score is a Stokes single to start the over. 41st over: England 173-5 (Stokes 23, Bairstow 9) Delicate from Bairstow, reaching for Boland and guiding him just past Green at gully for four. The fates have not been with Boland today, in the way they have on other days. Twice Bairstow miscues badly, hard into the ground trying to wallop through cover. Third time he gets it, but the point sweeper fields. 40th over: England 167-5 (Stokes 22, Bairstow 4) Leading edge from Stokes to mid off, scampers a run. Bairstow seeps one. The singles off Lyon tick over. To answer Michael Keane\u2019s question, the session times were: 11 to 13:15 13:55 to 16:10 16:10 until presumably 19:10? Given we can add a rain half hour as well as the usual extra half hour. 39th over: England 163-5 (Stokes 20, Bairstow 2) Boland from the Pavilion End, getting Bairstow off balance with a ball spearing into the stumps. Keeps it out, just about. Slip and gully waiting. Bairstow thrashes a cut but the deep point saves three. And there is the first big Stokes shot! Doesn\u2019t get it cleanly, charging and thrashing at width, the ball bobbling over cover off the angled blade for two. But he does get the next one, advancing again, taking it on the up, hitting the gap straight of cover. Labuschagne moves over a little. Stokes plays a reverse sweep to the seamer, one run to deep backward point. 38th over: England 155-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 1) Lyon to begin from the City End. Steve Smith at slip for Stokes. Short third for the reverse, deep backward point for the cut, cover and extra cover, long off for the lofted shot, mid on, deep midwicket, short fine leg. A sweeper\u2019s field. And Stokes does play the reverse sweep, on the bounce straight to Boland at short third. No run. As per the old debate, wonder if you need the long off especially, before he\u2019s even tried a big shot. Stokes is anchored to the crease in this over, hit on the pad twice, defending the rest. Another maiden. We\u2019re back\u2026 what will the second session bring? Barnaby Jenkins. \u201cPutting my son to bed here in Sydney with the cricket on in the background. Quietly singing to myself as I go. Just before lights out, he asks me, \u2018Dad, what\u2019s a shit Moeen Ali?\u2019\u201d What a session of cricket. Joe Root started with his foot pressed flat to the floor, as though no time at all has passed since he finished batting on the first day. Pope was blown away early, but Brook went with Root strike for strike. Then Australia found their way back into the contest through Lyon, extracting first Root, then Brook, to go to 493 Test wickets. England have a lead, and have power in their batting, but have a lot of work to do between Stokes, Bairstow and Moeen. The match beautifully in the balance! Grab a snack. 37th over: England 155-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 1) So close, but Bairstow survives! In-ducker from Boland, seam movement, smashes the pad. Umpire Raza takes a long time, then slowly puts the finger up. Contact is high on the pad with some angle in. Looks like it might be clipping the leg bail if anything. And DRS gives Bairstow a green light by about one millimetre, at the top corner of the bail. Would have been an unlucky dismissal had a millimetre been hitting, it looked too high live. Next ball, pad again, appeal again, Raza keeps his finger holstered. Australia have one review left so they don\u2019t chance it. England reach lunch in safety! 36th over: England 155-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 1) Another quiet one from Lyon. A single to Bairstow to start his scoring day, two blocks from Stokes. 35th over: England 154-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 0) Boland comes back, having switched ends to have the pavilion at his back, and Stokes gives him the charge to deflect four to fine leg. Bairstow follows up by nearly getting run out, charging down and being sent back, beating the throw from point but he\u2019s injured his hand in the process. Did that throw clip his hand? Seems so. \u201cEnjoying the OBO,\u201d writes David Roche. \u201cAgree that we need specialist third umpires, and the decision on the LBW referral for Lyon to Stokes demonstrates why. If an umpire makes the right decision but for the wrong reason, it is still a bad decision.\u201d I should clarify, and I\u2019m pretty sure on this but not 100 percent, that the guidelines for DRS give the umpires no latitude. In the same way as there is a set order for looking at each piece of teach, it also says that any movement on the soundwave at the right time must be treated as an edge. Because otherwise the decision-making is too opaque, and the optics for spectators who don\u2019t understand the difference would be too difficult to explain. If so, it\u2019s not the right process, but it\u2019s a compulsory process. 34th over: England 150-5 (Brook 46, Stokes 9) So it\u2019s Bairstow and Stokes, the Headingley duo, the ones who got that chase moving in 2019. Bairstow defends his first two balls against Lyon to end the over. The lead is 157. Oh ho! Do your best Ravi Shastri voice and say, \u201cAgainst the run of play!\u201d Straightforward stuff really, Brook plays a pull shot at a short ball, doesn\u2019t get the placement or elevation, and although he hits it hard Labuschagne dives to his right at midwicket and takes a very good catch. Five down. 33rd over: England 150-4 (Brook 46, Stokes 9) A long delay for a change of ball halfway through the over. Hazlewood gets bounce with the new one, and after Stokes hits it to point he runs down the pitch shaking his hand, it must have jarred. Gets back on strike, then leaves a ball outside off stump. I was joking earlier about Stokes not playing shots, but it is a little odd by the time it\u2019s 9 off 26 balls. He could hit the hammer at any moment, of course. If you want our round-up of the county champs and the Blast results over the past week, here you go. 32nd over: England 146-4 (Brook 44, Stokes 7) England lead by 151 runs with this pair at the crease and big hitters to come in Bairstow and Moeen. Another hundred runs and they\u2019re in a good spot. Brook punches one run off Lyon to cover. Stokes defends! Then, gets his front leg out of the way and jams a single off leg stump while half falling over. 31st over: England 144-4 (Brook 43, Stokes 6) Yep, eventually we get ball-tracking showing that the Stokes appeal from Lyon was missing off stump. Still, if that had gone to hand off the pad, he would have been given out caught on that evidence. It\u2019s a clear flaw with the system. Brooks has another waltz at Hazlewood and skews three runs through cover. Stokes gets a couple more. 30th over: England 137-4 (Brook 39, Stokes 3) A couple of singles, then Stokes survives an lbw referral upstairs. The ball gets under the toe of the bat and hits pad. I thought just outside the line, maybe turning away. The DRS though, says he\u2019s hit it. Which he hasn\u2019t. The disturbance on the soundwave graph is long and low, which is a scrape sound, not an edge. But as so often, the inability to read the technology correctly means the wrong decision is made. Any noise is held to be an edge, even though a qualified sound engineer could tell you what kind of noise it was. Resume the argument for specialist third umpires. \u201cI\u2019ve just noticed that the forecast for tomorrow has improved, at least for the afternoon. Might England be being a bit more circumspect now that there\u2019s a chance of some play tomorrow after all?\u201d Right this minute, Richard O\u2019Hagan, they are. Not sure how long it will last. 29th over: England 135-4 (Brook 38, Stokes 2) Twelve balls for one run, Stokes, after blocking the last of the previous over. Hazlewood bowls to Brook, who takes four balls to put Stokes back on strike. England\u2019s captain covers his off stump and drops the ball to backward point, no run. Finally, he charges Hazlewood but gets nothing to hit, can only bunt a run to midwicket. 28th over: England 133-4 (Brook 37, Stokes 1) Hot stat alert: Carey is now one stumping away from a share of the record for an Ashes Test. Which is four. Those already there? Bert Oldfield, twice, what a man. From a stretcher-bearer in the First World War trenches to gloving everything that came his way. Affie Jarvis, the cheerful South Australian with the fine moustache. And Jack Blackham, the man who kept Jarvis out of the team for most of his career. Elevate Carey to that company, and it will be a grand day for lovers of history. You\u2019d like his chances of getting one more from this England team. Two leg byes and a single from the Lyon over. 27th over: England 130-4 (Brook 36, Stokes 1) What doing? What are we seeing? Josh Hazlewood has bowled a very respectable over tight on an off stump line, and, well, England\u2019s captain, he just, he blocked it out. I don\u2019t know how else to say it. He defended each ball, solidly, getting forward. Is this some new level of mind game? Get them expecting something and then keep changing? Ever twisting and turning? Twirling towards freedom? The whole ground sits in disbelief. 26th over: England 130-4 (Brook 36, Stokes 1) This is the real quiz. Stokes to the middle. Five balls to face. And he\u2026 defends four and then tucks a single? What\u2019s this? He falls! It has been a joyously entertaining morning\u2019s work, but noon has passed and Joe Root\u2019s pumpkin has arrived. He gallops out at Lyon, isn\u2019t to the pitch, faces serious turn, and Carey takes the ball well outside leg stump after it beats the inside edge, and knocks off the bails. Didn\u2019t have a stumping before he went to India earlier this year, Carey, but he has three in this match. 25th over: England 129-3 (Root 46, Brook 36) We had a later than usual drinks break there because of the extended session. At last, here\u2019s Hazlewood. Had some errors with our block order if you were confused there, sorry. Brook lays into him just as hard. Smokes him through the covers for four! 24th over: England 121-3 (Root 45, Brook 29) More from Lyon. This is statement batting. Picks off two through point, then clouts four over cover. No one gets an easy time here. 23rd over: England 113-3 (Root 44, Brook 22) Cummins bowling his seventh over of the spell. A Brook single. Root just keeps out a yorker, looked as good as the Pope one. Cummins goes around the wicket to the right-hander, looking for something different. Root guides a run to deep third. If you\u2019re interested, Joe Root today has also gone to 21st on the list of Ashes run-scorers, passing The Big Ship, Warwick Armstrong, and gone to 11th on England\u2019s list, passing Kevin Pietersen. 22nd over: England 111-3 (Root 43, Brook 21) Lyon on to bowl, and Brook takes to him immediately! A cut shot through point, a sweep behind square, four runs from each. Two more with another sweep, two with a clip, one more with a normal shot to midwicket. Just the 13 from the over. England have been ruthless this morning. 21st over: England 98-3 (Root 43, Brook 8) Serious seam movement inwards from Cummins as Brook leaves, the ball bouncing just over his off bail. Cummins drops to his haunches for a second in disbelief. Then fires one past the outside edge as Brook charges and wafts, before staying home and leaving another very close to the off stump. Impressive burst from the bowler. Searching, gets too straight and Brook picks off one run to deep midwicket. A rare quiet over on the scoreboard. Root has just gone past Richie Richardson into 17th spot for most Test runs against Australia. Currently 2177 at an average of 41. 20th over: England 97-3 (Root 43, Brook 7) First boundary for Brook, picking off a full straight ball from Green through midwicket. Four, then one. Root comes way across his stumps and nearly loses leg, trying to catch up with the ball and missing. Stays leg side of the next ball and glides one. \u201cLiked the Jonathan Liew piece, while it\u2019s not Father\u2019s Day in this hemisphere,\u201d writes Eamonn Maloney. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed so that cricket fans are usually made through their fathers, but often so also is the way they interact with the game. My brother noticed a comment I made on the OBO yesterday which led to a discussion about how dad used to call up the ABC radio\u2019s Grandstand coverage from the rotary phone in the hallway, in a bid to have his (strongish) opinions amplified. Required more patience and commitment in those days but there\u2019s a clear line from the dialing digits to the typing thumbs.\u201d 19th over: England 90-3 (Root 42, Brook 1) Cummins continues, no Hazlewood. Root takes him off the pads to deep midwicket, where Head gets razzed in front of the Hollies sliding across to keep it to two runs. Same dose next ball. Scoring so easily. Then Root tries the scoop again but there\u2019s too much pace from Cummins and the line is straighter, over middle stump. Misses. More luck with conventional play, picking off a full leg-stump error through deep backward for four. Matt Dony has been pondering Joe Root too. \u201cAs you eloquently explained yesterday, it\u2019s aa fool\u2019s errand dwelling on \u2018what ifs\u2019. If you change one thing, you change everything. But, I do wonder what could have happened had Root stepped down from the captaincy a bit earlier. He is a sensational batter, even more fluid and creative without the (cliche klaxon!) Burden Of Captaincy. My suspicion is that Stokes became captain at the perfect time for him, so any intervening period between an earlier Root abdication and now would have been played in a different style and with a different approach. But surely Root would have flourished whatever. Alas, we\u2019ll never know. We can simply enjoy the now. It\u2019s impossible to know whether it\u2019s the best timeline, but it\u2019s a million miles away from the darkest timeline.\u201d 18th over: England 82-3 (Root 34, Brook 1) Cameron Green is the man for all jobs now. He was at first slip in the previous over, Khawaja out from there. Now he\u2019s bowling ahead of Hazlewood. Is there a problem? Hazlewood was off the field briefly. He\u2019s back on now at fine leg. Seems to be warming up. Green from the City End. Root slices a single. Harry Brook does likewise. Deep third and deep backward point now for Root, along with a deep square leg and a fine leg. So Green has licence to bounce him? Slip, cover, mid off, mid on, midwicket. Runs anywhere square on the off side, and Root goes there, driving in front of point for two. Then a single square. 17th over: England 77-3 (Root 30) Finally one goes down! Australia get something back their way, last ball of the over. It starts with Cummins to Root, who is taking a few breaths between bursts of freneticism, defending a couple. Cover is open for him, point and mid off now stationed, and he takes a run to deep third. Nathan Lyon fields, then does some bowling warm-ups. He\u2019ll surely be on soon. He comes up to backward point for Pope, and that\u2019s a mistake because Pope cuts fine, right where Lyon had just been, for four. Cummins zeroes in on off stump and Pope stays behind it. But Pope isn\u2019t expecting the fullest pitch. That\u2019s the perfect yorker, right on the line, a sharp angle in at the stumps from wider on the crease, and it sneaks under the toe of the bat to flatten off stump. Brilliant fast bowling. 16th over: England 72-2 (Root 29, Pope 10) Interesting. Cummins is usually quick with a bowling change if someone is getting tonked. But perhaps he thinks that doing so with Boland now would be some sort of defeat. Boland gets another over, and tucks up Root with two really good balls, before erring in width and being slashes for four! Leaning away from the ball is Root to make more room, such a shot. Then plays a crisp straight drive but mid on is able to stop it. Glides another single. The sun is shining. He can do whatever he likes. It must feel so good to be Joe Root right now. 15th over: England 67-2 (Root 24, Pope 10) Cummins said before the match about that there would be times when England\u2019s approach had him under pressure as a captain, and said there was nowhere he would rather be. This is the moment. He bowls to Pope, who takes two more runs through square leg. Green back in the gully for Pope, the cordon applauding a decent ball. Making a point of keeping their own spirits up. A drive on the bounce to cover. Only two men out, deep square and fine leg. Sun shining strongly now. Pope strokes a drive for three, straight of Labuschagne again, who is lurking between cover and mid off trying to be both. Root pinches one more and keeps the strike. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for a day of excesses!\u201d emails Tony White. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear from the OBOers who failed their Bazball GSCE\u2019s trying to understand JR\u2019s rocking start to the day!\u201d 14th over: England 61-2 (Root 23, Pope 5) This was always the question: would Boland be susceptible to a Bazzing? He overpitches here and Root drives him perfectly through extra cover. Then opens the face and dabs so fine that it goes on the bounce to Smith at second slip. Green is back closer to the action now, backward point. Head is down at deep third. Labuschagne at cover. No mid off. Then a mid on, midwicket, forward square leg, long leg, so Boland can target the stumps. He doesn\u2019t, and Root gets the glide away for a run this time. Pope advances at Boland and hits that gap at mid off for four! His first runs of the innings. Boland responds with a better length and draws a rare defensive shot. Then a single to point. \u201cI see Root has done that thing where he unobtrusively races to 20 odd runs without doing anything flashy,\u201d writes Martin Lloyd. \u201cI imagine once he\u2019s in he\u2019ll start to play some shots...\u201d 13th over: England 51-2 (Root 18, Pope 0) Off strike with a leg bye goes Pope, so he still hasn\u2019t scored but gets Root back into the action. Root is happy with a single tucked off his leg stump. More leg byes for Pope, four of them to fine leg. Cummins hasn\u2019t got his line right. Australia, dare I say, rattled early. 12th over: England 45-2 (Root 17, Pope 0) Too straight for thee! Scott Boland strays onto the pads and Root whips him through midwicket with elan. Lovely. Then Boland gets his line right, and Root plays his reverse again for six. Gets plenty of that one, over the keeper who is up to the stumps. It soars away! He enjoys it so much that he plays it again, next ball. Doesn\u2019t get a full piece, skews the ball flatter, but just over slip and away for four. That takes Green out of the cordon, Australia putting their tallest man back on the rope at deep third. So Root taps the ball into the gap at point for two runs. Sensational batting. 11th over: England 29-2 (Root 1, Pope 0) Ummmm, ok? That\u2019s one way to start the day. Cummins bowls length, and Root tries the reverse scoop over deep third without having seen a delivery yet. Misses it by a mile, and it misses his stumps. Settles for a single to fine leg a couple of balls later. Only three balls in the over, finishing the one that was abandoned yesterday. Here we go. \u201cAppreciate the blog from Perth (Australia),\u201d writes the helpfully specific Brendan Crozier. \u201cAny reason why play has not started early today, given the time lost yesterday?\u201d They don\u2019t do that here, Brendan. The theory is that because the evenings are light, you can play late. But that only works if the sky is clear. There\u2019s also an old argument that it\u2019s not fair to start play early because people have planned their arrival time and would miss that part of play. But if the overs aren\u2019t bowled, they miss that part of play anyway. But, yes. There is never an early start in England, there is time added to the end of the day. And we\u2019ll have 15 minutes added to each of the first two sessions before the breaks, too. Now, here\u2019s the kind of email I can get behind. From Dennis Johns. \u201cMorning Geoff. Nice to see you here this morning, looking forward to the Aussie perspective on an absolute snorter of a Test match. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m writing. I was reading Dead Lions (spy novel, part of the Slow Horses series) by Mick Heron this morning and found a reference to the OBO in it! We\u2019re told that a character called Harper \u2018emails the Guardian\u2019s over-by-over cricket blog on a regular basis\u2019. It was published 2013 - did we know this? Does the OBO get a shout out in any other novels? Enjoy the day\u2019s play.\u201d Here\u2019s a call out to the OBO readership. Another question, do we have a collective name for such? What is the Beyhive of the OBO? Of course you can send me an email through the day, or get in touch with Twitter, for thoughts large and small. Have at it. I\u2019ve just settled on an executive decision for today though. Most of the emails already have been about Robinson and Khawaja and sledging, and I appreciate that people have views on it, but I\u2019d rather not sidetrack the coverage this morning into more back and forth on a well tilled field. It will be the same discussion we\u2019ve had time and again: some people are all for it, some say it\u2019s the understandable by-product of competition, and some find it diminishes their enjoyment of the game. Robinson has extensive form, and you would think that someone with his history might engage in more thought or tread more carefully. But he doesn\u2019t, and hasn\u2019t, so most likely won\u2019t. There\u2019s not much point hashing it all over. And last on our list of links, one of the great mysteries of the OBO. I am only its servant, so who am I to question? Behold, the Test Match Special overseas listening link. Lastly, we\u2019ve had a huge response overnight to this one from Jonathan Liew, who arrived yesterday with a pensive air on Father\u2019s Day. \u201cI\u2019m going to write about my dad,\u201d he said when it came time to discuss column topics. And, what a piece. This is a top piece from Barney Ronay, capturing the tension of old and new, and what can be impressively irritating about Bazball for anyone not on the inside of it. If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes a podcast wrap while walking to the ground or making a sandwich, there\u2019s Day 3 on The Final Word with me and Adam Collins. Here. I wrote about the shifting moods of an English summer and an English Test match, which is still fitting given that we\u2019ve seen at least three of those moods in the last few hours. And here is Simon\u2019s Ashes Diary, throwing together the vignettes into some semi-coherent whole. Like making a quiche. Once that\u2019s done, check in with Ollie Robinson\u2019s press conference via Simon Burnton. Played a few shots last night, did Robinson. Let\u2019s play our favourite game: Read What We Wrote on The Guardian Yesterday! I suggest you start with Ali Martin\u2019s match report. Be informed. As ever for England, Joe Root is the key. Played like a dream on the first day, made his 30th career ton, and he will resume on 0 not out. So nearly could have been out three times yesterday, a couple of lbw shouts and a caught behind appeal that missed by a millimetre. It was a tough time to bat. This morning, not so much. England are already on the field, in a big circle at the southern end doing keepy-uppy warm-ups. Some Australian players are on the eastern side of the ground doing cricket warm-ups. Cricket? Nerds. Hello from Edgbaston! The sun is out, and the forecast is set fair, though there is still plenty of scattered cloud about and was the occasional cold blast of wind as we made our way into the ground. It should, overall, be a good batting day for England, but the forecast for tomorrow is awful. So, if this is the last reliable day, what does the new England philosophy demand? They\u2019re 28 for 2, leading by 35 runs. They have, in theory, 98.3 overs of play today. So do they go hell for leather for two sessions and then throw Australia in? We\u2019ll see just how Baz the Ball might be over the day."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319b9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/i-have-come-for-a-sign-of-life-relatives-cling-to-hope-after-greek-shipwreck", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I have come for a sign of life\u2019: relatives cling to hope after Greek shipwreck", "lead": "Families of missing desperately search for information about their loved ones after maritime disaster", "author": "Helena Smith in Malakasa", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:27:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175035", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee30a162ca65a7410f56f11ecbd432026c3da8a/0_233_7000_4200/500.jpg", "body": "Six days have elapsed since a fishing trawler piloted by people smugglers sank with unimaginable loss of life off Greece and yet they still come: relatives armed with pictures, praying that in the aftermath of the maritime disaster, loved ones are not among the perished. On Monday it was outside the steel gates of a migrant facility in Malakasa, north of Athens, that emotions were on display. \u201cI have come for a sign of life of my uncle Nadim,\u201d said Zohaib Shamraiz whose first stop was the fenced camp after flying into Greece from Barcelona. \u201cI know for sure he was on the boat because I talked to him five minutes before he boarded. He said there were hundreds on the ship and I told him: \u2018Please don\u2019t get on it. Wait for another one.\u2019\u201d The 21-year-old Pakistani reached Europe with his family as a boy six years ago. Nadim Muhammed, the uncle he had played with as a child in his native Punjab, had wanted to follow suit. \u201cHe had three children,\u201d said the soft-spoken trainee taxi driver, with tearful eyes as he showed pictures of Nadim in a traditional shalwar kameez. \u201cHe wanted to leave because he was very poor. He worked for $20 a day. Look, this is another picture of him in Libya the night before the ship left.\u201d Of the estimated 750 men, women and children smugglers are believed to have packed on to the vessel, the vast majority are thought to have hailed from Pakistan. Witness testimonies given to the Greek coastguard suggest that Pakistanis were singled out and \u201clocked\u201d in the hold together with women and children, which is why investigators believe their mortality rates are so much higher. Afghans, Syrians and Egyptians were kept in groups with almost no space to move on the upper deck. \u201cWe now know there were around 400 of our people onboard,\u201d said Shahid Nawab, the head of Greece\u2019s 30,000-strong Pakistani community, emerging from the migrant facility. \u201cOf the 104 survivors, only 12 are from Pakistan and they are in this camp. Of the 78 bodies found so far, most we think are Pakistani.\u201d Nawab, who reached Greece \u201cwhen it was so much easier to get to Europe\u201d on Christmas Day 2000, said the 30,000-strong community had rallied to help the survivors. \u201cWe have collected clothes and food and we will offer them shelter when they are allowed to leave this camp,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is in national mourning today.\u201d Greek migration ministry officials on Monday described survivors as still reeling from the ordeal of the odyssey onboard the Italy-bound ship. \u201cThey\u2019re still shocked and in a very bad psychological state,\u201d said one standing outside the camp\u2019s turnstile entry points. \u201cThey\u2019re sleeping a lot. They\u2019ll leave here once they have gone through the process of applying for asylum.\u201d The old trawler, repurposed by the Egyptian smuggler network behind the doomed voyage, ran into engine trouble after departing Libya on 9 June. Passengers have told of how they resorted to drinking seawater and their own urine when supplies of fresh water ran out. Others were reported fainting under the hot sun as the engine repeatedly failed and stalled before the ship listed and capsized 47 nautical miles south of Pylos. A search and rescue operation involving patrol ships and military helicopters was extended at the weekend. Survivors who had been hospitalised, mostly suffering from hyperthermia, are expected to join the 71 other men rescued from the shipwreck in Malakasa this week."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ba", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/starmer-reassures-north-sea-workers-as-labour-lays-out-energy-and-climate-plan", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Starmer reassures North Sea workers as Labour lays out energy and climate plan", "lead": "Speech in Scotland shows willingness to face energy dilemma head-on, but green groups say fossil fuel end date must come soon", "author": "Fiona Harvey and Severin Carrell in Edinburgh", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:26:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175053", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/782099f8f69ef91e0180277507c3ede091d38411/113_566_5137_3082/500.jpg", "body": "Scotland was a brave choice as the venue for the launch of Keir Starmer\u2019s new energy and climate policy. Back in March, Rishi Sunak was planning to hold his \u201cenergy day\u201d in Aberdeen, the UK\u2019s oil and gas capital, but after criticism he switched to the much safer Oxfordshire. Starmer knows that Labour needs to win back lost seats in Scotland, so visiting the Scottish capital for an important speech was a canny move. More than that, though, taking the launch to Edinburgh showed a willingness to face head-on Labour\u2019s energy dilemma: how to shift the UK economy to a low-carbon footing, as net zero demands, without destroying high-quality jobs in carbon-intensive industries. Scotland exemplifies this: with a 200,000-strong North Sea oil workforce, and most of the UK\u2019s installed base of windfarms, the Scottish economy and its workers are caught between the fossil fuel past and the renewable future. Starmer told them they could choose both, with a carefully managed transition. \u201cThe moment for decisive action is now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out, the opportunities this change can bring for Scotland and your community will pass us by, and that would be a historic mistake. An error, for the future of Scotland, as big as the Thatcher government closing the coalmines. My offer is this: a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs \u2026 to harness the wealth that is in our air, in our seas, in our skies, and use it to serve the interests of your community.\u201d The Labour leader has weathered a torrid few weeks on this issue, criticised for being too green and not green enough. He was forced to delay planned green investment of \u00a328bn a year to the second half of a prospective Labour parliament, to the chagrin of economists and green campaigners. But his net zero policies earned him the title of \u201cthe political wing of Just Stop Oil\u201d from the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, and the ire of sections of the trade union movement, one of whose leaders called him \u201cnaive\u201d for halting new North Sea licences. The Tories redoubled their attacks on Monday. A party spokesperson said: \u201cLabour have an energy surrender plan to abolish British oil and gas and an economic plan to saddle the British people with billions of debt and borrowing. Written and funded by the Just Stop Oil extremists, Labour\u2019s energy policy appeases their eco-zealot paymasters and puts dictators like Putin in charge of setting the price of your energy bills. Only the Conservatives can be trusted to grow the economy while delivering secure British power.\u201d Starmer may brush this off as \u201cTory crap\u201d, but his need to reassure workers and billpayers has led to some difficult decisions. The Rosebank oil and gas field, one of the biggest potential fields in the North Sea, is likely to receive final approval soon from the Conservative government. Labour will not try to stop production from the field, if elected to government, because rescinding licences could open the UK to legal wrangling and claims of billions in compensation. Labour must also be uncomfortably conscious of how big oil and gas companies could create difficulties before the election, if they threaten to start cutting jobs now. For all these reasons, reassurances over the future of the North Sea took precedence at the policy launch. As each of the key members of the Labour leader\u2019s top team \u2013 Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor; Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary; Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader \u2013 took to the stage, the message was clear: North Sea oil and gas would continue to be produced \u201cfor decades to come\u201d. At some point, that reassurance must be called into question. Conservative policy failures on net zero, as ministers vow to \u201csqueeze every last drop from the North Sea\u201d while also laying claim to climate leadership internationally, have led to accusations of hypocrisy. John Gummer, the chair of the committee on climate change and a former Conservative environment secretary, recently said: \u201c[The government are] asking other people not to do what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Environmental groups, keen to praise what they see as a good overall package of measures from Labour \u2013 including the eventual \u00a328bn-a-year investment, a \u00a3500m a year jobs bonus for companies setting up low-carbon industries here, the creation of a national energy company called Great British Energy, and insulation for 19m homes \u2013 were reluctant to criticise. Poor countries, experiencing the devastation of the climate crisis, have grown tired of rich countries arguing they can continue to produce fossil fuels while claiming to be climate leaders. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not credible for any political party to claim to be a leader on climate change whilst happily admitting it will continue to worsen the climate crisis through oil and gas burning for \u2018decades\u2019. \u201c My country of Kenya is suffering from the droughts and storms caused by rich nations historic emissions and despite still battling poverty we\u2019ve got our electricity mix to 92% renewables. We need parties in rich countries like the Labour party to be allies in this energy transition, not continue to prop up the fossil fuel industry which is causing climate misery across the globe.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319bb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/19/joe-root-takes-pleasure-in-the-reverse-sweep-cricket-ashes", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Joe Root takes pleasure in the reverse sweep, as should everyone else | Andy Bull", "lead": "Even the old sorts can appreciate the sporting artistry of the manoeuvre that Root instigated for England at Edgbaston", "author": "Andy Bull", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:15:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175072", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/739ea518e7314db44192fa8f9621d4ca8f9a68fb/0_118_3536_2121/500.jpg", "body": "The way Mushtaq Mohammad tells the story it all started in a one-day game at Vale Farm in Wembley, Middlesex against Rothmans\u2019 International Cavaliers, on 15 August 1965. You know it must have been a Sunday because the Cavaliers were a hit-and-giggle exhibition team set up by Ted Dexter and Bagenal Harvey to fill the gap in the afternoon TV schedules on the sabbath. They paid Mohammad \u00a310 a game to play, which, like the 209 Middlesex made off their 40 overs, felt a lot more back then than it sounds now. Fred Titmus was bowling, and Mohammad says he was wondering where, exactly, his next run was going to come from. \u201cSo I looked around and realised that the only gap was at third man.\u201d The problem was how to hit the ball there. So next time Titmus came in, Mohammad decided to flip his grip around and reverse sweep it to the boundary. Titmus, who, like everyone else, had never seen such a thing done in polite society, was apparently so offended that he appealed (hoping, presumably, that the umpire would be of the same kind of mind as the one who gave Dermot Reeve out lbw when he tried to play the shot in a warm-up game on tour in India 30 years later \u2013 \u201cbad cricket, not good, play straight, good cricket\u201d, he told Reeve as he walked off). Fortunately for Mohammad, this particular umpire just told Titmus to get on with it. There would be some debate, years later, whether or not Mushtaq had been taught the reverse by his older brother Hanif, who learned it when he was a kid batting in the polo grounds. That\u2019s best left between the siblings, but Mushtaq was certainly the first man anyone can remember seeing play it in a game in England. Not that anyone particularly thanked him for it. For 40-odd years it wasn\u2019t even something you\u2019d necessarily want to lay claim to if you wanted to stay on the right side of MCC. Like sideburns, stubble and a subscription to the Guardian, a penchant for the reverse sweep marked you out as some sort of a Bolshevist. It wasn\u2019t so long ago (in Jimmy Anderson years at least) that England\u2019s chair of selectors Peter May banned his players from even attempting it after Ian Botham was clean bowled playing one against Greg Matthews in a one-day game against Australia. \u201cI have thumbed through the MCC coaching manual,\u201d May said to the press afterwards, \u201cand found that no such stroke exists.\u201d What a shame he wasn\u2019t here at Edgbaston, when there were, by my count, almost 20 in the day. Anyone listening to Test Match Special would have had a fair idea of what May might have made of it. \u201cOh my word! What is he doing? What was that?\u201d Jonathan Agnew spluttered as Joe Root tried, and failed, to reverse-scoop the very first ball of the day over the slips for six. Listen carefully, and you could hear similar eruptions across the country, between great sprays of tea, toast and marmalade. The labradors were still polishing off that lot when Root played it again, to the third ball of Scott Boland\u2019s second over. \u201cThe bloody foo \u2026\u201d \u2013 this one went for six \u2013 \u201c\u2026 flip!\u201d The camera closed in on him, grinning like a kid who got to the ice cream in the freezer. He was enjoying it so much he took another dip at it. When Root plays like this (and he did it during the first half of last summer, in the series against New Zealand and the one-off Test against India) he is as good as anyone has been for England. There\u2019s a skill to it, a sporting artistry, that\u2019s worth even what they\u2019re charging for admission to the Test grounds this summer. It\u2019s improvisation based on a complete expertise of technique. Having mastered all the rules, he knows exactly how to break them, and after being bound by them for the past decade he takes a lot of pleasure in doing it, too. So should everyone else. You can imagine that right across the country the old sorts who like to decry the way they bat today felt, instead, unexpected zest themselves, found that they had a little twinkle in the eye. The only problem was it was all over so quickly. Root went for 46 off 55 balls. There were more, Ben Stokes played three, the same number as Jonny Bairstow, who got out to one. The tailenders were at it too, Ollie Robinson and Stuart Broad played a couple each, and so, of course, did Anderson, who never misses an opportunity to do it. And you like to imagine, too, that kids will be out copying the shot in the parks and playgrounds this weekend, and that, perhaps, one or two of us who, at our age, should maybe know better, might just find ourselves reaching for a poker or umbrella, and thinking: \u201cNow, how did he switch his grip again?\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319bc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-latest-news-moscow-blocking-aid-to-flood-hit-areas-after-kakhovka-dam-destroyed", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: \u2018difficult situation\u2019 in east as Russia deploys more troops to frontline, minister says \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Ukraine deputy defence minister says Russia is continuing efforts to occupy the whole of the Donbas", "author": "Yohannes Lowe, Martin Belam and Helen Livingstone", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:02:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175091", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/20875080d6d8fdfc5e42fa060b2ce3a45e10c186/0_158_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day\u2019s main news: Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said that Russia had concentrated a significant number of units in the east, including air assault troops, but that Ukrainian forces were preventing their advance. She described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d. The British government announced plans to tighten its sanctions policy against Russia, including introducing legislation to keep assets frozen until Moscow has agreed to pay compensation to Ukraine. The new measures will require any individual who has been designated under the sanctions to disclose assets held in Britain. In a phone call on Monday, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d, Downing Street said. Nato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, confirmed on Monday. The Kremlin reportedly said on Monday that Russia\u2019s decision to decline UN help in areas of Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was motivated by security concerns and \u201cother nuances\u201d. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee, which is supported by security experts, said the country\u2019s defence must adapt to focus on the threat posed by Russia, and that a military attack could not be ruled out. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has announced that the capture of the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern part of Zaporizhzhia, brought the tally of liberated settlements up to eight, with 113 sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. France, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia and Hungary signed a letter of intent for the joint purchase of Mistral air defence systems, a source told Reuters. The source said the letter was signed at the start of a defence ministers\u2019 meeting in Paris aimed at coordinating European efforts to enhance air defence capabilities across the continent after Russia invaded Ukraine. Germany\u2019s armed forces only have about 20,000 high explosive artillery shells left, the magazine Der Spiegel reported on Monday, citing confidential defence ministry papers. Countries like Germany have rushed to send supplies of 155m artillery rounds used by howitzers to Ukraine after its invasion by Russia last February, running down stocks for their own defence. Germany\u2019s military needs to build up an inventory of 230,000 shells by 2031 to comply with Nato goals to have enough artillery to withstand 30 days of intensive combat, Reuters cited Der Spiegel as reporting. The ministry aims to present the budget committee with nine contracts for the accelerated purchase of artillery and tank ammunition in coming months, Der Spiegel wrote. Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, has told the Kyiv Independent that the EU and its partners want to bring all perpetrators of international crimes to justice. \u201cNot only war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but also the crime of aggression,\u201d he said, adding that his team was considering what an international trial against Russian crimes in Ukraine may look like. Russia has committed wide-ranging war crimes in Ukraine such as wilful killings and torture, a UN mandated investigative body said in March. The alleged crimes, including the deportation of children, were detailed in a report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which said some acts may amount to crimes against humanity. On Monday, Alexei Navalny\u2019s team announced the launch of a campaign to deter Russians from supporting the war in Ukraine, AFP reports. In a post online, Navalny\u2019s team said it was planning a \u201clong, stubborn and exhaustive but fundamentally important campaign where we will turn people against the war\u201d. \u201cAgainst the dead-end that Putin crazily and dumbly put us in on 24 February 2022,\u201d it said, referring to the day Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine. It said it planned to fundamentally change Russian public opinion within months. Russia has introduced strict laws banning criticism of its army\u2019s actions in Ukraine. Organisations and lawyers that have campaigned for Russians critical of the offensive have faced increasing pressure. On Monday, Russian state media reported that Agora, a leading human rights group that provides legal help in political cases, was labelled as \u201cundesirable\u201d. You can read the full story (which relates to the blog post at 16:40) here: An EU report will this week say that Ukraine has met two out of seven conditions to start membership negotiations, two EU sources said. In a highly symbolic move, the EU granted Ukraine formal membership candidate status a year ago \u2013 four months after Russia attacked the country amid its efforts to pursue integration with the west. But the EU set seven conditions \u2013 including on judicial reform and curbing endemic corruption \u2013 to launch accession negotiations. Ukraine has called for talks to start this year. The executive European Commission\u2019s report is a milestone in that process. Two senior EU officials who were briefed on the report, which has not been made public, have now said that Ukraine met two of the criteria, Reuters reports. One of the officials said these related to judicial reform and media law. Russian troops hit the Beryslav district in the southern Kherson region with artillery on Monday, injuring three civilians, the regional administration wrote on Telegram, according to the Kyiv Independent. At least five residential buildings, two private residences and an administrative building were said to have been damaged in the attack. These claims could not be immediately independently verified. Russian politician Alexei Navalny announced the start of a new mass campaign against Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine on Monday as he began his latest trial in prison, facing a potential sentence of several more decades behind bars. Reuters reports: Navalny, 47, is already serving sentences totalling 11\u00bd years, and is now facing an array of charges linked to alleged \u201cextremist\u201d activity. Acquittals of opposition figures are practically unheard of in Russia. Journalists who had travelled to the penal colony where Navalny is imprisoned in Melekhovo, about 145 miles east of Moscow, were barred from the courtroom but could initially follow proceedings by video from a room nearby, though the sound was barely audible. Navalny, looking thin with cropped hair and dressed in a black prison uniform, stood and spoke loudly for three minutes. He unsuccessfully demanded access to the courtroom for his elderly parents, and contested the authority of the judge from Moscow to try him in a prison far from the capital. But the feed was later cut, and a court spokesperson said further proceedings would take place behind closed doors \u2026 Navalny\u2019s supporters accuse Moscow of trying to break him in jail, where he has had long spells in solitary confinement, to silence his criticism of Putin. The Kremlin says his case is purely a judicial matter. \u201cWe are not following this trial,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. Ukraine is seeking up to $40bn (\u00a331.2bn) to fund the first part of a \u201cGreen Marshall plan\u201d to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry, a senior Ukrainian official said before an international summit. Politicians and financiers will discuss short-term funding issues and look at long-term reconstruction efforts at the two-day meeting, starting in London on Wednesday and co-hosted by Ukraine and Britain, Reuters reports. It is expected to launch a \u201cwar risk\u201d insurance scheme to cover companies that begin investing in Ukraine again. Russia has deployed more forces to Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontline in an effort to advance toward Lyman and Kupiansk and seize the initiative, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, was mentioned by the Kyiv Independent as reportedly saying. The UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian sanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for frozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. Rishi Sunak told Volodymyr Zelenskiy that it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d when the two leaders spoke on Monday morning. Nato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, confirmed on Monday. The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia\u2019s decision to decline UN help in areas of Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was motivated by security concerns and \u201cother nuances\u201d, Reuters reported. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee has said the Nordic country\u2019s defence must focus on the threat posed by Russia, and that a military attack could not be ruled out. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has confirmed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just tweeted about his phone call with Ajay Banga, the president of the World Bank, on Monday. Ukraine\u2019s president said he thanked the World Bank for its \u201cunwavering support\u201d shown to his country since Russia invaded last February, noting its \u201crapid response\u201d to the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam. He added: I invited the World Bank to reopen its representative office in Ukraine and emphasised that we are interested in cooperation during the post-war transformation of Ukraine, in particular, in overcoming corruption and reducing the share of cash in the Ukrainian economy. Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister has said that even if a deal allowing shipments of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea ends, Russia\u2019s agreement with the UN to ease its own exports will stay in force, the Russian state news agency RIA reported on Monday. Moscow has repeatedly said it sees little chance of agreeing an extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 18 July, because it says western sanctions are thwarting its own UN-backed attempts to export grain and fertiliser. Reuters reports that when asked by RIA if the collapse of the grain deal would invalidate its memorandum with the UN, Alexander Grushko, the deputy foreign minister, said: \u201cNo, it will not.\u201d After invading Ukraine, a leading grain exporter, last year, Russia blockaded its Black Sea ports, contributing to a global surge in food prices. To help persuade Russia to allow grain ships safe passage under the Black Sea initiative last July, a separate three-year agreement was also struck in which the UN agreed to help Russia with its food and fertiliser exports. But Moscow has repeatedly complained that western sanctions imposed in response to the invasion continue to create financial, logistical and insurance obstacles to its shipments. Here are some of the latest pictures on the newswires from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. During a call with Rishi Sunak on Monday, Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Commission president, spoke about continuing financial support for Ukraine after 2023, among other topics. They also discussed efforts to galvanise international support for Ukraine and drive long-term public and private investment, Downing Street said. Kyiv has accused Hungary of barring access to eleven Ukrainian prisoners of war that Russia handed over to the EU country, AFP reports. The Russian Orthodox church said earlier this month that a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war of Hungarian origin had been transferred to Budapest. The prisoners are of Transcarpathian origin \u2013 a region in western Ukraine bordering Hungary \u2013 where about 100,000 ethnic Hungarians live. On Monday, Kyiv said Ukrainian officials had not been able to get access to the returned detainees. \u201cAll attempts by Ukrainian diplomats over the past few days to establish direct contact with Ukrainian citizens have not been successful,\u201d Oleg Nikolenko, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cEssentially they are being kept in isolation,\u201d he said. They communicated with relatives in the presence of third parties and were denied contact with the Ukrainian embassy, Nikolenko added. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister has described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d, saying that Russia has not given up its ambition to occupy the whole of the Donbas, and that is where it is concentrating its offensive forces. In a post on Telegram, Hanna Maliar wrote: The situation in the east is now difficult. The enemy has raised its forces and is conducting an active offensive in the Lyman and Kupyan directions, trying to seize the initiative from us. High activity of enemy shelling is recorded. Intense battles continue. The enemy does not abandon his plans to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Currently, this is the enemy\u2019s main offensive line. Therefore, it has concentrated a significant number of units in the east, in particular the airborne assault units. Our troops act courageously in the face of the enemy\u2019s superiority in forces and means, and do not allow the enemy to advance. In Moldova, which borders Ukraine, the pro-Russian Shor party that has led months of protests has been banned today by the constitutional court. The court declared the party led by Ilan Shor, who lives in Israel, unconstitutional. Its decision triggered an immediate ban and the justice ministry will set up a special commission to complete all legal procedures for the party\u2019s dissolution. At times, Moldova has accused Russian missiles destined for Ukraine of overflying its territory. Russia has troops stationed in the breakaway Transnistria region which is sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine. Rueters reports Shor did not immediately comment on the court\u2019s decision, under which lawmakers from the party will retain their parliamentary mandates as independents, without the right to join other factions in the assembly. The party\u2019s vice-chairman, Marina Tauber, had condemned the court proceedings before the ruling. Since last summer, the party has organised protests in the capital Chi\u015fin\u0103u at which demonstrators called for the resignation of the president, Maia Sandu, and her pro-western government. Sandu has accused Shor of attempting to destabilise Moldova. Shor has denied that the protests are part of a Russian threat. Ukraine will not be formally invited to join Nato at the forthcoming Vilnius summit [See 11.58 BST], but Sweden is hoping to be a full member by the time the 11-12 July gathering is held. Reuters reports that Sweden\u2019s defence minister has said his country is \u201cvery determined\u201d to be admitted to the alliance. P\u00e5l Jonson said: \u201cWe are very determined to become a full-fledged member of the alliance as soon as possible and by Vilnius at the latest. That\u2019s our objective.\u201d Objections from Turkey and Hungary have held up the process of Sweden becoming a member. The US defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin has said it stands ready to help Ukrainian pilots fly and maintain its F-16 fighter jets if Nato states agree to send them to help the country against Russian aggression, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Frank St John. \u201cWe are standing by, ready to not only backfill need as it arises with new F-16 builds but also any modifications to F-16s as well as training, equipment and systems,\u201d he said. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in Beijing that China had renewed promises not to send arms to Russia to fight in Ukraine, although he voiced concern at the actions of private Chinese firms, AFP reports. On Monday, Blinken told reporters: We \u2013 and other countries \u2013 have received assurances from China that it is not and will not provide lethal assistance to Russia for use in Ukraine. We have not seen any evidence that contradicts that. What we do have ongoing concerns about, though, are Chinese firms \u2013 companies \u2013 that may be providing technology that Russia can use to advance its aggression in Ukraine. \u201cWe have asked the Chinese government to be very vigilant about that,\u201d he added. Blinken said, after two days of talks, that China had offered assurances on Russia in \u201crecent weeks\u201d and not exclusively during his visit. The UK government is taking powers to maintain its sanctions on Russia until compensation is paid to Ukraine. The new legislation, announced by foreign secretary, James Cleverly, means that sovereign assets will remain immobilised until Russia pays for damage it has caused to Ukraine. The package of measures enables the government to keep sanctions in place by altering the purposes of the UK\u2019s sanctions on Russia. It will now say that sanctions can also be used for the specific purpose of promoting the payment of compensation by Russia. Cleverly said: As Ukraine continues to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, the terrible impacts of Putin\u2019s war are clear. Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction needs are \u2013 and will be \u2013 immense. Through our new measures today, we\u2019re strengthening the UK\u2019s sanctions approach, affirming that the UK is prepared to use sanctions to ensure Russia pays to repair the country it has so recklessly attacked. Since the invasion of Ukraine last year, Britain has frozen more than \u00a318bn in assets and sanctioned over 1,550 Russian individuals including Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea Football Club. The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia would continue to talk to a group of African countries seeking to mediate in the conflict with Ukraine, and that some of their ideas were workable, Reuters reports. Vladimir Putin on Saturday gave the seven-country African delegation that had come to see him in St Petersburg a list of reasons why he believed many of their proposals were misguided, pouring cold water on a plan already largely dismissed by Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that talks with the delegation would, nonetheless, continue as some of its suggestions could in theory be implemented. He did not say which proposals he was referring to. With Kyiv and Moscow courting the global south, some African leaders have seen a chance to mediate in a war that has hit African countries by disrupting grain and other food supplies and aggravating price inflation. Nato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, confirmed on Monday. \u201cAt the Vilnius summit and in the preparations for the summit, we are not discussing to issue a formal invitation,\u201d he told reporters after meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, adding leaders would talk about how to move Ukraine closer to the alliance. At the same time, Stoltenberg warned against accepting a frozen conflict in Ukraine in return for an end to the war. All sides have long accepted that Ukraine cannot become a Nato member in the middle of a war but Kyiv, backed by Baltic states and Poland, would like a date or a timeline by which it could join once the conflict ends. Scholz, meanwhile, said that Germanywas prepared for the possibility that the war in Ukraine could still last for a while. \u201cWe are preparing for that and adjusting our policies based on that,\u201d he told the news conference, adding that Germany would continue to support Ukraine for as long as necessary. Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, as Kyiv celebrated the liberation of an eighth settlement in the south of the country, two weeks into its offensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 troops. The progress of Ukraine\u2019s forces in both the east and south of the country has been slow with much of the heavy western weaponry and new brigades yet to be committed to battle. The deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar announced that the capture of the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern part of Zaporizhzhia, brought the tally of liberated settlements up to eight, with 113 sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. You can read more from my colleague Daniel Boffey on this story below: Rishi Sunak told Volodymyr Zelenskiy it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d when the two leaders spoke this morning on the phone, PA Media reports. Both men will speak at a conference in London this week on Ukraine\u2019s recovery. A Downing Street spokesman said Sunak \u201cpaid tribute to the bravery of the Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline\u201d. \u201cHe told President Zelenskiy that the UK was firmly behind Ukraine as it continued to push back invading Russian forces,\u201dhe added. The Ukrainian president tweeted to say that he had discussed steps to prepare for security guarantees for Ukraine during the phone conversation (See post at 10:24). Nearly 7,000 Ukrainians have been married in \u201cdistance\u201d ceremonies since the Russian invasion of their country, following a change to civil ceremony rules, the Kyiv Post reports. In 2022, rules were simplified to allow military personnel to be able to marry or register their partnership by distance, meaning one of the partners did not have to be physically present during the ceremony for it be valid. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee has said the country\u2019s defence must focus on the threat posed by Russia and a military attack could not be ruled out, Reuters reports. The Nordic nation has been scrambling to bolster its defences, having applied to join Nato last year as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, though Turkey and Hungary have so far held up Swedish entry into the Western alliance. The committee said the war in Ukraine could escalate into attacks on other countries or even the use of nuclear weapons. In the report, the all-party committee, which includes security experts, said: Russia\u2019s aggressive actions have led to a structural and greatly deteriorated security situation. Russia has further lowered its threshold for military use of force and exhibits a high risk propensity. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I\u2019ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. The UN has accused Moscow of continuing to block humanitarian aid deliveries to Russian-occupied areas in eastern Ukraine that have been affected by the recent Kakhovka dam rupture. \u201cWe urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. Aid cannot be denied to people who need it,\u201d the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in a statement. Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to bring down the dam, according to exclusive drone photos and information obtained by the Associated Press newswire. Images taken from above the dam appeared to show an explosive-laden car atop the structure, and two officials said Russian troops were stationed in a crucial area inside the dam where the Ukrainians say the explosion that destroyed it was centred, AP reported. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has confirmed. The Russian military has \u201chighly likely\u201d started relocating troops from the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has reported that minor damage was sustained in the village of Balki after cross-border shelling from Ukraine. He reported no casualties. Russia\u2019s FSB security service said on Monday it had thwarted a series of Ukrainian \u201csabotage and terrorist plots\u201d targeting Russian-installed officials in Russian occupied territory in Ukraine, and had arrested one woman as part of its investigation. US secretary of state Antony Blinken met Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday. It was the first time a US secretary of state has met the Chinese leader since 2018. All of the Patriot air and missile defence systems provided by the US to Ukraine in April are still working, contrary to claims by Russia, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address. The Kremlin has responded to UN claims that Moscow was blocking aid being provided to flooded areas of Ukraine which Russia occupies in Kherson. Reuters reports it said the decision was motivated by security concerns for UN workers and \u201cother nuances\u201d. Tass quotes Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that from the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the Dnipro \u201cconstant shelling is going on, constant provocations, civilian objects are being shelled, people and the population are being shelled, people are dying, so it\u2019s all very difficult here \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to ensure their safety.\u201d Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence claims that overnight the air force shot down four Kalibr cruise missiles and four \u201cShahed\u201d drones. The claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that he has spoken to Rishi Sunak. Ukraine\u2019s prime minister posted to his social media channels to say that in a call to the British prime minister, they \u201cdiscussed the defence needs of Ukraine and our further cooperation to expand Ukraine\u2019s capabilities on the battlefield, in particular through long-range weapons.\u201d Zelenskiy went on to say: We have coordinated our positions on the eve of the Nato summit in Vilnius. It is important to provide Ukraine with concrete membership prospects. We also discussed steps to implement the peace formula and prepare security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia is ramping up production of missiles with western components. During the conversation, I emphasised the need to increase sanctions pressure. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Monday, Reuters reports. It will be the first time a US secretary of state has met the Chinese leader since 2018, and it could help to facilitate a summit between Xi and US President Joe Biden later in the year. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, citing the regional authority, reports that Kherson and four other settlements remain submerged on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro, and almost 850 houses are still under water. This is a video which purports to show Ukrainian forces in control of Piatykhatky, the eighth southeastern village that Kyiv says it has liberated in the last fortnight. \u201cToday, 18 June, the forces of 128 assault brigade chased out the Russians from the village of Piatykhatky. The Russians ran away leaving equipment and ammunition. Glory to Ukraine!\u201d an unidentified soldier says in the video, Reuters reports. The Guardian has not independently verified the location and time the video was made. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. The regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote: \u201cThe Valuisk municipal district is under attack from from Ukrainian forces. According to preliminary information, seven people were wounded, among them a child.\u201d Gladkov reported that minor damage was sustained in the village of Balki after cross-border shelling from Ukraine. He reported no casualties. These claims could not be immediately independently verified. Ukrainian officials and advisers have been sharing a video clip of the fire in Kherson after Russian shelling which has damaged buses and an emergency vehicle. Russia\u2019s FSB security service said on Monday it had thwarted a series of Ukrainian \u201csabotage and terrorist plots\u201d targeting Russian-installed officials in Russian occupied territory in Ukraine and had arrested one woman as part of its investigation. Reuters reports the FSB said in a statement that the attacks had targeted Russian law enforcement officials and Russian-installed government officials in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, one of four Ukrainian areas that Moscow has claimed to have annexed after staging what Ukraine termed \u201csham referenda\u201d last year. The FSB said it had opened criminal cases against an unnamed woman it described as \u201can accomplice\u201d on charges related to terrorism and the illegal possession of explosives. Reuters reports Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Monday its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to take the village of Novodonetske in the eastern Donetsk region. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne correspondents have reported they have heard explosions in Kherson. This is not an infrequent occurrence, as Russian forces on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro continue to shell Ukrainian held positions on the right bank, and vice versa. Here is a map outlining what we know of the Zaporizhzhia front. Deputy defence minister of Ukraine Hanna Maliar earlier confirmed that Ukraine had retaken the village of Piatykhatky on the western edge of it, the eighth settlement to return to Ukrainian hands in the past fortnight. Her statement confirmed claims about the village that were being reported yesteday by Russian military bloggers and Russian-installed officials in the region. She also said that the battle continues around Bakhmut, writing: In the east, the enemy made a lot of efforts to stop the advance of our troops in the direction of Bakhmut. The overall intensity of fighting in this direction decreased last week, but the fighting continued. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency service has issued an image of firefighters battling a blaze in Kherson. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that \u201cAs a result of Russian shelling in Kherson, a gas tank at one of the city\u2019s gas stations and a company warehouse were on fire at night. Three units of equipment and 15 personnel of the state emergency service went to the scene of the fire.\u201d This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

The Russian military has \u201chighly likely\u201d started relocating troops from the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. \u201cThe DGF [Dnipro Group of Forces] redeployment likely reflects Russia\u2019s perception that a major Ukrainian attack across the Dnipro is now less likely following the collapse of Kakhovka Dam and the resulting flooding,\u201d the MoD writes. All of the Patriot air and missile defence systems provided by the US to Ukraine in April are still working, contrary to claims by Russia, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address. \u201cThey are still here, they are working, all of them are shooting down Russian missiles. As efficiently as possible. Not a single Patriot has been destroyed!\u201d Zelenskiy said. The comment appeared to be a response to remarks made by Russian president Vladimir Putin at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum last week in which he suggested Moscow had destroyed five Patriot systems near Kyiv. Zelenskiy also thanked \u201cour defenders of the sky\u201d, including Ukraine\u2019s pilots, saying they had launched \u201cmore than a hundred group air strikes on enemy positions and rear\u201d over the past week while almost three dozen missiles and about fifty attack drones had been destroyed. Eight settlements have been liberated over the past two weeks in Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive in the Berdyansk and Melitopol regions, including the village of Piatykhatky, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said in a Telegram post. A Russian blogger had reported the capture of the village on the western edge of the Zaporizhzhia front on Sunday after what he described as fierce fighting. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is set to go on trial on Monday on charges of \u201cextremism\u201d that could keep him behind bars for decades, AFP is reporting. The new case against the opposition leader comes as Moscow ramps up its crackdown, more than a year into its offensive in Ukraine, with most key opposition figures behind bars or in exile. Navalny, who used to mobilise massive anti-Kremlin protests, is currently serving a nine-year prison sentence on embezzlement charges that his supporters see as punishment for his political work. The 47-year-old was arrested in 2021 upon returning from Germany, where he recovered from a poison attack the previous year that he blamed on the Kremlin. He has suffered from major weight loss in prison, and now faces up to another 30 years behind bars. Navalny said that prosecutors provided him with 3,828 pages describing all the crimes he is alleged to have committed while in prison. \u201cAlthough it is clear from the size of the tomes that I am a sophisticated and persistent criminal, it is impossible to find out what exactly I am accused of,\u201d Navalny quipped. He has been charged with financing extremist activity, publicly inciting extremist activities and \u201crehabilitating the Nazi ideology\u201d, among other crimes. This will be the first formally political case against him, his team said. The trial will take place at the maximum security IK-6 penal colony at Melekhovo, about 250 kilometres (155 miles) east of Moscow, where Navalny is jailed. Wagner leader and regular Kremlin critic Yevgeny Prigozhin says 32,000 former prisoners have returned home after the end of their contracts with Wagner in Ukraine, AP has reported. According to Prigozhin, 83 crimes have been committed by those who had returned home, which he claimed was \u201c80 times less\u201d than the number committed by those released from prison over the same period without having served with Wagner. The early return of former prisoners to their communities has caused some controversy in Russia, as the Guardian\u2019s Pjotr Sauer reported in April, with at least two already accused of murder since their release: Ukrainian forces may be \u201ctemporarily pausing counteroffensive operations to reevaluate their tactics\u201d, the Institute for the Study of War says in its latest assessment of the conflict. It quoted the head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, Colonel Margo Grosberg, as saying on Friday that he believes \u201cwe won\u2019t see an offensive over the next seven days.\u201d The thinktank noted: \u201cOperational pauses are a common feature of major offensive undertakings, and this pause does not signify the end of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive.\u201d It said Ukraine had \u201ccontinued counteroffensive actions on at least four sectors of the front\u201d on Sunday and \u201cmade limited territorial gains\u201d. Russia had the \u201cmeans, motive and opportunity\u201d to bring down the Kakhovka dam earlier this month, the Associated Press newswire has reported, citing access to exclusive photos and drone footage. It writes: In the days leading up to the single explosion, Ukrainian military drone videos showed dozens of Russian soldiers encamped on a bank of the Dnieper, relaxed as they walked back and forth to the dam with no cover \u2013 suggesting their confidence in their control of the area and especially the dam, which was strategically crucial. The photos, taken from Ukrainian drone footage, obtained by the AP and dated May 28, showed a car parked on the dam, its roof neatly cut open to reveal enormous barrels, one with what appears to be a land mine attached to the lid and a cable running toward the Russian-held side of the river. It\u2019s not clear how long the car remained. A Ukrainian special forces communications official, who also noted the car appeared to be rigged, said he believed the purpose of that was twofold: to stop any Ukrainian advance on the dam and to amplify the planned explosion originating in the machine room and destroy the top of the dam. The car bomb itself would not have been enough to bring down the dam. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve operational secrecy. The explosion detected at 2:54 a.m. local time [on 6 June] registered on Norwegian seismic monitors at nearly magnitude 2. By comparison, a catastrophic explosion at Beirut\u2019s port that killed scores of people and caused widespread destruction registered at a 3.3 on the seismic scale and involved at least 500 tons of explosives. \u201cThat means it\u2019s a significant explosion,\u201d said Anne Str\u00f8mmen Lycke, CEO of the Norwegian earthquake monitoring agency NORSAR. Within a few minutes, water from the Kakhovka reservoir began cascading through the shattered dam, submerging the river\u2019s sand bar islands and flooding much of southern Ukraine, including Russian-controlled territory. The UN has accused Russia of refusing to allow aid deliveries to Moscow-controlled areas affected by flooding following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam almost two weeks ago. \u201cThe government of the Russian Federation has so far declined our request to access the areas under its temporary military control,\u201d Denise Brown, the UN\u2019s humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement. \u201cThe UN will continue to engage to seek the necessary access. We urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. \u201cAid cannot be denied to people who need it.\u201d The statement comes as Ukrainian and Russian authorities said the death toll from the flooding had risen to 52. Russian officials said 35 people had died in Moscow-controlled areas and Ukraine\u2018s interior ministry said 17 had died and 31 were missing, Reuters reported. More than 11,000 have been evacuated on both sides. The collapse of the Moscow-controlled dam on 6 June unleashed floodwaters across southern Ukraine and Russia-occupied parts of the Kherson region, destroying homes and farmland, and cutting off supplies to residents. A team of international legal experts assisting Ukraine\u2019s prosecutors in their investigation said it was \u201c highly likely\u201d the dam\u2019s collapse was caused by explosives planted by Russians. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. The UN has accused Moscow of continuing to block humanitarian aid deliveries to Russian-occupied areas in eastern Ukraine that have been affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam earlier this month. \u201cWe urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. Aid cannot be denied to people who need it,\u201d the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in a statement. The death toll from flooding caused by the collapse of the dam has risen to 52, with authorities in Kyiv reporting 17 dead and 31 missing and Russian officials saying 35 people had died in Moscow-controlled areas. In other key developments: Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to bring down the dam, according to exclusive drone photos and information obtained by the Associated Press newswire. Images taken from above the dam appeared to show an explosive-laden car atop the structure, and two officials said Russian troops were stationed in a crucial area inside the dam where the Ukrainians say the explosion that destroyed it was centred, AP reported. The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the news agency. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, reports suggest. It would be the second gain in the area since Kyiv launched its counteroffensive earlier this month. A Russian-installed official said Ukrainian forces had taken the settlement and were entrenching themselves there while coming under fire from Russian artillery, Reuters reported. If confirmed, this is Ukraine\u2019s first village gain for nearly a week, and marks an apparent escalation of the offensive on the most direct route to Crimea. Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed in its daily update its forces had repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks across three sections of the 1000-km-long frontline and made no mention of Piatykhatky, Reuters reports. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has praised Ukrainian forces for their \u201cvery effective\u201d repelling of enemy assaults near Avdiivka, one of the focal points of fighting in the east, in his nightly video address. The head of the military administration in Avdiivka, a mining town shattered by months of fighting, told national television that Ukrainian forces had advanced about one km (two-thirds of a mile) around the town over the past two weeks. The EU is speeding up arms deliveries to Ukraine to support the counteroffensive against Russian forces, the EU industry chief Thierry Breton told the French daily Le Parisien. He said the EU would be stepping up its efforts, pledging that 1m high-caliber weapons must be provided within the next year. The UK Ministry of Defence said heavy fighting continues to be focused in Zaporizhzhia oblast, western Donetsk oblast and around Bakhmut. It says both sides are taking high casualties, with Russian losses likely to be the highest since the peak of the battle for Bakhmut in March. It also noted that Russian defence operations had been \u201crelatively effective in the south\u201d. Ukrainian forces have destroyed an ammunition depot near the Russian-occupied port city of Henichesk, in the southern region of Kherson, a spokesperson for the Odesa military administration said on Sunday. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa sought to present an African peace mission to Moscow and Kyiv in a positive light, tweeting \u201cAfrica Peace Initiative has been impactful and its ultimate success will be measured on the objective, which is stopping the war\u201d. The Kremlin has said the plan will be \u201cdifficult to realise\u201d while Zelenskiy said allowing negotiations now would just \u201cfreeze the war\u201d. The African delegation is the first since the start of the war to hold separate face-to-face talks with both leaders on their peace initiative."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319bd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/19/cbi-frozen-out-of-meetings-with-other-leading-uk-business-lobby-groups", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "CBI frozen out of meetings with other leading UK business lobby groups", "lead": "Efforts to regain place at intersection of business and government after scandal hampered by refusals to engage", "author": "Rob Davies", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:59:33", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175108", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9ef4c64a5b123370f4ca931916967372eea79e2a/0_141_3088_1852/500.jpg", "body": "The Confederation of British Industry has been frozen out of regular meetings with other leading business lobby groups, hampering its fight for survival after a sexual misconduct scandal. Formerly Britain\u2019s leading voice for business, the CBI has been battling to overhaul its culture and regain trust after multiple allegations of misconduct were made by female employees, including two who said they were raped. Those allegations resulted in an exodus of members from John Lewis to Aviva and led Labour and the Conservatives to cut ties with the organisation. The CBI\u2019s efforts to regain a place at the intersection of business and government are understood to have been complicated by the refusal of fellow business interest groups to engage with it or allow it along to their meetings with ministers. The other four members of the \u201cB5\u201d lobbying groups \u2013 the Federation of Small Business (FSB), British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), Institute of Directors (IoD) and Make UK \u2013 have refused to hold meetings with the CBI, sources confirmed after a report in the Financial Times. The CBI is understood to have asked to be readmitted, only for the other B5 members to refuse, saying it was too soon. Craig Beaumont, the chief of external affairs at the FSB, told the FT: \u201cDecisions for departmental-led meetings are of course for the relevant [government] department. FSB, however, will not hold lobbying-advocacy meetings alongside CBI until we are confident that the scandal is over, the victims have been heard, and we are reassured about current police investigations.\u201d A source at another lobby group questioned the degree of backing the CBI has from British businesses after a recent vote of confidence by members. The source said it was \u201cslightly odd\u201d that votes were only cast by those that had not paused their membership, adding: \u201c[On that basis] of course the vote would result in total support for the CBI.\u201d The Guardian has previously estimated that 50 businesses have paused or cancelled their membership. The CBI said after the vote that it won with 93% backing from its members. It later emerged that turnout was low, with less than a third of the remaining members backing it at the vote, according to testimony given to MPs last week. A second source at another lobby group said it had been \u201cgood to see progress\u201d at the CBI, which launched an external investigation by the law firm Fox Williams and initiated a cultural overhaul after a review by a consultancy, Principia. However, the source said it was \u201ctoo soon to re-engage\u201d while City of London police continue to investigate the allegations, adding that they also wanted to \u201csee evidence that changes have embedded\u201d. They said fellow lobby groups also did not want to meet with the CBI while the government continued to boycott the organisation, in case there was a perception that the remaining members of the B5 were being used as a \u201cback door\u201d for CBI advocacy. On Sunday, Labour confirmed that the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, met the new CBI director general, Rain Newton-Smith, last week. Newton-Smith replaced Tony Danker after his dismissal in April following separate allegations about his own conduct. Danker has said he felt he had been made the \u201cfall guy\u201d for the wider crisis faced by the organisation. He has also said he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for making some colleagues \u201cfeel uncomfortable\u201d. The CBI\u2019s future is still uncertain, particularly in the light of a move by the BCC to set up a new \u201cbusiness council\u201d. Boycotts of the CBI by the government and Labour also remain in place, despite the latter\u2019s apparent relaxation of its position. The CBI told the FT that it was \u201cpressing ahead with an ambitious programme of change to continue to build the trust of members and stakeholders and renew its mandate for an ever-changing economy\u201d. It said the CBI was still \u201ca vital voice in championing business and delivering sustainable growth\u201d. A source close to the organisation told the FT that the CBI engageed with politicians not only through joint meetings with other lobby groups but through other channels as well. The IoD declined to comment, while the BCC and Make UK did not return a request for comment. The CBI has been approached for comment."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319be", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/nhs-nurses-strike-england-royal-college-of-nursing-members-postal-votes", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "NHS nurses strike in England could reach \u2018end of the road\u2019 this week", "lead": "Royal College of Nursing raises doubts over whether enough members will get postal votes in on time", "author": "Daniel Boffey and Denis Campbell", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:58:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175126", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/49355241cb67dcb5bd196fdc57d8e25fa536e0bb/0_201_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "The rolling strikes by NHS nurses could \u201chit the end of the road\u201d this week as the leader of the Royal College of Nursing raised doubts over whether sufficient numbers of members would get their postal votes in on time. The RCN union\u2019s ballot on further industrial action in England will close on 23 June but its general secretary, Pat Cullen, has for the first time suggested an affirmative result is in doubt. Nurses have taken strike action three times since December but the RCN needs the support of its members at another ballot if it is continue to leverage further strikes in its pay negotiation. Under the 2016 trade union laws, at least 50% of union members must vote in a ballot for its result to stand \u2013 equivalent to more than 150,000 of the RCN\u2019s membership. Speaking to the Guardian during a visit to a hospital in Guildford, Surrey, Cullen said the union laws and the lack of online voting option could bring the nurses\u2019 strikes over pay and conditions to an end. She added: \u201cTalking to nurses today, it is clear that they are unhappy with how they\u2019re being treated and feel the NHS is on a precipice. After nurses said they needed better from government, they can vote again on whether to take more strike action until December. There are only a couple of days left to vote by post and it is starting to look like the government\u2019s rules on postal voting could get the better of us.\u201d Cullen, who is seeking a double-digit pay rise for nurses, said she believed the vote would indicate support for further strikes but the 50% voting threshold may not be reached. She said: \u201cNursing staff can still post their ballots back but unless 150,000 people get their votes sent back in the post then the strike has hit the end of the road. Secure online voting was used to select a new Conservative prime minister last year so it is clear they just want to make it harder for working people to have their voices heard. \u201cFor the rest of the week we\u2019ll be visiting hospitals and reminding people that if they want to keep the pressure on the government they have to think of the postbox like a ballot box.\u201d The first national strike in the history of the RCN took place in December, with the union arguing that the pay of some experienced nurses had fallen by 20% in real terms since the Conservative party came to power. The RCN had originally called for a 19% pay rise. Further strikes took place in January and February, and then again in April after the RCN membership rejected an improved offer of a 5% pay rise for 2023-24 and a one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655. This was on top of the average 4.75% pay rise NHS staff had received in 2022-23. The offer was accepted by Unison, the GMB and Royal College of Midwives and others, leading the NHS staff council to accept it. The RCN and Unite, however, remain in dispute. Last week\u2019s three-day strike by junior doctors in England resulted in 108,602 outpatient appointments and operations being postponed, NHS England data revealed. That means a total of 651,232 procedures and consultations have been rescheduled as a result of stoppages by junior doctors, nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists since last December in pursuit of their campaigns for better pay. The number of junior doctors taking part in walkouts is falling, the figures also show. In their first strike in March a maximum of 29,243 joined in. However, in their second strike in April that number had fallen to 27,361. And during last week\u2019s stoppage that number had fallen again to 24,407. The British Medical Association\u2019s junior doctors committee has threatened to stage a three-day strike very month until they get the 35% pay rise they are seeking. It has started balloting members for a fresh legal mandate for another six months of strikes. In the latest RCN ballot the union is seeking a countrywide mandate, rather than at individual trust level. A vote in support would give the RCN a mandate to strike in every NHS trust or other NHS employer in England where members work. The next strikes would involve twice the number of nursing staff at twice as many locations. The results of the ballot are expected to be announced next week."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319bf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/partygate-met-police-assessing-footage-not-previously-provided", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Partygate: Met chief hints at new inquiry after \u2018jingle and mingle\u2019 video", "lead": "Sir Mark Rowley suggests force will investigate again after viewing video of party in December 2020", "author": "Vikram Dodd Police and crime correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:52:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175145", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a3cbb0b5e567c7616fdd6b9483e81bb7133c9690/134_0_4776_2868/500.jpg", "body": "The Metropolitan police commissioner has effectively said that there will be a new inquiry into lockdown breaches in Westminster after a video from a Conservative Christmas party attracted the attention of detectives. Sir Mark Rowley was speaking after video emerged of a December 2020 party surfaced this weekend, sparking outrage. Britain\u2019s top officer, when asked if a new investigation would follow, told an interviewer: \u201cI think we can all guess which way it will go.\u201d The Metropolitan police believe the video counts as new material potentially relating to alleged breaches of Covid rules. The event was billed as a \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d party, and held in December 2020 for Shaun Bailey, then campaigning to be mayor of London, when indoor socialising was banned. Crucially the Met has said the footage was not discovered by an earlier investigation it held into that event, which uncovered a photo of the party. Rowley told the NewsAgents podcast: \u201cAs people know, that case has been previously looked at based on a photo. It\u2019s very obvious a video tells a much richer, clearer story than a photo. And so, the team are looking at that with a view to whether that provides a basis for further investigation.\u201d Rowley added: \u201cI think we can all see the colourful nature of the video and how much it tells a story way beyond the original photo. I need to let a team work through that but I think we can all guess which way it will go.\u201d During the \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d event, on video unearthed by the Mirror, one person can be heard saying that filming is all right \u201cas long as we don\u2019t stream that we\u2019re, like, bending the rules\u201d. The Met said on Monday it was \u201cassessing video footage that was not previously provided to officers when investigating an event in Matthew Parker Street on 14 December 2020\u201d. The Met is also looking at other material relating to further potential breaches involving the former prime minister Boris Johnson at Chequers, and was passed to police by the Cabinet Office as they prepared for the official inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of Covid. The Met said it was \u201cassessing material referred by the Cabinet Office to the Met and Thames Valley police regarding potential breaches of the regulations between June 2020 and May 2021 at Downing Street and Chequers\u201d. Responding to the allegations about potential Covid breaches at Chequers a spokesperson for Johnson said: \u201cThis was entirely lawful, and it was covered by relevant provisions in the Covid regulations. To suggest otherwise is totally untrue.\u201d The third event is alleged to involve Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who sat on the privileges committee inquiry that damned Johnson last week for misleading parliament about Downing Street lockdown parties. The Met said it was \u201cassessing a report to the Met on Thursday 15 June regarding media reporting of alleged breaches in parliament\u201d. An ally of Jenkin said it was a work event held by senior figures in the Women2Win network, which encourages more Tory women to stand for political office, and that he arrived to collect his wife. The force insisted its previous investigation into Westminster lockdown breaches was thorough, and as evidence of that said that it had issued 126 fixed-penalty notices against 83 individuals under Operation Hillman. It said any new investigation would need to be into \u201ca serious and flagrant breach, be proportionate and when those involved knew or ought to have known what they were doing was an offence\u201d. Other factors include where declining to investigate \u201cwould significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law\u201d and where \u201cthere was little ambiguity around the absence of a reasonable defence\u201d. The 14 December 2020 event was attended by Bailey, who was last week ennobled in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. The Conservatives say four people were disciplined over the event. A spokesperson for the Bailey campaign has said: \u201cThis is an old story. We repeatedly apologised for this event at the time. It was subject to a nearly year-long police investigation. The matter is closed.\u201d Last year the Met decided not to refer people at the party for fines after a photo emerged of it, believing it was not enough evidence to \u201cdisprove the version of events\u201d provided by attenders."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319c0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/cameron-norrie-happy-return-on-grass-ryan-peniston-springs-another-queens-club-shock-tennis", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Norrie makes happy return on grass as Peniston springs another Queen\u2019s shock", "lead": "Cameron Norrie won his first match on grass this season against Miomir Kecmanovic while world No 265 Ryan Peniston beat No 37-ranked Ugo Humbert", "author": "Tumaini Carayol at Queen's Club", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:52:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175165", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f9bc9de4a98aa0e8033c4eafa59551223b7385fd/43_1_5636_3381/500.jpg", "body": "In his first match on a British grass court since his breakout run to the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, Cameron Norrie returned with a victory as he moved past Miomir Kecmanovic 6-4, 7-6 (5) at Queen\u2019s Club.

Peniston, who reached the Queen\u2019s Club quarter-finals last year while ranked No 180 after defeating Casper Ruud, lamented his bad luck in the months following his breakout summer after he sustained a wrist injury that affected him for much of 2022. \u201cI played a lot of matches on the grass and it was heavy conditions. Just, yeah, human body breaks down sometimes,\u201d said Peniston, who is now ranked No 265 in the world. \u201cSo I was out for six, seven weeks like not doing anything, and then the wrist injury lasted for about 17 weeks total. Definitely low points, not being able to play the sport I love, it was tough.

The number of vacant posts increased by 44% between 2021 and 2022. One in four new teachers leaves the profession within three years. The headteacher of one secondary school describes trying to fill some roles as \u201cadvertising for a unicorn\u201d. Even in English, where recruitment has traditionally been easier than in maths or science \u2013 where schools face competition from higher-paying private sector employers \u2013 there are shortages. Growing numbers of pupils are taught by staff without expertise in the subject. This should be a source of profound concern, and also shame, in government. It is ministers\u2019 job to oversee state schools. They are responsible for a situation in which becoming and remaining a teacher have become less attractive. Gillian Keegan is the seventh education secretary in five years. It does not appear that any of them have grasped the problem. Without teachers, teaching cannot take place. The difficulties are most severe in disadvantaged schools and areas, meaning that attainment gaps can be expected to increase. There is no great mystery about causes. In 2019, after recruitment targets had been missed for six years in a row, the government announced plans to remove barriers to part-time teaching, and reduce the workloads that are repeatedly cited as a reason why teachers quit. Where bursaries were introduced to fund training in some subjects, shortages eased off (these are being brought back for English this year). But pay remains too low, after years of freezes and budget cuts, and this year\u2019s average rise of 5% was only half the rate of inflation (and lower than increases in Scotland and Wales). The pressures remain intense. Teachers are subjected to a form of inspection, in Ofsted, that is not faced by other professionals. The inspectorate\u2019s response to the recent death of the headteacher Ruth Perry was not sufficient to allay concerns about unmanageable stress. Schools cope with a huge range of issues, from sexual harassment and bullying, to the difficulties that some children bring with them from home. In a context where social care, special needs and mental healthcare thresholds have all been raised by councils, sometimes schools are the only places where families feel they can turn for help \u2013 or offload frustration. Given that the UK has a younger teaching workforce than most comparable countries, it is unsurprising that some become overwhelmed when forced to assume responsibilities for which they are not ready. Teaching also lacks the flexibility, and options for home working, that other graduate employers increasingly offer. In relation to English, specifically, the shortage of teachers is linked to falling numbers learning the subject. A-level entries are down to 54,000 from 90,000 in 2012, and here, too, ministers are partly to blame. Their reforms stripped creativity and critical thinking out of the curriculum, particularly at GCSE level, while rhetoric about the importance of Stem subjects, especially maths, reduced the status of other subjects \u2013 even if this was unintended. Routes into teacher training have also become more complicated. The danger is that problems become self\u2011reinforcing, as the churn in staff makes schools less stable places. But pay and working conditions must be improved if we want children to thrive. The Conservatives\u2019 recent approach to schools, including Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to fund a recommended pandemic recovery package, has been negligent. The damage will take time to repair. At a minimum, Ms Keegan should publish the report of the independent pay review body, as unions have requested, and press the Treasury to fund the recommended 6.5% increase."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319c2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/the-guardian-view-on-a-pms-patronage-boris-johnsons-shameful-honours-list", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on a PM\u2019s patronage: Boris Johnson\u2019s shameful honours list | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Reforming the House of Lords should begin by constraining a departing leader\u2019s power to dish out lifetime awards to friends and cronies", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:50:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175204", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/200651cb53f8f48e318cb2ba26fead9af34b2601/0_0_2042_1226/500.jpg", "body": "When handing out lifetime honours, Boris Johnson\u2019s guiding principle has been brazen cronyism and snubbing established convention. But the most recent revelations, on the eve of MPs debating the privileges committee report into Mr Johnson\u2019s deceit over Partygate, are jaw-dropping. On Sunday, a video emerged of Conservative staffers enjoying a 2020 Christmas \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d jamboree that patently broke lockdown rules. Mr Johnson must have known about this event. Yet at least two of those at the party were on his resignation honours list. Voters care about honesty and integrity in politics. Mr Johnson does not. By waving through the list, Rishi Sunak appears either to agree with his disgraced predecessor or to be too weak to stop it. The government says it was respecting \u201cdue process\u201d \u2013 as prime ministers routinely rubber stamp those appointments approved by peers. But Mr Johnson did not respect such norms. The manner of his departure \u2013 convicted by parliament\u2019s highest court of lying \u2013 is unprecedented. The current prime minister is responsible for recommending honours. Mr Sunak would have been justified in refusing Mr Johnson\u2019s list. He should have done so. The sleaze is lapping at the door not just of Downing Street, but Buckingham Palace too. Prof Meg Russell of University College London\u2019s Constitution Unit wrote that the Crown\u2019s birthday honours list has been put at risk because Mr Johnson\u2019s nominations \u201care seen as discrediting the titles that many of these people \u2013 and others like them in the past \u2013 have rightfully received\u201d \u2026 \u201cAn added concern is that even Johnson\u2019s list was officially \u2013 and necessarily \u2013 issued in the name of the King\u201d. Prof Russell suggests that Mr Sunak has failed \u201cto protect the monarch from being drawn into political controversy\u201d. It\u2019s hard to disagree. Something is badly wrong with the way Britain is governed. Since 2010 the rewards to Conservative party donors and political friends in the form of peerages and gongs have exposed a manifest lack of legitimacy that is corroding state authority. Hoping to cast the opposition as scrupulous compared to the government, Sir Keir Starmer ruled out producing a resignation honours list of his own in future. Mr Sunak has offered no defence for what\u2019s gone on; but instead chose to defend his inaction. There is no excuse for business as usual. If nothing is done, Sir Keir should threaten to rescind Mr Johnson\u2019s honours list with new legislation once in office. It is the upper house where the need is most pressing. Labour ought to implement Gordon Brown\u2019s plans to replace the House of Lords with an elected assembly. The Conservatives are bereft of ideas, having proposed no new initiatives on Lords reform for more than 10 years. Mr Johnson\u2019s disreputable behaviour raises questions about how we are governed \u2013 and by whom. There\u2019s a need to shrink a bloated upper chamber, remove the remaining hereditary peers and introduce greater quality control on appointments \u2013 beginning with the prime minister\u2019s resignation honours list. Creating a mechanism that recognises the public interest in the matter of patronage and can prevent its crudest manifestation is \u2013 or at least should be \u2013 the order of the day.

The screen fell and collapsed on Olivia Burt, who received an \u201cunsurvivable\u201d head injury, Teesside crown court heard. Burt, a first-year natural sciences student and member of the sailing club at Durham University, was queueing to get into a busy Wednesday night Game Over event at the Missoula bar, popular with university sports teams. Prosecutors said the accident in February 2018 was \u201cforeseeable, predictable and preventable\u201d. Stonegate Pub Company, which owned Missoula, has denied four breaches of health and safety legislation. Jamie Hill KC, prosecuting for Durham county council, told the court that Burt, from Milford on Sea in Hampshire, lost her life while queueing at about midnight. \u201cShe and her friends, and others waiting to gain access, were standing next to a decorative screen which marked an area used by customers sitting outside. This screen should not have been used as a crowd control barrier or for queue management purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the queue swelled, the press of people caused Olivia to fall through a panel in the screen and then a section of the screen fell, with other customers landing on top. Olivia\u2019s head hit the concrete pavement and the metal bar of the screen with the weight of other customers landed on her head. She suffered an unsurvivable head injury.\u201d Hill said the prosecution case was that Stonegate failed to ensure Burt\u2019s safety and that of other customers, failed to properly assess risks, used inappropriate equipment and ignored danger signs. CCTV footage showed queues building up after 11pm as the venue filled towards its capacity of 630, the court heard. \u201cFor at least 12 months, when queues formed, students were asked to stand along the side of the decorative screen,\u201d Hill said. \u201cNobody from Stonegate had carried out any specific risk assessment of this measure. Nobody from the club had turned their mind to the dangers.\u201d A nightclub queue was different from that of a museum, he said, as some people would have had a drink and at times there would be pushing and shoving, \u201cbut nothing like a football crowd\u201d. Hill said: \u201cWe say that by bringing the decorative screen into use to direct and order the queue to the back door, the club were using it for a purpose for which it was entirely unsuitable.\u201d He said the screen was a heavy one. About 30 minutes before the fatal accident, it toppled over and it took four people to lift it back into place. Two panels had come off it and the structure, which was \u201calready unfit for the purpose of crowd management, had been further weakened,\u201d Hill said. The earlier collapse of the screen was an \u201cimportant missed opportunity\u201d, the prosecution said, and students should have been moved away from it. Hill said: \u201cBy re-erecting that barrier and allowing the queueing to continue, we say they allowed the conditions leading to Olivia\u2019s death to persist.\u201d The trial continues and is expected to last three weeks."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319c4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/dutch-study-reveals-extent-of-wealth-made-via-slavery-from-three-past-rulers-king-willem-alexander", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dutch study reveals extent of wealth made via slavery from three past rulers", "lead": "Report comes shortly before an expected apology from King Willem-Alexander in a speech in Amsterdam", "author": "Senay Boztas in Amsterdam", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:40:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175239", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e15bb74ff5e2a8ab7244fdbe6695dec67703eb09/818_1704_2944_1766/500.jpg", "body": "Inside the stables of Paleis Noordeinde in The Hague is a golden coach embellished with images of colonial offerings to Dutch rulers that many, including the current Dutch king, regard as a symbol of exploitation that, according to a new study, netted three Dutch rulers the equivalent of more than \u20ac545m (\u00a3465m). Historians calculated the staggering value of colonial profit for Willem III (also king of England, Ireland and Scotland), Willem IV and Willem V for a report published at the request of the Dutch parliament last week before a widely expected apology over slavery from the Dutch king. The study, State and Slavery, is the first to quantify the financial value to the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau of colonial trade that included enslaving at least 600,000 African men, women and children and between 660,000 and 1 million people from Asia to be tortured, exploited and robbed of their freedom and their names. It is a legacy for which Willem-Alexander is expected to present a formal apology in Amsterdam\u2019s Oosterpark on 1 July, the festival of Keti Koti (breaking the chains), 150 years after Dutch slavery in effect ended. The \u20ac545m equivalent exceeded the money that the rulers, known as Stadhouders, took as heads of the state and military. Between 1675 and 1770, William III netted 1,094,998 guilders in his share of profits from the Dutch East India Company \u2013 the equivalent of \u20ac196m today. Raymund Sch\u00fctz, a researcher at the municipal archives in The Hague, discovered the figures about the Dutch Stadhouders, appointed regents, last year in a private archive of Gerard van Vredenburch. This important figure in the Dutch East India Company was apparently hoarding and documenting secrets \u201clike poker cards\u201d, he said. \u201cIt was seen as something to be proud of,\u201d said Sch\u00fctz. \u201cIn some cases, they took enslaved people to the Netherlands to show off. It was a kind of conspicuous investment and consumption to show you were important, a kind of status symbol. These days, everybody is ashamed and it\u2019s hard to imagine how it was seen at the time. But the main thing was making money.\u201d Sch\u00fctz said it was not yet known how much the Netherlands\u2019 rulers profited from slavery between 1621 and its abolition on 1 July 1863 (followed by 10 years of compulsory employment for the enslaved). The Dutch king has commissioned a three-year independent study. Last year, the UK\u2019s King Charles, then Prince of Wales, expressed \u201cthe depths of his personal sorrow\u201d about suffering caused by the British slave trade, and in 2021 Germany offered \u20ac1bn in recognition of colonial-era genocide in Namibia. Last December, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, apologised for the government\u2019s role and the \u201cappalling suffering\u201d caused to generations, and announced a \u20ac200m fund for awareness initiatives but no reparations or damages. A spokesperson for the Dutch royal household confirmed that Willem-Alexander would make a speech at the Keti Koti celebrations in Amsterdam \u2013 something widely expected to contain his own apology. Don Ceder, an MP for the Christian Union and a lawyer, has played a major role in stimulating government recognition. \u201cI think that an apology from the king in his institutional role would [be of] enormous significance in the reconciliation process,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dutch royal family received a significant portion of her wealth through the slave trade \u2026 A sincere reflection upon that past could contribute to a shared future.\u201d Descendants of the enslaved believe that recognition of the profit and wrongs of the past are long overdue, according to Linda Nooitmeer, president of the National Institute of the Dutch Slavery Past and Legacy (NiNsee), whose surname means \u201cnever again\u201d. \u201cThe symbolic value of the king is so great that an apology is not just valued: it is self-evident,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2019, an investigation showed that 5% of Dutch GDP [in 1770] came from slavery. What the community thought, seems to be true.\u201d Roy Kaikusi Groenberg, of the Honour and Recovery Foundation, a Dutch Afro-Surinamese organisation, was one among many who took the government to court last year to demand a careful apology. \u201cIt would mean that the king, in the name of the monarchy and the Dutch head of state, underlines a kind of recognition,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a psychologist, but I think this apology will be the start of another era, that it will bring a kind of peace. The relatives of the victims of slavery are right now confronted with the consequences of that behaviour: racism, discrimination, being undervalued, Black Pete [a festive tradition in the Netherlands in which people dress up in blackface]. If people in the Netherlands truly realise what happened and what still needs to happen, I do not think they will lack the will.\u201d The golden coach may be retired until the Netherlands is a land of real equality, according to the king. But one way of achieving this is, in classic Dutch style, by sitting at a table. Across the country, organisations from the Rijksmuseum to police stations and town halls have organised hundreds of \u201cKeti Koti Tafels\u201d where, over a meal, different communities share personal stories about experiencing and tackling modern-day discrimination. \u201cThe aim is to bring people closer together,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe want to increase awareness of the internal consequences of a slavery past, that sits in a collective archive of us all \u2026 black, white and all colours in between, sharing personal experiences. We share a society, we are all people and we need to come together.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319c5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/darren-moore-leaves-sheffield-wednesday-manager-promotion", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Darren Moore leaves Sheffield Wednesday after winning promotion", "lead": "Darren Moore has left his job as manager of Sheffield Wednesday three weeks after winning promotion to the Championship in the playoff final", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:35:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175256", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0cd5a993f8e8636429c564125744d6a8ed0c9d88/0_80_3525_2115/500.jpg", "body": "Darren Moore has left his job as manager of Sheffield Wednesday three weeks after winning promotion to the Championship in the playoff final.

Theresa May kept up the pressure on Johnson, saying MPs were \u201cresponsible for our own actions\u201d and that friendship between colleagues should not cloud their judgment. \u201cIt is doubly important for us to show that we are prepared to act when one of our own, however senior, is found wanting,\u201d added May. \u201cFollowing an unsettling period in our political life, support for the report of the privileges committee will be a small but important step in restoring people\u2019s trust in members of this house and of parliament.\u201d MPs are expected to vote on the report on Monday evening, with Johnson\u2019s supporters boycotting it. Some of them repeated their attacks on what they called a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319c8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/19/succession-quiet-luxury-look-milan-fashion-week", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Succession drives \u2018quiet luxury\u2019 look at Milan fashion week", "lead": "Menswear has moved away from logos to more refined silhouettes, with collections from Prada to Valentino ditching streetwear", "author": "Scarlett Conlon in Milan", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:27:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175309", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7dc8b451fb52a30a9da8339f296e479c5f733923/0_0_4134_2480/500.jpg", "body": "Such is the piercing influence of Succession on the wardrobes of the rich and famous that its stars didn\u2019t even need to make a front-row appearance at Milan fashion week to make their presence felt. Excess is out and elegance is in as designers pursue the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d look that owes much of its recent popularity to the Roy family stone. At Prada, the bellwether of where the fashion mood heads next, the co-designers Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons used the humble white shirt as a springboard for \u201ca reconsideration of simple things\u201d, said Prada after the show on Sunday. \u201cWe were aiming to have quite a refined silhouette as we know it in men\u2019s fashion \u2013 a 40s kind of construction that deals very much with the idealisation of the male body,\u201d said Simons. At Valentino on Friday, the designer Pierpaolo Piccioli presented a collection of languid separates that addressed \u201cthe reality of masculinity now\u201d. For the second season in a row, Dolce &amp; Gabbana ditched the distressed denim and diamant\u00e9 suits in favour of tailoring and \u201cthe well-cut garment\u201d on Saturday afternoon. Even the front rows of the four-day showcase, which ended on Monday afternoon, were unusually quiet on the celebrity front, further emphasising the new low-key mood. With the logo-mania and high-profile collaborations of recent years left in the dust, brands have been finding new ways to make sartorial stealth stand out. \u201cThis trend is still the strongest message coming from Milan, however, it is now slightly more elaborate in detailing once you look closer at the garments and silhouettes,\u201d said Ida Petersson, buying director at Browns. \u201cWe are already seeing men move away from logos to a more refined way of dressing, however it\u2019s also clear that the gorpcore, more technical way of dressing remain as a strong sales driver and we\u2019re excited to see how customers responds to the evolution of this trend and the brands that are able to marry those traditional performance wear styles with relaxed tailoring.\u201d For much of the Italian contingent on the schedule, the return of understated luxury is welcome news. Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna, Tod\u2019s, Giorgio Armani and Brioni all presented collections that eschewed the streetwear influences that had crept in of late. At the latter, the creative director, Norbert Stumpfl pointed to blazers that take months just for the fabric alone to be made. Despite its moniker, quiet luxury is designed to speak volumes. These are still clothes that can cost more than the average monthly payslip and they need to look it. \u201cIt\u2019s about extreme material integrity, and tailoring skills developed by true experts and products at a price point way above even mainstream luxury,\u201d said Lucie Greene, trend forecaster and founder of consultancy Light Years. \u201cIt\u2019s about the cashmere sweater that is just the right colour, with subtle detail, light-as-a-feather softness that no one except the wearer \u2013 or a stealth observer \u2013 would know and that costs several thousand pounds. It\u2019s the opposite of someone wearing a designer logo belt, or handbag.\u201d As well as Succession\u2019s influence, the roots of quiet fashion are linked to the consolidation of wealth in recent years, particularly during the pandemic where more money than ever has concentrated at the very top, says Greene. \u201cThis has seen a drive for ultra-high net worth groups to differentiate themselves from commodified obvious luxury by embracing quietness, discretion, privacy, and institutional wealth codes even more \u2013 the more if-you-know-you-know the better.\u201d It sets the scene, she continues, for brands to come up with ever more exclusive, but subtle ways to communicate wealth and takes care of unwanted optics. \u201cPart of it is tactical. In this climate of extreme inequality, being obviously outrageously wealthy has become distasteful and contentious in wider society, see the flood of \u2018eat-the-rich\u2019 narratives from The White Lotus to Triangle of Sadness.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319c9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/tory-mayor-resigns-after-apologising-for-attending-lgbtq-event", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tory mayor resigns after apologising for attending LGBTQ+ event", "lead": "Mohammed Nazam said the Pride event contradicted his \u2018personal religious beliefs\u2019 in Facebook group", "author": "Robyn Vinter North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:24:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175326", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4eaa9fa284630f263207ecd045d280aab4421cff/0_177_1310_786/500.jpg", "body": "A Conservative mayor has resigned after being labelled homophobic when he apologised for attending a council LGBTQ+ Pride event because it \u201ccontradicts\u201d his beliefs. Mohammed Nazam, the mayor of Keighley in West Yorkshire, faced anger after posting in a Facebook group that it was a \u201clapse of judgment\u201d to attend the raising of a progress flag on Friday as part of the town\u2019s Pride month celebrations. In the post, he said he \u201cwholeheartedly apologised\u201d for attending the ceremony as it \u201ccontradicts my personal religious beliefs\u201d. He added: \u201cI want to emphasise that I have also personally repented for this error and reflected deeply on the consequences of my actions.\u201d The post received a backlash from Keighley residents, who described the comments as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cunbelievable\u201d. On Monday, Nazam \u2013 who has been in the post less than a month \u2013 was suspended from the local Conservative party after a number of complaints, and resigned hours later. In a statement following his resignation, he said he had meant no harm to LGBTQ+ people but refused to back down, saying \u201call elected Muslim representatives\u201d would have needed to apologise to the Muslim community for attending such an event. He said: \u201cI attended the flag raising for LGBTQ community. This did not conform to my religious beliefs and hence I offered an apology to the Muslim community. All elected Muslim representatives would be in the same position. \u201cBy my apology I did not mean any harm to the LGBTQ community. My religion teaches respect and tolerance for all and the law of the land. \u201cHere in the UK we are proud to have our freedom of expression. People should have the freedom to express their beliefs and live their lives as they wish to. This should apply to all communities and religious beliefs.\u201d His initial comments were criticised as \u201cnot the most helpful action to heal the abuse\u201d that LGBTQ+ Muslims suffer. Ahead of his resignation, Helen Hallam, from Oakworth, a trustee of Out in the Valley LGBTQ+ group, said she was \u201cbewildered\u201d by the comments. She added: \u201cMr Mayor, we live in a secular society and have a diverse community. If this is not to your liking, why accept the honour of being town mayor? In my humble opinion you should resign forthwith. \u201cOur town has worked hard to achieve an integrated community. In Keighley we have a number of gay and lesbian people of Muslim heritage and the situation is never easy for them. The mayor\u2019s apology is not the most helpful action to heal the abuse they suffer.\u201d Some of the criticism came from within his own party. Robbie Moore, the Tory MP for Keighley, said he disagreed with the comments and had been \u201cexceptionally proud\u201d to take part in the flag-raising event. He said: \u201cI am proud we live in a country where people can be who they want to be and are free to choose who they love. \u201cThe role of the town mayor is to represent everyone within the community, and therefore it was deeply disheartening to read the mayor\u2019s statement.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ca", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/quite-weird-sea-temperature-rise-in-north-east-of-england-worrying-for-residents", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Quite weird\u2019: sea temperature rise in north-east of England worries residents ", "lead": "Mixed reactions greet dramatic fluctuation in sea temperatures in Tynemouth", "author": "Mark Brown North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:15:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175344", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/851f0c38ebf4690e4fef4424ca30ad3903024a01/0_153_4582_2750/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cI\u2019ve never felt the sea this warm in June, it is quite weird,\u201d said retired nurse Val Hedley as she finished her regular paddle along the picture-postcard golden sands of Longsands beach in Tynemouth. \u201cOften here you will get a cold bit of the sea, then it gets warmer and then it gets cooler again. But today everything seems to be the same which is unusual \u2026 it\u2019s all evenly warm. \u201cIt is worrying but then other strange things are happening like seaweed accumulating in places it doesn\u2019t normally accumulate. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on \u2026 it must be climate change, mustn\u2019t it?\u201d Hedley, who lives in Wylam, Northumberland, was speaking on the day scientists revealed an \u201cunheard of\u201d marine heatwave which has pushed up sea temperatures in the North Sea and north Atlantic. The temperature rise for the north-east of England is particularly striking and it was concerning for swimmers and surfers out on the beach on Monday lunchtime. But most admitted they have yet to fully notice it. \u201cIt has felt as cold as normal, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d said 23-year-old Nathan Henderson, an instructor at Tynemouth surf company who has been surfing off the coast of north-east England since he was nine. \u201cThe sea here does gradually get warmer from April and the hottest month of the year, in the water, is September. That\u2019s just how it works round here. I\u2019ve not felt the sea getting warmer recently but it\u2019s a worry if it is.\u201d Most people braving the Tynemouth sea on Monday did not dip in above their knees. There was a lot of running in boldly and running out frantically. One fearless soul was Henry Harvey, a 19-year-old footballer for Blyth Town, who was in the sea with two friends. \u201cIt was really cold\u201d, he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s always cold. It\u2019s never warm \u2026 you jump headfirst in and it\u2019s a shock, but it\u2019s good for you.\u201d Barry Henderson has owned Longsands surf school for 12 years and is in the sea practically every day. \u201cWe surf all year and it\u2019s always the same. In winter you surf with boots, gloves and a hood on and as you come into the warmer weather you want to take your boots and gloves off as quick as you can because it\u2019s nicer to surf. \u201cMaybe this year a couple of the younger lads probably had their gloves off quite early but it still has felt bloody freezing. It hasn\u2019t felt massively different. \u201cSome days I\u2019ve gone in and thought the sea\u2019s warming up. I\u2019ve never gone in and thought, \u2018it\u2019s warm\u2019.\u201d That\u2019s not to say he hasn\u2019t noticed dramatic, apparently unexplainable, changes in temperature over the years. One August the temperature felt as high as 16 degrees, he said, and then suddenly it wasn\u2019t. \u201cIt never came back up to that temperature \u2026 it\u2019s strange how it can change like that.\u201d His surf school overlooks the abandoned wreck of Tynemouth outdoor pool, a place which was notoriously freezing in its heyday because it was filled up with sea water. Henderson has memories of badgering his mother to go in the pool when he was six. \u201cI think it was two pence and I dived straight in and it was just so cold, my breath just completely left me. It was so, so cold.\u201d For many years there has been a campaign to bring back Tynemouth outdoor pool, which opened in the 1920s and closed with the rise of package holidays in the 1970s. There is much goodwill behind the campaign with support for many predicated on one central part of the proposal: it will be heated."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319cb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/ashes-diary-englands-all-action-approach-keeps-fans-in-their-seats", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ashes diary: England\u2019s all-action approach keeps fans in their seats", "lead": "New hospitality area fails to appeal as Bazball takes preference, while Joe Root is still offering maximum entertainment", "author": "Simon Burnton at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:02:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175362", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a350b4c433c2ec329a036ce48c1bb29dc48cb530/0_96_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The price of Bazball As well as being the start of the match and indeed the series, Friday was opening day for Edgbaston\u2019s new hospitality area, the Skyline Terrace. This zone on the top of the South Stand is billed as \u201ca fun, interactive and modern cricketing hospitality experience \u2026 where there are not only exceptional pitch views, but where food is plentiful and space is fun and lively\u201d, and boasts \u201ca softer palette of materials and well-designed lighting along with informal buffet spaces within relaxed and varied seating zones\u201d. Ticket-holders are offered a premium street-food buffet, a complimentary bar and a live DJ, but for all its facilities on Monday it was completely empty \u2013 and Bazball was to blame. This kind of experience doesn\u2019t come cheap, and Skyline Terrace tickets for this Test cost \u00a3899 on the opening day, decreasing daily from there to an advertised \u00a3491 for day four on Monday. But this England side seems to play cricket on fast-forward and the result is that big-money tickets for the last couple of days, when there might be little or no play, have become very hard to shift. Edgbaston officials eventually decided not to risk displeasing their big-spending customers by charging high prices for potentially little action, while the facilities are considered too luxurious to open it up for general admission. Odd as it seems to have a completely empty section in a sold-out ground, that was the upshot. \u201cWe launched our new rooftop Skyline terrace shortly before the Ashes series to offer hospitality clients a fantastic new matchday experience,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe opened the terrace on days one to three of the Ashes. We sold around 1,000 covers in total and received great feedback from customers who entertained friends, family and business clients. We took the decision not to open on days four and five.\u201d Meanwhile anyone who considers those prices unacceptable for the simple pleasures of a day\u2019s cricket should sit themselves down, pour themselves a stiff drink and look up the brand new offering at Lord\u2019s for the second Test next week, the Ashes Lounge. You sixy thing Joe Root has already hit 13 sixes in Tests this year, having played only four games. That is one more six than he hit in the entirety of 2012 \u2013 the year of his debut \u2013 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 combined, when he played 83. Of Root\u2019s 131 Test appearances there have only been four in which he has hit at least one six in both innings of the game (3% of all his games). But there is something about these opponents and this venue that gets his synapses twitching: of Root\u2019s three Test appearances against Australia at Edgbaston he has now hit at least one six in both innings of the game twice. Sod steward Cricket fans are an appreciative bunch, and it is not just outstanding efforts in the classic parts of the game \u2013 bowling, batting, catching, running quite quickly, that kind of thing \u2013 that earn their approval. Mitchell Starc, not in Australia\u2019s team for this game but on the field temporarily as a substitute fielder, got a generous round of applause on Monday for doing nothing more than a spot of gardening. In the previous over Marnus Labuschagne, running back from mid-off, had slid to field a ball heading towards the boundary and dug up a significant divot in the rain-softened turf with his left knee. It was the last ball of the over and he promptly fled the scene of the crime with no attempt to make good the damage but Starc, arriving at what was then fine leg, picked up the stray sod, carefully returned it to its place and basked in the locals\u2019 appreciation. Reviewing the action At one point in England\u2019s second innings on day four it felt easy to lose count of the number of reviews and overturned decisions. So, for clarity, the Diary can confirm there were six reviews, two by Australia, both of which were incorrect and four by England. Only two resulted in an overturned decision, both in England\u2019s favour, saving Jonny Bairstow and Stuart Broad. The other reprieve for England came from a referral when Ben Stokes was adjudged out caught off Nathan Lyon, but replays checking the catch showed Stokes had hit it into the ground first."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319cc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/he-suffered-pakistani-relatives-mourn-sons-on-greek-shipwreck", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Grief-stricken Pakistani town mourns sons lost in Greek shipwreck", "lead": "Poverty drove young men from small Kashmir town to board ill-fated fishing trawler, say families", "author": "Shah Meer Baloch in Khuiratta", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:02:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175379", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/78d328fb825f8cc984eb23af6c9f36babcf4699a/0_133_3984_2390/500.jpg", "body": "The last time Mohammed Yousaf talked to his son, Sajid Yousaf, on 8 June, the son was waiting anxiously in Libya for smugglers to pack him and hundreds of others on to a boat bound for the other side of the Mediterranean. Six days later, the overcrowded fishing trawler sank off the coast of Greece. Sajid, 28, a shopkeeper and father of two from the small town of Khuiratta in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is among the hundreds missing, presumed dead. \u201cI never wanted him to go,\u201d Yousaf said through tears. \u201cHis elder brother also advised him against this deadly sea journey. It is like you are walking on fire and it can engulf you. We told him many times, stop it. We even asked him to come back from Libya.\u201d On Monday, as tracking data cast further doubts on the Greek coastguard\u2019s account of the shipwreck, an initial investigation by police in Pakistan estimated that about 800 people were onboard. Witness accounts had placed the number at between 400 and 750. Greek authorities say 104 survivors and 78 bodies have been brought ashore. Sajid Yousaf was one of 25 people from Khuiratta who boarded the boat in Libya. Only two are known to have survived. He planned to reach Italy, where his brother lives having made a similarly treacherous boat journey 12 years ago. In a video that has since gone viral, Sajid promised to bring a bicycle back home to his four-year-old son. The Guardian talked to almost a dozen families in Khuiratta whose sons and nephews were on the boat. All said their relatives had paid 2.2m Pakistan rupees to an agent who promised to take them to Greece. Many families took out hefty loans to cover the costs. Most of those who undertook the journey were hoping to eventually reach Italy, where about 500 people from the area had previously relocated. Sajid\u2019s cousin Touqeer Pervez, 29, was also onboard and is missing, leaving behind a pregnant wife. Pervez\u2019s father, a labourer in a brick factory, had borrowed money from about 20 friends and relatives to help pay the agent. Like most of the people from the village who boarded the ship, Pervez left for Libya via a flight from Pakistan. He had worked in Saudi Arabia for two years to help pay for the trip, and left in May to begin his illegal journey to Europe. At 5am on 9 June, he sent a final message to his family to say he was on the ship. \u201cWhen I tried to stop him from this risky voyage, he told me that our living standards will never improve by living in Pakistan,\u201d said his father, Mohammad Pervez. \u201cHe was adamant to change our future and living standards. I don\u2019t know how to console his pregnant wife who has been crying for days.\u201d Abdul Jabbar, 39, a baker with two children, had also hoped to reach Italy. He took a flight to Dubai on 5 June and then another to Libya. His father, Mohammad Anwar, said his son had called home in distress due to the conditions they were being kept in. That was the last time they heard from him. \u201cHe told his brother that if he had known about the conditions in Libya, he would never have left,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cThey were given just a little bread in 24 hours and he said they were dying of hunger. He wanted to turn back but he was helpless as he had already given the money.\u201d Rubina Kusar, a widow, said her son Ahmed, 26, left for Libya six months ago and endured terrible conditions at the hands of smugglers. She said they deprived him of food, beat him to try to extract more money from him and took his passport and other documents to stop him escaping. \u201cHe was put in a dark cell for four days as a punishment after he had a fight with the agent because he refused 19 offers to go on a small boat and told the agent he was promised that the journey would be on a big boat,\u201d Kusar said. In a phone call with his wife before the boat departed, Ahmed spoke of his happiness that he was finally making the journey on a large fishing trawler. \u201cMy son suffered a lot before his death,\u201d Kusar said. \u201cAt first at the hands of smugglers and then in the sea. He must have gone through excruciating pain. We need justice. The government has been in a deep slumber. Why did not our leaders wake up early? Don\u2019t they care about common people, common lives?\u201d People in Khuiratta said Pakistan\u2019s terrible economic situation and a lack of opportunities in their region were to blame for relatives making the journey. While many in Pakistan had previously taken a treacherous overland journey through Iran and Turkey to enter Europe, draconian policies by Turkey meant that more were opting to fly to Libya then get on a boat headed for Greece. According to locals, about 100 people from the area are still in Libya with plans to board boats but have become uncontactable after smugglers switched off their phones. \u201cIt is all poverty that pushed him to take this risky journey,\u201d said Mohammed Haneef, whose nephew Sameer, a tractor driver with six children, was among those feared to have drowned on the boat. \u201cThis poverty took his life. Poverty has engulfed the masses in Pakistan over the last few years. He saw people from his home town doing well in Italy, earning money to send home, and it pushed him to go.\u201d So far, only two from the village, Haseeb and Adnan Bashir, are known to have survived the sinking of the boat. Adnan had been frustrated with the lack of local employment opportunities and had tried to reach Europe twice before, going via Iran and Turkey, but he failed after he was caught by border guards. In order to afford this journey, he sold all his buffaloes \u2013 his only livelihood \u2013 and his wife\u2019s jewellery before leaving on 3 May. His father, Bashir Ahmed, a retired soldier, said he had spoken to his son through a relative from the UK. According to his account, the ship overturned after a rope was attached to it by the coastguard \u2013 an allegation rejected by Greek officials. \u201cAdnan said he jumped off the ship the moment it was going down. He said women and children were below in the deck and they could not come out,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cI am lucky that my son survived.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319cd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/david-cameron-admits-failures-pandemic-preparations-austerity-covid-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "David Cameron admits series of failures in his government\u2019s pandemic preparations", "lead": "Ex-PM defends austerity programme that unions said meant the NHS \u2018didn\u2019t stand a fighting chance\u2019", "author": "Aletha Adu and Robert Booth", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:00:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175396", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/729ab4a87299047eacb06f56d0662030ec08277c/0_102_3062_1837/500.jpg", "body": "David Cameron has admitted failures in his government\u2019s preparations for a pandemic but defended the austerity drive that he and his chancellor, George Osborne, imposed, saying \u201cyour health system is only as strong as your economy\u201d.

As he became the first politician to give evidence to the UK-wide public inquiry, the PM from 2010 to 2016 accepted that his government was repeatedly warned about the pressures facing the NHS, but he insisted Britain had the financial capacity to roll out schemes such as furlough during Covid because of his government\u2019s ability to \u201cget control of the finances and increase funding for the health service at the same time\u201d. Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of the British Medical Association, has said there was \u201cno doubt that both staff and patients were put in harm\u2019s way\u201d because of underfunding in the decade running up to the arrival of Covid-19. The inquiry saw internal documents that revealed how in 2019, 16 separate pandemic preparation projects were \u201cstopped\u201d or reduced as a result of planning for a no-deal Brexit. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had to allocate 70 staff to no-deal planning, and projects dropped included a \u201cpandemic influenza strategy refresh\u201d \u2013 which was supposed to examine how countries in Asia, such as South Korea, had dealt with previous coronavirus pandemics \u2013 planning for a \u201chealthcare surge\u201d and benchmarking the NHS\u2019s preparedness internationally. As it entered its second week, the inquiry also heard that 14 of the 22 recommendations from the 2016 flu pandemic exercise Cygnus had not been completed by the time Covid hit. These included the need to \u201cdevelop plans for social care facilities to support clients who are discharged from hospital\u201d. An internal DHSC report after the first wave of Covid said the pandemic highlighted \u201cglaring omissions\u201d in preparedness, \u201cmeaning that the social care system was not able to respond to a major health emergency\u201d. Declassified documents, meanwhile, showed the government identified in 2019 that a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d outbreak of an emerging respiratory coronavirus infection in the UK was a reasonable worst-case scenario for a pandemic. But planners thought it would only kill 2,000 people on the basis that it would not spread. There was a \u201cflaw in the thinking\u201d, said Sir Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the DHSC, because they also knew that an emerging infection may \u201cdevelop the ability to transmit rapidly human to human\u201d. However, the plans were all about flu with the mantra \u201cready for flu, ready for anything\u201d, he said. Cameron said his government was \u201cvery concerned about potential pandemics \u2026 But it does still come back to this issue of why so much time spent on a flu pandemic and not so much on these others.\u201d He told the inquiry it was \u201cwrong to say we [were] preparing for the wrong pandemic\u201d. He said there \u201ccould still be pandemic flu, and it\u2019s good that we have been prepared for that but \u2026 a long time was spent preparing for a pandemic that didn\u2019t happen rather than the one that did happen\u201d. \u201cThe regret \u2026 is more questions weren\u2019t asked about the sort of pandemic that we faced,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cBut I think many other countries are in the same boat of not knowing what was coming.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary under Cameron who will also be cross-examined this week, has told the inquiry in a witness statement: \u201cOur preparations were affected by an element of groupthink. We knew that the spread of many distinct types of virus could create a pandemic, yet our shared belief was that the most likely scenario was a pandemic flu.\u201d The inquiry continues."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ce", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/letter-roger-squires-rufus-obituary", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Letter: Roger Squires (Rufus) obituary", "lead": "<strong>David Wallace writes: </strong>Revisit the BBC production of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and watch the scene on the rugby field", "author": "David Wallace", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:51:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175413", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/35ebe568f4713473c015780ef1f5af6be59dce09/0_222_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "Hugh Stephenson mentions Roger Squires\u2019s career as a TV actor, but without describing his greatest triumph as an extra.

The best known Hopkins buildings \u2013 the Mound stand at Lord\u2019s cricket ground, Glyndebourne opera house, Westminster underground station, the 2012 Olympic velodrome \u2013 command not only respect but positive affection. Hopkins gave modern architecture a human face. At the start of his career, he seemed inextricably linked to the young turks of high tech, Richard Rogers and Norman Foster, designing steel-frame buildings of immaculate precision. From the late 1960s, Hopkins spent eight productive years in partnership with Foster. The Willis Faber and Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, Suffolk, was the peak of their collaboration. But his later architecture took a different and more original direction as he became more concerned with the history of building and the place of architecture in the landscape. This growing sense of context brought his buildings a new richness, a poetic modernity rooted in his understanding of the past. He could play the international game as well as anyone. There are fine Hopkins buildings in the US and Tokyo, India and Dubai. But Hopkins remained a quintessentially British architect. He liked to tell of how he once arrived for a job interview in Suffolk and realised he was still wearing his jeans. He went to a men\u2019s outfitters in Bury St Edmunds and bought himself some cavalry twill trousers, a check shirt and a tweed jacket. As an afterthought he added a tie. Also up for the job was Rogers, wearing his usual continental-style blouson. The board of directors making the decision easily identified a kindred spirit: Hopkins got the job. It is a good story, showing how easily Hopkins\u2019s clients managed to relate to him, often forming lasting friendships. He was a big ruminative man of strong affections who, as time went on, became more deeply rooted in the rural landscapes that he made his own. Michael was born in Poole, Dorset, the son of Barbara and Gerald Hopkins. His father ran his own contract building firm in Bournemouth. Michael was sent to Sherborne, a public school in a town dominated by a wonderful medieval abbey. He escaped from games and lessons to take bike rides through the countryside, absorbing the lie of the land and the detail of the buildings. Early on, there had been a family decision that Michael would become an architect. He was 23 when he arrived at the Architectural Association in London, a mature student in a black leather jacket with an Angry Young Man manner. He seemed to be super-confident, having already studied architecture at Bournemouth School of Art and worked professionally with both Frederick Gibberd, designer of Harlow New Town, and Basil Spence. The AA in the early 60s was a lively, inspiring place to be. The curriculum was set by Peter Smithson, a key figure in the postwar \u201cnew brutalism\u201d; Cedric Price, who developed the Fun Palace with the theatre director Joan Littlewood, was teaching there. Architectural history was high on the agenda and Hopkins was introduced to the Victorian functional tradition, the dramatic architecture of railway buildings, industrial warehouses and factories that was to be such an influence on him. At the AA, most importantly of all, he met Patricia Wainwright, a fellow student, who was to become both his wife (in 1962) and working partner in a lastingly successful creative collaboration, in which Michael\u2019s streak of professional cussedness was balanced by Patty\u2019s diplomacy and charm. Throughout his working life, Michael\u2019s professional and family lives were intertwined. While they were still students, he and Patty embarked on the restoration of a timber-frame house in Suffolk. In order to repair it Michael needed to know precisely how it had been put together in the first place, and unbolted the components like those of a 15th-century Meccano set. Suddenly, \u201clike a flash out of the blue\u201d, he understood the strong connection between the way that buildings were constructed and the way they eventually looked. Later on, in 1976, once Michael had left Foster and the Hopkins partnership had been established, he and Patty designed the rigorously beautiful steel and glass building that made them immediately famous. The Hopkins House on Downshire Hill in Hampstead, north London, was designed as both a family home and an architectural office, using factory-made industrial components in an urban, elegant and very English way. From the Hopkins House developed a whole progeny of structurally radical buildings: Greene King\u2019s draught beer cellars in Bury St Edmunds; the Schlumberger Research Centre in Cambridge; Solid State Logic headquarters at Begbroke in Oxfordshire. All these are emphatically modernist in concept, \u201ckits-of-parts\u201d buildings engineered with Michael\u2019s customary vigour. But one catches shadows of Paxton\u2019s Victorian Crystal Palace structures too. By the early 80s, Hopkins seemed well on track to be another of the British \u201csuperstarchitects\u201d. His office was expanding. The practice now included John Pringle and Chris Wilkinson, both destined to be leading British architects. But Hopkins was about to take a different direction: the Mound stand at Lord\u2019s became his turning point. This mid-80s commission for a new building involving the reconstruction of Frank Verity\u2019s original 1890s stand shows Hopkins no longer in assertively high tech architectural mode but engaging sensitively with context and atmosphere. One commentator saw the new stand as \u201cexpressing the sense of an English summer\u2019s day in brick, steel, glass and tensile fabric\u201d. Hopkins was at the start of inventing a new language for late 20th-century British modernism. Hopkins himself was later to express this as his personal \u201creconciliation with history\u201d. He was becoming more conscious of his links with the architecture of the past, with the great industrial buildings of the 19th century, and with natural materials such as stone, wood and brick. When he came to design a new cutlery factory in Derbyshire for my husband, David Mellor, on the site of a redundant village gasworks, it was Hopkins who suggested using the original circular foundation of the gas cylinder as a basis for the factory, a poetic but also wholly practical example of a new building arising from the old. Hopkins triumphed at this period with his design for the new opera house at Glyndebourne, a job for which he beat off competition from James Stirling. Hopkins needed to reconcile the bucolic appeal of the Christie family\u2019s neo-Elizabethan house and splendid gardens with the commercial and technical demands of a sophisticated modern opera house. Most people agree that the pitch pine interior of Hopkins\u2019s auditorium, as well as the wonderful acoustic, gives Glyndebourne a magic of its own. By the early 90s, Hopkins\u2019s success in relating historic context and new technology was gaining him admirers. He was appointed to the Royal Fine Art Commission. In 1992 he was elected a Royal Academician. In 1994 he and Patty were jointly awarded the Riba gold medal, a prize which recognised the interdependence of their skills. Michael was knighted in 1995. The Hopkins partnership was given a bumpy ride with its designs for Portcullis House. This complex building, containing committee rooms and offices for more than 200 MPs, was begun in 1989 and completed in 2000. An almost automatic resistance to the building arose from its bulky incursion on to one of the world\u2019s most sensitive sites, just off the Victoria Embankment, with Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament alongside. Objections receded once the building had weathered. There were no such reservations about Westminster underground station, the subterranean structure under Portcullis House. This is Hopkins high tech at its most dramatic, and a triumph of civil engineering. The sublime interior of the cavernous underground interchange has often been described as Piranesian. It was also a location for the 2007 film of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The Hopkins family believed in pleasure, and some of the most endearing Hopkins buildings were public pleasure palaces: the Inn on the Park caf\u00e9 on the lakeside of St James\u2019s Park in London; the Garden Pavilion at Alnwick in Northumberland; the refectory building at Norwich Cathedral with its spectacular timber and steel roof structure. These are buildings that lift the spirit in the subtlety with which they relate to the history of place. Hopkins\u2019s trademark membrane structure canopies, as in the spectator stands at Goodwood racecourse in West Sussex, are faintly reminiscent of the splendour of the medieval tournament. Michael had many connections with the medical profession. His brother was a doctor, as were both of Patty\u2019s parents. And in the early years of the new century, the practice began working on its first large-scale hospital project, the Evelina children\u2019s hospital on the St Thomas\u2019 hospital site near Waterloo station. This sophisticated yet cheerful building has been much acclaimed. Hopkins\u2019s ambulatory cancer care centre for University College London is designed to provide a reassuring ambience for 125,000 outpatients a year. The Hopkins practice was now employing around 200 architects. They were carrying out important commissions in America, including university buildings for Yale and Princeton. A particular thrill was the designing of a huge cricket stadium in the wonderful landscape of the Deccan plateau, south-east of Mumbai. Hopkins was now operating internationally, and in 2004 opened an office in Dubai. Michael and Patty latterly began to share out responsibility, giving a group of senior partners shares in Hopkins Architects. In 1987 Michael and Patty had purchased a site on the hills above Borgo a Mozzano, north of Lucca. The 350-acre Catureglio estate centred round a traditional square stone building in traditional local style, with its own chapel and numerous abandoned outbuildings around. For Michael, Catureglio became a personal project as he restored the buildings, revived the vineyards and olive groves and cleared the forestry around. Eight years later, the Hopkinses took on another architectural challenge, Blackheath House near Aldeburgh, Suffolk, an internally ungainly Victorian house which had been re-clad in brick by the neo-Georgian architect Raymond Erith. The irresistible attraction for Michael, a keen sailor, was the vista across the Alde estuary towards Orford. This house too, set in 500 acres, was gradually given the Hopkins treatment. Both in Italy and Suffolk, he and Patty created not only two fine architectural landscapes but a whole way of living that embraced their many friends \u2013 architects and artists, writers and musicians \u2013 over several generations. They were endlessly hospitable and in Suffolk their ties to the Aldeburgh festival were strong. Michael is survived by Patty and their three children, Sarah, Abi and Joel, and 11 grandchildren. \u2022 Michael John Hopkins, architect, born 7 May 1935; died 17 June 2023 \u2022 Fiona MacCarthy died in 2020"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319d1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/greek-coast-boat-sank-tracking-data", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunk boat had not moved for hours, data suggests, contradicting Greek officials", "lead": "Tracking data indicates two vessels stood by or circled around stationary refugee boat for several hours", "author": "Jon Henley Europe correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:27:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175466", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/67643248d0fec1a581fbbec9ccc656af5321532a/0_31_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "Tracking data suggests an overcrowded fishing boat that sank off the Greek coast last week with the feared loss of hundreds of lives had not moved for several hours before it capsized, contradicting accounts from the Hellenic coastguard. As Pakistani police said on Monday they believed up to 800 people were onboard, a Guardian analysis of ship movements supplied by the MariTrace service indicated two vessels \u2013 the Lucky Sailor and the Faithful Warrior \u2013 stood by or circled round the stationary trawler for at least four hours. The coastguard has said it was in contact with the boat throughout that period \u2013 from about 3pm to 7pm on Tuesday \u2013 by radio, satphone and helicopter and that the vessel was not in difficulty, but moving \u201cat a steady course and speed\u201d towards Italy. The trawler began rocking, then listed and sank in international waters off the west coast of Greece shortly after 2am on Wednesday. Authorities have said 104 people were rescued and 78 bodies recovered. A search and rescue operation continues. Citing survivors, suspects and bereaved families, an initial police investigation in Pakistan, where some of those onboard were from, found that 750 to 800 people had been on the vessel. Other witness accounts have put the number at between 400 and 750. The UN\u2019s human rights agency has said up to 500 people are still missing, making the sinking potentially the second deadliest refugee and migrant shipwreck after the April 2015 capsizing of another vessel on the Libya-Italy route that killed up to 1,100 people. The UN has called for an investigation into Greece\u2019s handling of the disaster amid claims the coastguard should have intervened earlier to prevent it. Greek authorities have rejected claims the boat sank after an attempt was made to tow it. Coastguard and government officials have defended the decision not to step in sooner to save the rusting steel trawler, which left eastern Libya on 9 June carrying men, women and children from Syria, Egypt, the Palestinian territories and Pakistan. A full-scale rescue attempt was not possible, they said, because the people on the boat repeatedly refused assistance and were not in danger. Any kind of forcible intervention could have caused the badly overloaded boat to capsize, they said. The coastguard has said that the trawler was moving forward more or less steadily until minutes before it sank. Activists, however, say people onboard were clearly in danger and making frequent pleas for help more than 15 hours before the boat sank. International maritime law experts have said conditions on the trawler, some of whose passengers were reportedly ill and which was supplied with water and food by at least one passing merchant ship, meant the people onboard were clearly at risk. The state of the vessel and its passengers should have prompted an immediate rescue operation, regardless of what the people onboard may have said, legal experts argue. The captain of a Greek coastguard vessel that finally reached the trawler less than three hours before it sank has testified to investigating authorities that the passengers refused any help whatsoever, Greek media have reported. He said when the coastguard boat tied a rope to the trawler\u2019s bow after it stopped moving just before midnight on Tuesday, some passengers cried: \u201cNo help\u201d and \u201cGo Italy\u201d, untied the rope, and restarted the engine \u2013 which stopped again at 1.40am. The Guardian analysis substantiates a BBC report based on tracking data supplied by another maritime analytics platform, MarineTraffic, which also indicates the fishing trawler was stationary and clearly not advancing for up to seven hours. Nine survivors from the shipwreck, all Egyptian men aged between 20 and 40 and accused of people-smuggling and other offences, pleaded not guilty in court on Monday, with a lawyer for one of them saying his client had been a passenger. The court in Kalamata postponed the hearing until Tuesday to provide them and their lawyers with time to review the testimonies of the suspects, who were reportedly identified as members of a smuggling ring by some of the survivors. They face charges of participating in a criminal organisation, causing a shipwreck and endangering lives. In a separate incident on Monday, the coastguard said 68 people were rescued in the eastern Aegean after the yacht they were on sent a distress signal. The boat, believed to have set sail from Turkey, issued a distress call early on Monday. Its passengers were initially picked up by two Russian vessels before being transferred to a coastguard boat and taken to the nearby island of Leros. In Pakistan, authorities in Islamabad said they had arrested 14 suspects in connection with alleged human trafficking related to last week\u2019s shipwreck, and police added that they were searching for more suspects. A statement from the office of the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said a high-level inquiry had been ordered into the network believed to be involved. Flags were flown at half-mast after Monday was declared a day of national mourning."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319d2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/19/letter-pete-brown-obituary", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Letter: Pete Brown obituary", "lead": "<strong>Tony Hudd writes:</strong> During the 1970s, I was part of a folk trio called Poem.

Brian Meehan\u2019s colt was a ready winner of the Group Two Superlative Stakes at Newmarket last summer and made an impressive in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury in April. That form will be dismissed by some as Chaldean, the subsequent 2,000 Guineas winner, unseated Frankie Dettori shortly after the start but Isaac Shelby won in a strong time and his form at Longchamp next time up was franked when the winner, Marhaba Ya Sanafi, finished third in the French Derby. Chaldean has been winning on much softer ground than he is likely to encounter on Tuesday and Paddington arguably beat a sub-standard field at the Curragh, while the unbeaten Cicero\u2019s Gift still has plenty to find on his latest form to figure. That leaves Isaac Shelby (4.20), who will be ridden by William Buick for the first time, as the clear pick of the prices to give Qatar-based Wathnan Racing, which bought the colt privately last month, a first European winner at Group One level. Ascot 2.30 Modern Games is impressively consistent at Group One level but Inspiral\u2019s emphatic success first time up in the Coronation Stakes last year is arguably the best individual piece of form on offer here and she can get Frankie Dettori\u2019s final Royal meeting off to the best possible start. Ascot 3.05 The visual impression of Asadna\u2019s 12-length win at Ripon last month was backed up by a remarkable time for a juvenile on debut and he deserves to be joint-favourite, at least, with Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s River Tiber, so at around 3-1 or better he is definitely worth an interest. Ascot 3.40 Several interesting new rivals for Highfield Princess, including Australian-trained Coolnagatta and the three-year-old Dramatised, but John Quinn\u2019s hugely popular mare looked as good as ever under a penalty at York last month and will take all the beating with that race under her girth. Ascot 5.00 Runners from big jumping yards head the betting but Calling The Wind, with the excellent apprentice Billy Loughnane taking off 3lb, has also been dropped 1lb since running into traffic in the closing stages of the Chester Cup and has definite claims at around 10-1. Ascot 5.35 Cadillac looked back to his best when successful in a handicap at Epsom earlier this month and may have crept in unnoticed here at around 12-1. Ascot 6.10 A decent turn of foot carried Ruling Dynasty nearly seven lengths clear at Haydock last time and a third straight success is a distinct possibility."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319d5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/christian-horner-hails-max-verstappen-as-one-of-the-greats-of-formula-one", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018A mega talent\u2019: Horner puts Max Verstappen among the greats of F1", "lead": "The Dutchman equalled Ayrton Senna\u2019s 41 career race wins in Montreal while Lewis Hamilton admitted catching up with Red Bull would be a tall order", "author": "Giles Richards", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:03:57", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175540", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5a07bf984648bf855a92de626b0c1176c900cb85/0_13_4299_2579/500.jpg", "body": "Christian Horner hailed his driver Max Verstappen as one of the greats of Formula One, after the Dutchman matched Ayrton Senna\u2019s tally of wins with victory for Red Bull at the Canadian Grand Prix. Verstappen took the flag in Montreal with another dominant run from pole to secure his 41st career win, equalling Senna. He now has six wins from eight races this season and, with a 69-point lead over his teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez in the championship, is on course to seal his third title sooner rather than later. Horner believes those achievements have elevated his driver to stand among the very best the sport has produced. \u201cWhat we are witnessing with Max is the emergence of another mega talent,\u201d the Red Bull team principal said. \u201cYou can start talking about him in the same sentence as the greats now after he matched Ayrton Senna. \u201cMax just keeps delivering at such a high level. The race was fantastic but to take pole position in conditions that were continually changing, his ability to adapt to whatever grip level he had, was Max at his best.\u201d Verstappen, who is only 25 despite being in his eighth season in Formula One, is now the fifth most successful F1 driver in terms of wins, behind Alain Prost, Sebastian Vettel, Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton who heads the field with 103. Verstappen acknowledged the feat was \u201cincredible\u201d and Horner believed it was significant for the Dutchman. \u201cPart of him inside will be quite proud of that,\u201d Horner said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is one to show huge emotion. He is a very modest guy. He is very understated in many ways. But behind the scenes it will mean quite a lot to him.\u201d The win was also the 100th for Red Bull since the team\u2019s debut in 2005. With their car the class of the field this year, more are sure to follow as they look to close out another drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship double. They remain unbeaten this year with eight wins from eight meetings, still potentially able to complete a record clean sweep of victories. They are unlikely to be caught this season and Hamilton, who was third behind Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso in Canada, believes they enjoy such an advantage that they may have already shifted resources into developing next year\u2019s car. His Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, who was pleased with the steps his team have made with their new car concept, conceded that they remained around two-tenths of a lap off Red Bull and Hamilton acknowledged that bridging that gap was a tall order. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about their amazing performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that they will win every race, moving forwards, this year, unless the Astons and us put a lot more performance on the cars.\u201d Wolff, however, confirmed that Mercedes were pressing on with a very aggressive development programme, promising major upgrades for the British Grand Prix, which should suit their car\u2019s strengths. \u201cWe are bringing a large one to Silverstone and another one before the [summer] shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe learning has accelerated a lot since we changed some of the conceptual architecture, so there should be decent steps coming in the next four races.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319d6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/heavy-casualties-both-sides-ukraine-offensive-russia", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Heavy casualties on both sides as Ukraine offensive edges forward", "lead": "British intelligence report comes as Kyiv celebrates liberation of eighth settlement in south of country", "author": "Daniel Boffey in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:54:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175557", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3aab884aba135b7c1625dca939d10fe174a34ad9/0_398_5976_3586/500.jpg", "body": "Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, as Kyiv celebrated the liberation of an eighth settlement in the south of the country, two weeks into its offensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 soldiers. The progress of Ukraine\u2019s forces in both the east and south of the country has been slow, with much of the heavy western weaponry and new brigades yet to be committed to battle. The deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar announced that the capture of the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern part of Zaporizhzhia, brought the tally of liberated settlements up to eight, with 113sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. Ukraine\u2019s border guard service released images of several Ukrainian service personnel holding their national flag at Piatykhatky. \u201cToday, 18 June, the forces of 128 Assault Brigade chased out the Russians from the village of Piatykhatky. The Russians ran away, leaving equipment and ammunition. Glory to Ukraine,\u201d an unidentified soldier said in a video that could not be independently verified. Maliar said Ukrainian troops were coming up against fierce resistance in the east of the country, particularly around Bakhmut, the symbolically important town captured recently by Russia after months of close combat fighting and heavy casualties. \u201cThe Russians have transferred additional units there and increased the amount of shelling,\u201d she said. Maliar said the situation in the east of the country was \u201cdifficult\u201d after initial positive reports over advances around Bakhmut. She said: \u201cThe enemy has raised its forces and is conducting an active offensive in the Lyman and Kupyan directions, trying to seize the initiative from us. High activity of enemy shelling is recorded. Intense battles continue. \u201cThe enemy does not abandon his plans to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Currently, this is the enemy\u2019s main offensive line. Therefore, it has concentrated a significant number of units in the east, in particular the airborne assault units. Our troops act courageously in the face of the enemy\u2019s superiority in forces and means, and do not allow the enemy to advance.\u201d In a phone call on Monday, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told Volodymyr Zelenskiy that it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d, Downing Street said. Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Monday that its forces had fought off a Ukrainian attempt to take the village of Novodonetske in the eastern Donetsk region, on the road to Mariupol, close to where Ukrainian forces have enjoyed recent success, according to Reuters. Russia was reported to have moved troops to the southern Donetsk front, including 20 attack helicopters, from the Kherson region, where the destruction of the Kakhovka dam has reduced the potential of Ukrainian forces to cross the enlarged Dnipro. In recent days, the 68th brigade, among others, had blazed a trail south from Velyka Novosilka, a small town 75 miles (120km) north of Mariupol, but they appear to have struggled to make further progress. The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based military observatory group, said in an analytical note on Monday that Ukraine\u2019s forces had probably taken back some territory from Russian forces over the weekend. \u201cUkrainian forces continued counteroffensive actions on at least four sectors of the front on 18 June and made limited territorial gains,\u201d it said. Russia\u2019s FSB security service claimed on Monday to have thwarted Ukrainian \u201csabotage and terrorist plots\u201d targeting Russian-installed officials in the occupied territory, arresting one woman as part of its investigation. Criminal cases were said to have been opened against the unnamed woman it described as \u201can accomplice\u201d on charges related to terrorism and the illegal possession of explosives. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. The regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote: \u201cThe Valuisk municipal district is under attack from Ukrainian forces. According to preliminary information, seven people were wounded, among them a child.\u201d Strikes on the Kursk border region were also said to have hit two villages, causing damage but no casualties, the local governor, Roman Starovoit, said. \u201cUkrainian forces hit the Tyotkino and Popovo-Lezhachi villages this morning,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. In Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the governor, Sergei Aksyonov, said two drones were shot down overnight. During a press conference with Nato\u2019s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said his government was prepared for the possibility of a lengthy war in Ukraine. \u201cWe are preparing for that and adjusting our policies based on that,\u201d Scholz said, adding that Germany would continue to support Kyiv for as long as was necessary."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319d7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/info/live/2023/jun/19/product-and-engineering-away-day-2023-live", "primaryCategory": "info", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Product and Engineering away day 2023 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "All the news and updates from the 2023 Guardian Product and Engineering away day", "author": "Calvin Dickson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:39:09", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175575", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8cec2954bd490ae3eb5f8e06d2c21126b2072739/0_208_6240_3744/500.jpg", "body": "Nichola is back on stage to wrap up the day.

This whole thing is being judged? Suddenly I\u2019m really invested. A dramatisation of a date between an inflatable saxophone and a picture frame. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I think someone might have spiked my coffee at lunch. Another Christmas presentation. There seems to be a theme emerging in this summer away day. Up next, a story about Elton John at Glastonbury. This performance definitely wins the award for the best costume so far. Now we have two reluctant presenters. They are up with the \u201c12 trash gifts of Christmas\u201d. Delivered with a real sense of disdain, that was up there with my favourites. The next group are up with \u201cThe Wrong Show\u201d. A parody of the One Show with some real focus on staging. Great acting gets it a thumbs up from me. Next team are up to discuss \u201cBasecamp Studios\u201d, the new Guardian Hollywood film studio. They are performing \u201cPartygate: The Movie\u201d. Short, sweet and disturbingly accurate. Now up we have a team talking about \u201cLego Fridays\u201d. Four team members are now having their lego builds live judged by Nichola Johnson. It cannot be confirmed whether or not the winner will get a monetary prize. The next team have brought a first aid kit to the stage. A little bit ominous \u2026 The next team to take the stage have done so with an abundance of props and visual aids. Who\u2019s to say what\u2019s in store? Next to take the stage \u201cChocolate coins as a new currency\u201d. Sounds delicious, I\u2019m in! And now what we\u2019ve all been waiting for. The presentations! Up first, \u201cCloudy with a chance of beach balls\u201d. A story about plastic balls raining from the sky in a freak weather event. A great presentation, with some fantastic associated graphics. Kath is now taking questions from the floor. A variety of questions and some insight into her cultural influences (a lot of The Smiths). Some of the perks of the job? Kath has met seven UK prime ministers and three US presidents. Caspar asks, \u201cDoes the news ever get too upsetting?\u201d Kath responds that the proximity to the news may not give her the chance to have those feelings. She says that something that probably helps her is the fact that she feels as if she is trying to make a difference to the problems every day. Caspar then asks Kath about the value of print in the modern, digital-first climate. She explains the extend to which an important part of our identity and something that sets us apart from other publishers. Kath talks to the department about how her day to day job works. The day is split into journalism focused work in the morning and then more strategic and organisational work throughout the rest of the day and afternoon. She touches upon the dangers and opportunities of AI in the future and some of her favourite apps (aside from our own of course). And we\u2019re back! Kath Viner is here on stage with Caspar for a live Q&amp;A. 15 minutes to have a quick drink, after which I am hearing we will be joined by the editor, Kath Viner! The biggest name I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of reporting on (sorry Caspar). I\u2019m getting nervous already. Things are really ramping up. It looks like there will be everything from duelling elves to a puppet show and everything in between. Emotions are at fever pitch as the teams scramble to tighten up their scripts, presentations and cheap costumes. There are rumours floating around that one of the presentations will be \u201ca mixed media show combining found footage and live improvised action\u201d. I may have undersold the amateur level of these dramatics. We could be seeing one of these performances debut at indie film festivals in the near future. It\u2019s looking like some of the teams are working on fully acted out scenarios. The anticipation is building here for the presentations. Who doesn\u2019t love hurried amateur dramatics? In keeping with tradition, Colin King has snapped a pic of me liveblogging while I was unaware. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m looking at here, but it looks like it is stressing me out. There is a creative hum around the space. People are donning strange outfits and giggling as they create their wacky and wonderful stories. I can simultaneously see someone throwing a beach ball, two people shaking cheerleader\u2019s pom-poms, a person playing an inflatable guitar and someone wearing reindeer antlers. People\u2019s names will be omitted for the sake of their own dignity. Shervin is giving everyone the lowdown on the next activity. Everyone is to split into teams and pick up a random set of items from the stage. There are hats, scarves, novelty glasses, decks of cards and all other manor of joke shop accoutrements. The teams are now groups of journalists after the big scoop. They are being given 40 minutes to create and report on a story related to the objects they have collected. At the end of the time, all of the teams will present their cutting edge journalism back to the room. This could be interesting. A wide array of sandwiches and confectionary was provided for lunch. I am well fed and back for some more this afternoon. What\u2019s next on the agenda? Something called \u201cMost entertaining story\u201d. This sounds very promising.

The first, Caspar is armed with a bunch of P&amp;E Away Day 2023 stickers. A must have accessory for any self-respecting member of the department. And second, it\u2019s lunch! See you back here in an hour. Alert. David Blishen has made a list. He has gathered thoughts from people around the room on what they are most scared of. From not being able to publish, to being locked out of the systems for six months and anything in between. I\u2019m sure it makes for terrifying reading for anyone and that he is keeping it in a safe place. First up, how would we rebuild the department from scratch. Group Product Manager Jess Lane shares some interesting details around restructure of teams and how this may impact speed of delivery. Then a bombshell \u2026 the group propose a change to the name of the department! The second session of the unconference time has come to a close. There will now be some time for feedback on the topics. Who will step up to share their thoughts? It\u2019s nearly time on session two. I\u2019m hearing there will be a brief summary of each discussion back to the room. Let\u2019s see what the future holds for us all. And that\u2019s time on session one. For session two we have eight more topics for people to join. I can see a big congregation of people for a chat on AI. Maybe ChatGPT will be writing this live blog next year? Philip McMahon takes to the stage and gives the 5-minute warning. The groups are being encouraged to wrap up their discussions. A calm has fallen over the great hall. There are pockets people in focused and collaborative discussion on various big topics. It is lovely to see. We are through the icebreakers now (mostly unscathed) and on to the real substance of the day. Next up, the \u201cunconference\u201d. The department have been asked to suggest topics for eight discussions that will happen in different groups around the room. Sabina Bejasa-Dimmock takes the mic to explain the rules. You are free to join and leave a discussion as you please and are invited to move around to different discussions as you see fit. Don\u2019t overstay your welcome if you feel you are not engaged or do not wish to contribute. There are such topics of discussion as: \u2022 The decline of mobile web \u2022 The need for green software practices \u2022 If we built the department from scratch, what would we do differently? These are some big themes, I\u2019m still trying to figure out the rules! It is our UX and service designer Abolade Akintunde\u2019s birthday! The entire hall breaks into a chorus of Happy Birthday led by our fantastic senior agile lead Shervin Sahraei. A surprisingly tuneful rendition as well. The first activity of the day is \u201cGetting to know you Bingo\u201d. The aim of the game, find someone in the room with every characteristic on your list. The floor is suddenly awash with people striding around trying to fill their Bingo sheets. Who loves Beyonc\u00e9? Who has never been on a plane? Who hates summer? All will be revealed. Wow, it\u2019s good to be back! Today we\u2019re at the wonderful Bishopsgate Institute. David Blishen (Group Product Manager) has informed me this is the venue of his finals exams, although he would not disclose the year. The day kicks off, as always, with an introduction from our Chief Product Officer Caspar Llewellyn Smith. There was something about a statue of a goat that I didn\u2019t quite catch\u2026 hope it wasn\u2019t important. Hello, and welcome to the 2023 Guardian Product and Engineering away day. We\u2019ll be blogging throughout the day, discussing the new features and enhancements we have added to the Guardian\u2019s digital products.

In an era of hyper-connectivity, millions are left in the shadows, even in the wealthiest countries. Data from the US shows that a quarter of America\u2019s rural population, a staggering 14.5 million people, still don\u2019t have access to broadband. In a world where billions are connected, the stark reality of this absence looms large, leaving more than 3 billion people on the margins of the digital age. As life moves online, it only exacerbates existing inequalities, limiting access to education, healthcare, job opportunities and essential services. This takes us to Kerala in south India, home to about 34 million people. There, the communist-led state government is launching something called the Kerala Fibre Optical Network (KFON) \u2013 and it\u2019s a major milestone. (It is worth noting the irony that the communist government, which has a history of opposing the introduction of computers, is now at the forefront of this digital initiative.) In 2016, the state recognised the internet as a basic citizen\u2019s right, joining other polities like Finland, Costa Rica and France. Next on the agenda: making this new right mean something. Despite facing various setbacks \u2013 such as the pandemic and a corruption allegation that led to the arrest of the senior bureaucrat who was previously in charge of KFON (he denies the allegation) \u2013 the project has finally been launched. It\u2019s a fibre-optic broadband network project, aiming to provide affordable and reliable internet connectivity to every household, government institution and business entity in the state. Marred by delays, the project is taking a cautious approach, starting with about 14,000 relatively poor households throughout the state that will be getting internet connectivity this month. The extensive KFON network has reached even the most remote areas, like tribal hamlets in faraway regions in Wayanad. The project aims to eventually provide free internet connections to 2 million economically disadvantaged households in the state \u2013 this is expected in the next 12 to 18 months. The other 6 million or so households Kerala will have the option of choosing from a range of affordable data packages, starting from just under 300 rupees (\u00a32.86) a month for a 20 Mbps connection. (For context, rural farm workers in Kerala make about 727 rupees a day.) All this \u2013 along with installing the infrastructure in schools and government buildings \u2013 is expected to have a multiplier effect within society, with significant benefits for healthcare, education, skill development and business opportunities, to name just a few. Alongside the expansion of the infrastructure, the government has initiated digital literacy campaigns at the grassroots level, working with local bodies to ensure that individuals from the marginalised communities have the skills necessary to use the internet; the aim is to empower every citizen with the ability to leverage the benefits of digital connectivity in their daily lives. In several low- and middle-income country settings, where service delivery is affected by infrastructure bottlenecks and gaps in human resources, digital interventions like this can offer a great leap forward for equity in access. For instance, the eSanjeevani project, a free telemedicine service initiated by the government of India, has achieved a remarkable milestone of 125m tele-consultations in just over three years of operation.

Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital are under pressure to move players out of Chelsea and the ownership hopes to offload a number of expensive misfits to the big-spending Saudi Pro League. Although Romelu Lukaku has snubbed interest from Al-Hilal and hopes to return to Inter on loan, many of the Belgian striker\u2019s teammates are open to moving to the Middle East. Chelsea are in talks with Al-Nassr over a deal for the Morocco winger Ziyech, who wants to team up with Cristiano Ronaldo, and Koulibaly is likely to join Al-Hilal for about \u20ac30m (\u00a325.5m). Mendy, who lost his place in goal to Kepa Arrizabalaga last season, is likely to move to Al-Ahli. Chelsea, who are also set to lose N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 on a free transfer to Al-Ittihad, need to sell players after spending close to \u00a3600m since last summer. Their transfer activity has left them with a bloated squad and has led to speculation over them falling foul of Financial Fair Play regulations. Club insiders have insisted there are no concerns over FFP. Nonetheless the recent flurry of activity from Saudi Arabian clubs thanks to investment from the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund is a welcome development for Chelsea as they look to streamline Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s squad. Chelsea were willing to sell Ziyech in January and the former Ajax playmaker was left aggrieved after a loan move to Paris Saint-Germain broke down because of technical glitches on deadline day. Pochettino is not short of attacking midfielders and Ziyech, who joined Chelsea for \u00a337m in 2020, has been inconsistent during his time in west London. Koulibaly has also struggled since his \u00a333.8m move from Napoli last summer. The 31-year-old Senegal centre-back has not adapted to the pace of the Premier League but there were concerns that his high wages would make it difficult for Chelsea to shift him. Inter failed with a loan bid for Koulibaly last week. Al-Hilal, though, will have no problem matching Koulibaly\u2019s wages. There will be sadness over Mendy leaving. The Senegal goalkeeper was a smart signing from Rennes in 2020 and played a key role in Chelsea winning the Champions League two years ago but his form has deserted him during the past 18 months. Mendy struggled with injuries last season and has not agreed a new deal. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has been a major flop since joining Chelsea last year, also has interest from several Saudi clubs. Chelsea are expected to raise funds by selling Mason Mount to Manchester United, Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and Kai Havertz to Arsenal. They are set to step up their efforts to sign the Brighton midfielder Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, and the Villarreal striker Nicolas Jackson. Well-placed sources believe they will bid for the Celta Vigo midfielder Gabri Veiga soon."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319da", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/liz-truss-lettuce-joke-puerile-media", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Liz Truss says lettuce joke was \u2018puerile\u2019 and media did not understand her ideas", "lead": "Former PM criticises Daily Star stunt at Dublin conference but says UK media\u2019s irreverence is a good thing overall", "author": "Peter Walker Deputy political editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:15:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175692", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/91a8fdb3255b1719192cda1c6722cd807065427b/0_371_5568_3341/500.jpg", "body": "Liz Truss has described as \u201cpuerile\u201d the newspaper stunt in which her tenure as prime minister was measured against the shelf life of a lettuce. Speaking at a broadcasting conference in Dublin, Truss also complained that the media did not properly understand her economic ideas. She said too much political coverage was \u201cfroth\u201d, while at the same time praising the overall irreverence of the UK. Interviewed at the News Xchange event by the RT\u00c9 journalist David McCullagh, Truss was reminded of the Daily Star\u2019s decision to livestream the decline of a lettuce in a blond wig, after an Economist article a fortnight before she was ousted, likening the then-PM\u2019s political longevity to that of the lettuce. Asked by McCullagh if she could see the funny side of the Star\u2019s decision, Truss, whose comments were reported by the Press Gazette, replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, I just think it\u2019s puerile.\u201d Truss also disputed the idea that the Economist\u2019s original parallel was a fair one to make, saying: \u201cI mean, what\u2019s the relevance of that?

To me it\u2019s not a very relevant question.\u201d More widely, Truss argued, the UK media were focused overly on trivialities, and did not properly understand economics \u2013 especially the sort of small-state, low-tax economics she espoused in her disastrous, sub-50-day period in No 10. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got a criticism of the media, there\u2019s too much focus on the people and seeing it as a sort of entertaining story to follow \u2026 rather than discussions of the ideas.

But I think we\u2019re operating in an environment where the economic ideas that I believe in are not widely understood.\u201d Truss nonetheless praised the UK media for their irreverent and robust approach, saying: \u201cI think the British media are known around the world for being particularly vociferous \u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly deferential to politicians. \u201cCertainly, when I went to international summits I would get a lot of sympathy from politicians from other countries who were saying: \u2018My God, your press \u2013 what are those people like!\u2019 \u201cI think the irreverence of the media in Britain is a good thing on the whole.

The firefighters had to force open the train\u2019s doors to free passengers, some of whom were suffering from heat exhaustion after a lengthy holdup in the train in which the air conditioning failed. Footage showed passengers, including some in wheelchairs and children in prams, being brought to safety along a forest track by firefighters. Thermal cameras were flown over the forest to ensure that no passengers had been left behind while other train traffic in the area was brought to a standstill amid fears of passengers on the tracks. The incident was the latest in a series of reports of malfunctioning trains, cancelled and delayed services and faulty rail infrastructure. Deutsche Bahn puts the problems down to a chronic lack of investment and a personnel shortage, which has worsened since the pandemic. Germany\u2019s three-way coalition government, which includes the Greens, believes rail transport is key to efforts to reach net zero targets, but experts say the country\u2019s trains are in such a parlous state these goals will be almost impossible to reach. A groundbreaking plan to synchronise long-distance and regional transport so trains would run every half-hour in both rural and urban areas, was recently put back from 2030 to 2070. Calling it the \u201cproject of the century\u201d, Michael Theurer, of the pro-business FDP and government ombudsman responsible for overseeing rail transport, admitted the Deutschlandtakt or \u201cGermany Rhythm\u201d was more appropriately to be seen as a \u201cprogramme for the next 50 years\u201d. Marissa Reiserer, of Greenpeace, has said the government\u2019s failure amounts to a \u201cclimate crime\u201d that will do grave damage to its own goals to reduce CO2 emissions in the next seven years by 65% compared with 1990 levels. The railway system is in need of about \u20ac60bn of investment but even that figure is said to be an underestimate as costs rise with inflation. Michael Peterson, the chair of Deutsche Bahn\u2019s long-distance transport arm, admitted in a recent interview in Die Zeit that too little had been invested in the rail network over years. \u201cSince the 1970s, Germany has been investing far too little in rail. The Swiss invest five to six times more per resident, in Austria, it\u2019s three times more \u2026 Already 10 years ago, these investment deficits were publicly said to be up to \u20ac50bn,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone can see it for themselves that lack of investment has led to the current infrastructure now being at a tipping point, which is why we\u2019re drastically trying to turn things round.\u201d He said many works were taking place simultaneously, in which everything from overhead lines to tracks, signal boxes, stations and level crossings were being repaired and modernised, which was also having a detrimental effect on services. At the same time, Peterson said, train travel had become more popular than ever, prompting plans to double passenger capacity by 2030, with longer trains, double decker inter-city expresses and smaller inter-cities away from major destinations. \u201cGuaranteed, by 2029 the situation in the whole of Germany will have improved,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319dc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/19/arctic-monkeys-glastonbury-2023-headline-set-thrown-into-doubt-by-alex-turners-laryngitis", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Arctic Monkeys: Glastonbury 2023 headline set thrown into doubt by Alex Turner\u2019s laryngitis ", "lead": "Band cancel open-air Dublin gig on Tuesday, leaving a nervous wait for fans looking forward to Friday\u2019s Glastonbury set", "author": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:10:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175729", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/de8fa9b04afa93ccf0c9dbac4e5256679f23a66f/0_43_5138_3082/500.jpg", "body": "Alex Turner, frontman with Arctic Monkeys, is suffering from \u201cacute laryngitis\u201d and the band have been forced to cancel an open-air concert in Dublin on Tuesday.

The company, which has about 500 stores and is considered a good barometer of consumer spending, said in a surprise update that there had been an \u201cover-performance\u201d in sales over the past seven weeks, sending its share price nearly 5% higher and making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. Next, which is helmed by its longstanding chief executive, Simon Wolfson, cited the warmer spell of weather \u2013 \u201cparticularly coming after a wet and cold April\u201d \u2013 that had prompted people to update their wardrobes with summer clothing. It said pay rises awarded to UK workers at the beginning of the financial year in April were also likely to have played a part. The retailer said: \u201cIn an inflationary environment, annual salary increases deliver a significant uplift in real household income at the time they are awarded. We do not think it is a coincidence that sales stepped forward so markedly at a time of year when many organisations make their annual pay awards.\u201d Annual inflation remains high, having fallen to 8.7% in April, a smaller-than-expected decline. Nevertheless, April\u2019s monthly inflation figure, comparing prices with March, stood at 1.2%. That prompted Next to argue that a worker given a 5% pay rise that month would get a 3.8% increase in real income, temporarily putting more money in consumers\u2019 pockets. Next said full-price sales from the end of April until mid-June were 9.3% higher compared with a year earlier, enabling it to beat estimates for the period by \u00a393m. This compared with a 5% decline in sales predicted for the period in early May. As a result of better trading, the company upgraded its full-price sales guidance for the whole year by \u00a3137m and its annual profit forecast by \u00a340m to \u00a3835m. The \u201cmaterially better\u201d trading at Next comes just weeks after it warned the cold and damp weather during early spring and the cost of living crisis had knocked its sales, and predicted this would continue. Shares in other retailers including the Sports Direct owner, Frasers Group; Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods; and the electronics retailer Currys also gained in response. Emily Salter, lead analyst at GlobalData, said Next\u2019s trading update showed that consumers had \u201ccontinued to spend, whether supported by any remaining savings they built up during lockdowns or by the proliferation of buy now, pay later schemes\u201d and that Next had been a beneficiary of this. Next warned the impact of recent pay rises and the arrival of warmer weather would fade over time, as inflation remains elevated, eroding the effect of higher salaries. It said it did not expect its current performance to continue at the same level in the coming months. Analysts at the US investment bank Jefferies said Next\u2019s improved sales showed that \u201cthe combination of pent-up demand on seasonal items and the recovery of purchasing power through wage rises\u201d was proving \u201cmore powerful a driver\u201d for consumers than the impact of higher mortgage rates on homeowners, and the challenge of higher UK government borrowing costs. Recent UK wage data from the Office for National Statistics showed growth in average regular pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 7.2% in the three months to April \u2013 the highest level on record, excluding the Covid pandemic. The wage figures, combined with elevated levels of inflation, drove up yields on two-year UK government bonds \u2013 known as gilts \u2013 and reinforced expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again on Thursday. Next\u2019s trading update \u201ccould also signal more enduring pressure on the gilt front,\u201d Jefferies analysts said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319de", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/eu-split-over-subsidies-for-coal-plants-as-poland-seeks-extension", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "EU split over subsidies for coal plants as Poland seeks extension", "lead": "Luxembourg calls proposal by Sweden \u2018astonishing\u2019 as energy ministers gather to discuss overhaul", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll in Brussels", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:05:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175764", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/664ce1e4540c623f6a27336d456d5d65267e24d7/0_253_4346_2608/500.jpg", "body": "EU nations have failed to agree on new plans for energy supplies across the bloc after a bid to extend subsidies for coal burning power stations was blocked. EU energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg ended talks without a joint stance on the rules that also seek to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s energy crisis, when record-high gas prices left consumers with soaring energy bills. The talks were complicated by a late proposal by Sweden, which holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, to allow countries to prolong capacity mechanism subsidies for coal power plants that pay generators to keep enough capacity on standby to avoid blackouts. Countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg had objected to the proposal on coal subsidies, saying it would undermine Europe\u2019s goals to fight climate change. Earlier Luxembourg\u2019s energy minister describing the proposal as \u201castonishing\u201d. Luxembourg\u2019s energy minister, Claude Turmes, said he could not believe the proposal, which was made on Friday, days before a planned summit of energy ministers from across the bloc, was even on the table given the EU\u2019s commitment to combating the climate emergency. \u201cFriday, the Swedish presidency did something really astonishing which is weakening our climate policy by \u2026 reopening the possibility to subsidise coal power plants,\u201d he told reporters before the summit in Luxembourg. Some countries consider this a measure to help Poland, which uses coal to produce about 70% of its energy. Poland is expected to soon surpass Germany as Europe\u2019s top power polluter due to aggressive planned reductions in fossil fuel use across Germany, creating assumptions that Poland will have no choice but to remain Europe\u2019s most coal-reliant nation for years to come. So far this year, Poland has defied expectations by cutting coal use and pollution to the lowest level since at least 2014, and by raising clean power output to record highs just as Germany cut its clean generation by shutting nuclear reactors. \u201cWe have a big bloc of countries that will reject the proposal of the Swedish presidency \u2026 so it\u2019s a clear no,\u201d Turmes said ahead of the summit on Monday. Spain\u2019s minister for ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, said some thought had to be given to Poland, which is heavily reliant on coal, while the French energy minister, Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, said extending support to Poland was an \u201cambitious approach\u201d \u2013 a hint Paris was more open towards the move than other member states like Germany. \u201cWe need to take into account the reality of each country to ensure their capacity to provide energy to their people and to their industries,\u201d she said. Belgium sided with Luxembourg, describing such a move as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Tinne van der Straeten, the energy minister, said: \u201cIn Belgium we already have in our national legislation the obligation to become climate neutral and to have a steep decline in emission by 2030 and 2040.

Scientists have warned the planned massive expansion of hydraulic fracturing \u2013 or fracking \u2013 for gas in the Beetaloo basin will have an unacceptable impact on the climate. But on the ground there is another battle playing out. Beckett has spent more than two decades working in native title, including a period at the Northern Land Council (NLC). But he now believes the land council is not effectively doing its job as a representative for traditional owners in negotiations with gas companies. \u201cSo many of the people up there are opposed, are fearful, about contemporary fracking practices on their land and the scale of operations. That\u2019s very clear from the time I\u2019ve spent up there,\u201d he says. The NLC\u2019s role is to help Aboriginal people in the northern half of the Northern Territory acquire and manage their traditional lands and seas. It\u2019s a commonwealth-funded statutory authority that traces its roots back to the land rights movement of the 1970s and has been instrumental in traditional owners across the Top End winning back land. But dozens of traditional owners in the Beetaloo basin now say the NLC is no longer acting in their interests. A number of them have told Guardian Australia they felt under pressure by the land council to sign agreements with gas companies to frack on their country rather than risk the matter going to the native title tribunal. They say the NLC appears to them to be \u201cin the business of facilitating fracking\u201d. Johnny Wilson, a Gudanji-Wandaya man who is a jungai, or cultural lawman, for his family\u2019s country, said: \u201cThe NLC is supposed to be representing us. But we see them doing not anywhere near that.\u201d But a spokesperson for the NLC strongly rejected the claims, saying the land council had \u201ca proud history of fighting for land rights, against governments, miners and other vested interest groups [and] setting groundbreaking legal precedents\u201d. They say criticism should instead be directed at native title law, which doesn\u2019t give a right of veto over gas exploration or production, and noted there was a diversity of opinions among Territorians, including Aboriginal people, about fracking. Hundreds of fracking wells The Beetaloo basin is the name governments and industry have given to an area of about 28,000 sq km between Katherine and Tennant Creek. The name is drawn from a single pastoral station 40km off the Stuart Highway but the entire basin takes in communities including Daly Waters, Newcastle Waters, Larrimah and Elliott and, on its borders, places such as Mataranka, which is home to natural springs that feed into the Roper River. The basin was the focal point of the former Morrison government\u2019s proposed \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d from the Covid-19 pandemic and is central to the Northern Territory government\u2019s plans for a $40bn territory economy by 2030. Despite the International Energy Agency\u2019s warnings that no new coal or gas projects can proceed if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C, the expansion of the Beetaloo has the backing of both major parties. The main companies with active exploration in the basin are Tamboran Resources \u2013 which in 2022 bought Origin Energy\u2019s projects in the Beetaloo \u2013 and Empire Energy. One of Tamboran\u2019s exploration permits is a joint venture with Santos. If the basin reaches full production, hundreds or potentially thousands of wells could be drilled using fracking across the landscape. The 2018 Pepper inquiry into fracking in the territory found Aboriginal people from regional communities who made submissions to the panel \u201calmost universally expressed deep concern about, and strong opposition to, the development of any onshore shale gas industry on their country\u201d. A bid to take back control Wilson lives on an outstation on the Carpentaria Highway and says he can smell the gas well 20km from his home when there\u2019s a change in the weather. He is worried about how fracking might affect songlines, which connect one place with another, and the groundwater that people and ecosystems rely on. Ninety per cent of the territory\u2019s water supply comes from groundwater. \u201cIt\u2019s a tossing and turning situation at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this energy in your head, all these questions: why is it happening like this? \u201cIt hurts me really badly \u2026 Sometimes I pray at night for something to go right.\u201d Wilson is the chair of the Nurrdalinji Aboriginal Corporation, an organisation that is made up of more than 60 native title holders from 11 determination areas in the Beetaloo. There are hundreds of native title holders in the basin and at least 11 determination areas, depending on how you define its boundaries. In December 2020, he and a group of six other traditional owners, represented by Beckett, applied to the federal court to have Nurrdalinji recognised as the body that would represent the rights and interests of native title holders in nine of the determination areas, including in their dealings with governments and developers about gas exploration. In short, it proposed that Nurrdalinji take on a role performed by the NLC. Beckett says the land council\u2019s response was swift and aggressive. In a letter to the lawyer, seen by Guardian Australia, the NLC recommended his clients discontinue their proceedings because the application \u201chas no reasonable prospects of success\u201d. If they did not, it warned the land council would pursue an indemnity costs order for its full legal costs to be paid by the individual applicants and an Indigenous organisation by the name of Original Power, which was supporting the traditional owners. \u201cI think it was an attempt to scare off both the traditional owners and their supporters once and for all,\u201d Beckett says. \u201cWhile it hasn\u2019t scared people off or daunted their opposition, it was enough to kill off those proceedings.\u201d The application collapsed after one pivotal traditional owner withdrew. A spokesperson for the NLC said the land council was unable to support Nurrdalinji\u2019s bid \u201cbecause of significant deficiencies in the application\u201d and said its response was \u201centirely reasonable\u201d. \u2018We want more transparency\u2019 For years, traditional owners in the Beetaloo basin have queried the processes used to inform people and obtain agreements for gas exploration, some of which were signed in the early 2000s when little was understood about fracking. Those attempts are documented in letters and emails \u2013 seen by Guardian Australia \u2013 that were sent to the NLC and companies such as Origin Energy between 2018 and 2020. Traditional owners were supported in writing some of this correspondence by Original Power, an Indigenous organisation that \u201csupports the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to self-determine what happens on their country and waters\u201d, according to its executive director, Yorta Yorta woman Karrina Nolan. \u201cWe are writing because we feel the NLC are not listening to the people from the communities,\u201d says one letter from 2018, which was signed by 10 traditional owners from Beetaloo and neighbouring areas. \u201cWe want more transparency as to how the NLC operates especially with mining companies and whose interests are represented.\u201d A reply was not sent until six months later, in January 2019. In it, the NLC\u2019s interim chief executive, Rick Fletcher, said the NLC provided \u201cinformed explanations about mining and fracking and its impact on country \u2026 at all consultations\u201d. He offered to meet with traditional owners to discuss their concerns, but attempts to take up this offer were not successful amid a change of personnel at the land council. Original Power sent more letters and emails on behalf of native title holders in 2019, requesting a meeting to discuss concerns about the consultation process and the potential effects of fracking. Nolan says they received no response to these requests and no meeting was organised. By August 2020, senior NLC representatives were being invited to meet in Daly Waters with native title holders for 11 of the determination areas in the Beetaloo basin. This invitation was extended in multiple letters that stressed the group believed \u201ccoordination and cooperation with NLC will ensure the best and most durable outcomes for the native title holders\u201d. On 25 September 2020, Janet Gregory, a Jingili woman whose lands are affected by fracking, wrote to senior NLC representatives and said traditional owners were \u201cdisappointed and sorry, but not surprised, that we received no response and that no representative of NLC attended the meeting\u201d. \u201cWe need to take greater control over decisions being made on our country,\u201d she wrote, before requesting the NLC support the court application to formalise Nurrdalinji as the new representative body for native title holders. In a reply, the NLC representatives wrote they were concerned that \u201cafter stating that the reason for the change was so that \u2018we can take control of our native title and our country\u2019, you go on in the letter to use language which reflects your opposition to fracking\u201d. \u201cYou are absolutely entitled to have negative views about fracking. We respect those views and some of us may share them,\u201d it said. \u201cBut \u2026 our job is to properly represent wishes in particular of the senior decision makers from the estate groups whose country will be affected.\u201d In 2022, Nurrdalinji wrote that it had formed the view the \u201cNLC is primarily in the business of facilitating fracking, rather than enabling members to make their own decisions about fracking, in a free and informed way,\u201d in an unpublished submission to a current audit of the land council by the National Audit Office. No right to veto \u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster for people to understand,\u201d says Janet\u2019s sister Elaine Sandy, one of the directors of Nurrdalinji and a Jingili woman. Sandy and her siblings have felt the presence of the gas industry in the Beetaloo since some of the earliest exploration agreements were negotiated with companies in the early 2000s. Sandy says in those very early days there was little explanation about what fracking was or what its effects or potential scale could be. \u201cWe never knew what it was all about,\u201d she says. \u201cThere had been a promise of jobs and money. \u201cMy concern is water \u2026 the environment and our land. Once it\u2019s been contaminated that\u2019s going to be [a] great disaster for us,\u201d she says. \u201cNot just for us, our people, our country, our environment \u2013 but also our neighbours, the pastoralists.\u201d Most of the areas targeted by the gas industry in the Beetaloo are non-exclusive native title lands, meaning they are lands held under pastoral leases where traditional owners have coexisting rights. Native title holders don\u2019t have a right of veto over resources exploration, but have a right to negotiate an agreement with gas companies and the NT government for jobs, protection for the environment, and payments for exploration to ensure benefits flow to what are often desperately poor communities. These negotiations are time-limited and companies must negotiate in good faith. If after six months they have not secured an agreement, the legislation permits a company to go to the national native title tribunal and seek a determination to be granted tenure for its activities anyway. Consultation and division Elliott is a sliver of a town on the Stuart Highway where homes run on diesel paid for with power cards. Residents live in two town camps, one on either side of the petrol station, and in houses scattered between. There\u2019s a primary school, a sports and recreation park with a brightly painted basketball court, and an arts centre where people meet to chat under the din of industrial fans. Guardian Australia visited the town, which is one of the focal points of the NT\u2019s gas industry expansion, in mid March. People who live in Elliott talk about their connection to the region\u2019s ecosystems and waterways and the aquifer that runs under the Beetaloo, flowing north feeding the Mataranka hot springs that then discharge into the Roper River. Their deep ties to country are not only to what sits above the ground but what is below it. One of the biggest concerns traditional owners worried about fracking have raised is that its effects could be cumulative and felt region-wide but consultation has focused on the boundaries of single permits, which \u201csuits the gas companies \u2026 so their enormous combined impacts and the risks they present are not fully understood,\u201d as Nurrdalinji wrote in its submission to the audit. While in Elliott, Guardian Australia witnessed the way consultation about gas development can divide communities. A new company, Territory Gas, has applied for an exploration permit on the edge of the Beetaloo basin and a meeting was held with native title holders in March. If the application is approved, it would be the first new gas company to enter the territory for a number of years. Notices were delivered to homes in Elliott, inviting native title holders to a meeting where they would be provided with information about \u201cwhat is involved in petroleum exploration\u201d, would have the opportunity to ask the company questions and \u201cgive the NLC instructions about whether you want to make an agreement with Territory Gas\u201d. Near the top of the meeting notice, the NLC noted Territory Gas had made an application to the native title tribunal to decide if the permit could be granted. Guardian Australia did not witness the meeting. But after it, people raised concerns and some said they felt pressured to sign an agreement they did not support. That a tribunal application hung over the proceedings indicates how fraught these processes can be. \u201cThe NLC mob want us to say yes to the company,\u201d Jingili man Mark Raymond told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe mining company want to push ahead in the tribunal. \u201cThey said if we don\u2019t sign an agreement [Territory Gas] will push through the back door.\u201d A spokesperson for the NLC said its staff members were courteous professionals. \u201cNLC staff members are monitored throughout their interactions with constituents and notes are kept,\u201d they said. A spokesperson for Territory Gas said its involvement at meetings was limited to company presentations and corresponding questions and answers, and they had not been party to any of the discussions between the NLC and native title holders. \u201cThe company has complied with all the requests of the NLC including the provision of information and facilitation of multiple on country meetings with the native title holders,\u201d they said. In a statement to the ASX last week, the company said it had reached an agreement with native title holders. \u2018Treating land owners like children\u2019 There is another factor that is unique to the Northern Territory that is critical to understanding why a group of traditional owners tried to take back control from their own land council in court. In every other jurisdiction in Australia, when a determination of native title is made a corporation is set up that holds the native title in trust, usually with local traditional owners on its board. These corporations are generally referred to as prescribed body corporates (PBCs) and are meant to act as a forum for regional governance that manages interactions with governments and industry. In the Top End of the Northern Territory, this has not occurred. Instead, the Northern Land Council established a shell corporation called the Top End Default Prescribed Body Corporate (TED PBC) that is the PBC for more than 70 native title determinations in the territory\u2019s northern half over an area twice the size of Tasmania. The TED PBC\u2019s members and directors are also the executive of the NLC. \u201cThe NLC is neither separate from, nor independent from the TED PBC, and vice versa. Indeed, they are indistinguishable,\u201d Nurrdalinji wrote in its submission to the audit. The NLC has told parliamentary inquiries this was only meant to be an interim arrangement before native title holders transitioned to their own PBCs. But it has also said it was a useful model for the remote communities of the Top End because they were not the target of large-scale development and thus rarely had to engage with industry. The Beetaloo basin, as one of the largest proposed new fossil fuel developments in Australia, does not fit that description. Beckett thinks the TED PBC model is abhorrent and paternalistic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t put power back into the hands of the people who have been determined to be the native title holders,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this is treating land owners like they\u2019re children.\u201d The spokesperson for the NLC said the TED PBC \u201cdelivers efficient and effective support for native title holders and avoids the dysfunction plaguing many parts of the PBC sector\u201d. James Fitzgerald, who has worked as a native title lawyer for 25 years and negotiated some of the largest and most lucrative mining deals with Aboriginal groups in Australia, believes the NLC\u2019s approach to native title holders in the Beetaloo with concerns about fracking \u201cseems to be fundamentally antagonistic\u201d. \u201cThe Beetaloo basin is one of the hottest industrial properties in Australia, yet when Beetaloo native title holders have attempted to opt out of the TED PBC arrangement they have met strong resistance from the NLC,\u201d he says. \u201cTaken together, the NLC\u2019s actions in the Beetaloo indicate an organisation that seems more interested in establishing and maintaining monopolistic control over native title representation than in serving the wishes of native title holders.\u201d Fitzgerald has also who worked as a strategist for Original Power. The spokesperson for the NLC said the land council sought to ensure development did not occur without the free, prior and informed consent of traditional owners. They said lands covered by the Native Title Act notoriously did not allow for a right of veto over either gas exploration or production and the NLC, along with other land councils around Australia, had advocated for law reform that would give First Nations people genuine rights to decide whether and how their country will be mined or drilled. \u201cIn the Beetaloo basin, much of the criticism that is currently levelled at the NLC would be more appropriately directed at the native title legislation under which the NLC is required to operate,\u201d the spokesperson said. Fitzgerald, however, said \u201cregardless of the shortcomings of the Native Title Act\u201d it was \u201cwithin the power of the NLC to use its substantial heft to advocate in favour of native title holders\u2019 wishes, including where a group or groups wants to resist fracking or other mining development on their land\u201d. \u201cThere are more tools available than just the Native Title Act,\u201d he said. \u201cNational and territory environmental laws, cultural heritage laws, the negotiations themselves and political and direct action can be used to genuinely minimise the risk of environmental or cultural heritage impacts including, where necessary, agreements not to frack.\u201d The spokesperson said the NLC\u2019s chief executive, Joe Martin-Jard, had told the Senate inquiry into the Beetaloo basin that \u201cif any determined group of native title holders in the Top End makes a decision to replace the [TED PBC] with a different corporation, the NLC will respect and support that decision\u201d. They said \u201cat most about 36 adult constituents\u201d were in attendance at the Daly Waters meeting in September 2020 who sought to represent the native title holders of the entire Beetaloo Basin. The council said at the time it was not \u201csatisfied that this appointment or this creation of Nurrdalinji and the purported appointment of it as a PBC were decisions that were authorised with the consent of all native title holders. On the contrary, it was quite clear to us that many groups and many senior native title holders either didn\u2019t know anything about this or were opposed to this particular action\u201d. \u201cWhen understood in context of the established facts, NLC\u2019s response to Nurrdalinji and Original Power\u2019s application in the federal court is entirely reasonable,\u201d the spokesperson said. But Beckett said the NLC\u2019s remarks were \u201can attempt to downplay the significance of the meeting\u201d. He said Original Power had made considerable effort to inform and consult with a steering committee to make sure the meeting was well notified and a sufficiently representative group was invited to attend. He said this was done without the assistance of the anthropology and other resources available to the land council. He said he was not aware of any other region-wide meeting that had been organised to discuss gas development in the Beetaloo and this was why people had requested one. \u201cIn my view the NLC should have supported this meeting and attended it. This was a meeting requested by and for the benefit of people who it claimed to be acting on behalf of,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it chose to keep its distance and then criticised and marginalised it after the event.\u201d \u2018I want the world to know\u2019 \u201cAt the moment we have a big fight, a big battle on our hands with companies that are entering the Northern Territory,\u201d says Samuel Sandy, a Jingili man and deputy chair of Nurrdalinji. Guardian Australia met with him in March, on the porch of his home in Katherine, while his great-grandson Henry played next to him in a Spider-Man suit. \u201cIf they continue doing this fracking, if they\u2019re going to drill all these wells and going to full production, there\u2019s going to be a lot of dangers to the land.\u201d In 2022, Nurrdalinji directors visited a fracking well on Tanumbirini station. Sandy says when he saw the site \u201cmy heart sank\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable on our beautiful country. The way it\u2019s going, they\u2019re going to destroy it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a storybook and someone has ripped the page out and burned it. \u201cI just want the whole world to know we desperately need help. The people in the Beetaloo basin need help.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319e0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/19/my-fiance-died-unexpectedly-last-year-could-communal-grieving-help-me-heal", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "My fiance died unexpectedly last year.

His big warm hand on my back. I smile to myself. I\u2019m in Hobart to see Community of Grieving by Zosia Ho\u0142ubowska and Julia Giertz, as part of Dark Mofo. The show started life as a radio broadcast in 2020 in response to Covid-19, before morphing into a live experience at the 2021 Unsound festival in Krak\u00f3w. It is, ostensibly, a place for people to come together and grieve. To reckon with their loss. To heal. Jamie, my fiance, died unexpectedly at the end of last year. The past six months or so have been spent dealing with his sudden absence. My experience of grief has been mostly solitary, so I feel a bit exposed as people file in and take their places on the floor. Four figures enter, shrouded in white. The performance is so far silent, apart from the sound of a woman unzipping and removing her boots. Their wooden click clack echoes as she places them on the hard floor. She proceeds to meditate for the duration of the performance. \u201cGet her!\u201d I hear Jamie whisper. \u201cIsn\u2019t she cold? Put your low, sensible heel back on, love!\u201d I laugh to myself.

They start singing, beautifully, their voices layering indiscernibly with the slightly warped, recorded voices of the score. They stutter, crackle with static. The singers wail. Scream. The voices are embodied and disembodied; alive and perhaps dead. The ghostliness of the scene feels instantly recognisable. Grief, I think, is a lot like a haunting. I expect to see Jamie in the kitchen by his beloved coffee machine before work, or in his spot on the couch when I get home at night or lying next to me in bed in the morning. Every time he isn\u2019t there it feels like a jump scare. The rhythm of reaching for him every day, of longing for his touch, the routine of picking up my phone to call him when I leave the office is a memory that I can\u2019t seem to shake out of my muscles. It\u2019s hard to know where the real and the imagined ends a lot of the time. Community of Grieving changes suddenly. The singing stops, the music becomes hard and industrial. Discordant. The singers begin to spin and twirl. Their bodies break down, slowly twitching and contorting as the music glitches out. They bend, squat and then their knees buckle, perhaps under the weight of everything. They crawl and find each other in the darkness. Because we\u2019re sitting on the floor, I crane my neck but I can\u2019t really see anything. Everyone around me is doing the same. I give up on engaging with anything visual in the show and close my eyes. I think of Jamie and feel the weight that settles on my chest when I stop distracting myself. The weight, I\u2019ve learned, is everything I have felt and still feel for Jamie: the love I have for him, the desire and longing I have, the anger I have at him for leaving even though I know he wouldn\u2019t have left if he could have helped it. The guilt I have because he passed away on my watch and that maybe, if I paid closer attention, there was something, anything, I could\u2019ve done to save him. And I don\u2019t know where to put all of that. I don\u2019t know if I ever will. The music stops. I open my eyes and the performers enter and bow. It\u2019s over. We clap. I get up from the ground, slowly, and stomp my feet to get the feeling back. I don\u2019t feel a lot of closure leaving Community of Grieving, or catharsis or even emotion. I feel mostly neutral, even though there were parts of the show that were exceptionally beautiful. I step out into the night and feel the shock of the icy Hobart air on my cheeks as I walk with my friends to a bar up the road. \u201cLet\u2019s get a drink, darl,\u201d I hear Jamie whisper. \u201cI need it after that.\u201d I wish Jamie was here. No show, I think, is going to change that. Or fix that. Or help me understand it.

A tourist flying over the Great Barrier Reef filmed what appeared to be a white humpback whale swimming north, as thousands of humpbacks make their annual migration from Antartica to warmer waters to breed. But scientists cautioned it might not be Migaloo. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the footage it\u2019s unmistakably a white whale but there is always an element of doubt, which is why we can\u2019t confirm until we\u2019re 100%,\u201d said Vanessa Pirotta, a whale expert at Macquarie University. \u201cIf it is him it would be incredible that this one iconic whale has avoided being seen for so long along one of the busiest coastlines in the world.\u201d Migaloo, the only known albino humpback whale in Australia\u2019s east coast population, was first spotted in 1991 at Byron Bay when he was estimated to be around two years old. He has been spotted occasionally in intervening years since, with the last sighting in 2020 off the coast of Port Macquarie. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In 2004, tissue samples collected from Migaloo, which is a First Nations word for \u201cwhite fella\u201d, confirmed its lack of pigmentation was due to albinism. Pirotta said other whales in the population that are predominately white or are swimming on their backs with their white belly pointed to the sun can sometimes be mistaken for Migaloo by observers. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the beautiful things about this population that have such variation in the way that they look,\u201d she said. \u201cMigaloo looks like an iceberg under the water.\u201d Dr Wally Franklin, director of the Oceania Project, said Migaloo has two telltale bumps on his back where his backbone protrudes and unique serrations on the outer side of his tail fluke. \u201cLast time we sighted him in Hervey Bay was in 1998 when he was around nine years old. He was singing and we recorded his song,\u201d Franklyn said. \u201cHe\u2019s quite a superb singer.\u201d Frankyln said there was a low probability that Migaloo would pass his albinism on to his offspring given both he and the female would need to carry the gene. Pirotta encouraged anyone else who thinks they spot Migaloo to send the information to the White Whale Research Centre. \u201cThe sighting is truly a great example of citizen science and people capturing information helps us learn more about one of the most famous whales in the world,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319e2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/19/fossils-long-necks-prehistoric-reptiles-targeted-predators", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fossils show long necks of prehistoric reptiles were targeted by predators", "lead": "Evidence suggests slender necks of some ancient marine creatures were a deadly weakness", "author": "Ian Sample Science editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:00:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175831", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/93376fc63278ddf8311307bfbf4a157d34472c65/756_0_4874_2926/500.jpg", "body": "For nearly two centuries, fossil hunters have mused that the improbably long necks of some ancient marine reptiles made them tempting targets for hungry predators. Now, researchers have uncovered grisly evidence that sticking one\u2019s neck out really was a deadly weakness: the remains of two creatures whose heads were snapped off in acts of Triassic violence. \u201cWe think they were grabbed by the neck and killed that way, and because the neck doesn\u2019t have much muscle, the predator left them and focused on the much more meaty body,\u201d said Dr Stephan Spiekman, a palaeontologist at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany. Spiekman and his colleague Dr Eudald Mujal, an expert in prehistoric bite marks, made the gruesome discovery while examining a pair of 240m-year-old fossils of tanystropheus, a marine reptile recovered from Monte San Giorgio on the Swiss-Italian border. At the time, before the emergence of the dinosaurs, the mountain was home to a tropical lagoon. Fossils from the rocks preserve such a spectacular diversity of prehistoric fish, reptiles, crustaceans and other species that it was designated a Unesco world heritage site. The fossils studied belong to two different species of tanystropheus, one smaller animal about 1.5m long, and another much larger creature about 6m long. In both cases, only the small head and part of the long, slender neck remain. The bodies, ominously, are missing. Close inspection of the larger fossil revealed two tooth-shaped holes in the vertebrae at the precise point where the neck was cleanly broken. \u201cThe whole neck is broken in exactly one plane,\u201d said Spiekman. \u201cThe neck was broken in one go, and having the tooth marks there is pretty conclusive evidence that some animal bit its neck off.\u201d The smaller reptile seems to have suffered the same fate. Again, the neck and slender supporting neck ribs which run parallel along the vertebrae to provide stiffness, were broken at a single point. This time, a small tooth-shaped hole was found further up the neck, away from the fracture point. Scavenging looks highly unlikely, the scientists say,because bite marks look different in dead animals, and scavengers tend to cause far more damage when they tuck in to a carcass. The evidence suggests that while many marine reptiles reaped clear benefits from exceptionally long necks \u2013 the larger tanystropheus had a neck comfortably over 2m \u2013 the advantages came with a cost. As depicted in Henry De la B\u00e8che\u2019s 1830 watercolour, Duria Antiquior, a long neck was a great way to lose one\u2019s head. Based on the size of the teeth marks, Spiekman and Mujal suspect the beheadings were performed by other marine reptiles, perhaps a distant ancestor of the plesiosaur called a nothosaur, an early ichthyosaur, or the stocky helveticosaurus. Details are published in Current Biology. \u201cThese are some of the most macabre fossils I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a professor of vertebrate palaeontology at Edinburgh University, who was not involved in the study. \u201cYou can sense the violence of the reptile-eat-reptile world of the Mesozoic when you look at these fossils.\u201d \u201cIt seems like these long necks were a type of superpower, which allowed these reptiles to ambush their prey by darting their heads like a spearfisherman,\u201d he added. \u201cBut all superheroes have a weakness, and these long necks would have been kryptonite to these animals, as they left them vulnerable to attack from other reptiles. \u201cStill, long necks persisted in so many reptile groups, for so long, right up to the asteroid that knocked many of them out, alongside their dinosaur cousins. The value of a long neck must have generally outweighed the costs.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319e3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/im-transfixed-by-a-menial-ipad-game-in-an-age-of-saturation-its-an-embarrassing-comfort", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I\u2019m transfixed by a menial iPad game \u2013 in an age of saturation, it\u2019s an embarrassing comfort | Caitlin Cassidy", "lead": "Petting pups and cleaning up digital dog poo makes me happy.

The bark came with a tantalising notification: \u201cYour new rustic lantern is ready to decorate your sanctuary!\u201d My hands instinctively moved to swipe before I managed to contain myself. The lantern wasn\u2019t real. The lantern could wait. I have a job. For the past few months, I have developed an addiction to a free iPad game in which I assist ageing dogs to enjoy their twilight years in my home for elderly pets. I started with one dog. Now I have five. I have passed 22 levels and obtained several items of furniture by completing mediocre tasks. I pat my dogs when they want pats. I feed them treats when they are hungry. I give them a toy when they \u201cneed toy\u201d. I clean up leaves, poo and chewed-up balls by clicking on them when they appear. I win coins by completing said tasks. That is essentially the game. And yet I cannot stop. It is not infrequent that I will pick up my iPad to \u201ccheck on the dogs\u201d (that is the thought that goes through my head \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll just check on the dogs) and find myself hours later, sitting in the dark, frantically pressing on love hearts that appear above their cartoon heads so I can collect more coins and progress to new levels. It\u2019s like gambling, but the stakes are extremely low, and all I\u2019m losing is my precious time. I\u2019ve stopped reading books. I\u2019ve neglected my own dog to satisfy my fake ones (Mack, Bagel, Leo, Babs and Captain Ron). Each time I check in after a few hours to a flood of coins I get a rush like a shot of heroin. Is this bad? There is no anonymous group you can join to say you might have a problem with a pleasantly designed iPad game. If anything, it\u2019s just a bit embarrassing, like getting caught with your trousers undone when you leave the loo. And yet. When I was at the pub the other day, I chanced upon a couple of young girls playing on their iPads while their parents ate dinner. \u201cHow terrible!\u201d I thought. Nobody can just sit back and enjoy the moment these days. Looking closer, I realised with a sense of dread that the game they were playing was my coveted pleasure. With a simple Google search, I discovered the game on a string of websites recommending \u201cbest games for toddlers\u201d and \u201cbest apps for kids (of all ages)\u201d. I have reverted to the brain-space of a toddler with an iPad. This is my reality. What does it say about me, about my headspace, that I can take such comfort in something that requires the intellectual rigour of a collection of wooden blocks? My suspicion is that it makes sense because the state of the world is so objectively wrong right now. I am gaining a sense of serenity and pleasure from how well my old dog\u2019s sanctuary is coming along and from the new lantern in my inventory to decoratively place in my garden. There\u2019s a reason we (adults, of which I am one) have turned to mindless TV like Emily in Paris and whatever reality show came out this week in droves, or why people get a weird kick out of menial games where you\u2019re simply completing day-to-day tasks. Sometimes, in an age of saturation, when you can be presented with 100 different ideas in one humble scroll of a social media feed \u2013 from catastrophic climate change to Trump hiding classified documents in the loo \u2013 games like this are a comfort. All I have to do is give the dog a biscuit, and he\u2019s happy. And I\u2019m happy.

Graeme Samuel, the former competition watchdog head who chaired a 2020 review of Australia\u2019s environmental laws, says a campaign is needed to bring public awareness of biodiversity decline in line with the understanding of the climate crisis. The Biodiversity Council, which is a partnership between 11 Australian universities, surveyed people about their attitudes to nature. The online poll of about 4,050 people found although most (63%) understood how unique Australia\u2019s wildlife was and 83% rated looking after nature as important to them, many were not aware of the extent of biodiversity loss in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The research found that fewer than half (43%) were aware Australia had one of the highest rates of mammal extinction in the world and just more than half (54%) knew most of Australia\u2019s forests had been lost since colonisation. Awareness of climate change and how it affected nature was much higher, with 74% indicating they understood global heating was having a direct impact on wildlife and ecosystems. Winnifred Louis, professor of psychology at the University of Queensland and one of the report\u2019s authors, said there were many psychological biases that could lead to a gulf between the state of the environment and how people perceived it. Louis said when changes in the environment were gradual it could be difficult for people to notice. \u201cPeople\u2019s opinions can be influenced by a few key species, so if they see whales they feel the oceans must be doing OK, even if many other species are missing and if whales are in much smaller numbers than in past decades,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout specialist training, people may not recognise the difference between environments that are green and full of diverse native plants, and environments that are green and full of weed species.\u201d Louis said much reporting and discussion on the state of nature was focused on \u201cbig ticket\u201d species, such as bilbies or koalas, rather than things people could relate to in their local area. Samuel\u2019s 2020 review of national laws found Australia\u2019s environment was in unsustainable decline and successive Australian governments had failed to protect the country\u2019s unique species and habitats. He said the public\u2019s understanding of the nature crisis was years behind the level of awareness of the climate crisis. He called for a shift in focus from individual charismatic species \u2013 such as the koala \u2013 to flora and fauna generally and what they mean for people. \u201cI think we need a major awareness campaign to bring people up to the same level of awareness and sensitivity to biodiversity as they have for climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to do to raise awareness. It is so important.\u201d The Biodiversity Council\u2019s survey found the majority of respondents were concerned for Australia\u2019s biodiversity, with at least two-thirds very or extremely concerned about waste and pollution, land-clearing, extinction of species and the loss of pollinator species and natural places. About three-quarters (72%) said more money should be spent on the environment. Scientists have estimated about $2bn is needed annually to recover Australia\u2019s full list of almost 2,000 threatened plants, animals and ecological communities. Brendan Wintle, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Melbourne and lead councillor at the Biodiversity Council, said about half of Australia\u2019s economy relied on natural systems. He said the loss of biodiversity would have serious consequences for clean air, food and water, human health, Indigenous culture and national identity. \u201cMany people would be shocked if they realised the actual state of Australia\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Wintle said."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319e5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/victoria-to-consider-rent-caps-and-taxes-on-airbnb-owners-to-ease-rental-crisis", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Victoria to consider rent caps and taxes on Airbnb owners to ease rental crisis", "lead": "Exclusive: Greens will support Labor\u2019s state budget in exchange for measures as Yarra council creates emergency fund to help with cost of living", "author": "Benita Kolovos", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:00:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175884", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/228cf7afaf63783003400e758fcdc7cdb5affbd5/0_0_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "The Victorian government will consider introducing rent caps and new taxes on owners of Airbnbs and vacant properties to help ease pressure on renters, under a deal struck with the Greens in exchange for their support for the state budget. Before the last sitting of state parliament before the winter break, the Greens will announce their support for the budget, which includes tax increases for big business, property investors and private schools to pay off the state\u2019s Covid-19 borrowings. In exchange, a taskforce led by deputy premier Jacinta Allan, which is currently examining measures to boost housing supply, will consider renter safeguards the Greens have been campaigning for. This includes \u201crent caps or other forms of rent control\u201d, \u201cregulation or taxation\u201d of the short-stay industry and \u201cimprovements\u201d to the state\u2019s vacancy tax, according to a letter sent to the Greens by the treasurer, Tim Pallas, and seen by Guardian Australia. Pallas has also committed to meeting with the Greens each month to discuss the crisis and possible solutions to help fix it. Guardian Australia understands the government has also secured the support of the remaining progressive crossbenchers \u2013 Georgie Purcell from the Animal Justice party and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs \u2013 meaning the bill should pass parliament by the end of the week. It follows weeks of negotiations between the Greens and Labor, during which the minor party had lambasted the government for failing to support renters during the housing affordability crisis. The Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, said the party would continue to pressure the government to implement the proposals, as well a two-year rent freeze. \u201cThis is just the beginning of us pushing them to go further and faster to address the rental crisis and address the housing affordability crisis more broadly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not easing up on that pressure any time soon. In fact, given how much worse the housing crisis is getting day by day, we\u2019re going to be increasing our pressure on the government to act as a matter of urgency.\u201d It comes as an inner-city Melbourne council on Monday night became the first in the state to create an emergency fund for those struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. From 1 July, people living in Yarra city council experiencing rental stress will be able to access a pool of $100,000. At Monday\u2019s meeting, councillor Stephen Jolly moved an amendment to ensure funds would be allocated specifically for young renters in the area, which takes in the suburbs of Abbotsford, Collingwood, Fitzroy and Richmond, but this was voted down. Instead, the fund will take in all concession card holders who live in the council, as well as homelessness support services. Jolly said this could equate to about \u201c30-50%\u201d less assistance for young people but was hopeful other inner-city councils would follow suit. \u201cIt\u2019s a start, even though I\u2019m disappointed the Greens watered it down,\u201d Jolly told Guardian Australia. \u201cDirect wealth distribution is rare in Australian politics, so this is hopefully a new trend that other councils will follow.\u201d The council is examining whether it can impose an Airbnb tax on owners in the area. According to the open-source database Inside Airbnb, there were 1,608 properties available in the city of Yarra on Airbnb in March this year. Jolly said he was hopeful any revenue derived from such a tax would go directly into the fund announced on Monday. Pressure is also growing within Labor\u2019s ranks to address the housing crisis. The party\u2019s state conference at the weekend unanimously passed motions to make housing a human right, introduce a mandatory inclusionary zoning scheme and provide affordable housing for young people. Another motion to introduce a cap on the number of nights each year an owner can rent out a property as short stay accommodation also passed. The motions are non-binding but play an important role in guiding Labor policy. A government spokesperson said it was working to deliver a pipeline of more housing via its $5.3bn \u201cbig housing build\u201d and build-to-rent incentives but acknowledged more needs to be done. \u201cWhether it\u2019s housing supply, first homebuyer affordability, public housing or renters\u2019 rights \u2013 we know the housing system needs reform,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard on a package of reforms that will come later in the year, and we will have more to say in due course.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319e6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/people-smugglers-migrant-boat-disaster-greece", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Evil people smugglers\u2019 are easy to blame for migrant boat tragedies.

They stand accused of piloting a fishing trawler that sank off the Greek coast last week, leaving hundreds missing and presumed dead in one of the Mediterranean\u2019s worst boat disasters. All have pleaded not guilty. When a mass drowning such as this one hits the headlines, governments squirm as their own culpability is probed. Just weeks ago, the Greek government was accused in the New York Times of involvement with pushbacks of migrant boats, and many questions have been raised about the Greek coastguard\u2019s actions in this latest disaster. In response, ministers follow a well-trodden path and try to divert blame towards \u201cevil people smugglers\u201d. It\u2019s what Priti Patel, the former UK home secretary, did after mass drownings in the Channel in November 2021. No matter that kingpins of smuggling operations generally don\u2019t pilot overloaded leaky boats across dangerous expanses of water. Sometimes, however, impoverished migrants do, in exchange for free or reduced passage. The organisation Alarm Phone \u2013 which monitors migrant boats in distress and alerts coastguards to boats in peril, providing GPS locations and other vital information \u2013 said in a statement that it had emailed the Greek authorities and Frontex, the European border agency, alerting them to the fact that 750 people were on board an overcrowded boat that was in distress near Kalamata. According to a Twitter post, \u201cnobody intervened and the boat capsized\u201d. The organisation appealed to the authorities to \u201cstop blaming people on the move for their own death\u201d. (Greek authorities have claimed that those on the boat repeatedly refused assistance.) While many smugglers may be greedy and ruthless, they are responding to human demand with a form of supply, albeit one that is high-risk and overpriced. Smugglers are not the cause of the mass migration of people searching for survival and safety. Contrary to government adverts, people do not decide to uproot from their families, homes and communities based on a smuggler\u2019s slick TikTok post. In fact the decision to escape is made first and the smuggler is sought second \u2013 often using personal recommendations from within communities rather than social media enticements. The gap between the anti-migrant rhetoric of many heads of government and the rising numbers of people migrating is growing. Rishi Sunak boasted that plans being rolled out to prevent people crossing the Channel in small boats were working, with a 20% reduction in crossings so far this year \u2013 just days before more than 2,000 people crossed in the space of a week. According to the latest data released by the International Organization for Migration\u2019s Missing Migrants Project, in 2022 nearly 3,800 people died on migration routes within and from the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 the highest number since 2017, when 4,255 deaths were recorded. The figures are likely to be an underestimate of the true number of lives lost during irregular migration journeys. Clearly the deterrent mechanisms are not working. The UK sees deporting people who arrive on small boats to Rwanda as the jewel in its deterrent crown. Yet asylum seekers threatened with being sent there say the plan will actually increase people smuggling, as anyone who is sent there will beg or borrow money to pay smugglers a second time to get out of the east African country. Irregular migration undoubtedly poses complex challenges for governments, but achievable pragmatism rather than unachievable rhetoric is required. Can conditions in people\u2019s home countries be improved to prevent some from leaving? Can those who arrive here have their protection claims processed swiftly so they are not forced into expensive, taxpayer-funded limbo while their claims are processed? The scale of the presumed loss of life from this boat is difficult to comprehend. No doubt many people were fearful from the moment they squeezed onboard, but also hopeful that the precarious vessel would take them to a safer place. The yearning to survive is engrained in human DNA irrespective of global postcode. That should be the starting point for government policies to tackle the migration challenge.

It was indeed in his Verdi aria from I Lombardi that Corrado\u2019s dramatic vigour came through most convincingly, with his acting skills also in play as Figaro and Dr Bartolo in the more conventional arias by Mozart and Rossini. All Italian, and all the better for exemplary diction, but arguably too narrow a focus. Effervescent soprano Jessica Robinson, representing Wales, delighted the home crowd, acquitting herself best in Donizetti\u2019s Chacun le Sait from La Fille du R\u00e9giment, and Arditi\u2019s Il Bacio, pinging out the high notes. Beth Taylor, representing Scotland, conveyed well Giulio Cesare\u2019s imperious machinations in her Handel aria, her mezzo voice plush and stylishly used, yet in the somewhat slow-burn first of an unfamiliar aria by the Austrian Wilhelm Kienzl, followed by Berlioz\u2019s Le Spectre de la Rose from Les Nuits d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 apt on a close and sultry night \u2013 Taylor didn\u2019t quite fulfil the promise of earlier appearances when she\u2019d been much fancied.

For many \u2013 and I include myself among them \u2013 Molteno\u2019s glorious mezzo was the most memorable voice and, across the week, she showed an unusually wide choice of repertoire, from Mahler to South African songs and, in this final, the richness right through her considerable vocal range in Octavian\u2019s aria Wie du warst from Strauss\u2019s Der Rosenkavalier. An intensity of demeanour disappeared when, in her last aria, Rossini\u2019s Una Voce Poco Fa \u2013 more usually a soprano lollipop \u2013 she was relaxed, comfortably comic and showing herself to be a mezzo with knockout coloratura, a rare talent.

The footage of Sunak addressing fellow Conservative MPs, leaked to PinkNews, shows him making fun of Ed Davey after the Liberal Democrat leader said it was possible for a woman to have a penis, which can happen under the government\u2019s own gender recognition laws. Addressing the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories on 5 June, the footage, seemingly shot on a phone held surreptitiously towards the floor, has Sunak\u2019s voice saying Davey \u201chas been very busy\u201d. Sunak went on: \u201cLike me, you can probably see that he was trying to convince everybody that women clearly had penises. You\u2019ll all know that I\u2019m a big fan of everybody studying maths to 18, but it turns out that we need to focus on biology.\u201d The comment was greeted by laughter in the room. While Sunak\u2019s government is opposed to self-recognition for transgender people, as sought by the Scottish government, people are allowed to apply for a gender recognition certificate, changing their gender under law, even if they have not had gender-affirming surgery or treatments, or do not plan to. An unnamed Conservative MP quoted by PinkNews said: \u201cIt is profoundly depressing \u2013 this whole \u2018othering\u2019 of minorities \u2013 pretty much any minority. Without stopping to think we have equalities legislation for a reason, to stop discrimination against anyone with a protected characteristic \u2013 we should be trying to understand and support, not belittle and demonise.\u201d Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said the target of the joke had been Davey, and the general tone of the comments was not different to remarks the prime minister had made before. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the prime minister talk about his enormous compassionate understanding for people questioning their identity and that they should be treated with dignity and respect,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOn this specific issue, these are points he\u2019s made in interviews, publicly \u2026 My understanding is that this was a joke aimed at a political opponent rather than a specific group.\u201d Asked if Sunak would use any other minority group as the punchline for a joke, the spokesperson said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that characterisation.

In a sign No 10 wants to defuse the blue-on-blue row over the former prime minister\u2019s conduct as quickly as possible, Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said he was not planning to attend parliament on Monday due to \u201ccommitments that he can\u2019t move\u201d. The duties were said to include welcoming the prime minister of Sweden to Downing Street and a series of other meetings. Monday evening\u2019s vote will be the culmination of a 14-month inquiry by a cross-party group of MPs into Johnson\u2019s Partygate denials, which found he committed five contempts of parliament. As well as deliberately misleading the Commons, Johnson misled the privileges committee behind the investigation, the inquiry concluded. He was also found to have partially leaked its findings, been complicit in a campaign of abuse against its members and undermined parliament\u2019s democratic processes. MPs will have up to five-and-a-half hours to debate the report from 4.30pm on Monday. Commons sources suggested it was likely to take four hours, based on the number of MPs who wanted to speak. At the end, a vote will be held on endorsing the findings, which recommended Johnson should be blocked from getting a pass for former MPs allowing him privileged access to parliament. The sanction was proposed by the privileges committee because it was not able to enforce the 90-day suspension it was going to recommend, as Johnson quit as an MP last week. No 10 would not say definitively whether Sunak would abstain on the vote, given it may go through uncontested \u2013 meaning there will not be a formal division and instead the report will go through \u201con the nod\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think we know yet whether there will be a vote on this issue,\u201d said Sunak\u2019s spokesperson. Asked whether the prime minister planned to attend the Commons if there was a vote, they said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got his schedule for today, which doesn\u2019t include attending parliament, but obviously we will see how the timings play out.\u201d Johnson\u2019s supporters were said over the weekend to be planning to abstain on the vote as well. The move was viewed as a sign of Johnson\u2019s weak grip over the parliamentary party he once commanded, signalling his allies\u2019 fears of demonstrating how few in number they were. Several Tory MPs have indicated they will endorse the report. But the Brexiter backbencher William Cash wrote in an article for the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cI shall vote against the motion that approves the committee on privileges\u2019 report because I do not believe it serves parliament well.\u201d Though Downing Street and Johnson have sought to avoid holding a formal division whereby MPs must register their vote in the \u201caye\u201d or \u201cno\u201d lobby, there were increasing signs that Labour would push for one. Multiple sources told the Guardian they were confident there would be such a vote, which would force each Tory MP to register their view on the matter."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ea", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/macron-rugby-club-beer-stunt-sparks-binge-drinking-row", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Macron\u2019s rugby club beer stunt sparks binge-drinking row", "lead": "French president accused of irresponsibility and toxic masculinity after downing beer in 17 seconds", "author": "Angelique Chrisafis in Paris", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:45:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175970", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3f4e6176ef1ac529b412d242f813e6e08b6ced/404_0_1464_879/500.jpg", "body": "Footage of Emmanuel Macron downing a bottle of beer in 17 seconds in a rugby club dressing room has prompted a political row about binge drinking and accusations of toxic masculinity. The video shows the French president being handed a bottle of Corona in the Toulouse changing room after they beat La Rochelle at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday. Urged to down the beer in one, Macron drains the bottle to cheers from coaching staff and players, then proudly slams the empty bottle down on the counter. \u201cToxic masculinity in political leadership in one image,\u201d tweeted Sandrine Rousseau, an MP for the Green party. \u201cA president who is sharing in the joy of 23 players and taking part in their traditions. That\u2019s all,\u201d replied Jean-Ren\u00e9 Cazeneuve, an MP from Macron\u2019s centrist party. The choice of Corona beer \u2013 favourite drink of the late rightwing president Jacques Chirac \u2013 led to comments about whether Macron was using it to make overtures to the right, or whether, after accusations that he is out of touch, he was trying to show he was a man of the people. When Macron was filmed having a beer in Kinshasa in March, during the French pensions crisis, he was accused of being cut off from ordinary concerns back home. Most of the commentary, however, centred on Macron\u2019s stance on alcohol. He is a strong supporter of France\u2019s wine industry, once claiming he regularly drank a glass of wine at lunch and another in the evening. He has been seen to have defended the wine and alcohol lobby by blocking attempts by public health authorities to promote \u201cDry January\u201d. The daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration recalled that in 2018 Macron had told local newspapers in an interview that rather than wine being a problem, it was the binge-drinking of beer and spirits that was dangerous for young people. He said there was a public health problem \u201cwhen young people get drunk at high-speed with strong alcohol or beer\u201d. Lib\u00e9ration said Macron was now showing off his own \u201chigh-speed\u201d drinking. Bernard Basset, from the charity Association Addictions France, told BFMTV: \u201cThe president has a responsibility as a role model in terms of setting a healthy example for behaviour \u2026 In this case, he\u2019s associating sport, parties and the consumption of alcohol in a context of virile peer pressure where everyone drinks a bit too much.\u201d William Lowenstein, a doctor and addiction specialist, told the BFMTV: \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate \u2026 You could do it, but not in front of the cameras.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319eb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/share-your-stories-about-your-first-loves", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Share your stories about your first loves", "lead": "We would like to hear from people about their first love, why it mattered and if you still think about them now", "author": "Guardian community team", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:43:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.175987", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7143eea60ff3ae6ebf77d98ae695644bdada3b/0_330_5100_3061/500.jpg", "body": "Do you remember your first love?

He is now nearing the end of a seven-month theatre tour. It must be tiring by this stage, I suggest. But no, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really the one thing that I enjoy doing more than anything. Performing on stage is kind of a release for me.\u201d He smiles. \u201cIt sounds a bit heavy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Nicholas is about to release the audio version of the memoir he wrote during lockdown, which covers his career from failed rock singer to successful pop star, from being the first actor to play the lead in Jesus Christ Superstar to being part of the original cast of Cats, appearing in numerous films including the cult hit Tommy and the 80s BBC sitcom Just Good Friends. In recent years, Nicholas has appeared in EastEnders and the reality show version of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, among others. Over a video call from a low-cost hotel room, he seems fun and lacking in self-importance, as does his book. It made me laugh, often intentionally \u2013 going to dinner in Paris with Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin in the 60s, 24-year-old Nicholas is taken to a restaurant where they serve only flowers and he asks for chips with them. But sometimes it\u2019s just his turn of phrase, almost Partridgean at times. On being asked to invest in an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical: \u201cNow, I had saved a bit, but not enough that I wanted to blow it on a show about cats.\u201d His inclusion of a Private Eye report on his father, the flamboyant showbiz lawyer Oscar Beuselinck, made me laugh out loud: \u201cNever marry,\u201d warned Oscar, who had divorced three times. \u201cI reckon my cock has cost me \u00a3100,000 per inch.\u201d With a father like that, says Nicholas, \u201cyou could either go the other way and become a priest or you could find yourself expressing yourself with a similar kind of humour at times, which of course is deeply inappropriate. I have to be careful, but I still find myself making mistakes, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Later, he asks me if I \u201cdetect an old dinosaur\u201d. \u201cHaving grown up in the 60s, and having that freedom to say what you want, now we\u2019ve regressed a little bit. Overall, it\u2019s good that people are more careful about how they speak about others, but there is a willingness among some people to be offended.\u201d His book is so un-PC that it\u2019s almost quaint. On at least two occasions, Nicholas describes female co-stars, of similar vintage to him (he is 78), as \u201cstill an attractive lady\u201d, as if it\u2019s surprising at their advanced age. His wife, Linzi, to whom he has been married for more than 50 years, is always telling him off, he says. Recounting a sex scene in one film, he writes that he gives his co-star \u2013 who happens to be the wife of the director \u2013 a \u201ctongue sandwich\u201d. \u201cDid I say that? Please forgive me,\u201d he says with a laugh, but also looking aghast. \u201cI think I was overdramatising the tongue. It sounds very energetic, and I wouldn\u2019t have been that energetic.\u201d During the second world war, Nicholas\u2019s father apparently worked for MI6 \u201cbecause he could speak Flemish, so he was quite useful\u201d. His mother, Peggy, worked at Bletchley Park, and he likes to say she cracked the Enigma code \u201cbut she wasn\u2019t a codebreaker, though she wasn\u2019t bad at crosswords\u201d. Until Oscar, who had started at a law firm as a tea boy at 14, advanced through the ranks and then specialised in showbiz \u2013 he brokered contracts for the Beatles and Sean Connery, among others \u2013 the family wasn\u2019t well off. They moved in with Nicholas\u2019s grandmother on a council estate in north London until Nicholas was seven. Then Oscar bought a house and, later, once his parents had separated, Nicholas and his mother lived in a flat. It was his mother who took him to the cinema and introduced him to performing. England in the late 40s and 50s, he says, \u201cseemed to be a very grey place, but colour in my life came through film \u2013 and I particularly liked musical films. I used to go home and imitate Gene Kelly, tap dance on the lino.\u201d Nicholas was in bands while still at school, including his own, Paul Dean and the Dreamers, but \u201cwe weren\u2019t really going anywhere\u201d. When his guitarist joined Screaming Lord Sutch\u2019s band, the Savages, Nicholas went to see them. \u201cI was amazed at [Sutch], who had really long hair down to his shoulders in 1961, which no one had. I loved his act. He lit a fire on stage; it was a very outrageous act.\u201d Nicholas joined the band. \u201cWhat was great about that for me was that it wasn\u2019t just standing there singing; there was a sense of theatre about it. Much more fun.\u201d During Sutch\u2019s song Jack the Ripper, Nicholas dressed up as one of the serial killer\u2019s victims and would be murdered on stage every night by Sutch, who would hold aloft a pair of bloodied rubber lungs; at one point, he started using animal hearts procured from the butcher. When Sutch, the founder of the Monster Raving Loony party, stood for parliament against Harold Wilson in 1966, Nicholas ran around in leopardskin, handing out leaflets. Nicholas\u2019s next band toured with the Who, then he tried to become a solo star and was taken on by a manager, Robert Stigwood, who would go on to manage Cream and the Bee Gees. The Who\u2019s Pete Townshend wrote a song for him, as did the Bee Gees (who sang backing vocals on his single) and a young David Bowie. \u201cHe was very stylish, as you would imagine, even then,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cHe was quite serious, I thought, for a young man. He told me about learning to be a mime artist and did a bit of mime for me, you know, putting the hands on the windows.\u201d The song Bowie wrote, Over the Wall We Go, inspired by a number of jailbreaks, was banned by the BBC, says Nicholas. \u201cIt was too outrageous to become a hit. I had really quite a long go at becoming a pop star without any success.\u201d He took an office job at a music publisher \u2013 by then he was married with two children and it was stable work \u2013 but when auditions came up for a new musical, Hair, inspired by the hippy counterculture, he went. He got the lead role. The musical opened in 1968, the day after a 200-year-old legal act censoring plays was abolished. \u201cThere was a freedom,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cIt was the beginning of women becoming freer. It was kind of throwing off the shackles of the 50s. All that music was happening here. It was a big awakening for London and the UK, and Hair was part of that. It was exciting.\u201d Sometimes cast members would smoke weed on stage. \u201cYou\u2019d think: \u2018We\u2019re supposed to be playing hippies, we aren\u2019t really hippies.\u2019\u201d Next, Nicholas auditioned for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice\u2019s musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Lloyd Webber, he remembers, was \u201cvery foppish. He was in the style of the moment, but quite flamboyant, quite gentlemanly, in some ways rather 18th-century.\u201d The musical was exciting, he says, \u201cbecause it was considered to be a rather taboo subject, calling Jesus Christ a \u2018superstar\u2019. A superstar in those days was pretty out-there.\u201d There were protests outside; it was Nicholas\u2019s \u201cfirst experience of really being in the limelight\u201d. After Grease with Elaine Paige, \u201cI thought: \u2018You haven\u2019t done any real straight acting.\u2019\u201d He was invited to do Much Ado About Nothing at the Young Vic. \u201cI bought the play, had a look at it and didn\u2019t understand it. If you don\u2019t know Shakespeare, it takes some interpretation.\u201d There was a snobbishness that musical theatre actors weren\u2019t considered \u201cproper\u201d actors. \u201cNot by them all, but by one particular actor who was in it. We had a few cross words in the wings one night and a slight dust-up, not major, and then we had to go on and be friends in the play.\u201d An opportunity to play Hamlet in a musical version in New York fell through because Nicholas couldn\u2019t get a work visa. \u201cI wasn\u2019t considered a name worthy enough in America to usurp an American actor,\u201d he says. And so Nicholas decided he needed to become famous. The best way, he thought, was to become a pop star after all. Incredibly, he managed it \u2013 he had three UK hits, including two Top 10s, and got on to Top of the Pops. I don\u2019t even know how to describe one of his hits, Reggae Like It Used to Be. One YouTube comment under his flare-wearing performance perhaps sums it up: \u201cThis might just be the whitest thing anyone\u2019s ever done.\u201d Nicholas smiles when I say this might get him cancelled now. It wasn\u2019t a reggae song, he says in (feeble) defence, \u201cit was a song about reggae\u201d. He was a bubblegum popstar and teen heart-throb, even though he was in his early 30s. \u201cI even got an afternoon pop TV show, which I hosted, called Paul, so I was really out there as a young pop singer, even though I was rather an old pop singer.\u201d He laughs. \u201cBut I was playing a character.\u201d He\u2019d tried to be like a pop star, he says \u2013 he would go to fashionable clubs to drink vodka. \u201cBut I was crap at it. I used to go home and throw up.\u201d By then, he had split up from his first wife and was in a relationship with Linzi, but he had a lot of attention from female fans. \u201cAs a result, my darling lady decided that things shouldn\u2019t be continuing as they were and decided to leave, which she did. Which was difficult.\u201d Things got even worse \u2013 his first wife was killed in a car crash, and he became sole parent to their two children (he also had two from before his first marriage). \u201cLinzi came back and helped me through that terrible time, and we\u2019ve been together ever since. It was a horrible, horrible time for everybody and without her I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done. She took on two children and our family.\u201d Later, they got married and had two more children. \u201cIt\u2019s been like that ever since, except they\u2019ve all gone \u2013 now the grandchildren are coming.\u201d He has six children, 13 or 14 grandchildren \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t added them up lately\u201d \u2013 and three great-grandchildren. How much of his long marriage was down to a reaction against his father\u2019s philandering? \u201cWell, when I was 16, if you were in a band, it was one-night stands, because you were never home long enough to have a girlfriend.\u201d Linzi, he says, \u201cwas the stable thing that I needed, and she has given me that over the years. I don\u2019t quite know what I\u2019ve given her.\u201d His father, he thinks, was a shy man whose sexual bragging may not have been entirely true. \u201cI think most of it was bullshit. I think it was reserved for other men, rather than women. He always seemed to me very courteous around ladies. He was in a profession that was quite strait-laced, but he was dealing with showbusiness people, who were the opposite, and I think that was part of his charm for them.\u201d In 1980, Nicholas was cast in Cats, which opened the year after. \u201cI went over to [Lloyd Webber\u2019s] place, and he played me these songs and I said: \u2018Oh yeah, nice tunes.\u2019 At Sydmonton Court, his home, he does this kind of festival every year where he tries things out, and so we performed Cats for 200 people in a church in his back garden. He seemed very pleased with it and the audience seemed to take to it.\u201d He regrets not investing money in the production when he was asked. \u201cIt became probably the biggest hit that Andrew has ever had.\u201d Nicholas, who played the rebel Rum Tum Tugger, was not as good a dancer as the others, and would run around the audience during the main dance piece. In his book, he recalls ruffling the hair around the bald spot of Prince Charles, sitting in the audience. \u201cHe seemed quite amused by it.\u201d The BBC sitcom Just Good Friends, written by the Only Fools and Horses creator John Sullivan and centred on his on-off relationship with his posher ex-lover (played by Jan Francis), cemented Nicholas\u2019s mainstream fame in the mid-80s. It wasn\u2019t that he wanted fame for fame\u2019s sake, he says: \u201cYou never really have got control in this business, because you\u2019re always reliant on someone calling you, but you stand more chance of [getting] work if you have a name.\u201d It was one reason he successfully went into producing, with an actor friend, David Ian. They put on Jesus Christ Superstar. \u201cI said: I\u2019ll play Jesus. That was good of me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d His other successful shows include Grease and Saturday Night Fever in the West End. He is still looking for opportunities \u2013 he writes songs and made an album recently, and has written two sitcoms, which he is hoping to develop. \u201cYou have to be a realist. I can\u2019t play young romantic leads and do those things, but there are parts out there for older people. It\u2019s such a terrible cliche, but if you do have dreams, follow them, because you\u2019re only here once. Give it a go, and if you muck up, too bad, but you\u2019ve had a go.\u201d What has he learned about showbusiness in all these years? He thinks for a moment, looking slightly as if he can\u2019t believe his luck. \u201cI think the one abiding passion is to keep going.\u201d \u2022 Musicals, Marigolds &amp; Me is released on 26 June, and is available to pre-order now on Amazon, Audible and iTunes"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ed", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/football-daily-email-euro-2024-qualifiers", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football Daily | Yet more qualifiers designed to ensure the rich countries can\u2019t fail", "lead": "<strong>In today\u2019s Football Daily:</strong> England\u2019s Euros expectations and more", "author": "Daniel Harris", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:42:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176019", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eb9c5d51cecc5fa540410cfc5999f82e7334329d/0_235_4830_2898/500.jpg", "body": "HERE\u2019S A HYMN TO WELCOME IN THE DAY There\u2019s nothing like an exciting game, and England v North Macedonia is nothing like an exciting game.

Alfred Dorris, 49, was acquitted by a jury at the Old Bailey of health and safety offences in the 2016 crash. The tram derailed at a sharp corner when travelling at three times the speed limit. The unanimous verdict was reached after less than two hours of deliberation, in the prosecution brought by the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, against the driver and transport companies involved. The ORR also prosecuted the operators of the track and the tram service, Transport for London and the First Group-owned Tram Operations Limited (TOL). Both pleaded guilty to health and safety failings earlier in the case, in 2022, and will be sentenced at a later date. Prosecutors had alleged that Dorris was paying insufficient attention, possibly due to a \u201cmicro-sleep\u201d, when the crash occurred in the early morning of 9 November 2016, which seriously injured 21 passengers as well as causing the seven fatalities. The court had been told that Dorris, of Beckenham, south London, was driving the tram at 70kph (42mph), more than three times the 20kph speed limit, when the tram derailed. However, a similar incident had occurred just over a week earlier on the service with another driver, jurors were told. Dorris denied he had a \u201cmicro-sleep\u201d and said he became disoriented in the tunnel on approach to the curve \u2013 blaming a combination of external factors including poor lighting and signage around the tunnel, darkness and bad weather. Dorris, who had been excused from attending a 2021 inquest because of post-traumatic stress, apologised to the victims\u2019 families and survivors as he spoke publicly for the first time about the crash while giving tearful evidence at the Old Bailey. He said: \u201cI\u2019m a human being and sometimes as a human being things happen to you that you are not in control of. I\u2019m sorry that I became disorientated. I\u2019m sorry I was not able to do anything to stop myself from becoming disorientated. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply sorry I was not able to do anything to reorientate myself and stop the tram from turning over. I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d Survivors described being \u201cflung\u201d about as if in a washing machine as the tram rolled over. Dorris was found in his cabin with his eyes shut and one passenger called for him to \u201cwake up\u201d. In court, Dorris broke down as he recalled the moments before the crash. He said: \u201cIt was like I went into shock. I could not do anything. I wanted to reach for the brake but at that stage the tram was already going over and I was thrown out of the chair and I could not do anything. \u201cI can remember being thrown from the chair to the side of the cabin and my shoulder took the impact and I hit the side of my head on the side of the cabin.\u201d Prosecutor Jonathan Ashley-Norman KC told jurors: \u201cWhether by virtue of a micro-sleep, or by virtue of becoming disorientated in some other way, or a combination of the two, Mr Dorris failed to attend to the most basic of requirements of a driver of a passenger vehicle, namely remaining alert and attentive at the controls.\u201d Dorris was described as having an \u201cimpeccable\u201d past record and was seen as one of the better drivers. The court was told of the previous \u201cnear-miss\u201d on the service, where Dorris\u2019s defence barrister, Miles Bennett, said a passenger had \u201cgenuinely feared for their safety\u201d. Accident investigators in 2017 found that another tram had come close to overturning nine days earlier, while drivers warned that they needed to brake heavily when approaching the bend. The Old Bailey jurors were not told of the findings of the 2021 inquest, which ruled that the deaths were accidental. The inquest\u2019s narrative verdict also found that the tram\u2019s operator TOL had failed to account for the risk of a high-speed derailment, or create a \u201cjust culture\u201d at the firm that would allow drivers to report health and safety concerns. The people who died were Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, Robert Huxley, 63, and Philip Logan, 52, all from New Addington, and Donald Collett, 62, and Mark Smith, 35, both from Croydon. Some relatives of the victims were in court, while others attended by video link from Croydon. The granddaughter of Philip Logan, Danielle Wynne, said the verdict was \u201cdeflating\u201d, adding: \u201cThere has to be some kind of accountability. As far as I\u2019m concerned, accident or not, he\u2019s taken no accountability for his actions that morning.\u201d The ORR said: \u201cWe conducted an extensive, detailed and thorough investigation and took the decision to prosecute TfL, TOL and driver Alfred Dorris for what we believed to be serious health and safety failings. \u201cWe note the decision reached and will consider this appropriately. Our thoughts remain with those affected by the tragedy.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319ef", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/ireland-debate-military-neutrality-president-michael-d-higgins-government", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ireland \u2018playing with fire\u2019 for opening debate on military neutrality, says president", "lead": "Michael D Higgins says government risks burying country in other people\u2019s agendas amid \u2018drift\u2019 towards Nato", "author": "Rory Carroll Ireland correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:30:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176052", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/47436e0cf2b9fcb0094d3838bb9ce19be5703758/0_95_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Ireland\u2019s president has rebuked the government for launching a debate about the country\u2019s longstanding military neutrality and the possibility of joining Nato, saying ministers were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. Michael D Higgins accused the government of a dangerous \u201cdrift\u201d from a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy and said it risked \u201cburying\u201d Ireland in other people\u2019s agendas. The intervention, made in an interview with the Business Post newspaper on Sunday, puts a spotlight on a government-sponsored forum on international security, where Ireland\u2019s neutrality will be debated. It also raises questions on the role of the president, who occupies a largely ceremonial post. On Monday, Higgins apologised for a \u201cthrowaway remark\u201d in the interview about the forum\u2019s independent chair, Louise Richardson, who he said had \u201ca very large DBE \u2013 Dame of the British Empire\u201d \u2013 implying that she was biased towards the UK. He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s grand but, you know, I think there were a few candidates I could have come up with myself.\u201d Richardson, an Irish academic and counter-terrorism expert, is a former vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford who sits on the boards of the Booker Prize Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation philanthropic foundation. Several politicians had called the president\u2019s comments unfair. In a statement, his office said: \u201cHe apologises for any offence which he may have inadvertently caused to Prof Richardson by what was a throwaway remark.\u201d However, the president did not recant other views expressed in the interview, which sharpened the debate about Ireland\u2019s military neutrality in the era of Russian aggression under Vladimir Putin. The arrival of Ukrainian refugees, incursions by Russian ships that are suspected of mapping underwater cables and a 2021 ransomware attack by suspected Russian gangs on the health service have raised questions about Ireland\u2019s meagre security resources. The justice minister, Helen McEntee, defended holding the forum. \u201cThe president himself knows what the boundaries are here, and he expressed his views. Many would agree with him, there are many who would disagree, and that\u2019s why we need to have this forum,\u201d she told the Newstalk radio network. Neale Richmond, the junior enterprise minister, said the president had sailed \u201cclose to the line\u201d. Ireland has joined UN peacekeeping missions but shunned military alliances and invested little in defence compared with other countries. Critics accuse it of saving money and claiming the moral high ground while sheltering beneath a Nato umbrella. Miche\u00e1l Martin, the deputy prime minister, said the government did not intend to abandon military neutrality but that the forum would explore evolving security needs. Ireland has previously convened citizens\u2019 assemblies to debate constitutional changes such as ending an abortion ban. The upcoming consultative forum involves experts, academics and service personnel as well as citizens. They will meet on 22-27 June in Cork, Galway and Dublin. Anxiety about Russia prompted Finland to become Nato\u2019s 31st member in April. Sweden also abandoned decades of non-alignment this year but objections from Turkey and Hungary have delayed it joining Nato."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319f0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/19/raw-milk-the-ultimate-dairy-product-is-back-but-is-it-safe", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Raw milk: the ultimate dairy product is back \u2013 but is it safe?", "lead": "Tom Parker Bowles has spoken out in favour of unpasteurised milk, along with much of TikTok.

Age: Ancient. Status: The hot new milk that everyone has to try! I\u2019m already confused. How can something be ancient and new at the same time? Oh, that\u2019s easy. People used to drink raw milk for centuries. Then they stopped. Now, they\u2019re drinking it again. Interesting. Why did they stop? There\u2019s a chance that they died of food poisoning from drinking all that raw milk. Sorry, what? Anyway, hey! Raw milk is the best drink in the world and you should try it. Even the queen\u2019s son says so. But didn\u2019t you just say \u2026 This weekend, Tom Parker Bowles wrote that raw milk has endured \u201cno pasteurisation, homogenisation or standardisation, meaning it still contains the full complement of vitamins, minerals and natural digestive enzymes, as well as providing the most lusciously creamy mouthful of pure dairy delight; rich, sweet and voluptuously full-bodied.\u201d Oh, that sounds quite nice. Remember, we\u2019re talking about the queen\u2019s son here. A litre of raw milk costs about \u00a33.50, compared with \u00a31.35 for the same amount of the usual stuff at a supermarket. Is it worth the expense? As a food fad, raw milk is growing in popularity. Aside from Parker Bowles, a fleet of TikTok influencers cannot overstate how good it is. Why do I feel a \u201cbut\u201d coming on? But, I mean, where to start? Pasteurisation has saved countless lives, because it eliminates bacteria such as E coli, salmonella, listeria and campylobacter; these can cause illnesses that \u2013 not to be too delicate \u2013 tend to leave you pallid, sweaty and blasting hot liquid jets from both ends at once. Blimey. Sorry. But raw milk is banned in Scotland. Additionally, in 2016, 65 cases of food poisoning were linked to a vending machine in Cumbria that dispensed raw milk. Reputable vendors claim their raw milk is perfectly safe (as long as it\u2019s kept fresh), but one study found that Americans who eat and drink raw dairy products are more than 800 times more likely to contract food poisoning than people who choose pasteurised ones. I\u2019ll stick to semi-skimmed then. No! Don\u2019t do that, either. Do you know what enormous emitters of greenhouse gases cows are? Industrial livestock farming is a huge contributor to the climate emergency. Almond milk? No! While it\u2019s better for the environment than cow milk, it takes 74 litres of water just to make one glass of almond milk. It represents a huge strain on the planet\u2019s resources, especially in areas where the almonds are grown. Oat? Soy? Rice? All require water and cause greenhouse emissions. Aargh! What do I do? Honestly, would it be such a sacrifice to drink your tea black?

For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of the darkest chapter in US history with joy, in the form of parades, street festivals, musical performances or cookouts. The US government was slow to embrace the occasion \u2013 it was only in 2021 that Joe Biden, who had been inaugurated that January, signed a bill passed by Congress to set aside 19 June as a federal Juneteenth holiday. And just as more people learn the historical details and traditions of Juneteenth, the holiday\u2019s message is facing modern pressures \u2013 especially political rhetoric, policies and laws censoring history and condemning efforts to teach Americans about the nation\u2019s racial history. Then there are issues such as companies using the holiday chiefly as a marketing event with little beneath the superficial, and people partying without taking the trouble to learn why there are commemorations and celebrations. How did Juneteenth start? The celebrations began with enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. Although president Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation officially freed all from slavery in 1863, it could not be enforced in many places in the south until the civil war ended in 1865. Even then, some white people who had profited from enslaved labor were reluctant to share the news. Laura Smalley, freed from a plantation near Bellville, Texas, remembered in a 1941 interview that the man she referred to as \u201cold master\u201d came home from fighting in the civil war and didn\u2019t tell the people he enslaved what had happened. \u201cOld master didn\u2019t tell, you know, they was free,\u201d Smalley said. \u201cI think now they say they worked them, six months after that. Six months. And turn them loose on the 19th of June. That\u2019s why, you know, we celebrate that day.\u201d News that the war had ended and they were free finally reached Galveston when the Union major general Gordon Granger and his troops arrived in the Gulf coast city on 19 June 1865, more than two months after the Confederate forces had surrendered. Granger delivered General Order No 3, which said: \u201cThe people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.\u201d Slavery was permanently abolished six months later, when Georgia ratified the 13th amendment. And the next year, the now-free people of Galveston started celebrating Juneteenth. Are there other titles used for Juneteenth? It\u2019s sometimes also called Juneteenth Independence Day, Freedom Day, second Independence Day and Emancipation Day. It began with church picnics and speeches, and spread as Black Texans moved elsewhere. Most US states now hold celebrations. Opal Lee, a former teacher and activist, is largely credited for rallying others behind a campaign to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. The 96-year-old had vivid memories of celebrating Juneteenth in east Texas as a child with music, food and games and she rallied support from her home city of Fort Worth all the way to Washington DC, Lee was one of the people standing next to Biden when he signed Juneteenth into law. How have Juneteenth celebrations evolved over the years? The national reckoning over race ignited by the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police helped set the stage for Juneteenth to become the first new federal holiday since 1983, when Martin Luther King Jr Day was created. Now there is a movement to use the holiday as an opportunity for activism and education, with community service projects aimed at addressing racial disparities and educational panels on topics such as healthcare inequities and the need for parks and green spaces. Like most holidays, Juneteenth has also seen its fair share of commercialism. Retailers, museums and other venues have capitalized on it by selling Juneteenth-themed T-shirts, party ware and ice cream. Some of the marketing has misfired, provoking a social media backlash. Supporters of the holiday have also worked to make sure Juneteenth celebrators do not forget why the day exists. \u201cIn 1776 the country was freed from the British, but the people were not all free,\u201d Dee Evans, national director of communications of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, said in 2019. \u201cJune 19, 1865, was actually when the people and the entire country was actually free.\u201d Associated Press contributed reporting"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319f3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/19/uk-mortgage-rates-housing-summer-slowdown-rightmove-interest-rates-bank-of-england-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Average two-year fixed rate mortgage deal hits 6% for first time this year, as Sunak rules out extra help \u2013 business live", "lead": "Average mortgage rates hit highest level since December, as asking prices for British homes fall in June for the first time in six years", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:21:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176123", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f69d504edc21f76cc7dbb999b836914e96265f58/0_395_5951_3570/500.jpg", "body": "A quick recap\u2026 The cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage in the UK has risen above 6 per cent today for the first time this year, as thr turmoil in the property sector continued. Average two-year fixed mortgage rates hit 6.01%, from 5.98% on Friday, financial data provider Moneyfacts reported. The rise came as investors anticipate another increase in Bank of England base rate on Thursday, probably from 4.5% to 4.75%. The financial markets now believe there is a greater than evens chance that UK interest rates hit 6% by early next year. UK government borrowing costs continued to climb, with the two-year gilt yield hitting 5% for the first time since 2008. That will put further upward pressure on mortgage prices. Increased borrowing costs have prompted some lender to withdraw deals, while other products have been repriced with higher interest rates in the last month. Rising interest rates means people looking to remortgage their homes will pay an average \u00a32,900 a year more from 2024, the Resolution Foundation think tank predicted. But despite the squeeze, prime minister Rishi Sunak sounds unwilling to provide specific help for mortgage holders. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Sunak said: \u201cI know the anxiety people will have about the mortgage rates, that is why the first priority I set out at the beginning of the year was to halve inflation because that is the best and most important way that we can keep costs and interest rates down for people. Consumer champion Martin Lewis accused chancellor Jeremy Hunt, and UK banks and regulators, of missing the opportunity to agree protections for mortgage holders before rates surged. Asking prices for British homes fell in June for the first time in six years, as rising interest rates hit the markets and dragged forward the usual summer slowdown. But retail chain Next has lifted its profit forecasts, reporting that sales have been much stronger in recent weeks than expected. It attributed this increase to the better weather (more demand for summer clothes) and recent pay rises\u2026 And in other news: Former UK prime minister Liz Truss has been sharing some little gems of wisdom from her time in office. Speaking at the European Broadcasting Union\u2019s NewsXchange conference in Dublin today, Truss argued that the U.K. was, and still is, in \u201cserious economic trouble\u201d, Politico reports. Truss, who left office after 45 days after her government\u2019s mini-budget backfired, causing turmoil in the markets, said she needed to be \u201cbold\u201d to reverse declining economic growth. She admitted she lacked support from Tory MPs and \u201ccould have gone a bit slower\u201d with her economic reforms. But Truss also criticised the UK media\u2019s coverage of politics, saying: \u201cI do think sometimes politics is sort of treated as a branch of the entertainment industry, who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down, who says what about who. \u201cI think the level of understanding of economic ideas in the media and the ability to explain them is very poor indeed.\u201d The pound hit a record low in the aftermath of Truss\u2019s mini-budget, as traders were concerned by the package of unfunded tax cuts announced by chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. UK bond yields jumped, but then recovered some ground after the Bank of England launched an emergency intervention last September. Another UK interest rate rise looks almost certain on Thursday, but the market view of further borrowing cost increases is \u201ctoo pessimistic\u201d, says economic forecasters at EY ITEM Club. They argue that the ingredients for an improvement in the inflation outlook means current market expectations of rates peaking at close to 6% early next year look too pessimistic. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says: \u201cRecent surveys from the Bank of England and Citi/YouGov show inflation expectations among the public continuing to decline. The Bank of England\u2019s own Decision Maker Panel survey of businesses also suggested pay and price expectations have eased in recent months. And there remain good reasons to think the fall in inflation since last autumn will gather pace, as powerful base effects kick in, a slowdown in pipeline price pressures feeds through to consumer prices, household energy bills fall on the back of a significant decline in wholesale prices, and the consequences of a marked slowdown in monetary growth leaves its mark. May\u2019s inflation report, due on Wednesday, will also influence the Bank\u2019s thinking\u2026. Consumer finance champion Martin Lewis has criticised the government, and the financial sector, for not taking action sooner to protect mortgage-payers from rising interest rates. In a post on Twitter, Lewis explains that he warned last autumn of a \u201cmortgage ticking time bomb\u201d as people\u2019s existing fixed-rate deals came to an end. Lewis says, a mortgage summit called last December by chancellor Jeremy Hunt proved to only be \u201ca missed opportunity talking shop...\u201d Lewis says he pushed for \u201ceasy to agree forbearance and help measures\u201d to assist those facing higher mortgage costs, But, Lewis says, his push for real changes met push back from the banks, and sometimes from the FCA, the City regulator, too. He writes: For example 1. Any help options should be easily reversible on request. Eg if you extend your term, to reduce payments, when things improve you should have an automatic right to reduce the term. Knowing there is a reversibility option gets rid of a barrier to action - without reversibility people are scared to be locked into a longer mortgage (which means more interest). 2. It should have no or minimal impact on people\u2019s credit scores (as it did in the pandemic). Again negative credit file impact is a big barrier to action - as it leaves people reticent to make a decision, which can lead to snowballing problems. None of the suggestions have seen any real fruition. The attention faded, especially when rates didn\u2019t rise as sharply as first expected. Next has jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after upgrading its profit forecasts today. Next\u2019s shares are up 4.7%, while other retailers such as Primark-owner AB Foods (+2.5%) and Frasers (+2%) are also gaining. Just in: High street retailer Next has just upgraded its profit forecasts for the year, and cited warmer weather and recent pay rises received by UK workers. In an unscheduled trading update, Next says that trading in the last seven weeks has been \u201cmaterially better\u201d than the guidance it issued in May. Full price sales in the first seven weeks of the second quarter were up +9.3% versus last year, strongly ahead of Next\u2019s guidance of a 5% fall in full price sales. In the period, Next have beaten its full price sales estimates by \u00a393m. It has now lifted its full year profit guidance by \u00a340m to \u00a3835m. Next tells shareholders that the recent change in weather (after a damp and windy spring) has boosted sales, saying: The onset of warmer weather has made a significant difference to our performance, particularly coming after a wet and cold April. Next also suspects that annual salary increases are spurring spending at its shops \u2013 a comment that may alarm the Bank of England as it tries to prevent inflation becoming embedded in the economy. Next explains: For example, during April annual inflation was running at 8.7% and monthly inflation was 1.2%; if an individual received a pay rise of 5.0%, then their real income would have risen by 3.8% in that month. We do not think it is a coincidence that sales stepped forward so markedly at a time of year when many organisations make their annual pay awards. Last week\u2019s employment report showed that regular pay excluding bonuses increased by 7.2% in the three months to April, the fastest in 20 years. The rise in UK mortgage rates to 6% will put a tighter squeeze on borrowers who need to remortgage. Economists at ING explain that a typical houseowner refinancing their home loan would be paying close to 40% of their average disposable income on mortgage repayments. ING say: If we look at the mortgage market \u2013 the main transmission mechanism for interest rates \u2013 then 6% rates would mean a homeowner with a 75% loan-to-value ratio would, on average, be paying close to 40% of their disposable income on repayments. That compares to roughly 30% at the peak going into the 2008 financial crisis. The difference between now and then is that the share of households with a mortgage has fallen, and more people own their home outright now. And more importantly, around 90% of mortgages are fixed \u2013 predominantly for five years \u2013 a huge sea change compared to 10+ years ago when most were on variable rates. The result is that the length of time rates stay elevated is now arguably more important than the level, and the impact of 5%+ mortgage rates for a prolonged period would be large. The Bank of England is also right to highlight that the impact of past rate hikes is only now beginning to bite as a greater number of mortgage holders refinance. The curent turmoil in the mortgage market could have long-term consequences for retirement plans and pension incomes, warns Gary Smith, partner in financial planning at UK wealth manager Evelyn Partners. Smith says the increase in mortgage costs, and rents, is bound to have a disruptive effect on saving (assuming people had enough money left over to put aside anyway), adding: \u201cImpacts could be felt right from younger savers looking to get on the housing ladder who cut back on pension saving, to the middle-aged who find themselves taking on marathon mortgages that run well past state pension age, to those who have retirement on the horizon and face tricky calculations around how long their pension pot will last.\u201d Smith fears that much of the \u00a315.7bn increase in annual mortgage payments by 2026, predicted by Resolution Foundation on Saturday, could come from either reduced pension contributions or from savings that were intended for the medium to long term. The Liberal Democrats have repeated their calls for the government to intervene to help struggling mortgage payers, PA Media reports, as average fixed mortgage costs rose again today to the highest since December. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: \u201cThe time for the Government to step in is now, anything else will be a disaster for struggling families worried about losing their homes. \u201cThis Government is sitting on their hands, giving no help to ordinary working people who suffer. It\u2019s just plain wrong. \u201cLiberal Democrats are calling on Rishi Sunak to finally listen to those who need help and immediately end this mortgage horror show with a mortgage protection fund.\u201d The Lib Dems first proposed a \u00a33bn fund last November, which would provide grants of \u00a3300 per month to cover rising costs mortgage costs to prevent a home-owner being repossessed. However, such a proposal is controversial \u2013 as it could undermine the Bank of England\u2019s attempts to cool the economy, forcing interest rates higher. Plus, it would mean taxpayers effectively underwriting a major asset purchase, and prop up house prices at a time when some people are hoping they keep falling so they can get onto the housing ladder\u2026 Elsewhere in the City, the money markets are indicating a greater than 50% chance that UK interest rates will hit 6% by next February. That\u2019s up from just under 50% on Friday, Reuters reports. This calculation is based on the price of interest rate swaps, which are derivatives contracts used by investors to hedge against rising borrowing costs, or to speculate on future moves in interest rates. Sterling has risen to its highest level against the euro in 10 months, as traders anticipate a rise in UK interest rates on Thursday. The pound has touched \u20ac1.1736, the highest level since last August. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, says both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are likely to keep raising borrowing costs, while the US Federal Reserve took a pause in its tightening cycle last Wednesday. The Bank of England in particular probably has the most ground to cover still amid more rampant inflation than in other countries and the ongoing resilience of the UK economy. The pound is trading above the $1.28 level for the first time since April 2022, while the euro is back above $1.09. Heading into Thursday\u2019s meeting, the risks for sterling are symmetrical as the BoE could surprise with a 50-bps hike, but it could also signal that it is nearing the end of its tightening cycle. Shares in UK housebuilders have dropped to a three-month low, after Rightmove reported this morning that asking prices for homes dipped a little in June (see opening post). The UK homebuilders index is down 0.8%, to its lowest since 20 March, as City traders react to signs that the summer slowdown has started early this year. Renters are also feeling the squeeze from the cost of living crisis. Bristol\u2019s local mayor has warned today that tenants in his city are facing a \u201cWild West market\u201d, and argued for rent controls in the housing market. Marvin Rees told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere has been no real change in our regulatory powers as a local authority to keep up with the changing nature of the housing market. We are taking old tools to new challenges.\u201d On rent controls, Rees said: \u201cI recognise there is complexity but what we certainly need is intervention in the rental market. \u201cWhether you call that control or not is up to you, but there needs to be an intervention because allowing this Wild West of the rental market with rents growing out of all pace to people\u2019s income\u2026 \u201cWhat we have at the moment in Bristol is, over the last decade, rents have gone up about 52% and wages have gone up 24%. The Bank of England could be split this week, when policymakers meet to set interest rates. James Lynch, Fixed Income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, predicts that most members of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will vote to tighten again. Lynch says: \u201cOn the voting, we could be back to three-way splits on the committee again, with two voting for unchanged, one or two voting for a 50bps hike, and the remainder in the middle voting for 25bps. On the finer details of the forward guidance, we have the minutes of the meeting to go on, but this is not a policy review meeting where we get updated fan charts, and there won\u2019t be a press conference \u2013 so it\u2019s not the most useful meeting in the event of a big change in guidance. MPC members Silvana Tenreyro and Swati Dhingra are seen as most likely to vote for no change, having opposed recent increases at past meetings. UK government short-term borrowing costs have hit a 15-year high, in a move that signals more pain for mortgage holders. 11am UPDATE: The yield, or interest, rates on two-year government bonds has just hit 5% 4.995% this morning. That\u2019s the highest level since July 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted. Those two-year gilts are used to price fixed-term mortgages. They are rising as the financial markets anticipate the Bank of England will raise UK interest rates on Thursday, for the 13th time in a row, to 4.75%. Riz Malik, founder and director at R3 Mortgages, warns that rising mortgage rates are creating a \u2018ticking time bomb\u2019 in the UK property market: We urgently needs a cross-party Mortgage Task Force to find potential solutions to this ticking time bomb. This should be comprised of economists, lenders and other stakeholders who are actively involved in the mortgage market. We need action or the impending financial earthquake is going to send shockwaves across the country. Samuel Mather-Holgate, independent financial advisor at Mather and Murray Financial, argues that the Bank of England should be given the leeway not to raise interest rates to squeeze inflation. The Government need to change the mandate of the Bank of England so that they put more weight on the future of the economy and give their inflation target a longer term time horizon. This would allow them to maintain their independence but take their foot off the accelerator when it comes to rate hikes. Confidence breeds confidence and a pause in rate rises will mean lenders stabilise their product offerings and the resultant competition drives prices downwards. [the Bank\u2019s target is to keep inflation at 2% \u2013 so is under pressure to keep raising interest rates as inflation was 8.7% in the year to April]. Buy-to-let mortgage rates have also risen again. Moneyfacts reports that the average two-year fixed rate on a BTL mortage increased from 6.21% on Friday to 6.30% today. The average five-year fixed rate has gone up too, from 6.17% to 6.23%. The number of buy-to-let mortgage products on the market has fallen this morning, to 2,515 from 2,589 on Friday. The Labour party also aren\u2019t pledging any specific help for mortgage payers today. Asked about the party\u2019s plans on Sky News, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour would tighten up the windfall tax on oil and gas companies to yield more money to help reduce energy bills. He says: That wouldn\u2019t be a direct mortgage payment, but it would help people with their bills. Starmer argues that the situation in the UK is worse \u201cbecause of that terrible mini-budget\u201d, which has created \u201ca Tory premium on people\u2019s mortgages.\u201d Q: So the Labour wouldn\u2019t help people pay their mortgages? Starmer says Labour is trying to put \u201cconcrete plans\u201d on the table to reduce bills through the oil and gas windfall tax, to help families with their overall bills. He says: We need a long-term solution to this, we can\u2019t have sticking plasters any more. That requires a stable plan to grow the economy, properly. That hasn\u2019t happened for 13 years. Starmer adds that Labour\u2019s plan to make the UK a clean energy superpower by 2030 would help lower bills in the long term. Lenders have been \u2018scrambling\u2019 to raise mortgage rates over the last month, says ITV\u2019s Joel Hills, after UK inflation failed to fall as much as hoped in April. Newsflash: the average rate on a two-year fixed rate mortgage has risen over 6%, for the first time in six months. Financial information provider Moneyfacts reports that the average two-year fixed rate has increased to 6.01% today. That\u2019s up from 5.98% on Friday, and 5.26% at the start of May. It takes average two-year fixed mortgage rates back towards the levels seen in the chaos after the mini-budget last autumn (when they hit 14-year highs). This is the first time since the first week of December 2022 that two-year fixed-rate mortgages have cost 6% or more. Longer-term fixed rate mortgages also become more expensive, with the average five-year fixed rate rising to 5.67% today, from 5.62% on Friday. This reflects financial market expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates several times this year. As well as a quarter-point hike on Thursday, to 4.75%, the money markets predict rates could hit 5.75% by the end of the year. Mortgage providers continued to cut deals too. The product count has fallen from 4,923 on Friday to 4,683 this morning, Moneyfacts adds. Although rising interest rates are a blow to borrowers, they are welcome news for those retiring. The average rate on an annuity, which provides a regular guaranteed income in retirement, has jumped by 20% over the last 12 months, according to financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. They report that a 65-year-old with a \u00a3100,000 pension is able to get up to \u00a37,144 per year, up from \u00a37,027 two weeks ago, and an increase of a fifth on the same period last year. The last time incomes were this high was November 2022, after the mini-budget chaos drove up the cost of government borrowing (meaning UK bonds paid a higher return). Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: After being relegated to the side lines after Freedom and Choice annuities are once again taking centre stage and attracting more notice. This increase is likely to be in response to the looming rate rise we are expecting this week. Interest rates are one factor that determine annuity rates and while it is by no means a certainty, we have seen annuity incomes increase in line with interest rate rises over the past two years. With more increases rumoured to be on the way we could see further income boosts in the coming months. Though they have dropped in popularity in recent years annuities should always be considered where there is a need for guaranteed income in a retirement strategy. The state pension will offer secure income up to a certain level but if you need more, and you don\u2019t have something like a defined benefit pension scheme, then annuities are an important option. Housing market analyst Neal Hudson of consultancy BuiltPlace shows in this tweet how mortgage holders in the South East are more vulnerable to rising mortgage rates: And here\u2019s Jon Boys, economist at the CPID (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development) on the generational impact: Prime minister Rishi Sunak has ruled out providing any extra help for households who are struggling with mortgage payments. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, the prime minister declined to back extra support for mortgage holders, despite concerns that millions of households facing a dramatic rise in borrowing costs as they remortgages their home loans in coming months. Instead, he said the government needs to \u201cstick to the plan\u201d, and that his top priority remains bringing inflation down. Sunak said: \u201cI know the anxiety people will have about the mortgage rates, that is why the first priority I set out at the beginning of the year was to halve inflation because that is the best and most important way that we can keep costs and interest rates down for people. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a clear plan to do that, it is delivering, we need to stick to the plan. \u201cBut there is also support available for people. We have the mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers and we have the support for mortgage interest scheme which is there to help people as well. On Friday, the Liberal Democrats called for a \u00a33bn mortgage protection fund to be set up to offer help to families at risk of losing their homes, as fears of a jump in repossessions rose. Mortgage experts fear the average rate on a two-year fixed-term mortgage could hit 6% today, having climbed to 5.98% at the end of last week. But Sunak\u2019s comments do square with the reports last night that Treasury insiders insisted that taxpayers will not bail out mortgage holders, as such state intervention would be the \u201cmost dangerous thing a government could do\u201d. Rightmove\u2019s survey covers asking prices, not the actual amount which buyers agree to pay for a home. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, reports that sale prices are \u2018softening\u2019, saying: \u2018As expected, recent mortgage market turbulence is dampening the increase in prices and activity which we would usually see at this time of year. \u2018However, these are, of course, only aspirational not achieved values. On the street, prices are softening as cash and equity-rich buyers in particular continue to hold sway over those relying on increasingly hard-to-obtain loans. \u2018Negative publicity is helping lower expectations and encourage more seller realism.\u2019 Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, says sentiment has \u2018taken a hit\u201d in the past few weeks: \u201cRecent rate volatility hasn\u2019t yet had a material impact on housing market activity because, if anything, those holding mortgage offers are keen to move sooner rather than later. That said, sentiment has taken a hit in recent weeks, which will keep a lid on trading volumes later this year. Ironically, strong wage inflation rather than the mini-Budget is now the main brake on the housing market although the outlook will only become clearer this week. Those buying, selling or re-mortgaging will hope the Bank of England isn\u2019t faced with a second ugly underlying inflation reading on Wednesday.\u201d Rightmove\u2019s monthly house price report also shows regional differences in the markets In London, average asking prices fell by 1.6% in the month, while they dropped 0.6% in the East Midlands and by 0.5% in Yorkshire and the Humber region. But average asking prices rose 4.9% in the North East, followed by a 1.8% gain in Wales. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: \u201cRightmove\u2019s UK asking prices dropped for the first time since 2017 but only by \u00a382 on average. Versus last year, house prices in June rose by 1.1% to an average of \u00a3372,812. There are significant regional differences; the North East saw average property prices increase by 4.9% to \u00a3188,414 whereas London prices fell by 1.6% to \u00a3685,241. The housing market tends to get a seasonal boost around this time of year, and consumer confidence has been picking up. However the market is still grappling with rising interest rates, falling real wages, sluggish economic growth and volatility in the mortgage market. This week the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates again by 25 basis points while the latest UK inflation figures [on Wednesday] are expected to point to price pressures which are easing but remain sharply above target. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Rising mortgage rates are cooling the UK housing market, bringing forward the usual summer slowdown in the housing market. Asking prices for British homes fell in June for the first time in six years, property website Rightmove reports this morning. Rightmove\u2019s latest data shows that average new asking prices dipped, slightly, this month for the first time this year. It suggests that some sellers are pricing their properties a little more competitively, as higher borrowing costs dampen the market. Average new seller asking prices slipped by \u00a382 this month to \u00a3372,812. This is the first monthly drop in new asking prices this year, and the first at this time of year since 2017, Rightmove reports. The number of sales being agreed has dropped marginally, and in the last two weeks is 6% behind the same period in 2019; twice as fast as the 3% drop recorded in May. On average, over the previous ten years prices have risen by 0.6% at this time of year. Rightmove suggests that constraints on buyer affordability due to higher borrowing costs, and \u201cmore pricing realism from new sellers\u201d have brought forward the usual summer slowdown. Tim Bannister of Rightmove explains: Average new seller asking prices, the first and leading indicator of new trends in the market, have dropped slightly this month, signalling that the belated spring price bounce has quickly turned into an earlier than usual summer slowdown. We expect asking prices to edge down during the second half of the year which is the normal seasonal pattern, and while we sometimes re-forecast our expectations for annual price changes at this time, current trends suggest that our original forecast of a 2% annual drop in asking prices at the end of 2023 is still valid. The squeeze on borrowers is expected to worsen this week, with the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates on Thursday from 4.5% to 4.75%. One Conservative MP warned last weekend that Britain is heading for a \u201cmortgage catastrophe\u201d, due to the surge in borrowing costs this year. Lucy Allan, the Tory MP for Telford, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have quite understood the interest rate catastrophe. People [are] telling me their monthly mortgage payment is exceeding their salary. That is unsustainable. \u201cConstituents do ask about \u2018support for unaffordable mortgages\u2019. I say \u2018talk to your lender,\u2019 but the reality is they need to sell sooner rather than later and that\u2019s a hard message to hear.\u201d Allies of chancellor Jeremy Hunt have ruled out giving any direct fiscal support to households struggling with soaring mortgage costs. Hunt, according to Treasury sources, has concluded that such an intervention would drive up government borrowing and fuel inflationary pressure, leading to even higher interest rates. More than a quarter of UK homeowners on a fixed-rate mortgage are heading for sharp increase in monthly payments before the next election. Figures shared with the Guardian by UK Finance, the banking industry trade body, show more than 2.4m fixed-rate homeowner deals will expire between now and the end of 2024. According to the Resolution Foundation, total annual mortgage repayments are now on course to rise by \u00a315.8 billion by 2026, as households move onto new, higher fixed-rate deals. That means an extra \u00a32,900 cost for the average household re-mortgaging next year.

Had Britain \u201cheard\u201d the screams of caution from Black people about the racism and, therefore, unsuitability for office of Boris Johnson, there is a good chance Britain would not be \u201cfeeling\u201d the pain and shame of demise we are right now. In the story of race in Britain, Johnson may be as deserving of his own special chapter as Enoch Powell. And a fascinatingly complex chapter it would be. It is hard to conceive of anyone who has seemingly done more to decimate antiracism movements and relegitimise racism in Britain (for his own political gain) but simultaneously just as hard to name anyone who did more for high-level political diversity \u2013 once seen as a vital measure of racial progress. Powell gave a speech; Johnson gave power and the respectability of diversity to racism. As a shock-jock scribe, Johnson played to the nativist gallery with attempts at humour that only a drink-sodden toadying upper-middle-class dinner party (or a fawning media class) would laugh at. There was his reference to \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and \u201cflag-waving piccaninnies\u201d in an infamous 2002 Telegraph column about a trip by Tony Blair to west Africa. But there were myriad others. \u201cThe problem is not that we were once in charge [of Africa], but that we are not in charge any more \u2026 If left to their own devices, the natives would rely on nothing but the instant carbohydrate gratification of the plantain,\u201d scribbled Johnson in the Spectator. Indeed, a cursory study of his time as editor of the Spectator suggests an apparent disdain for, obsession with and envy or fear of Black people in particular. He did not write but he published at least one patently, eye-wateringly racist pseudoscientific article suggesting Black people had low IQs. Another piece published under his editorship described Jamaican immigrants (ie descendants of Africans enslaved by Britain) as \u201cludicrously self-satisfied, macho, lupine-gaited, gold-chained-and-front-toothed predators of the slums, with the bodies of giants and the mind of a pea\u201d. Another dismissed the idea of disaffected Black youth as politically correct cover for \u201cblack thugs, sons of black thugs and grandsons of black thugs\u201d. The piece contained the bigotry bat-signal \u201cboy, oh boy, was Enoch \u2013 God rest his soul \u2013 ever right!\u201d Far from making him a pariah, his early catalogue of racist waffle, written by or apparently sanctioned by him, helped to propel Johnson to success. Whether it was Brexit (during the campaign he labelled President Obama a \u201cpart-Kenyan president\u201d with an \u201cancestral dislike\u201d of Britain), his refusal to condemn England fans who booed their own players for making an antiracism gesture, his visit to Myanmar as foreign secretary (during which the UK ambassador to Myanmar had to stop him reciting a colonial-era poem) or writing in a column that Muslim women wearing burqas \u201clook like letter boxes\u201d (which some critics blamed, at least in part, for a 375% rise in reports of Islamophobic incidents) \u2013 time and again over the course of his career Johnson would return to his reliable ace, the racism card. Often the offence was camouflaged. The burqa article, for example, argued against a ban in Britain. Which is classic Johnson \u2013 playing the liberal and the crowd-pleasing, devil-may-care reactionary at once. And we would complain and no one would listen and no one would do anything. Here\u2019s a funny thing: no one has appointed more people from ethnic minorities to senior political positions than Boris Johnson. His cabinet was unthinkably diverse \u2013 the statistics speak for themselves. But as the business professor and economist Aaron Levenstein once cautioned about statistics: \u201cWhat they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\u201d What the statistics concealed is the fact that Johnsonian diversity represented a giant leap forward for racism. If you were an ethnic minority \u201canti-woke culture war warrior\u201d, the Johnson years were a land of milk of honey. Your anti-woke provocation was your qualification. A couple of viral anti-woke tweets or YouTube clips could propel you into the Johnsonian stratosphere or into a prestigious national institution. Thanks to Johnsonian diversity, Britain now has more ethnic minorities in positions of power than ever. But arguably he used it to undermine antiracism or racial progress in society at large. His willingness to brazenly do so was part of his nativist appeal. That was disreputable, but then he is disreputable and we knew that. We did find the emergency glass: we did break it. And now you know what we knew about that willingness to offend, the readiness to trash rules and norms for cheap gain and self-advantage.

At 5.05pm (and 22 seconds) on 20 June 2019, the 28-strong field in the Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot was approaching the furlong pole and Turgenev, who had set off as the 7-2 favourite, was going strongly in front with a lead of nearly three lengths and trading at around 1-3 in-running on Betfair. Frankie Dettori, Turgenev\u2019s rider, had already won the first four races on the card, at odds of 5-1, 13-2, 4-1 and evens. Victory No 5 on the day would have completed a 2,024-1 accumulator at SP, with many of Dettori\u2019s loyal followers having banked much bigger prices earlier in the day. Just 12 seconds later, though, the bookmakers could breathe again, as Harry Bentley and Biometric emerged from the pack to win by a length-and-a-quarter. It was a dramatic and memorable afternoon, but also just one among many at the Royal meeting over the last three decades when Dettori, the most high-profile and popular rider of the post-Lester Piggott era, has demonstrated his ability to seize control of the narrative, at Ascot above all. Much was said and written about his final ride in the Derby earlier this month, but Epsom, for whatever reason, was never really his track. Ascot absolutely is, and four years to the day after his latest golden afternoon at the course, Dettori has six booked rides on Tuesday\u2019s opening card at what will be his final Royal meeting before he retires from the saddle later this year. All six are priced up at single-figure odds, ranging from Inspiral, at 15-8, in the opening Queen Anne Stakes, to Absurde, at 5-1, in the Copper Horse Handicap at 6.10. If we all work together and put on \u00a35 each-way accumulators at the current combined odds of around 10,000-1, the potential is certainly there to bring the bookies to their knees. But at the same time, the simple fact that all of Dettori\u2019s opening-day rides are odds-against is a reminder that while Cheltenham in March has overtaken Royal Ascot as the biggest meeting of the year from a betting perspective, these five days in June still offer the best and most competitive British Flat racing of the season. Inspiral ran away with the Coronation Stakes 12 months ago but is not even sure to start favourite for the Queen Anne, while Chaldean, Dettori\u2019s fourth and final 2,000 Guineas winner at Newmarket in May, is only narrowly preferred to Paddington, who took the Irish equivalent, in the betting for the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. And, like Cheltenham, this most traditional of race meetings continues to evolve. When Dettori rode his memorable four-timer just four years ago, the six-races-per-day format seemed unshakeable. Post-Covid, when the 2020 meeting behind closed doors increased to seven on the first four days and no fewer than eight on Saturday, it has settled at seven-per-day and 35 over the week. The race that charted the last 20 years of the late Queen\u2019s reign, meanwhile, first as the Golden Jubilee Stakes from 2002 and then the Platinum Jubilee from 2012, is now the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes, the feature on Saturday\u2019s card. And while it remains to be seen how regularly the new King and Queen will be in attendance, their colours will be aboard several runners with a chance, including Saga, the likely favourite and another in Dettori\u2019s book of rides, in Tuesday\u2019s Wolferton Stakes. And though Dettori is very likely to end his Royal Ascot career as the second-most successful jockey in the meeting\u2019s history, even that is not entirely guaranteed. Dettori has 77 winners at the meeting so far, but the rider currently attracting all the money to be the week\u2019s top jockey is Ryan Moore, who has 73. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s principal rider was, briefly, odds-against last week, but is now no bigger than 4-6 to win the jockeys\u2019 prize for the 10th time in 14 years. A net gain of four would therefore put Moore alongside Dettori in the all-time list, though still a long way behind the astonishing Piggott, who died in May 2022, and who amassed 116 Royal Ascot winners in an era when there were just 24 races to aim at each season. Whoever claims the riding honours this week \u2013 and William Buick and Oisin Murphy are in with a serious shout, too \u2013 the Long Fellow\u2019s place as the greatest Royal Ascot jockey will surely outlive us all."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319f6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-is-trolling-netflix-and-its-breathtaking", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bite the hand that streams!

The good news, then, is that Brooker was able to fully reboot what Black Mirror is during his time away. The less good news is that he probably didn\u2019t reboot it enough. For some years now, Black Mirror has been stymied by the sense that it exists solely as a vessel for predicting the future. Samsung has patented a video-recording contact lens that acts like the chip from The Entire History of You. Neural networks can reproduce the vocabulary and speech patterns of your dead loved ones, like in Be Right Back. The Chinese government has tested a system that punishes citizens who demonstrate poor social etiquette, like in Nosedive. There was that whole thing about David Cameron being inside a pig. But to watch the newest batch of Black Mirror episodes is to sense that Brooker really, really doesn\u2019t want that to happen again. For much of the new season, technology barely even features at all. In fact, the most traditionally Black Mirrorish episode \u2013 the feature-length space-set Aaron Paul melodrama Beyond the Sea \u2013 is easily the weakest of the lot. But the rest of it has the feeling of a self-willed backlash against everything that Black Mirror used to be. Unless humanity is suddenly overwhelmed by an onslaught of demons and werewolves (which admittedly, the way things are going, isn\u2019t impossible) then the sense is that Brooker is all too eager to relinquish his role as soothsayer-in-chief. The final episode of the season, a co-write with Bisha K Ali entitled Demon 79, feels like the biggest departure of all. The opening credits describe the episode as \u201cRed Mirror,\u201d a branded offshoot that eschews technological satire in favour of straight-up period horror. It\u2019s a successful experiment, largely thanks to Paapa Essiedu\u2019s immaculate turn as a put-upon demon trying to stave off Armageddon, and it hints at a whole new future for Brooker and Black Mirror. Or at least it would, if he hadn\u2019t already created an even better one. The first two episodes of season six primarily exist as a way to allow Brooker to lash out at his paymasters in extremely petulant (and wonderful) fashion. There is Loch Henry which, once it lumbers up enough momentum, becomes one of the most precise critiques of true-crime documentaries \u2013 the genre that clogs up a million Netflix submenus \u2013 that has ever been made. Every uneasy feeling you have ever experienced watching one of these documentaries is parcelled up and delivered with barely concealed fury. The same goes for the standout episode of the season, and potentially the entire show; the opener Joan is Awful. Not only is it the funniest Black Mirror episode ever, but the sheer force of its satire \u2013 aimed at glossy, dramatised biopic series like Netflix\u2019s Inventing Anna and Dirty John \u2013 is truly breathtaking. To watch either of these two episodes is to understand that Brooker has now come full circle. These aren\u2019t television episodes. They\u2019re entries from the spoof television listings site he used to run, TV Go Home. And, quite honestly, they\u2019re all the better for it. The unifying antagonist of both Joan is Awful and Loch Henry is Streamberry, an all-powerful streaming service with a distinctive Netflix-style red logo and \u201cTu-dum\u201d jingle. Black Mirror depicts Streamberry executives as craven engagement-obsessed opportunists who exist without any form of moral centre whatsoever, and the episodes would feel like extreme self-sabotage if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Netflix pays Brooker millions of dollars for his content. They\u2019re so effective, and so much more focused than Brooker has been for years, that you\u2019d like to see him sharpen his axe even further. If season six has any message at all, it is that Brooker has now outgrown Black Mirror. This isn\u2019t a bad thing. If there are no more new Black Mirror episodes, I won\u2019t be particularly sad. But if they\u2019re replaced by a full run of Streamberry Presents, we might be in for something very special."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319f7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/bournemouth-sack-gary-oneil-as-manager-in-clubs-best-interests", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bournemouth appoint Andoni Iraola as manager after sacking Gary O\u2019Neil ", "lead": "Bournemouth have named Andoni Iraola, who had left Rayo Vallecano at the end of the season, as manager after surprisingly sacking Gary O\u2019Neil", "author": "Ben Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:01:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176191", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7605ad9aa4f32bff6bc74fef1d1be38d286efebc/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Bournemouth have appointed Andoni Iraola as their manager on a two-year contract after sacking Gary O\u2019Neil. Iraola was free to take charge after leaving Rayo Vallecano at the end of the season. O\u2019Neil was dismissed despite steering Bournemouth to Premier League safety after Scott Parker\u2019s departure. The decision has caused surprise behind the scenes, with O\u2019Neil understood to have been informed on Monday morning that the club wanted to adopt a different style of play to accelerate their progress. Leeds failed in an approach to land Iraola, a 40-year-old former Athletic Bilbao midfielder, in February and he was on Bournemouth\u2019s shortlist when Parker was sacked last August but was not willing to move mid-season. Iraola, who began his coaching career in Cyprus with AEK Larnaca, had three seasons with Rayo, winning promotion to La Liga and then finishing 12th and 11th. Bournemouth\u2019s American owner, Bill Foley, concluded the club could not achieve his ambitions with O\u2019Neil at the helm. Foley said last week after his ice hockey team, the Vegas Golden Knights, had won the Stanley Cup that he wanted modest improvements at Bournemouth after a 15th-placed finish. Foley said of Iraola: \u201cHe was highly sought after by other clubs across the continent, and his style of play has been an important factor in making this decision. His achievements in Spain have certainly been very impressive, and we\u2019re confident that he is the right man to lead our next chapter.\u201d O\u2019Neil had two years on his contract after an extension was automatically triggered by avoiding relegation. He was appointed as manager, initially in a caretaker capacity, with the club bottom of the league after a 9-0 defeat at Liverpool. Foley said: \u201cGary\u2019s achievement last season is one I will always be grateful for. This has been a difficult decision, but it has been made with great consideration to best position ourselves ahead of the coming season. \u201cAs a club, we have put plans in place for long-term success with improvements being made to infrastructure, most notably the development of a new state-of-the-art training facility and the ongoing discussions around upgrades to our stadium. We have also identified a number of significant targets in the transfer market this summer and believe this change in direction will provide us with the best platform from which to build. \u201cGary will go on to have a long career as a head coach or manager, but we feel that, at this moment in time, a change is in the best interests of this football club. I would like to place on record my thanks to Gary and wish him all the best for the future.\u201d Foley, the 78-year-old who bought Bournemouth from Maxim Demin in December, wants to build a new stadium and the new training ground is due for completion in autumn of next year. In January Foley acquired a stake in the Ligue 1 club Lorient, whom Bournemouth are set to play in pre-season."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319f8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/labour-pledges-british-jobs-bonus-as-it-sets-out-green-energy-strategy", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labour pledges \u2018British jobs bonus\u2019 as it sets out green energy strategy", "lead": "Party to offer \u00a3500m a year for low-carbon sector but says North Sea oil and gas production will continue \u2018for decades\u2019", "author": "Fiona Harvey and Severin Carrell in Edinburgh", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:59:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176208", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/65750c38a6674eb2b663b7aa4128b05cd37e1555/0_322_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Clean energy companies would be offered up to \u00a3500m a year to set up manufacturing in the UK, to build the wind turbines, solar panels and other infrastructure needed to reach net zero, under plans set out by Labour. But Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, on Monday also gave assurances to the oil and gas industry that production would continue in the North Sea \u201cfor decades to come\u201d, to the consternation of green campaigners. Under plans for a \u201cBritish jobs bonus\u201d, Labour would allocate \u00a3500m a year for each of the first five years of government, to provide capital grants to companies in low-carbon industries, including wind and solar energy, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Companies wishing to supply clean energy in the UK, under a continuation of the existing incentive system, known as contracts for difference, would have to demonstrate they were creating high quality jobs in the UK. Labour said the bonus would particularly benefit industrial heartlands and coastal communities, and areas that have past or current coal, oil and gas industries, and pointed to an independent estimate that 65,000 new jobs could be created in this way. Starmer told an audience of energy experts and green campaigners in Edinburgh on Monday that the Tory government and the Scottish National party had failed to secure green jobs in the UK. \u201cBritain has the second largest offshore wind capacity in the world, a close second only to China, yet across the North Sea in Denmark they\u2019ve got three times as many jobs. How do you explain that?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow do you explain Scottish wind turbines built in Spain, in Holland and Indonesia, as the workers in the fabrication yards in Fife \u2013 who would be proud to build something great in their country \u2013 look out their window and watch others putting them up in the Forth? There is no justification.\u201d Labour\u2019s clean energy strategy was launched in Edinburgh to wrongfoot the SNP and bolster Starmer\u2019s efforts to win back Westminster seats lost to the party. Starmer also agreed to base the proposed state-owned energy company GB Energy in Scotland, under pressure from the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar. Climate campaigners believe Labour has also outflanked the SNP, which appears to be watering down the strong pro-climate commitments by Nicola Sturgeon to quickly phase out North Sea production. While extolling the virtues of clean energy, however, Starmer was also careful to reassure his audience that jobs in the North Sea oil and gas fields were not at risk. Labour has vowed to halt the licensing of new oil and gas fields, but will not seek to rescind licences issued by the Tories, or to halt production from existing fields. This means the controversial Rosebank field in the North Sea, for which final permission is believed to be imminent, could go ahead and Labour would not rescind the licence if elected. Halting production from already licensed fields would be legally tricky, and any future government that did so could be subject to claims for billions in compensation. Taking such a stand could also spook investors now and lead to a disorderly situation in the North Sea, rather than a managed transition away from fossil fuels. Union leaders sharply criticised Starmer this month for his plans to halt North Sea licensing, calling the proposals \u201cnaive\u201d and saying they threatened current and future jobs. Starmer, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Sarwar were at pains throughout the policy launch on Monday to repeat that North Sea oil and gas would be needed \u201cfor decades to come\u201d. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, told the Guardian that Labour\u2019s policy was in line with scientific advice on staying within 1.5C of heating. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration could take place after that date, if the 1.5C limit was to be kept, but current production need not cease immediately. Miliband said the North Sea was already in decline, so a transition to green energy offered an opportunity. \u201cWe\u2019re going to carry on using existing fields, we\u2019re not going to turn off the taps,\u201d said Miliband. \u201cBut what they [the IEA] say is that governments should not be issuing new licences. It\u2019s the science-driven, evidence-based position. It\u2019s also right for energy security.\u201d Labour strategists believe the \u00a3500m green manufacturing subsidy will help address fears that renewables companies will not shift manufacturing to the UK or produce the high wage engineering jobs that will be lost when North Sea production is being phased out. Several attempts to attract those jobs to Scotland have already failed: pledges of windfarm jobs in Fife and northern Scotland have gone unrealised; the promise of large-scale tidal and wave energy schemes funded by Scottish ministers have not been met. Green campaigners said turning off the taps would be necessary. Mary Church, the head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: \u201cSaying no to new licences is an important start, but the Labour leader needs to go further and stand up to the oil and gas companies that are ripping off householders and profiting as the planet burns. \u201cAll parties need to acknowledge that no new projects can go ahead and some existing oilwells will have to be phased down before they run dry. If Rosebank, or any other development is approved by the current UK government, then it will have to be shut down by the next UK government.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319f9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/italy-mulls-law-against-glorifying-crimes-online-after-youtuber-crash", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Italy mulls law against \u2018glorifying\u2019 crimes online after YouTuber crash", "lead": "Move to jail those who upload videos that \u2018instigate violence\u2019 comes after Rome collision kills five-year-old", "author": "Angela Giuffrida in Rome", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:56:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176224", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6d2d58b02c719a515c142ac33f55b1a040e32643/52_0_5896_3537/500.jpg", "body": "The Italian government is considering a law that would jail people convicted of \u201cglorifying illegal activity\u201d online for up to five years, after YouTubers driving a Lamborghini SUV crashed into a car while filming a video, killing a five-year-old child.

An investigation was opened in 2018 after Alexandre Gilet, a 22-year-old volunteer deputy gendarme in Grenoble, allegedly ordered products that could be used in explosive devices. The manager of a fireworks shop found his order suspicious and contacted police. A search of the man\u2019s home found \u201cregularly used\u201d weapons, including two Kalashnikov assault rifles, and laboratory equipment. Prosecutors say he and the three other accused were part of an ultra-right, neo-Nazi private online discussion forum called \u201cOperation WaffenKraft\u201d, where discussion \u201cvery quickly turned to the preparation of terrorist projects\u201d. The Waffen-SS was the military branch of the Nazis\u2019 elite SS corps, which was founded by Adolf Hitler. French media reported that investigators found pictures of the four men, one of whom was aged 17 at the time, taken when they had met face-to-face for the first time in summer 2018 for shooting practice in a forest near Tours. Investigators also found draft documents that they interpreted to be manifestos along the lines of those used to justify ultra-right mass killings. One of the accused described the volunteer deputy gendarme as radical and determined, saying he wanted \u201cto create worse carnage than the Bataclan\u201d. This referred to the attack claimed by Islamic State that killed 90 people and injured scores more at a rock gig by the Eagles of Death Metal during coordinated attacks on Paris in November 2015. The topic of the group\u2019s online discussions is alleged to have included hatred of Muslims and communists as well as comments that were antisemitic and homophobic. Targets that were discussed allegedly included mixed neighbourhoods, a mosque, a meeting of a Jewish group, an airbase, the offices of the Licra association against racism and anti-semitism and a rally by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the leader of the hard-left party La France Insoumise. The four men include a farm worker, as well as an engineering student who was the son of an army colonel. The men\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue in court that they would not have carried out any real attacks, nor had they written manifestos. Nine planned attacks by ultra-right groups have been thwarted in France since 2017, the interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, said this spring, and the threat of attacks by ultra-right or neo-Nazi groups is being taken seriously by French authorities. One of the accused was a teenager when police arrested the suspects in 2018 and 2019, which meant a closed-door trial for all four men was likely under French law. But the presiding judge, Christophe Petiteau, said on Monday that given the seriousness of the allegations, \u201cthe court considers it important to lift the restricted publicity\u201d."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319fb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/celebrity-hairdresser-charles-worthington-puts-mykonos-villa-up-for-sale-for-50m", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Celebrity hairdresser puts Mykonos villa up for sale for \u20ac50m", "lead": "Charles Worthington, who has styled Sarah Jessica Parker and others, could get record sum for Greek island home", "author": "Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:26:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176257", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5bde72f1b8b800bb91988a25fc1a2670935b510e/671_163_5337_3205/500.jpg", "body": "The celebrity hairdresser Charles Worthington is attempting to sell an eight-bedroom villa on the Greek island of Mykonos for \u20ac50m (\u00a343m). If the house \u2013 which features an infinity swimming pool, whirlpool, gym and entertaining space for more than 200 guests \u2013 achieves the huge price tag it will be the highest price ever paid for a property on the island, which is known as a popular summer party destination for gay people from Europe and the US. Worthington, who has over the years been the go-to hairdresser for celebs including Goldie Hawn, Sharon Stone, Lily James, Tracey Emin, and both Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall, said he was selling the 14,000 sq ft villa in order to start work on a new project on the island. Worthington, who sold his namesake beauty company to British consumer goods giant PZ Cussons for \u00a337m in 2004, bought the Mykonos property in 2013 with his partner Allan Peters. The couple declined to say how much they paid for the villa, which stands on a dramatic clifftop with direct sunset views. The property, which is built in the Greek island\u2019s classic stone with white facade, is also being advertised to rent at a cost of \u20ac220,000-a-week. The main bedroom suite includes an en suite bathroom, TV lounge opening on to a sea view terrace, dressing area and further reading area. \u201cWith its dramatic elevated location and unrivalled sea views The Cape never fails to deliver the wow factor for residents and guests,\u201d Worthington said of his villa. \u201cIt is the perfect setting for private relaxation, intimate dinners with friends and family, and large-scale entertaining. From the windows and terraces the panorama provided is beyond compare, you can watch the superyachts glide into Mykonos harbour, enjoy the sunset and glittering night lights of the Chora, and spy many of the other islands, which sparkle like jewels in the sea. The estate provides total privacy and security, yet the fun and glamour of Mykonos town is 10 minutes away.\u201d Gary Hersham, founder of estate agency Beauchamp Estates, which is selling the property in partnership with Roi Deldimou, an estate agent who works on the island, described Mykonos as a \u201cbeautiful, outstanding and luxurious destination like no other in the world\u201d. \u201cCatering for the wealthy with superyachts and private jets, as well as fine dining and luxury retail boutiques is it any wonder that discerning people from around the world seek to return time and time again to Mykonos, many choosing to purchase a home.\u201d Mykonos has been attracting tourists since the 1920s, when archaeologists and antiquity hunters used it as a base to visit the ancient Greek ruins on neighbouring Delos. It came of age in the 60s when the former US first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis visited with her second husband, the shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Following her lead came Grace Kelly, Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren. There are two bars and a hotel dedicated to Jackie O on the island. The island first became a destination for gay visitors in the 70s, when the Italian-American painter Pierro Aversa and a local fisher, Andreas Koutsoukos, set up Pierro\u2019s, an LGBT-friendly bar. Since then the super-rich have followed. The island\u2019s Psarou Bay has proved particularly popular for superyachts because it is a natural deepwater harbour protected from the notorious meltemi north winds. When the Guardian visited in 2019 there were 11 of them at anchor, including the Maltese Falcon, a $300m (\u00a3240m) three-mast sail-powered superyacht built for the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tom Perkins. The bay\u2019s Nammos beach club is popular with celebrities such as Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan, Ariana Grande, Wayne Rooney and Usain Bolt. In 2017, the one-time-billionaire Philip Green was caught on Instagram at Nammos smashing plates and spraying champagne with the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, the Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner and the US designer Tommy Hilfiger."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319fc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/hunter-valley-bus-crash-parents-of-groom-call-for-stronger-seatbelt-laws", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hunter Valley newlyweds appreciate \u2018love and support\u2019 after bus crash as groom\u2019s father calls for seatbelt law change", "lead": "John Gaffney, whose son Mitchell married Madeleine Edsell last Sunday, calls for mandatory rule on all buses", "author": "Elias Visontay", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:23:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176274", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4454f7e020479f7c6b425d5aa7187f8197c9b0aa/0_170_5185_3113/500.jpg", "body": "The parents of the groom whose Hunter Valley wedding ended in tragedy when 10 guests died in a bus crash when leaving the event have called for stronger seatbelt laws. John Gaffney, whose son Mitchell married Madeleine Edsell in wine country on Sunday 11 June, has called for seat belts to be mandatory on all buses \u2013 something which is not currently the law in New South Wales. While it is a requirement for everyone on board a bus fitted with seat belts to wear them, drivers are not legally responsible for ensuring their passengers wear them, and experts have warned enforcement is grey area. Gaffney has called for stricter policies so that passengers are \u201ccompelled by laws to wear them\u201d. \u201cHopefully something positive can come out of this tragedy. 50 years ago the fitting and wearing of seat belts became compulsory in Australia for all occupants of motor cars saving countless lives since,\u201d Gaffney said in a post on LinkedIn. \u201cWhilst my wife and I can\u2019t do this on our own we believe ultimately everyone who rides a bus should have access to a seatbelt and be compelled by laws to wear them. Gaffney called for assistance by asking people to lobby federal and state MPs on the issue. \u201cIf a federal government petition could be set up that would be most appreciated,\u201d he said. His wife and mother of the groom, Carolyn Gaffney, reportedly echoed the plea on social media. \u201cSo that something \u2018good\u2019 can come out of this our family would appreciate if the community would lobby the state and federal governments to ensure that seatbelts are provided in all buses and the wearing of them made compulsory,\u201d she posted on Facebook. On Monday, Mitchell Gaffney and Edsell released a statement via the premier\u2019s office requesting privacy \u201cwhile we grieve\u201d. \u201cWhile we appreciate the outpouring of love and support from the community\u2026our primary focus at this time is processing this tragedy, and supporting our family and friends,\u201d the couple said in the statement. Also on Monday, members of the Singleton Roosters Australian rules football club \u2013 a team which several of those who died in the crash were involved with \u2013 held a press conference to explain members were suffering \u201cunfathomable heartache\u201d. \u201cOur community has experienced unfathomable heartache, distress, and sadness after a number of people closely connected to the club were on board and either injured or killed,\u201d president Dylan Hixon said. \u201cWe will lean on each other through this incredible and difficult time with the memory of everyone that has been lost at the forefront of our thoughts.\u201d \u201cOur first priority and focus is on supporting the families, friends and those from the wider club community who have been affected by this unspeakable tragedy,\u201d he said. Among the victims were Nadene McBride, who coached the Singleton Roosterettes, her 22-year-old daughter Kyah who played in the team, as well as Kyah\u2019s boyfriend, Kane Symons. Also killed were Singleton husband and wife Andrew and Lynan Scott who both played for Singleton Roosters teams and left behind two young children. Tori Cowburn, who also died, was captain of the Roosterettes and worked for mining company Thiess. Darcy Bulman, a 30-year-old investigator for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission from Melbourne was killed while her partner is believed to be injured. Rebecca Mullen, a junior doctor and Singleton local working at Calvary Mater Newcastle hospital, was one of the younger victims. Others who died were Zach Bray, who was working as a mining engineer in the Hunter region and engineer Angus Craig who had worked with mining company BHP in Queensland. Hunter MP Dan Repacholi said nine victims remained in hospital with two of them in intensive care. Two community gatherings and memorials have been set up in Singleton and Greta, he said. New South Wales premier Chris Minns said more than half a million dollars had already been donated to a fund to help victims and their families. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced on Monday that his government will provide up to $580,000 to the family members of Bulman.

Ajax want \u00a340m plus \u00a35m in add-ons for \u00c1lvarez and West Ham have decided the Mexico international is too expensive. That has left the path clear for Dortmund, who are favourites to sign the midfielder as they look to rebuild after selling Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid. West Ham will have funds to play with once they sell Rice, who is expected to join Arsenal for at least \u00a3100m. David Moyes wants two midfielders, with Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse and Manchester City\u2019s Kalvin Phillips in his thinking, and Palhinha is a key target. Palhinha has impressed since joining Fulham for \u00a320m last summer and Marco Silva will not want to lose the former Sporting Lisbon player. Fulham are expected to demand \u00a350m for the Portugal international, whose tough tackling caught the eye during his debut Premier League season, and West Ham will need to decide whether that represents value. West Ham, who qualified for the Europa League after winning the Europa Conference League, are yet to receive a new bid from Arsenal for Rice. They turned down Arsenal\u2019s opening offer of \u00a380m plus add-ons and expect Manchester City to bid. Rice has also been targeted by Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Newcastle and Manchester United. Moyes has long been a fan of Ward-Prowse, who is expected to leave Southampton after their relegation. Ward-Prowse is a proven Premier League player, which could enhance his appeal to West Ham, and his threat from set pieces would make him a good fit in a Moyes team. Phillips is unlikely to want to leave City this summer. West Ham had a bid rejected for the England midfielder when he was at Leeds. West Ham also want a left-winger and are interested in Harvey Barnes, who is available after Leicester\u2019s relegation. Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham also want Barnes, who scored 13 goals last season."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c003319fe", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/uk-to-change-sanctions-rules-in-move-towards-seizing-russian-assets", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK to change sanctions rules in move towards seizing Russian assets", "lead": "Move changes purpose of sanctions so that they will be maintained until Russia agrees to pay compensation", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:01:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176309", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d768237ce9b8f8bce5baf0da8bad8099a8614f74/0_169_5983_3590/500.jpg", "body": "The UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian sanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for frozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. The laws go some way to ensuring that Russian assets currently frozen by the UK government can in effect eventually be seized \u2013 a move that many western powers have rejected on the basis that it could set a precedent for western assets held overseas to also be seized. According to the UK government, the new laws do not amount to forfeiture and could only be used if there is evidence of criminal conduct. The measures come ahead of the Ukraine recovery conference in London and critics will see it as an effort to forestall demands for more definitive steps. The laws will change the purpose of sanctions so that they will be maintained until Russia agrees to pay compensation, rather than merely protecting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the current purpose of the sanctions. The UK is the first government to take these initial steps and accepts they may take time to resolve and require consultation. New measures will also require designated persons to disclose all the assets they hold in the UK, with a failure to comply leading to a fine or a seizure. A further set of measures will require individuals to disclose if they hold Russian sovereign assets in the UK, a move that will provide clearer data to the government on the amount of Russian central bank assets in the UK. These assets will not be disclosed in public. A more minor measure will make it easier for those under sanctions to have their assets voluntarily transferred and handed to Ukraine for the purpose of its recovery. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: \u201cAs Ukraine continues to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, the terrible impacts of Putin\u2019s war are clear. Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction needs are \u2013 and will be \u2013 immense.

There\u2019s a full moon over the olive grove where the Master Musicians have cut out a flat area as a stage, and tonight it is covered in carpets beneath a green and red patterned awning. The musicians are dressed in turbans and black embroidered djellaba robes, and all are seated apart from their elected leader, Ahmed El Attar, a drummer who parades in before them, driving on an intricate, improvised and trance-inducing dance music that continues without stop for hour after hour. This ancient artistry, stretching back over a thousand years, is powerful and complex; the musicians say it is spiritual, bringing a blessing, baraka, to those who listen. There are four percussionists, beating out constantly changing polyrhythms on their goatskin drums, the small zowak and larger farad, and alongside them are eight woodwind players, blowing into their reed ghaitas. The lead player and two companions establish a riff, others respond or embellish the melody or use circular breathing to add drone effects to music that is constantly developing, creating phasing effects as it builds from crescendo to crescendo. Suddenly, the lights go out, a bonfire is blazing in the field by the stage, and Boujeloud, the Pan god appears, dancing around the flames, quivering from head to foot, brandishing olive branches as he chases village children before leaping on stage with the band. By day, Mohamed El Hatmi is a 71-year-old cafe owner but once he puts on his costume, made from the skins of four black goats, he is a man possessed. It\u2019s a role he has played for more than 50 years. This is the finale of the world\u2019s smallest annual music festival. Only 50 people, including organisers and guests, can attend, so as not to disrupt village life, and Joujouka fans have come here from all over the world. A third are from Japan, where the band have toured and played a reportedly frenzied five-hour set at an EDM festival, while others have flown in from Los Angeles, France and the UK. After three days and nights of this intense music, with lengthy sessions always starting after midnight, everyone has got to know each other. There is still no running water in the village, and alcohol is not allowed. We all stay in the houses of the musicians, whose wives provide breakfast, and the musicians themselves help cook and serve lunch and dinner, served on the stage where they will later be playing. In the afternoons there are sessions with oud or violin players. Joujouka is a farming community perched on a ridge with a patchwork of fields and olive orchards below. There are more donkeys and chickens on the one street than there are cars. It may look like a typical north African village, but it has an extraordinary musical history. El Hatmi takes visitors across a valley to the mountain cave where Boujeloud, a creature who was half-man and half-goat, was said to have first taught flute playing to a shepherd, in the hope of getting a wife in return. He failed, but the villagers became such great musicians that Boujeloud was pacified, bringing health, fertility and good crops to the village. That ancient myth lives on. The festival is organised by Frank Rynne, once a musician in Dublin, where he first met members of the Joujouka band, and now a Paris-based academic historian. He has studied the Boujeloud story and argues \u201che is absolutely derived from Pan. Look at the depictions of Pan in Pompeii with his pan pipes \u2013 and the Romans were here. This is a pre-Islamic belief that has kept going. The villagers believe that the huge fire that destroyed olive groves here last year happened because there had been no Boujeloud festivals \u2013 they had been stopped by Covid.\u201d Islam also influenced the music. In the early 15th century, Sufi saint Sidi Ahmed Sheich came here, realised the power of the music and taught the musicians to play a style that Rynne says \u201cwould act like a surgical instrument on the brain to help heal people from depression\u201d. Joujouka flourished. Some musicians travelled to Fez to play for the Sultan (a lucrative gig that ended with the colonial era: the French were in Fez, the Spanish in Joujouka, and the musicians weren\u2019t able to cross the new colonial borders). Others stayed in the village to play to the sick who flocked here to be cured. When I first came here in 1973, musical healing ceremonies were still being held in the ancient shrine to the saint in the centre of the village. The shrine remains, still dominated by an old fig tree, but it\u2019s now deserted. With Rynne translating from the Arabic, I ask El Attar what had gone wrong. There has been a clash between the old Sufi tradition and modern Islam, and they have been banned from playing there: \u201cThe authorities say it shouldn\u2019t happen because there is a mosque across the road.\u201d But he says the music still has the same power and they still treat the sick in private: \u201cFive weeks ago we played for someone who came to us with a djinn [a malicious African spirit] in his brain\u201d. He and other musicians break into a furious burst of hand clapping as they demonstrate the difference between \u201cthe Boujeloud rhythms, for dancing\u201d and the healing music written by the saint. There\u2019s another, more recent figure in the village mythology \u2013 Rolling Stone Brian Jones, who recorded here in 1968, a year before his death, and was said to be obsessed by the music. After Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka was released in 1971 the village attracted more celebrities. When I was first invited here there was still no electricity, the musicians were playing on the mud square, but the guests included William Burroughs and Ornette Coleman. Rikki Stein \u2013 later Fela Kuti\u2019s manager \u2013 had been living here for two years, and in 1980 he organised passports for the band, and bought a bus for their first European tour, lasting three months. Stein is back this year and noted \u201cthe music has the same energy and dynamism I experienced in the 1970s \u2013 though the number of musicians has reduced\u201d. It\u2019s a glorious story \u2013 but with one sour edge. Bachir Attar, the son of one of Joujouka\u2019s best-loved musicians, runs a rival band called The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar. He speaks English (unlike the Joujouka musicians), has lived in New York, played with the Rolling Stones on Steel Wheels in 1989, with Ornette Coleman at his London Meltdown in 2009, and won a gold medal from the Kennedy Centre for the performing arts this year. Which is all fine \u2013 there is surely room for two bands from the region? But Bachir, who has a house in the village but was not in evidence during the festival, claims his band are the \u201cauthentic Master Musicians \u2026 not to be confused with any imitations\u201d. And that has caused major problems. Rynne says he started the festival in Joujouka to prove that these really are the village musicians, and was delighted that Brian Jones\u2019s former partner Anita Pallenberg came along to the first event in 2008. So what do the Joujouka musicians think of Bachir\u2019s music? \u201cIt\u2019s popular music, not the ancient music of Joujouka,\u201d says El Attar. \u201cBut let him do what he wants. Anyone who comes here and sees what we do knows what the story is.\u201d And it\u2019s the Master Musicians of Joujouka, not Jajouka, who will be at Glastonbury, where they last played in 2011. They are clearly excited to be going, especially the three band members who have never been outside Morocco before. \u201cWe loved it,\u201d said El Attar. \u201cWe had no wellington boots until someone gave them to us. Boujeloud music brings blessings.\u201d \u201cPeople want the baraka, the healing power,\u201d adds the ghaita player Abdeslam Rrtoubi. \u201cThis music is ancient. It will never die.\u201d \u2022 The Master Musicians of Joujouka play London Forge, 20-21 June, and Glastonbury 23 June (Pyramid stage, noon)"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a00", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/19/peloton-lockdown-boom-ends-uk-sales-slide-full-year-results-interactive-exercise-bike-firm", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Peloton\u2019s lockdown boom grinds to a halt as UK sales slide", "lead": "Full-year results reflect slowdown for interactive exercise bike firm viewed as \u2018winner\u2019 from pandemic", "author": "Alex Lawson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:46:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176345", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/41efaf8f8988668fc1bdf630300bbba1a23a1a4d/0_163_4884_2930/500.jpg", "body": "Sales at the UK arm of Peloton have fallen after the end of Covid restrictions put the brakes on the interactive exercise bike firm\u2019s lockdown boom. The US brand\u2019s British business reported that sales had decreased by 13% in its last financial year and that losses had widened. Peloton Interactive UK said turnover had fallen to \u00a3127.8m in the year to 30 June 2022, down from \u00a3147m in the 12 months before. In accounts filed at Companies House, the firm\u2019s directors said the fall was \u201cdue to slowing sales, reflecting the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our hardware sales\u201d. The results reflect a slowdown for a brand viewed as a \u201cwinner\u201d from Covid lockdowns. UK sales of Peloton, which sells bikes, treadmills and online fitness classes, nearly trebled during the first year of the pandemic as its equipment became sought after by Britons seeking exercise while stuck at home. Some customers have since said they are struggling to resell the \u00a31,300 bikes and have resorted to using them as expensive clothes racks. The US parent company floated on the stock market in 2019 and its share price rose steeply during the pandemic, reaching $162 (\u00a3126) in late 2020. The price has since slumped to about $8 and last year the company announced it would cut more than 3,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive. Losses at its UK business more than double from \u00a381m to \u00a3210m. Administrative costs related to its expansion rose 47%, while the \u201cgross margin on hardware deteriorated\u201d. The company racked up costs by opening a fitness studio in a grade II warehouse in Covent Garden, London. The studio, which contains three gyms, was just the second such site the company had opened worldwide, after its New York studio. It also recorded nearly \u00a337m in restructuring costs as the group decided to stop manufacturing its own bikes to cut costs. The UK business said it was \u201clooking critically\u201d at its cost base, including the \u201crationalisation of our retail footprint as well as outsourcing an increasing proportion of our delivery operation\u201d. Peloton has eight retail sites in the UK, including six concessions in John Lewis department stores. Last month, Peloton Interactive Inc, the US parent company, reported that cash burn had slowed as its efforts to cut costs through redundancies and store closures bolstered its balance sheet. The company is now repositioning its brand to appeal to consumers exercising out of the house, as well as at home. Peloton, which has nearly 700 UK employees, also noted that the cost of living crisis could affect customer spending.

Peers are tabling motions on Tuesday for an environmental baseline to be put into the controversial bill, which is designed to formalise which EU-derived legislation is brought permanently into UK law. The majority of environmental laws in England and Wales are derived from the EU, so green groups are concerned that any changes to laws could weaken protections for wildlife, habitats, and water, including laws on air pollution, and rules to make developers offset the impact of increased sewage from new homes. Ministers have said \u201cenvironmental protections will never be downgraded\u201d in the bill but refused to accept previous Lords amendments to make this part of the law. Instead the government whipped its MPs to reject the draft of the bill containing legal safeguards to stop any environmental laws being downgraded. As the bill returns on Tuesday to the Lords, peers are tabling two more amendments to put an environmental baseline into the bill and prevent protections being downgraded. Ruth Chambers of Greener UK, a coalition of 10 major environmental organisations including the National Trust, RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe more that the government refuses to compromise on this amendment, the more suspicious its motives appear. Why would a government that says it is committed to environmental protections continue to resist adding a protective layer in this bill? \u201cIt is an uncontroversial change that would provide reassurance to people worried about air pollution and water quality. We hope ministers will seek sensible compromise.\u201d The government has rowed back on plans to ditch all remaining EU laws by the end of the year. It now aims to remove 800 statutes and regulations, instead of 3,700 laws it had lined up for a \u201cbonfire\u201d of EU law in December. Last month peers inflicted a major defeat on the government, voting in favour of an amendment calling for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the EU laws to be scrapped at the end of the year and an amendment ensuring that future governments cannot weaken existing levels of environmental protection. On Tuesday peers will debate a motion by Lord Krebs that any changes to regulations do not reduce the level of environmental protection arising from the EU retained law to which the provision relates."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a02", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/antony-blinken-xi-jinping-beijing-china", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Antony Blinken and Xi Jinping hold \u2018candid\u2019\u00a0talks in Beijing", "lead": "Meeting between China\u2019s president and US secretary of state takes place at time of heightened tension", "author": "Rachel Cheung in Hong Kong", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:20:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176379", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf8c19829474ac29b045fb0b57027c36baf40716/0_521_4590_2754/500.jpg", "body": "The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has wrapped up a rare trip to Beijing where he met China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, concluding a high-stakes visit aimed at stabilising spiralling relations. Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing before his departure, Blinken said he had had \u201can important conversation\u201d with Xi during the 35-minute encounter and stressed it was the responsibility of both countries to find a path forward. \u201cIn every meeting, I stressed that direct engagement and sustained communication at senior levels is the best way to responsibly manage our differences and ensure competition does not veer into conflict,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cI heard the same from my Chinese counterparts.\u201d Blinken, the first holder of his post to meet the Chinese leader since 2018, strode towards Xi with his hand outstretched at the Great Hall of the People, a venue China often uses for greeting heads of state \u2013 positive signals in the choreography of diplomacy. \u201cThe two sides have had candid and in-depth discussions,\u201d Xi said at the start of the meeting, in comments broadcast on Chinese state television. \u201cI hope that through this visit, Mr Secretary, you will make more positive contributions to stabilising China-US relations,\u201d Xi added, addressing Blinken. The rest of the discussion was held behind closed doors. The Chinese readout said the two sides \u201cmade progress\u201d and reached agreement on specific issues, without offering further details. Despite signs of positivity, Blinken acknowledged there were issues on which the two countries disagreed profoundly and even vehemently. China rejected a proposal to set up communication between the Chinese and American militaries. \u201cI want to emphasise that none of this gets resolved in one visit, one trip, one conversation. It\u2019s a process,\u201d Blinken said. The state department said later that in Blinken\u2019s meetings he had raised China\u2019s \u201cunfair and nonmarket economic practices\u201d, human rights violations in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and \u201cpeace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\u201d. \u201cThe two sides discussed a range of global and regional security issues, including Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, [North Korea\u2019s] provocative actions, and US concerns with [Chinese] intelligence activities in Cuba,\u201d said Matthew Miller, a state department spokesperson. Blinken\u2019s visit is the first by a US secretary of state in five years. Tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies have soared in recent years over a host of issues including trade, technology and Taiwan, with Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, calling Beijing the most serious threat to long-term US global primacy. Earlier on Monday, Blinken held extensive discussions with China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, at the Diaoyutai state guest house. On Sunday, he held talks with China\u2019s foreign minister, Qin Gang, for more than seven hours. According to a Chinese readout, Wang said China-US relations were at \u201ca critical juncture\u201d and called on the US to make a choice \u201cbetween dialogue or confrontation, cooperation or conflict\u201d. Wang stressed the need to reverse the downward spiral in bilateral ties, but also blamed the current low point on the US\u2019s \u201cerroneous perception of China\u201d. Moritz Rudolf, a fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said Wang\u2019s confrontational tone \u201cshows the great level of mistrust of Beijing vis-a-vis the US\u201d. However, given the bleak state of US-China relations, the mere fact that the visit had taken place was a positive sign, he said. Blinken\u2019s trip to China was initially planned for February but was postponed when a balloon, allegedly a Chinese spy balloon, flew over the US, sparking a controversy. China insisted it was a weather balloon that had been blown off course. Given the fraught relations, expectations of the meetings were generally low. Both countries hold hardened positions on a range of issues including trade, Xinjiang and Taiwan. But both sides showed a willingness to talk, with Qin and Blinken agreeing to maintain high-level exchanges and expand cultural and educational exchanges. The meetings could launch the process for more diplomatic engagement between the US and China, laying the ground for a Xi-Biden meeting, for instance, at the Apec summit that will take place in San Francisco in November, Rudolf said. \u201cThe reopening of bilateral communication channels, including on security-related matters, would be a step in the right direction,\u201d he said. Beijing and other western countries have also sought to stabilise relations after a tense few years. On Monday, the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, arrived in Germany for a diplomatic trip that will include a visit to France.

The city\u2019s vibrant Latin music and dance scene, thriving Cuban coffee bars, cigar shops, restaurants and colorful street art can all be credited to the wealth of culture that crossed the Florida Straits with the hundreds of thousands fleeing the island\u2019s new communist regime. Those changes, it turns out, also extend to the way Miami sounds. According to linguistic analysts at Florida International University\u2019s center for the humanities in an urban environment, a new dialect has evolved blending Spanish meanings and English words into a colloquial form of language readily understood here by those who speak and hear it, but which just sounds \u201coff\u201d to the majority of English-speaking Americans. Examples include people who say they are \u201cgetting down\u201d from a vehicle, instead of getting out; \u201cmaking a party\u201d instead of hosting one; and \u201cthrowing a photograph\u201d as opposed to simply taking it. The dialect incorporates what linguists call \u201ccalques\u201d, or \u201cborrowed translations\u201d from a speaker\u2019s native language directly into another, such as the literal translation of the Spanish phrase \u201chacer una fiesta\u201d into \u201cto make a party\u201d in English, or \u201ccasarse con\u201d, meaning to be married with someone, not married to. It\u2019s a different concept, the researchers say, from the more familiar, so-called Spanglish or Franglais hybrid of single words or short phrases melded from two separate languages. Instead, what has happened in Miami, notably since waves of Spanish-speaking Cuban immigrants began arriving after the revolution in their homeland six decades ago, has been a gradual assimilation from their Spanish phraseology into a widely understood local parlance in English. \u201cWe really learn our language not from our families, but from speech communities around us,\u201d said Phillip Carter, FIU professor of English and linguistics and affiliate of the university\u2019s Cuban Research Institute, who led the research. \u201cWhat happens when the speech community is majority foreign born, as in the case of Miami where it\u2019s about 65%, you have people responsible for caregiving, nannies, schoolteachers, children in the classroom, reinforcing those language patterns, and that\u2019s kind of how it enters the language. \u201cThe forms are very close to the regular forms anyway, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s actually shifting to Spanish. It sounds like English, they\u2019re English words, just rendered a little bit differently. For that reason they kind of fly, people here don\u2019t bat an eyelid, but to people from the outside, in conversation, a little flag might go up. \u201cYou know what it means in context, but you can\u2019t quite put your finger on why it sounds odd.\u201d Other parts of the dialect rely less on direct translation, and more on the familiarity among Cuban Americans of accepted, albeit ambiguous meanings. As an example, Carter cites the use of the generic word \u201cmeat\u201d. \u201cIn Spanish, \u2018carne\u2019 can refer to both all meat, or specifically to beef,\u201d he said. \u201cWe discovered local speakers saying meat to mean beef, as in \u2018I\u2019ll have one meat empanada and two chicken empanadas.\u2019\u201d Carter\u2019s team concluded that the first waves of Cuban immigration were \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of the process, with second-, third- and fourth-generation Cuban Americans, and now immigrants from other South and Central American countries in the Miami area, continuing its evolution. \u201cAt this stage, we\u2019re already 50-60 years into it,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration from Cuba has accelerated through the 2000s to today, and also because Cubans set up south Florida as a place where you can go and be Latinx, Latino, Latina, be Hispanic, and also maintain Spanish, it meant that when there was the civil war in Nicaragua, Nicaraguans came here; when there was political turmoil in Colombia in the 1980s, Colombians came here. \u201cSo Miami became a site of immigration from the 1959 revolution to the present, and it hasn\u2019t stopped. English language learners are continually introducing those types of forms into speech communities.\u201d For the research report, compiled with the language expert Kristen D\u2019Alessandro Merii from the University of Buffalo, New York, a former FIU student, Carter spoke with several generations of Cuban immigrants and Cuban Americans, including college students identifying as Latinx and born in Miami who speak English more than Spanish. \u201cThere are immigrants most proficient in Spanish and may have some proficiency or understanding of spoken English, and people like fourth-generation Cuban Americans who may have some passing understanding of Spanish if they don\u2019t speak it, and are really proficient in English,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of variation that\u2019s going on in the speech community like Miami. When you have two languages spoken by most of the population, you\u2019re going to have a lot of interesting language contact happening.\u201d Carter said he intends to expand the research to look at different regions of Florida and other states where there are large Spanish-speaking immigrant populations, and also to other nationalities in the Miami area. \u201cI got a note from a Haitian American lady, who pointed out that in French they also say \u2018get down\u2019 from a car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows there\u2019s more research to be done with speech communities here that are not of Spanish-speaking background, including Haitian Creole and French.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a04", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/does-the-world-really-need-a-4650-indiana-jones-bag-phoebe-waller-bridge-dial-of-destiny", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Does the world really need a $4,650 Indiana Jones bag?", "lead": "Luxury leather bags inspired by Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character in the new Dial of Destiny movie are the latest collaboration between fashion and film \u2013 but this time fans can fawn over Indy discreetly", "author": "Stuart Heritage", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:01:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176414", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/664266848be79e1506475d913832ba6d1d0cd787/0_302_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "The latest, and hopefully last, Indiana Jones film is released this month. It isn\u2019t a spoiler to say that it probably won\u2019t end up occupying the same cultural territory as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then again what could? Still, it isn\u2019t a bad film. It contains some digital de-ageing that\u2019s almost convincing, a big twist at the end that feels specifically designed to make the crankiest corners of the internet choke to death on its popcorn and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character carries a bag around for some of the film. No, really, that\u2019s important. When the dust has settled on the Indiana Jones series, everyone will remember the key pieces of its iconography. When future generations come to watch Indiana Jones, they will instantly picture Jones\u2019s hat and whip, and also the bag that Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character carries around for some of the last film. Why? Is it because the bag plays an important role in the film? Not really. Is it because it\u2019s an especially memorable bag? No. I\u2019ve seen the film and didn\u2019t even realise that she had a bag until I went back and did a Google Image search for it. But the bag is still very important, because otherwise nobody would have bothered to make an officially licensed partial replica of it and sell it on the internet for several thousand dollars. But they have, so here we are. It has been announced that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny costume designer Joanna Johnston has collaborated with London-based luxury leather goods maker M\u00e9tier to make a bunch of bags and wallets and playing card holders inspired by the film. These are statement pieces, and that statement is \u2018I am slightly too invested in the fourth-best Indiana Jones film, and also I have more money than I really know what to do with.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t to say that the resulting pieces aren\u2019t nice. Of course they\u2019re nice. They\u2019re beautiful. One of them is a suede duffle bag that\u2019s roomy and practical and very well made. But it costs $4,650, which is a lot of money to invest in something designed to commemorate the sequel to a film where Indiana Jones gets blasted across a portion of the American wilderness inside a fridge. This is, of course, just the latest collaboration between the worlds of fashion and entertainment. The final series of Game of Thrones, for example, caused an enormous rush of brands desperate to get in on the action, with Urban Decay bringing out a special Game of Thrones make-up set and menswear brand John Varvatos bringing out a $2,698 leather jacket designed to make you look like someone who lived in a time before the invention of laundry detergent. Jimmy Choo made shoes to commemorate the live-action Cinderella remake. Mr Porter sold a range of menswear based on Kingsman. Start to look for it and you\u2019ll see it everywhere. In a way, it\u2019s quite sweet. When you\u2019re a child, it\u2019s easy to show the world that you like a film, because all you have to do is wait until Halloween and then buy a hellish padded superhero muscle suit to demonstrate your abiding love for, say, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. But it gets harder as you age. You can\u2019t go to work dressed up as Darth Vader, because you are now a grownup and as such experience a suitable amount of shame when it comes to being enthusiastic about things. True, there are plenty of ways in which one\u2019s fandom can be celebrated indoors. You can buy all sorts of expensive merchandise \u2013 limited edition action figures and elaborate Lego sets, maybe even props from the actual movies \u2013 and fill your home with them, in the process creating a shrine to both the object of your enthusiasm and your own harrowing lack of impulse control. But perhaps this represents a new and better way. These bags are a way for people to quietly and discreetly demonstrate their love for Indiana Jones. Take the duffle bag out for a weekend away, and most people will simply think you have a fondness for well-made but pricey luggage. However, those who know will know. Maybe one day a stranger will tap you on the shoulder and whisper \u201cExcuse me, isn\u2019t that the bag inspired by the bag that Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character wore in some of the fourth-best Indiana Jones movie? I\u2019d recognise that anywhere,\u201d into your ear and, instantly, you will have made a friend for life."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a05", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/elemental-review-fire-and-water-fall-in-love-in-multicoloured-unworldly-pixar-fable", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Elemental review \u2013 fire and water fall in love in multicoloured, unworldly Pixar fable", "lead": "Decent family entertainment set in the city of four elements, with a message of acceptance in bricks of colour and concepts as if originated via algorithm", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:00:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176431", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b59d4593589d73a6408a18627c63af1fa4e781/0_113_2352_1411/500.jpg", "body": "Here is a perfectly decent, personable family entertainment from Pixar, based around another of this studio\u2019s oddly pedantic and algorithmically developed abstract high concepts: what if fire and water fell in love? It is also a star-crossed love story based on that most traditional of American themes: melting-pot diversity in the big city. The scene is another fabular alt-reality: Element City, a place of vivid colours and shapes like a toy held up in front of a newborn. Here, the creatures of the four elements \u2013 fire, water, earth and air \u2013 have come together to live, if not in harmony exactly, then a kind of boisterous acceptance. There is, however, a bigoted caste system that means that fire creatures are looked down on, maybe in the way the US\u2019s northern European identities look down on people from hotter countries. Each of them comes from an old country where they were members of the only element-ethnicity. Bernie and Cindy Lumen (voiced by Ronnie Del Carmen and Shila Ommi) are hardworking first-generation fire immigrants who set up a store in the city\u2019s Fire Town district. They have a smart, fiery-tempered teen daughter Ember (Leah Lewis), whom they hope will take over the business when they are gone. But left alone to mind the shop one day, Ember\u2019s explosively combustible temper cracks the pipes, which have been amateurishly installed by her dad, and this brings a certain watery young man through the cracks. This is Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), a government building inspector who really ought to penalise the Lumen family. But he\u2019s a goofy, soppy romantic whose watery identity is represented chiefly by his tear ducts. There\u2019s a funny scene showing his family playing what they call \u201cthe crying game\u201d (nothing to do with Neil Jordan\u2019s film of that name), in which they challenge each other to listen to a poignant story without bursting into tears. Wade falls in love with Ember, whose incendiary talent for turning sand into glass might yet prove to be the making of them both. To find happiness, Wade has to prove himself to Ember and also to her suspicious parents. It\u2019s a bit silly, a bit surreal, a bit simplistic, and lands itself with the problem of how to show Ember being sad (which she sometimes is) and Wade being passionate (which he also sometimes is). But this film is surely pitched at much younger kids than a comparable Pixar film such as Inside Out, in which the separate moods inside us all were represented by different characters. The question of whether Pixar\u2019s golden age is irrevocably behind us is now well-established and perhaps also misleading. In fact, Pixar has given us some outstanding films recently in Soul and Coco, and I am admittedly in a minority in thinking the Toy Story spin-off Lightyear is much better than it\u2019s given credit for. But undoubtedly Elemental is another step away from the sophisticated brilliance of this studio\u2019s glory days. Perhaps these multicoloured abstracts make the films sell better in international territories, but there is a worrying hint of PixarGPT about all this. Elemental seems to have been formulated with slightly chilling accuracy and the look of the movie is less interesting than it could have been. But having said that, a certain sweet, unworldly idealism in Elemental survives, the keynote of optimism \u2013 and this is the flame that Pixar has to keep alive. \u2022 Elemental is out now in Australia and the US, and on 7 July in the UK"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a06", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/19/courgette-budget-recipes-rosie-sykes-stuffed-bread-garlic-bulgur-pilaf", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rosie Sykes\u2019 budget recipes for courgettes", "lead": "The cheesy goodness of courgette-stuffed bread, plus wonderfully rich, slow-cooked garlic courgettes with bulgur pilaf", "author": "Rosie Sykes", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:00:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176448", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d0e068311673d82842f171746492a43c20f7c6/0_0_5683_3410/500.jpg", "body": "From the same family as cucumbers, squashes and melons, courgettes are very versatile, and are at their best and most affordable between June and September. Go for smaller, firmer ones for salads, marinades or grilling, while larger specimens work best roasted, fried or braised. If you have the space to grow some yourself, you will already know how well they can crop, and if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll always be on the lookout for new things to do with them, which is how today\u2019s first recipe came about. Slow-cooked garlic courgettes with bulgur pilaf Slow cooking turns courgettes wonderfully rich, and once you\u2019ve mastered the approach, there are many variations on the theme. My friend, the fabulous chef Laura Jackson, who co-owns the lovely canal-side Towpath cafe in east London, makes an especially delicious stew with braised courgettes, white beans and saffron that she serves with minty creme fraiche. The pilaf, meanwhile, is loosely based on a recipe from one of the gorgeous Moro cookbooks that I\u2019ve been making for years. I like to serve this with a bowl of seasoned yoghurt. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 15 min Serves 4 3 tbsp light olive oil 30g butter 4 courgettes (500g), washed, trimmed and cut into 1cm-thick coins (if they are fat, cut them in half lengthwise first) Sea salt and black pepper 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed or finely grated A few soft herb leaves \u2013 mint, basil or oregano (optional) Seasoned yoghurt, to serve (optional) For the pilaf 20g butter 2 tbsp light olive oil 4 spring onions, lightly trimmed and sliced 1 tsp chilli flakes 200g bulgur wheat 300ml vegetable stock A squeeze of lemon 1 small handful parsley, roughly chopped In a large pan for which you have a lid, heat the light olive oil and butter, add the courgettes and a generous dose of salt, and leave them to come up to a good heat, shaking the pan from time to time. When they start sizzling, turn down the heat, stir in the garlic, cover and leave to cook gently for 20-30 minutes, until the courgettes are collapsing \u2013 check on them every now and again, and give them a stir and a squish. Take off the lid, turn up the heat a little and cook to reduce the liquid that will have accumulated in the pan \u2013 you\u2019re after a thick, spoonable consistency. Season to taste, cover again and leave to sit on a very low heat until the pilaf is ready \u2013 the courgettes will sit happily for ages. For the pilaf, melt the butter and oil on a medium heat, add the spring onions and chilli flakes, and soften, stirring regularly, for five minutes. Add the bulgur and a generous pinch of salt, stir to coat, then add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan, leave to simmer for five minutes, then stir thoroughly to make sure nothing\u2019s sticking to the bottom of the pan. Turn down the heat to low, cover and cook for five minutes more. Stir in the lemon juice and parsley, season to taste, then take off the heat and leave to rest for five minutes. Stir the soft herbs into the courgettes. Spoon the pilaf on to warmed plates, top with the courgettes and serve with some seasoned yoghurt, if using. Courgette-stuffed bread These very simple breads can be cooked in a frying pan as well as in the oven, as here \u2013 I usually bake them, though, so I can go and do other things while they\u2019re cooking. Serve with a salad and some chutney to cut through the cheesy goodness. Prep 10 min Steep 1 hr Cook 50 min Serves 4 2 large courgettes, trimmed and coarsely grated (about 380g) 1 large red onion, peeled and finely sliced Sea salt and black pepper About 150g yoghurt 360g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed or finely grated 1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and finely diced (optional) 150g hard cheese, coarsely grated \u2013 whatever suits your tastes and pocket 1 tbsp light olive oil Put the courgettes and onion in a bowl, add a good pinch of salt and toss to combine. Set a colander over another bowl, tip in the courgette mix and press it down to squeeze out some of the liquid. Cover the courgettes with a clean cloth, weigh down with some tins or a heavy pan, then leave to drip away for an hour or so \u2013 this liquid will later be used in the flatbreads. Measure out the liquid in the bowl \u2013 you should have about 100ml or so. Add water to top it up to 200ml, then stir in the yoghurt and set aside. Put the flour in a bowl, make a well in the centre, add most of the courgette liquid and yoghurt mix, and use your hands to work the mix until it comes together into a shaggy dough; if need be, add the rest of the liquid. Turn out on to a lightly floured surface, knead until smooth, divide into four and roll into balls. Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)/450F/gas 8 and put in two large oven trays. Meanwhile, mix the grated courgette mixture with the garlic, chilli and cheese, and season to taste. Using your hands or a rolling pin, roll out one ball on a floured worktop into a 1cm-thick circle and spoon a quarter of the courgette mix into the centre. Gently gather the edges, bring them up and over the filling to cover it completely, then pinch all around to seal very well. Flour the worktop and your hands, then press out each bread into a flat, 2\u00bdcm-deep disc: the top will be thinner than the bottom, so don\u2019t worry if any small holes appear or there is a little seepage. Drizzle some olive oil on to the heated baking sheets and lay two breads on each tray. Drizzle each bread with some more oil and bake for about 25-30 minutes, until golden.

We much preferred to be out exploring a city. But we\u2019d just done a big tour of Europe, had been away for weeks, and were feeling really homesick. We\u2019d ended in Germany: it was the last show of the tour, about four in the afternoon, and it was pissing down with rain. Paul came up with the riff from nowhere, and immediately I started humming the verse. It was weird \u2013 this has only happened two or three times in our whole career \u2013 but within 20 minutes we\u2019d got the arrangement and most of the lyrics. I remember that when we played around with it in the soundcheck, our crew stopped what they were doing and just listened. We knew it was a winner. We recorded it quickly and made a pretty ropey video. The original idea was to film on a real train, but in the end they built a wooden carriage in a warehouse. It looks as if I\u2019m walking through all these different carriages \u2013 in reality I was just walking through the same one over and over. Someone stood outside spinning a light round on a pole to make it look as if the train was moving, passing places. We rush-released the single at the end of the year, which meant we were the only act in 1996 to have five Top 40 singles. The downside was that it got a bit lost in the Christmas rush and only went to No 17. If we\u2019d have released it even a couple of weeks earlier, I think it would have been Top 5, but over the years it\u2019s become the song that people most connect with. It\u2019s about disappointment and wanting what you can\u2019t have \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve been chasing rainbows all my life\u201d \u2013 which obviously everyone can relate to. Now it ends all our gigs. It\u2019s such a great feeling when people leave and are still singing it down the street. Paul Banks, guitar, songwriter I\u2019m pretty sure we were playing the Luxor in Cologne. That clip in the recent film Get Back, where Paul McCartney spontaneously comes up with the title song in a few minutes, totally takes me back, because that\u2019s what writing Chasing Rainbows felt like. Normally on the bus, we\u2019d have had the PlayStation on, but I picked up my guitar and started strumming without really knowing what I was playing. It was subconscious: I just started playing the riff. My left arm got broken when I was a kid and never set right, so I\u2019ve got limited rotation. Because of that, I\u2019ve never been able to play barre chords, but someone had showed me these minor barre chords lower down the guitar, and Chasing Rainbows starts with one of those. In the space of an hour, we went from Rick and me coming up with the verse, bridge, lyrics and chorus to playing the song in soundcheck. I\u2019m pretty sure we put it in the setlist for the gig that night. Then, as soon as we got home to York, we did a demo and sent it to the record company. Going for Gold had been a big hit for us, so the label wanted to get us straight back into the studio with Chris Sheldon producing. The single\u2019s sleeve featured a man standing outside a bingo hall in London with some flowers, looking as if he\u2019d been stood up. For the song\u2019s 25th anniversary, we did a new mix and put something on Twitter asking if anyone knew the guy on the sleeve. This woman replied and said: \u201cIt\u2019s my husband!\u201d Then he got in touch. In the 90s, he\u2019d kept a diary, and still had the details of the original location on Kennington Road in London. We recreated the sleeve with him still stood outside the same building, same suit, same pose, flowers, 25 years later. It\u2019s a Tesco Express now. \u2022 Shed Seven play the Picturedrome, Holmfirth on 11 August and headline Party at the Palace, Linlithgow, on 12 August.

When the farm was liberated, the carcasses covered the land as far as you could see. Those that were not blown up or gunned down starved. They were so hungry, they ate each other\u2019s tails. The survivors standing at the trough in one of the farm\u2019s wrecked sheds have stubs where their tails once were. \u201cThe cows are terrified after what they went through,\u201d said Serhii Vorobyov, the farm\u2019s deputy manager. \u201cThey are just like soldiers who\u2019ve been on the frontline. They are scared if you just go near them.\u201d The surviving farm workers in this village near Balakliia, in Kharkiv oblast, are every bit as damaged. When the Russians \u2013 a motorised rifle regiment all the way from Kaliningrad and another from just across the border in Valuiki \u2013 first took over the farm on 3 March last year, relations between occupiers and occupied were initially terse but civil. All that changed after the Russians took heavy losses in an engagement with Ukrainian forces. \u201cThey looked like the same people but they behaved totally differently. You can see madness in their eyes,\u201d said Yurii Vovchenko, the farm manager. \u201cThey were shooting at people on the streets, yelling and screaming, so people were scared and stayed at home after that.\u201d The Russian soldiers, most of them teenagers, invited some of the farm workers to milk the cows, and six of the labourers never returned. Their remains have not yet been found. The Russians are long gone, but the occupation continues to hobble the Husarivka farm. The buildings are wrecked and the land is sown with mines. Until the devices are cleared, crops cannot be planted and the 230 surviving cattle cannot be put out to pasture. The Kharkiv regional mine-clearing team helped to screen the buildings and courtyards, but they and the international organisations supporting them are stretched far too thin to clear everyone\u2019s farmland this spring. The area of Ukraine exposed to conflict and therefore potentially mined is up to 25m hectares, the size of the UK. The Halo Trust, a landmine clearance charity, says Ukraine faces \u201cthe heaviest landmine contamination the world has seen since the second world war\u201d. The Ukrainian government is starting to decontaminate the territory it controls even as it conducts a counteroffensive aimed at liberating the rest. \u201cThe government of Ukraine plans to return over 470,000 hectares of the most valuable agricultural land to productive use within four years,\u201d said Yulia Svyrydenko, the economy minister. \u201cOur plan is to survey, clear and return to use most of all potentially contaminated areas within 10 years.\u201d Kyiv and the Halo Trust and other charities are pressing for mine clearance to be at the centre of the Ukraine recovery conference, which begins in London on Wednesday, as the first step in restoring the agricultural sector. \u201cThe Ukraine recovery conference must signal the start of an unprecedented effort to restore an industry that feeds the rest of the world,\u201d said James Cowan, Halo\u2019s CEO. Halo has 800 Ukrainian staff working on demining, a figure expected to double next year, but by Ukrainian law they are not allowed to remove and destroy mines themselves. They can only map them and mark their location, a limitation that has slowed clearance. An administrative fix is being worked on, but Vovchenko cannot wait for conferences and legal reform. The government is already demanding taxes and the landowners are expecting rent each month. \u201cI have two choices: to go bankrupt and become a homeless person, or I can survive and do something about it,\u201d he said. Vovchenko and his workers are clearing their land themselves. They start off by dragging a long rope across each field to trigger any tripwires and then they walk across the land finding mines, unscrewing the detonators and stacking them up. He said they had found thousands, and he showed recent photos of piles of anti-tank mines in one of his trucks. They have been lucky so far that none of the mines have been booby-trapped. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of anti-lift devices, a lot of booby traps and two or three mines being placed on top of each other deliberately,\u201d said Mike Newton, who runs the Halo Trust regional headquarters. \u201cBut as you\u2019ve seen, farmers just can\u2019t wait, and we completely sympathise with that. People just need to get out and make a living, and they do that in the most incredible circumstances and there\u2019s a great degree of innovation.\u201d Modern mine-clearing technology is beginning to arrive in Ukraine. On the outskirts of Izium, not far from Husarivka farm, a Croatian-made robot mine-clearer the size of a large bulldozer is being used by the regional emergency services to clear land under damaged electricity pylons so that repair work can begin. It will be months until that work is completed. Meanwhile, some local farmers have made low-budget approximations of the commercial robots. At Oleksandr Kryvtsun\u2019s farm at Hrakove, about 40 miles north of Izium, the workers have welded bits of an abandoned Russian tank and armoured car on to an old tractor and its harrow and then wired it up to a battery-powered remote controller. The resulting machine looks like it belongs in a Mad Max film. The operator sits at a safe distance in the scoop of a bulldozer made comfortable with a wooden crate and some cushions and works the remote control panel, running the tractor up and down the fields, triggering mines. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t wait to start planting so we took means into our own hands. We saw how the foreign machines looked and made something similar with our hands,\u201d Kryvtsun said. It took about two months to perfect. They have since made similar contraptions for five other farmers nearby and now have a line of customers for their machines. \u201cCircumstances make us innovators,\u201d he said. \u201cThey push us to think in new ways.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a09", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/chelsea-fans-oppose-sponsorship-deal-online-casino", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chelsea fans voice opposition to sponsorship deal with online casino", "lead": "Chelsea fans have expressed overwhelming opposition to shirt sponsorship from an online casino after a deal with Paramount+ was blocked", "author": "Sean Ingle", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:45:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176497", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d6122c95c7e7968ac5000a067447c084bd36f509/0_103_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Chelsea supporters have expressed overwhelming opposition to a proposed shirt sponsorship with an online casino that hails itself as a \u201cworldwide leader in crypto gambling\u201d.

All three have revealed a fine understanding of the complexities of Strauss\u2019s music and dramaturgy. His Ariadne, however, is more radical than its predecessors, a considered, if at times drastic rethink of an ambivalent even problematic work. Ravella strips the opera of its familiar associations with the baroque, either in the original 18th-century setting or the ornate profusion that most directors bring to it. In their place is something altogether more stark and austere. Designer Giles Cadle\u2019s simple set of staircases and platforms initially frame the backstage doors and rooms for the Prologue, but are later transformed by Malcolm Rippeth\u2019s lighting into a disquieting, Escher-type labyrinth \u2013 Naxos as an island of the mind where Natalya Romaniw\u2019s Ariadne is effectively imprisoned by her own loneliness. Costumes, meanwhile, suggest the 1950s, with Romaniw in a plain pink dress and her attendants in green, while Polly Leech\u2019s Composer and Young Woo Kim\u2019s Bacchus both wear suits. The absence of fussiness allows Ravella to dispense with various directorial tropes that have crept in over the years. Not having the stage awash with extras in the Prologue leaves us free to concentrate on narrative, psychology and the all important interplay of ideas. There\u2019s no attempt in the second half to suggest any sort of development of the relationship between Leech and Jennifer France\u2019s Zerbinetta, which is left unresolved, as it should be, by the time we reach the interval. And the final apotheosis, achieved by the sparsest of means, is breathtaking. There are flaws, though. The harlequinade is po-faced and unfunny. And I\u2019m not convinced that Zerbinetta\u2019s Grossm\u00e4chtige Prinzessin is really about the levels of vulnerability and anger that Ravella has France bring to it here. But it\u2019s a fascinating piece of theatre, and the best of it is beautiful indeed. The theatrical sparseness also means that music and emotion really hit home. Romaniw is an outstanding Ariadne, singing with great depth of feeling and an extraordinary richness of tone over the role\u2019s wide range, her low notes as sumptuous as her upper register is thrilling. France, in her second UK Zerbinetta this year, is also excellent, her coloratura wonderfully accurate and gleaming. Kim ducked one tricky high note on opening night, but otherwise sang handsomely with a telling, subtle use of dynamics. Leech\u2019s Composer is bright-voiced, passionate and superbly acted. In the pit, the Philharmonia play quite wonderfully for Mark Wigglesworth, whose conducting is remarkable in its finesse, intensity and emotional depth. \u2022 Ariadne auf Naxos is at Garsington Opera until 21 July."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a0b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/19/life-is-more-important-than-art-thats-why-art-is-important-review-whitechapel-gallery-london", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Life Is More Important Than Art review \u2013 banality turns into poetry", "lead": "From snaps of car parks and train platforms to an operatic film showing people arriving at an airport, this show reveals that art is a particular way of looking at life", "author": "Jonathan Jones", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:38:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176533", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fe67c947be22379a7888cd97534e68084d618226/0_51_939_563/500.png", "body": "Nearly 50 years ago, a young artist called John Smith took his camera to a street in Dalston, London, to film people going about their lives. Except that he pretended to construct and author this raw slice of reality. Over the black and white footage you hear Smith barking out commands like a director. \u201cI want the man in the white boiler suit to come in from the left!\u201d It\u2019s funny and thought-provoking: what is is art, if not a moment in which we frame all the stuff going on in the world, and see it as if we were part of a vast fiction? Smith\u2019s work forms part of the first exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London under its new director, Gilane Tawadros. It\u2019s a promisingly quirky, adventurous start by her, that challenges you to wonder what the difference between art and life is, if any. This is not exactly a new question. But it is asked here in a daring way that risks utter banality to unlock poetry. Smith\u2019s 1976 conceptual art masterpiece The Girl Chewing Gum is its keynote, a British punk version of French New Wave cinema that suggests art is life, and life only. The parody directorial voice becomes increasingly deranged: a young man walking by in a rain coat has just robbed a bank and has a gun in his pocket. Then the kids in the cinema queue notice the camera and start looking at it, curious, amused and self-conscious. A moment of truth that transcends invention. It\u2019s lovely. Much in the exhibition turns a direct mirror to the streets outside, in almost unmediated images of British urban life right now. Playing a similar game to Smith, Mitra Tabrizian\u2019s Film Stills invite you to find a narrative in apparently chaotic, random photos of lockups and parked cars. Yet the depth of this show lies in seeing inwards, understanding that as we pass by each other, our memories and desires brush the air like ghostly shadows. Alia Syed crosses that border between outer existence and inner consciousness in her film Fatima\u2019s Letter: against fleeting monochrome images of platforms and trains, we hear fragmented memories of migration and lost worlds, lost connections. That same sense of the infinite mystery hidden in the daily grind is given transcendent form by the classic of contemporary art that concludes this exhibition. Mark Wallinger\u2019s Threshold to the Kingdom may be familiar to some but seeing it again makes you startled at how such a simple idea can be so profound. Wallinger fixes his camera on people coming out of the arrivals gate at an airport. Their smiles and the hugs of waiting friends, or their anxious, isolated faces, or confident strides, are shown in slow motion, lifesize, approaching you directly. Allegri\u2019s Miserere plays majestically. And it is like seeing people enter heaven, a scene from a Last Judgment altarpiece, a canto written by Dante: so much poetry, taken from completely real, ordinary moments in modern lives. It makes the exhibition\u2019s point perfectly: art is just looking, in a certain way, at life. There are good works aplenty, but the discovery here is the radical veteran John Smith. In 2020 Smith started filming over the rooftops from his window in the London borough of Hackney. There\u2019s so much mist and snow in the opening shot that you can only see a white blankness above the houses. When that clears, the glass towers of the City loom and we hear Boris Johnson in the early weeks of 2020 talking dismissively about coronavirus. As the days pass his pronouncements get more alarmed. Smith carries on filming, spying on his neighbours as they move around their homes in lockdown. While Downing Street partied. It\u2019s almost too real. Often, art is an escape \u2013 or at least a way of sublimating the mess of life, like Smith pretending to \u201cdirect\u201d it in his early film. This exhibition wonders what it would be like if art was as true, as unvarnished, as a piece of chewing gum on asphalt. Refreshing, is the answer.

Liu Jianchao, the head of the international department of the Communist party of China central committee, is due to speak at the Chatham House thinktank and meet UK parliamentarians. Victims of China\u2019s transnational extraditions and their families are exploring if it is possible to make an application for Liu\u2019s arrest at Westminster magistrates court on the basis he is accused of international crimes. The peers and MPs say they are appalled at the visit and question how someone such as Liu could have been given a visa. The group, including Sarah Champion, the chair of the international development select committee, Lord Alton, the Conservative MP Tim Loughton and the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, say that between 2015 and 2017 Liu had ultimate command for thousands of so-called international fugitive recovery operations and the irregular methods employed by the Chinese government to bring them back to China. The criticism is part of a wider battle between some parliamentarians and ministers over a perceived new willingness by ministers to avoid confrontations over Chinese repression in an effort to improve wider relations with Beijing. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has been at odds with some MPs who have accused him of going soft on China in recent months. Cleverly is due to visit Beijing later this year, but is struggling to manage angry backbenchers. The group of British parliamentarians cites a submission written by the NGO Safeguard Defenders that says Liu, as director of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\u2019s (CCDI) International Cooperation Bureau, had direct command of and responsibility for thousands of international fugitive recovery operations. The recovery operation was presented as a drive against corrupt officials who had fled abroad and needed to be extradited to face charges. But Safeguard Defenders says this was not the case and the operations targeted opponents of the regime. Laura Harth, the Safeguard Defenders campaign director, said \u201cthe \u2018persuasion to return\u2019 operations account for the vast majority of successful fugitive returns and flaunted those individuals\u2019 as well as their families\u2019 rights to a legal defence and fair trial\u201d. In a 21-page dossier, she claims the \u201cmethods employed institute a wanton climate of fear within overseas diaspora communities, aimed at silencing dissent and accounts of gross human rights violations inside China\u201d. The report claims Liu was the co-author of \u201cthe special investigative mechanism of liuzhi, a system of incommunicado detention firmly outside the bounds of any judicial overview, that institutionalizes enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture for investigative purposes by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\u201d. The report estimates that more than 9,000 Chinese fugitives or exiles have been extracted from abroad. The group, coordinated by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, acknowledges in its letter that diplomacy requires meeting people with whom one disagrees, and that the visit has not been sponsored by the UK government but they say \u201ca line is crossed when someone with his human rights background is afforded such a platform\u201d. The letter says \u201cLiu himself, when speaking of the system of \u2018liuzhi\u2019 which he helped design \u2013 consisting of enforced disappearances, incommunicado detention and torture \u2013 said: \u2018These are not criminal or judicial arrests and they are more effective.\u2019\u201d The report estimates approximately up to 70 people are put into Iiuzhi every day. As secretary of the Zhejiang CCDI, Liu Jianchao had command responsibility over the use of the system in Zhejiang province between 2017 and 2018. As a member of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and a member of the 20th party central committee, he continues to bear oversight responsibility for the implementation of the measure nationwide."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a0d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/19/sir-michael-hopkins-portcullis-house-lords-mound-stand-architect-dies", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sir Michael Hopkins, Portcullis House and Mound Stand architect, dies aged 88", "lead": "Hopkins was part of vanguard of \u2018hi-tech\u2019 architects who dominated building design in UK and beyond", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:31:17", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176569", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2276a49b11a9ce8b655c2805de7a52daa4b015c6/0_340_4789_2875/500.png", "body": "Sir Michael Hopkins, one of the leading British architects of his era, has died leaving behind a built legacy including Portcullis House at the Palace of Westminster, the Mound Stand at Lord\u2019s cricket ground and the Jubilee campus at Nottingham University. His wife, Patty Hopkins, with whom he formed Hopkins Architects in 1976, said he had \u201cdied peacefully at the age of 88, surrounded by his family\u201d. Alongside Richard Rogers, who died last December, Norman Foster and Nicholas Grimshaw, Hopkins became part of a vanguard of \u201chi-tech\u201d London-based architects who from the 1980s and into the 2000s dominated building design in Britain and beyond. He and Lady Hopkins won the Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1994, he was elected a Royal Academician in 1992 and knighted for services to architecture in 1995. Michael Taylor, the current principal of Hopkins Architects, described Hopkins as \u201cbrilliant in his analysis and fearlessly creative in his designing\u201d. He said Hopkins approached building design by first \u201cestablishing a sense of place, about how to make historic connections, how to put the materials together in an honest and contemporary way so that the building would appear calm and make immediate sense to the end user\u201d. Lady Hopkins said: \u201cMichael was obsessive about architecture and tenacious in refining a design until he was absolutely satisfied with it. He was usually (and annoyingly) right. He made the world \u2013 and the buildings so many people live, work and learn in \u2013 more beautiful. We will miss him more than we can imagine.\u201d The couple first met at the Architectural Association, a school for architecture in London, and started their partnership in the 70s with commissions including their own house in Hampstead, a glass and steel structure that quickly became a case study of the pared-backed aesthetic of the hi-tech movement. It was also the family home, where the couple brought up their three children. It was open plan, but when the children became teenagers they demanded their bedrooms get walls. By the 1980s they discovered brick, after being asked to rebuild the Mound Stand for Marylebone Cricket Club, which included Victorian brick arches. They went on to use the material for a new opera house at Glyndebourne and used stone amply at Portcullis House. Meanwhile, Rogers and Foster, who had worked with Hopkins on the celebrated Willis Faber and Dumas building at Ipswich, pressed on with steel and glass. When lottery money for public architectural commissions started to flow around the turn of the millennium, Hopkins Architects built the Forum, a new covered public space in Norwich. The commission for Portcullis House led them into one of the most controversial building projects of its era. The soaring \u00a3235m cost for the MPs offices, which opened in 2001, grabbed public attention. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on indoor fig trees, recently felled. The Guardian\u2019s critic at the time of opening complained its robust appearance meant it \u201clooks across to the Palace of Westminster like a podgy, old-time pugilist might, squaring up to its well-mannered Victorian partner and sniffing: \u2018Come on then, wanna fight?\u2019\u201d But the building has become increasingly well-loved, with a huge atrium where MPs mingle with lobbyists over coffee and lunch, and handsome committee rooms where everyone from Rupert Murdoch to Boris Johnson has been grilled. The concrete cathedral of Westminster tube station below was also designed by Hopkins Architects, as part of the architecturally ambitious Jubilee line extension, with architects such as Will Alsop, Foster, Ian Ritchie and Richard MacCormac picked to design distinctive stations as the line headed east towards Canary Wharf. The Hopkins partnership was also known for 1985\u2019s Schlumberger Cambridge Research Centre with a tent-like roof that would be echoed at Lord\u2019s, the Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Evelina Children\u2019s hospital, which opened in 2005 and was a rare example of a new NHS building at that time that was not built under the private finance initiative that was known for sidelining the contribution of architects. Hopkins was born in 1935 in Poole, Dorset, to a builder father and a mother who decided when he was 12 that he would be an architect. He is survived by his wife, three children and 11 grandchildren. His family said that in his final years he had lived with vascular dementia."}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a0e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/19/the-big-idea-will-ai-make-us-stupid", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The big idea: Will AI make us stupid?", "lead": "There may be an unexpected upside to machines taking on more of our mental tasks", "author": "Simon Winchester", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:30:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176586", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f0fd62e6e27028303b44694c05c2db52be5183fc/0_51_1847_1108/500.jpg", "body": "Modern historians count 1967 as an especially busy year: the six\u2011day war, the summer of love, Sgt Pepper, the first recorded deaths of American astronauts, the founding of the suburban utopia of Milton Keynes. And also, half-forgotten in the crush, perhaps the most consequential event of all: the invention of the first device ever that permitted us to henceforward stop using a part of our brains. A young Dallas engineer named Jerry Merryman and his team gave us, courtesy of his employers, Texas Instruments, the Cal-Tech electronic calculator. For $400 you could own a shirt-pocket-sized plastic box with buttons and symbols that, if pressed, would answer in an instant, and with impeccable accuracy, any simple arithmetical question you might ask it. And most important, it performed its work invisibly. The abacus and the slide rule might have been mental labour-saving devices, but they still required you to make some use of your grey matter; the Cal-Tech freed you up entirely, removing all mathematical tedium from your daily life. It was semiconductors and algorithms that helped make Merryman\u2019s magic, and for the 60 years since, and in the hands of other similarly blessed engineers, they have continued to do so, relentlessly. Their gifts have been all we might ever have wished for. Our brains can now relax. Whatever cerebral nooks and crannies we employed, for instance, to read paper maps, or to use sextants and compasses and chronometers to find out where we were, have now been put into cold storage: GPS has given us all the direction we might ever need. Not sure how to spell a word or how best to compose a sentence? From the 1980s onward there has been no urgent further need for an OED or a copy of Fowler\u2019s Modern English Usage: Commodore\u2019s WordCheck and its successors have such matters taken care of. And after the presentation in April 1998 at a conference in Brisbane by two (now very rich) young Americans named Page and Brin, of their paper The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine, we had Google, which, for the past quarter-century, has been able to answer all our questions about just about anything in microseconds. OpenAI is currently inventing even more advanced things that promise to blow out of the water whatever still remains of the requirement to do mental work. This has in recent months led to widespread hand-wringing. Our minds, it is said, will inevitably fall out of use, atrophying, or distending, whichever is worse. The nightmare model \u2013 for our bodies \u2013 is a movie like Wall-E, that dystopian vision from 2008 in which humans, having abandoned their polluted and garbage-choked world, live out their lives in cocoons suspended in suborbital space. Here they have evolved into flaccid slobs, marooned in recliners, fed on high-calorie mush from squeeze-packs while gazing glassily at telescreens. So now there comes a similarly dire vision for our minds. With machines doing all our daily mental tasks for us, our brains will become literally thoughtless, our minds a haven for endless daydreaming. We will become spiritually moribund. As inherent knowledge vanishes, no longer much needed since it is now always on tap at the slightest brush of a touch-glass surface, the concept of human wisdom, which is after all a mix of knowledge and experience, will evaporate. Society will slowly flounder and decay, body, mind and soul. This is one vision of our future doom. But I am not a doomsayer \u2013 not so far as our minds are concerned, at least. I challenge the notion that all is now going to intellectual hell. Rather I see ample reason for optimism. And I draw this hope from the sextet of Ancient Greeks who laid the foundations for and defined the very idea of knowledge: Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus and Euclid. These figures, rightly revered and sanctified by time, had minds essentially little different from the finest of our own today \u2013 except in one important respect: there was, in the centuries in which these men lived, so much less for them to know. Karl Popper\u2019s droll and much-quoted remark that \u201cknowledge is finite but ignorance is infinite\u201d is objectively true, of course \u2013 and yet the amount of knowledge in our contemporary mental universe is immeasurably more vast than that in which the intellectual elite of classical times existed. These six and their like travelled little (Aristotle excepted), existing in a world necessarily circumscribed by so little known geography, by very much less history, by the existence of so little written prior description. Their minds, though steeped in the totality of contemporary knowledge, were thus almost tabulae rasae \u2013 nearly empty, ready to take it all in, ready to think, primed for purpose. Which is why our modern minds, once they have been purged of all that today\u2019s algorithms might now deem unnecessary information, will be as ready as theirs were to think, to inquire, to wonder, to contemplate, to imagine, to create. So I see today\u2019s algorithmic revolution as a necessary cleansing, a movement by which we rid ourselves of all the accumulated bricolage of modern intellectual life, returning us to a more reasonable sound-to-noise ratio, gifting us with a renewed innocence, filled with potential. Fanciful though it may sound, this new-made post-AI society could even see the emergence of a new Euclid, a new Plato, a new Herodotus. Such figures may now be waiting in the wings, ready to rise from the ashes of whoever created Milton Keynes, maybe to write us a new edition of the Ethics, or teach us afresh the true worth of human happiness, as Aristotle did so impeccably, 2,500 years ago. If that is the true benefit of clearing our minds of the busywork that is perhaps best left to electronic others, then I can hardly wait. \u2022 Simon Winchester is the author of Knowing What We Know: The Transmission of Knowledge \u2013 from Ancient Wisdom to Modern Magic (HarperCollins).

From inauspicious beginnings in Glasgow \u2013 their debut album Tigermilk was assisted by a Scottish welfare programme for unemployed musicians \u2013 to Brit awards, cruise-ship festivals and the Hollywood Bowl, Belle and Sebastian have brought a fair amount of razzle-dazzle to music that is often (rather inaccurately) thought of as meek and retiring: \u201csad bastard music\u201d, as Jack Black\u2019s character in High Fidelity had it.

A wealth tax on the fortunes of the world\u2019s richest people would raise trillions of dollars that could be spent on helping poorer countries shift their economies to a low-carbon footing, and on \u201closs and damage\u201d, the rescue and rehabilitation of countries stricken by climate disaster. A 2% tax on extreme wealth would yield about $2.5tn a year, by recent estimates. The economists, including the prominent degrowth advocate Jason Hickel, have written a letter to world leaders before a global summit on finance this week. They are calling for a tax of 1.5% for 1.5C to help ensure the world limits global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world\u2019s wealthiest people are responsible for an outsize proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with the richest 1% responsible for double the carbon emissions of the world\u2019s poorest half, according to Oxfam, but there are few constraints on them. Recent research suggests if the combined emissions of wealthy countries was counted against the destruction that the climate crisis is wreaking in poorer countries, the rich would owe the poor $6tn a year in \u201creparations\u201d for the damage caused. Mark Paul, of Rutgers University, and a signatory of the letter, which was spearheaded by the campaigning group Oil Change International, said rich countries were not facing up to their responsibilities. \u201cGlobal north leaders saying they can\u2019t afford to address global crises is the oldest excuse in the book, and simply put, a lie. What\u2019s truly unaffordable is the status quo. The truth is there is no shortage of public money that can be dedicated to the cause, only a lack of political will \u2013 but that must change.\u201d In the letter, the economists also call for an end to harmful subsidies of fossil fuels, and the forgiveness of debts for some of the poorest countries. Alex Lenferna, of Nelson Mandela University and the Climate Justice Coalition, one of the signatories of the letter, said: \u201cCountries in the global south are drowning in debt, which is driving austerity and undermining our ability to respond to the climate crisis. \u201cWe need much more public money to drive a truly just transition. The global north must pay their climate debt, and not use climate finance as a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing that advances their interests.\u201d Richard Heede, of the Climate Accountability Institute, said fossil fuel companies must pay for the damage they have caused. \u201cThe wealthy fossil fuel companies that have acted in concert to delay action and perpetuate the carbon economy should also contribute substantially to an atmospheric trust to aid the nations and peoples who have contributed little to the climate emergency.\u201d About 50 heads of state and government are expected to attend the summit for a new global financing pact, which will be held in Paris on Thursday and Friday, hosted by the French president Emmanuel Macron, with Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados. It is intended to address the deep concerns that developing countries have over the continuing lack of the financial assistance that has long been promised to them by richer countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. Leaders including Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, are expected to attend. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, is unlikely to attend the meeting, however. Climate finance is an increasingly contentious issue for poorer countries, which are aggrieved that the richer countries are helping Ukraine, and found trillions to cope with Covid, but are unwilling to help them with the impacts of the climate crisis. In November governments agreed to set up a fund for \u201closs and damage\u201d, to help reconstruct communities afflicted by climate disaster. But there is no agreement yet on how to raise the money needed to fill it. Poorer countries also find it hard to access money for green development of their economies, despite being urged by richer countries to cut their emissions. Mottley has set out her proposals for reform of the World Bank and its fellow international institutions to triple the money they can make available to developing countries. The conference will also discuss potential new sources of revenue such as taxes on high-carbon activities, including global shipping. Avinash Persaud, an economic adviser to Mottley, told the Guardian: \u201cWe need a complete rethink of the whole nexus of climate, debt and development. What we are seeing today is new \u2013 countries affected by climate disaster, this is happening now. Countries are drowning.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c9251ac331c00331a12", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/australias-shadow-economy-leeches-124bn-from-tax-revenue-amid-treasurys-failure-to-crack-down", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia\u2019s shadow economy leeches $12.4bn from tax revenue amid Treasury\u2019s failure to crack down", "lead": "Auditor general\u2019s report says bid to tackle cash-in-hand work and tax avoidance measures haven\u2019t worked", "author": "Tory Shepherd", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:39:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:50.176654", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9f500b2bec5f9e2664e96c72c8bb2cf2e7191500/0_29_6048_3627/500.jpg", "body": "Treasury has failed to effectively tackle the shadow economy, which leeches $12.4bn in tax from Australia, and \u201cpaused\u201d work on it during the Covid pandemic, an auditor general\u2019s report has found.

It can hurt individuals by exposing them to workplace exploitation, as well as potentially penalise those doing the right thing \u201cby creating an uneven playing field\u201d. The government set up a shadow economy taskforce and its 2017 recommendations included cracking down on cash-in-hand work, the gig economy and tax avoidance measures. More than $900m was put towards implementing its recommendations, including $12.3m to Treasury. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Coalition government at the time agreed to 27 of taskforce\u2019s 80 recommendations. Of the recommendations the Coalition agreed to, 44% \u2013 or 12 \u2013 have been fulfilled. The auditor general examined the performance of the Australian Taxation Office, Treasury and the home affairs department in implementing those recommendations.

The auditor general found problems including that records of key decisions were not always documented, or \u201cdid not allow for transparency and accountability\u201d. Treasury had poor information management and a lack of clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities, and \u201cdid not set out a clear plan of action\u201d. The department\u2019s executive board agreed to pause work on the shadow economy at the start of the Covid pandemic. The ANAO noted that as of February this year there had been no updates to the government since June 2021. The ANAO recommended improved policies and procedures, better reporting to government, efficiency measures to use resources efficiently, and further work on the taskforce recommendations. In response, Treasury said it agreed with the ANAO\u2019s recommendations and was \u201ccommitted to addressing the findings of the report\u201d. It said resources were reprioritised to support the government\u2019s management of the Covid pandemic but that it would continue to work on its approach. On the other hand, the ATO and home affairs were \u201clargely effective\u201d, the report found."}]
