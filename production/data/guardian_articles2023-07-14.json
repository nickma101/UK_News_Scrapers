To think they once came to the Tour with Armstrong, Contador, Kl\u00f6den and Leipheimer. (yeah, I know) \u201cThey were by far the worst performing World Tour team in 2022 as well, but due to the UCI\u2019s \u2018interesting\u2019 point system and relegation procedures they are stuck at the top level until 2025. \u201cThis perhaps sounds cynical, but of all the teams certain to be at next year\u2019s Tour, only Astana probably have no other cards to play for publicity and relevance than Cavendish\u2019s attempt on the record. Whether this is the right reason for the Manxman to stick with them is up to him.\u201d 105km to go: UAE Team Emirates have taken up the chase on the front of the peloton, which suggests they do want to control this \u2026 but the gap is growing, now out to 1min 19sec. 107km to go: The gap has flown out to 1min 04 sec: The riders in the front group are as follows: Bol, Petit, Mozzato, Charmig, Wright, Teunissen, Asgreen, Bettiol, Latour, Mohoric, Eenkhorn, Shaw, Pacher, Houle, Stuyven, Zimmerman, Oliveira, Van Gils, Kwiatkowski and Tejada. No one who is a threat on GC. 110km to go: All action! We\u2019ve now got 20 riders up front, and the gap has grown to 21sec. These kilometres are ticking away very quickly indeed \u2026 and we\u2019ve got a strong break up front that looks like it may make this stick. 113km to go: This is a fine effort by the four riders up top to get away \u2026 but the gap has dwindled to 10sec. Looks like this one will come back too. 115km to go: That previous group of six was shut down. Now it\u2019s Pacher, Van Gils, Oliveira and Teunissen out front, a group of four, and they have 13sec. 117km to go: One of the sports directors comes on the radio, saying that UAE Team Emirates have let it be known that they want to control the race today and go for the stage win. On commentary, Sean Kelly and Robbie McEwen poo-poo this idea. Neither believe UAE Team Emirates will expend the energy to control this. 119km to go: Cavagna (Soudal\u2013Quick-Step), Castroviejo and Fraile (Ineos Grenadiers), Cort (EF Education\u2013EasyPost), Wright (Bahrain Victorious) and Coquard (Cofidis) are the six up front. 121km to go: Six riders bust away from the clutches of the peloton once again. Is that Mohoric up there? I think it may be. Anyway six riders have five seconds on the bunch, but the bunch is still trying to shut all this silliness down. We\u2019re told the front group is moving at 56km/h. That\u2019s a spicy meatball! 122km to go: Cavagna, the Frenchman who hails from Clermont-Ferrand, has a crack off the front again. It is Bastille Day, after all. Not Metronomy Day or Friendly Fires Day. 124km to go: Pierre Latour (TotalEnergies) and Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X) are on the move up front. They have impressively built a lead of eight seconds over the chasing peloton. But chasing is the operative word: the main bunch aren\u2019t having any of this, and are trying their hardest to close it down \u2026 Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) is taking charge of the chase, and predictably given his ludicrous power, he shuts it down in double-quick time. All back together. 125km to go: You already know about today\u2019s climb. Stage 13\u2019s intermediate sprint comes at Hauteville-Lompnes, with 50.5km to race. It\u2019s on the way to the top of the long, but uncategorised ascent that comes as an hors d\u2019oeuvre for Grand Colombier. 128km to go: \u201cHuge day,\u201d emails Paul. \u201cBut why have the French declared a national holiday named after a middling but erudite indie synth band? Can any Francophile readers explain? Not knowing is driving me MAD but I\u2019ll wager that it\u2019s do with why we needed to leave the EU and that. I predict we will see Pogacar in yellow today (the colour, not the middling but erudite Swiss synth band).\u201d 129km to go: Cofidis up front now. There\u2019s a gaggle of riders up ahead of the peloton again. Again they are going to be reeled in. At this pace, we\u2019ll be faster than the fastest predicted stage finish, I\u2019d bet. 130km to go: EF Education\u2013EasyPost now have two riders up front trying to snap the elastic. \u201cGood afternoon!\u201d emails Bill. \u201cIt\u2019s France! It\u2019s Bastille Day! It\u2019s a big mountain finish! It\u2019s Thibaut\u2019s time! Pinot is going to get a huge stomp on, and the final climb is going to be thrilling heorics in the red all the way to the top. He will take a brilliantly emotional victory on his farewell Tour de France. \u201cIt will be marvellous.\u201d 132km to go: The situation is fluid up front \u2026 but now that latest attempt to break away is closed down and we are back together again. This isn\u2019t going to be a nice, relaxed start to the three looming days in the mountains, that\u2019s for sure. 134km to go: R\u00e9mi Cavagna (Soudal\u2013Quick-Step) now has a dart. There are four riders who have a few metres on the peloton. Biniam Girmay (Intermarch\u00e9\u2013Circus\u2013Wanty) gets across and swells the group. Six there now \u2026 but I fancy this is going to get pulled back as well. They only have a few metres and it\u2019s strung out at the front as the riders try to pull it back. 136km to go: That first attempt to break away is shut down. But more attacks come almost immediately. Mike Teunissen (Intermarch\u00e9\u2013Circus\u2013Wanty) is the next to have a bash. He springs out of the peloton on the left-hand side of the road. And several riders give chase. 137km to go: Victor Campanaerts is one of two Lotto Dstny riders up front, trying to form the breakaway. Three Uno-X men are giving chase. They are speeding along at 50km/h. And they\u2019re off. Lotto Dstny are on the attack. On the telly, there\u2019s a beautiful shot of the Alps looming in the far distance. Andrey Amador (EF Education\u2013EasyPost) needs a front wheel change following a puncture. Here we go then. The peloton are rolling along in the neutralised zone. 1.2km until they race. Jens Voigt believes the break has zero chance of survival today. I don\u2019t agree \u2013 and not just because Pogacar said UAE will be keeping their options open \u2026 As mentioned earlier, De Gendt won on this day in 2016, the same day that Chris Froome went for a jog on Mont Ventoux: On Eurosport, pundit Dan Lloyd points out that going really deep today may cost riders over the weekend: perhaps not tomorrow, but Sunday. Managing effort over the next three days is going to be so important. Now Vingegaard speaks, and is asked by Eurosport if this is a climb for Pogacar? \u201cYes, it suits him better. It\u2019s only one climb in the end. In that case we\u2019ll try to ride a bit defensively today. Are you going to leave everything to UAE? \u201cBasically, yes. \u201cI have the lightest options for today [bike and equipment]. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very hard climb. It\u2019s 17km. Especially the bottom of it is very hard. It\u2019s a hard climb to predict. In the bottom it\u2019s steeper \u2026 we\u2019ll see what plans everyone else has.\u201d He looks nervous, in my view, but that\u2019s only to be expected \u2026 Tadej Pogacar speaks to Eurosport, and is asked about how today may play out: \u201cA lot depends on the break \u2026 then we have to decide if we go for it, or we let go.\u201d Is Grand Colombier a good climb for him? \u201cI think yes, it suits me good. Three years ago was really nice memories. It would be nice to have it again. But today might be totally different than three years ago.\u201d And what did he think of Jumbo Visma\u2019s tactics yesterday? \u201cIt was a bit crazy. They really wanted to go for the break. It was strange to see. But for us, it was OK, we had a good day yesterday. We focus on ourselves, and do our own thing.\u201d The headline in GC is that Vingegaard leads Pogacar by 17sec. Top 10 before stage 13: Vingegaard 50hr 30min 23sec Pogacar +17sec Hindley +2min 40sec Rodriguez +4min 22sec Bilbao +4min 34sec A Yates +4min 39sec S Yates +4min 44sec Pidcock +5min 26sec Gaudu +6min 01sec Pinot +6min 33sec Mark Cavendish gives an update following his unfortunate departure from the race. He says his broken collarbone is slightly complicated by a previous injury \u2013 the one he sustained when he crashed in Harrogate in 2014. Anyway, aside from that, he sounds upbeat and thanks everyone who\u2019s sent him messages of support. It\u2019s been \u201cwicked\u201d, he says. One more next year \u2026 ? Any thoughts on today\u2019s stage? You can email me or tweet. Allez! Ion Izagirre mounted a superb lone breakaway yesterday to snaffle Cofidis\u2019s second stage win of this Tour. Here\u2019s Jeremy Whittle\u2019s report, kicking off with some \u201cHell yes, I\u2019m tough enough\u201d thoughts from Vingegaard on the looming battle with Pogacar on Grand Colombier: Chris Froome enjoyed some good times on Mont Ventoux, of course, but things are rather different now. Sylvan Adams, Israel-Premier Tech\u2019s owner, took the opportunity yesterday to point out that the four-times Tour winner has not provided value for money since signing for the team in 2020: Seven years ago today: everyone\u2019s favourite Belgian breakaway specialist, Thomas de Gendt, won the stage on Mont Ventoux. (Being pedantic, it wasn\u2019t \u201catop\u201d Mont Ventoux as the Lotto Dstny tweet states. The finish was at Chalet Reynard, I think, but certainly not atop the mountain as you can see from the photo.) It\u2019s the 14th of July \u2013 Bastille Day \u2013 a time for French pride and, perhaps, a French stage winner? Here\u2019s a picture of Tony Gallopin (Lidl-Trek) waving the flag, a proud Frenchman, but not the type of rider who will be in contention for today\u2019s win. Below that, a hint from the Tour\u2019s official Twitter that we may see an appearance from the Patrouille acrobatique de France. The omens could hardly be better for UAE Team Emirates today. In 2020, Tadej Pogacar won stage 15 atop Grand Colombier on a day that Egan Bernal\u2019s attempt to defend his title with Team Ineos disintegrated. Primoz Roglic (Jumbo-Visma) remained well placed for the overall win, or so it seemed before that fateful final time trial. Have you got much planned for this weekend? The Tour de France certainly has: three mountain stages, beginning today, that may even determine the overall winner. The race hits the Jura Mountains this afternoon before two punishing days in the Alps on Saturday and Sunday. This afternoon\u2019s route is relatively short, at 137.8km, but very sharp with a summit finish atop Grand Colombier, 17.4km long, peaking 1,501m above sea level. We will almost certainly see a full-on early fight to form a breakaway among the peloton\u2019s climbers who fancy a stage win, but regardless of how the rest of the stage plays out, attention will be focused on Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar on that final, attritional ascent. The Slovenian Pogacar (UAE Team Emirates) is just 17sec behind his Danish rival in the general classification. Vingegaard, of Jumbo-Visma, may still lead the race, but there is a sense Pogacar is getting stronger and merely waiting for his moment. Perhaps the GC teams will seek to control things, and let Vingegaard and Pocagar duke it out for the stage win as well as precious seconds in the GC at the front of the race? However it shakes down, the relatively short distance and the finely-balanced situation at the top of the standings means it\u2019s going to be gripping entertainment anyway.

I think it all depends on the quality and a good quality bagel trumps challah for a closed sandwich as challah tends to crumble. But a good bagel should be ashamed of its hole and be nearly closed at the point of consumption, as seen at Beigel Bake. A holy bagel is no match for challah though. Also, do you not think Grodzinski\u2019s in Stamford Hill is a fair match for Daniel\u2019s?\u201d It\u2019s years since I went to Grodz in N17, but I\u2019ll have a shy next time I\u2019m visiting my wife\u2019s dressmaker \u2013 Tiferes in Dunsmure Road for anyone wanting a top bloke and craftsman. I find the challah sandwich can be prevented from crumbling by rapid insertion into facehole. \u201cOn court I try to do the right things, but off court I can be a classic one,\u201d Sinner tells BBC when explaining he\u2019s not as serious as he seems and is actually quite funny. He\u2019s from northern Italy near the Austrian border, and in general, folk from there are said to be more stereotypically Austrian than Italian in temperament, but on a very basic level he seems sound. He\u2019s also a tremendous all-round athlete, good enough to have been a pro skier and footballer, such that even if he wasn\u2019t an interesting bloke, which he is, he\u2019d still have the personality proxies we all wish for. Tim Henman is in the BBC studio, wondering how on earth this tournament ever got finished playing one day fewer and with no roofs, noting that rallies are shorter these days. I\u2019d not thought of that, but I guess if points are serve, return, putaway volley, it makes perfect sense. It\u2019s funny, though, that two of my all-time favourite finals were completed on Monday, Edberg beating Becker in 1990 and Ivanisevic finally getting his title in 2001 by seeing off Rafter \u2013 coincidentally, Henman\u2019s one that really got away. Regular readers will, no doubt, be wondering where on earth Coach Calvin Betton has got to with his pithy tactical breakdowns, and I\u2019m pleased to report that the answer is right here: \u201cCan\u2019t see anyway Djokovic is troubled. He\u2019ll make too many balls and keep Sinner moving so he never has a set base to hit his big shots out of. Medvedev and Alcaraz could be interesting. If Medvedev serves well then it will be really tight. Alcaraz probably just has enough to hit through him. Medvedev doesn\u2019t have much to hurt with if his serve isn\u2019t happening. The key shot will be Alcaraz\u2019s drop shot cos Medvedev stands so far back.\u201d I wonder if he\u2019ll adjust there. I imagine he\u2019ll stick with his usual position to return, but he must know he needs a plan to combat one of the best and, increasingly, most renowned shots in the game. Real talk: bagels do not, in my opinion, make for any kind of decent sandwich. No give, hard to arrange a decent filling to bread ratio, and just not that tasty. Challah is far, far better in every aspect, and the extensive, decades-long research I\u2019ve undertaken in this important area tells me that the best in London can be found at Daniels \u2013 or, indeed Daniel\u2019s, depending on where you look \u2013 in Temple Fortune. I\u2019m not sure whether to thank or blame Oli Goldman for bringing this monstrosity to my attention. I guess you might argue that anything is improved by its insertion between two slices of bread, but you might also contact The Hague. It\u2019s minging in London today, so I\u2019m almost certain these matches will take place with the roof on. I doubt it\u2019ll make much difference to Djokovic, but Sinner will probably be pleased as indoors tends to favour the harder hitter, and against the greatest, you need every advantage you can get. Hello and welcome to Wimbledon 2023 \u2013 day 12! Our women\u2019s final is set and now it\u2019s time for the men. We begin with the defending champion, playing his 12th semi-final at the All England Club \u2013 he\u2019s won nine \u2013 a venue at which he\u2019s not been beaten since 2017. And it\u2019s hard to see that changing here, given his earth-shattering ability, spectacular form, and sense of mission. He is not on course for a calendar-year Grand Slam \u2013 rather it seems almost inevitable. However, there\u2019s always a however. Jannik Sinner comes from the third generation of players bested by Novak Djokovic, but unlike most, he knows he can beat him \u2013 not because he has, but because he nearly did, losing from two sets to love up in last year\u2019s quarter-finals. Sinner can easily rationalise that he\u2019s a much better player now, more settled in his game, more at home in these surroundings and better able to negotiate the big moments \u2013 plus he can hit anyone, and I mean anyone, off the court. He\u2019ll need to play better than ever before, but of all the men on the tour bar Carlos Alcaraz, he has the game and coldness most suited to ruining Djokovic\u2019s day. Talking of Alcaraz, he has again been brilliant through this tournament, his explosive forehand not just the most thrilling shot in the game but one of the greatest sights in all sport. But Daniil Medvedev is an opponent who\u2019s seen it all, gradually growing into the fortnight with a serve big enough to trouble anyone and a tactic of standing beyond the baseline that might just neutralise his opponent\u2019s power. Of course, that opponent is not underfurnished in the guile department, but this is only his third major semi and in his last one, just a month ago, he succumbed to cramp. So, though Alcaraz has unshakeable confidence that he\u2019s good enough to win this, now, he doesn\u2019t know for sure, and Medvedev will be doing all he can to make him live that uncertainty. This is going to be good!

With eight days of strike action looming, EasyJet says: \u201cWe urge them to reach an agreement as soon as possible.\u201d Another US bank, Wells Fargo, has also benefited from the rise in interest rates hitting consumers. Wells Fargo has reported a 57% rise in second quarter profits, as it earned more from customer interest payments. The bank has also raised its annual forecast for net interest income (NII). Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf explains: \u201cWe reported solid results in the second quarter, with net income of $4.9 billion and revenue of $20.5 billion. Our strong net interest income continued to benefit from higher interest rates, and we remained focused on controlling expenses. But, like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo has set aside more money to cover bad debts. Its allowance for credit losses has risen by $949m, primarily for commercial real estate office loans, as well as for higher credit card loan balances. The jump in profits at JP Morgan in the last quarter highlights how higher interest rates are good for bank profitability. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, explains: JPMorgan\u2019s numbers have demonstrated the overwhelming strength of big banks over their smaller competitors, after it unveiled a 67% surge in profits for Q2. Higher interest rates will continue to drive strong performance, it added. This looks like a very healthy set of numbers, and will boost hopes that earnings have begun to recover, something that might drive further stock gains in the second half of the year. Just in: Wall Street giant JP Morgan has set aside more funds to cover potential losses from customers defaulting on their debts as high inflation and interest rates hit consumers. In its second-quarter financial results, just released, JP Morgan has increased its provision for credit losses to almost $2.9bn, up from $1.1bn in the second quarter of 2022. The increase is partly due to JP Morgan having rescued regional lender First Republic earlier this year. It set aside $1.2bn to cover credit losses at First Republic \u2013 so exclude that, and the provision was $1.7bn. JP Morgan also reported a $2.7bn \u201cbargain purchase gain\u201d on its takeover of First Republic at the start of May, after the second-biggest bank failure in US history. Overall, net income rose to $14.4bn in the quarter, or 67% higher than a year ago. CEO Jamie Dimon said the US economy continues to be resilient, but warns of several risks: Consumers are slowly using up their cash buffers, core inflation has been stubbornly high (increasing the risk that interest rates go higher, and stay higher for longer), quantitative tightening of this scale has never occurred, fiscal deficits are large, and the war in Ukraine continues, which in addition to the huge humanitarian crisis for Ukrainians, has large potential effects on geopolitics and the global economy. A sharp drop in the number of advertised job openings in England is raising fears that the UK will slip into recession this year. Bloomberg are reporting that the number of jobs listed with Reed Recruitment in the April-June quarter are down 24.4% year on year, and over 26% lower than before the pandemic in 2019. Chairman James Reed in the prospects for the UK. \u201cThe alarm bell is sounding a lot louder now than it was, as the labor market is beginning to loosen. This continued contraction in job postings, which have been falling since this time last year, therefore suggests that a recession may well be imminent.\u201d Vacancies are a good gauge of corporate confidence, and whether firms feel demand is strong enough to justify taking on more staff. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics reported that vacancies fell by 85,000 on the quarter to 1,034,000 \u2013 just as the cost of living squeeze pressed more people back into the labour market. Reed\u2019s data is more timely, and \u201cthe picture isn\u2019t pretty\u201d, says Bloomberg, adding: Vacancies on Reed\u2019s platform, adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations, fell by 16,127 between the first and second quarters of this year \u2014 a 10% plunge. A decline of that scale, if mirrored in the official statistics, historically has been associated with a 0.6% contraction in GDP in the same quarter, said Dan Hanson at Bloomberg Economics. In this case, that would mean a sharp contraction in the quarter that ended on June 30. More here: England\u2019s Falling Job Advertisements Ring a Recession Alarm There could be additional strike action at Gatwick this summer too, on top of what\u2019s just been announced. That\u2019s because Unite is also balloting its members at DHL Gatwick Direct, Red Handling and Wilson James who are employed at Gatwick. All three ballots will close at the end of the month \u2013 if workers vote for industrial action, then strikes in these companies could begin by mid-August. The airlines affected by the strikes at Gatwick will include British Airways, Easyjet, Ryanair, TUI, Westjet and Wizz, Unite say. Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis is forcing more people to eat into their savings, according to official data which also shows that renters are at greatest risk of financial vulnerability. The Office for National Statistics reports that around three in 10 people are using their savings because of the rise in cost of living, up from 25% when previously polled in April. The ONS also reports that renters are 4.7 times more likely to experience financial vulnerability compared with those who own their home outright, while mortgage holders are twice as likely. That difference may be because, on average, renters spend 21% of their disposable income on rent (21%), while mortgage holders spend on averare 16% of their disposable income on their mortgage, ONS research shows. Today\u2019s report shows that over 4 in 10 renters are finding it difficult to afford their rent payments, compared with almost 3 in 10 (28%) mortgage holders. And around 1 in 20 of adults reported that in the past two weeks they had ran out of food and had been unable to afford more. Gatwick Airport is already suffering major disruption due to air traffic control (ATC) restrictions, PA Media points out. Strikes, staff shortages and air space closures related to the war in Ukraine mean ATC providers are limiting flight numbers across Europe. Gatwick is the busiest single-runway airport in the world, but its flight numbers are currently capped at peak times due to the ATC issue. The problem recently forced easyJet to cancel 1,700 summer flights, mostly from Gatwick. A Gatwick spokesperson says: \u201cWe are aware of the recent ballot result and will support our airlines with their contingency plans to ensure that flights operate as scheduled.\u201d Unite says the majority of the 950 Gatwick staff who will strike this summe are paid below \u00a312.00 an hour, despite undertaking highly demanding and safety critical roles. It says it has been negotiating on pay with ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services Ltd since January, but the firms have not made offers that meets the workers\u2019 expectations. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cOur members at Gatwick Airport undertake incredibly demanding roles and are essential to keeping the airport and airlines working, yet their employers somehow think it is acceptable to pay them a pittance. \u201cAs part of Unite\u2019s unyielding focus on the jobs, pay and condition of its members the union has drawn a line in the sand and is committed to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport.\u201d Nearly a thousand workers are set to take eight days of strike action at Gatwick Airport in July and August in a dispute over pay, which unions say will disupt the summer holiday getaway. The Unite union has announced that 950 staff working for ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services Ltd will take part in a four-day strike from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August, and a second four-day strike from Friday 4 August to Tuesday 8 August. All four companies conduct outsourced operations for major airlines, including ground handling, baggage handling and check in agents roles. Given the scale of the industrial action, disruption, delays and cancellations are inevitable across the airport, Unite says. Unite regional officer Dominic Rothwell said: \u201cStrike action will inevitably cause severe delays, disruption and cancellations across Gatwick\u2019s operations but this dispute is entirely of the companies own making. They have had every opportunity to make our members\u2019 a fair pay offer but have chosen not to do so.\u201d Finnish telecommunications firm Nokia has cut its sales and profit outlook for the year, warning that rising interest rates are hitting its business. Nokia cut its sales forecast for this year to between \u20ac23.2bn and \u20ac24.6bn, down from between \u20ac24.6bn-\u20ac26.2bn It also cut its profit margin range to 11.5%-13%, from 11.5%-14% before. Nokia, which sells telecoms network hardware, software and related services, says the macro-economic environment is leading to weaker demand, saying: Customer spending plans are increasingly impacted by high inflation and rising interest rates along with some projects now slipping to 2024 \u2013 notably in North America. Some customers are also \u2018normalising\u2019 their inventories, following the supply chain disrupion of the past two years, which led to stockpiling. Shares in Nokia have fallen around 8% in early trading. Turning from the poverty crisis to luxury goods\u2026. Burberry has reported a bounce in sales in China following its pandemic reopening. Sales in mainland China jumped 46% in the first quarter of the financial year (the 13 weeks to 1 July). That helped Burberry to grow its comparable store sales by 18%, with strong sales of \u2018heritage rainwear\u2019 (ie raincoats) and leather goods (such as handbags). It told shareholders: The Group benefitted from strong underlying growth in EMEIA [Europe, the Middle East, India and and Africa.], South Asia Pacific and Japan as well as the recovery in Mainland China from COVID-19 related lockdowns last year. But, sales in the America fell by 8%, as consumers cut back. Burbery says: Globally, the Americas customer decreased mid-single digit with the decline in locals partially offset by outbound tourist spend. Finance ministers from G20 nations are meeting in India next week, where they should discuss measures to tackle poverty, along with reforming the world\u2019s top multilateral institutions and the international debt architecture. Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator, called the surge in poverty alarming, Reuters reports. He told journalists. \u201cWhat this means is a government that can no longer pay its teachers; a government that can no longer employ doctors and nurses in hospitals, that cannot provide the medicines for rural health centers.\u201d The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has calculated it would cost around $14bn to lift back out of poverty the extra 165m people since 2020 who are living on less than $3.65 a day. The solution \u201cis not out of reach for the multilateral system\u201d, they say. UNDP chief economist George Gray Molina argues that a \u201cDebt-Poverty Pause\u201d would be triggered automatically when a country suffers an economic shock, so it can redirect debt repayment towards financing social expenditures. Molina says: \u201cThis systemic addition to the international financial architecture should be triggered automatically, to stabilize free-falls when exogenous shocks shrink developing countries\u2019 fiscal space, bloat their debt servicing and throw households into poverty. This is the beginning of a new adaptive social protection architecture to prepare for a future prone to shocks.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Global finance ministers are being urged to give poor countries debt repayment breaks, to cushion the developing world from the impact of high interest rates. In a new report, the United Nations is calling for a \u201cDebt-Poverty Pause\u201d, so developing countries can redirect debt repayments toward critical social expenditures. Such a pause would mitigate poverty, they argue, until the multilateral system can address debt restructuring \u201cat speed and scale\u201d. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports that poverty rates in poor countries have surged over the last three years, with another 165 million people now living on less than $3.65-a-day. These additional poor all live in low and lower-middle-income economies, UNDP says, with the poorest 20% in low-income countries still suffering incomes below their pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Rising debt servicing costs are making it increasingly harder for countries to support their populations through investments in health, education and social protection, warns Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. Steiner explains: \u201cCountries that could invest in safety nets over the last three years have prevented a significant number of people from falling into poverty. In highly indebted countries, there is a correlation between high levels of debt, insufficient social spending, and an alarming increase in poverty rates. Today, 46 countries pay more than 10 percent of their general government revenue on net interest payments. Steiner warns there is \u201ca human cost\u201d in not acting to restructure developing countries\u2019 sovereign debt, adding: \u201cWe need new mechanisms to anticipate and absorb shocks and make the financial architecture work for the most vulnerable.\u201d The increase in interest rates over the last year or so has hit developing nations hard, the UNDP explains. Those escalating borrowing costs, and the stronger dollar, make repaying loans and raising money significantly more expensive for dozens of developing nations. The average low-income country devotes between twice and three times as much, as a share of their revenue, on servicing interest payments compared with the average high-income country, UNDP say. Highly indebted developing countries have run out of fiscal space for continued debt-financing, which forces them to cut spending on social protection, says UNDP chief economist George Gray Molina, adding: In the absence of credible debt relief, these countries are not able to deliver this \u2018temporal and targeted\u2019 support.\u201d Late last month, the World Bank proposed that poor countries should be able to pause their debt repayments if hit by climate disaster. Yesterday, Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog warned that the UK\u2019s public finances are in a \u201cvery risky\u201d period after a series of shocks, including the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said national debt could surge to more than 300% of gross domestic product by the 2070s.

Mercenary fighters from Russia\u2019s Wagner group are training Belarusian soldiers in Belarus, the country\u2019s defence ministry said on Friday. The ministry said the training was taking place near the town of Osipovichi, about 90 km (56 miles) south of the capital Minsk, Reuters reports. The ministry said: [Wagner] fighters acted as instructors in a number of military disciplines. A Ukrainian court has jailed a man for 10 years after finding him guilty of plotting with Russia to blow up transport infrastructure to disrupt foreign arms supplies, Ukraine\u2019s domestic security agency said on Friday. The security service of Ukraine (SBU) said in a statement that it had detained the man in February before he had been able to carry out his mission. After fighting against Ukrainian forces in southern Ukraine, he was tasked by Russian military intelligence with blowing up two infrastructure objects, according to Reuters. It did not identify the intended targets but said they were in the Rivne region in western Ukraine, where there are several important, and largely secret, road and railway links with Poland. The SBU said: In order to carry out the enemy\u2019s task, the criminal conducted reconnaissance of the territory around infrastructure facilities and prepared to place explosives in the most vulnerable places of both transport routes. However, the SBU employees worked ahead of time and detained the attacker as a result of a multi-stage special operation at the end of February this year. The security service of Ukraine (SBU) did not identify the man but said he had fought with Russia-backed militant groups in eastern Ukraine before and since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, held a meeting with the Ukrainian intelligence chief, who ruled out an invasion from Belarus. According to intelligence data, there is no threat of invasion from Belarus, Ukraine\u2019s president said on Telegram. Russia accuses west of aiding \u2018nuclear terrorism\u2019 after drone strike in Kurchatov Russia has accused the west of sponsoring \u201cnuclear terrorism\u201d after authorities said a Ukrainian drone had struck the western Russian town of Kurchatov, where a nuclear power station similar to the Chornobyl plant is located. Roman Starovoit, the governor of Russia\u2019s Kursk region that borders Ukraine, said the Ukrainian drone had struck a residential apartment building in Kurchatov, a Soviet-era town built on the banks of a cooling pond for the Kursk nuclear power station, which is still in service. On Telegram, Starovoit said: A drone crashed in the town of Kurchatov overnight. Fortunately, none of the residents were injured. Critical facilities were not damaged as a result of the drone crash and its subsequent detonation. The only damage was to the facade and glazing of one block of flats, he added, saying the authorities would help residents restore their homes. The EU and the World Health Organization (WHO) are joining forces to further strengthen Medevac operations in Ukraine and to ensure Ukrainians can access crucial medical care. According to the European Commission, more than 2,350 Ukrainian patients have been transferred to hospitals in 21 European countries to get medical treatment.

Financial leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced countries will hold talks on July 16 on the sidelines of the broader G20 meeting in India, the Japanese finance minister, Shunichi Suzuki, said on Friday.

Soldin was given the top honour with effect from 28 June 2023 by a presidential decree issued on Thursday, according to France\u2019s official gazette. Soldin, AFP\u2019s video coordinator in Ukraine, was killed in a rocket attack in the country\u2019s east on 9 May, more than a year after the Russian invasion. He was 32 years old. Soldin was part of a team of AFP reporters embedded with Ukrainian soldiers near the besieged city of Bakhmut, at that point an epicentre of fighting that was targeted daily by Russian forces. The team was walking back to their car near the village of Chasiv Yar when they came under fire by Grad rockets. In case you missed it: Cluster munitions provided by the United States have now arrived in Ukraine, the Pentagon confirmed on Thursday. The munitions \u2013 bombs that open in the air and release scores of smaller bomblets \u2013 are seen by the US as a way to get Kyiv critically needed ammunition to help bolster its offensive and push through Russian frontlines. US leaders debated the thorny issue for months, before President Joe Biden made the final decision last week. US leaders have said the US will send a version of the munition that has a reduced \u201cdud rate\u201d, meaning fewer of the smaller bomblets fail to explode. These unexploded rounds, which often litter battlefields and populated civilian areas, cause unintended deaths. US officials said Washington will provide thousands of the rounds, but provided no specific numbers. Wagner has played a crucial combat role in Ukraine, especially in the grinding battle for Bakhmut. In June its fighters sought to topple Russia\u2019s military leadership during the brief rebellion, before backing down. The seeds of the Wagner\u2019s failed insurrection were sown nearly a decade ago when Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula and sent proxy forces into eastern Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin then founded the Wagner mercenary group, which gave Putin a tool for more active military intervention and some degree of plausible deniability. Before the war, Wagner had about 5,000 fighters, but that has since grown to 25,000, according to Prigozhin. Prigozhin\u2019s whereabouts are largely unknown in the wake of an agreement with the Kremlin that allowed for him to be exiled to neighbouring Belarus. Since the failed mutiny, speculation has been rife that there could be a reshuffle among Russia\u2019s military leadership, while details about the deal that ended the Wagner rebellion remain uncertain. The Kremlin has said that President Vladimir Putin met with Prigozhin during an hours-long meeting in Moscow days after the mutiny. On Wednesday, Russia announced that its army had received more than 2,000 pieces of military hardware, including tanks, from Wagner, following the rebellion. Wagner mercenaries are no longer participating in \u201cany significant capacity\u201d in combat operations in Ukraine, the Pentagon said Thursday, more than two weeks after the group\u2019s aborted mutiny in Russia. \u201cAt this stage, we do not see Wagner forces participating in any significant capacity in support of combat operations in Ukraine,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Pat Ryder told a news briefing, per AFP. Ryder said the the United States assessed that \u201cthe majority\u201d of Wagner fighters were still in areas of Russian-occupied Ukraine. Welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: Wagner mercenaries are no longer participating in \u201cany significant capacity\u201d in combat operations in Ukraine, the Pentagon said Thursday, more than two weeks after the group\u2019s aborted mutiny in Russia. \u201cAt this stage, we do not see Wagner forces participating in any significant capacity in support of combat operations in Ukraine,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Pat Ryder told a news briefing. Elsewhere today: The US president, Joe Biden, has said he doesn\u2019t believe there is \u201cany real prospect\u201d of Vladimir Putin using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Biden made the comment in response to a question about whether the Russian president could escalate actions in Ukraine after the disarray caused by last month\u2019s failed Wagner mutiny. The US president was speaking during a press conference with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, in Helsinki after the US-Nordic leaders\u2019 summit. Biden also said he was \u201cserious about prisoner exchange\u201d when asked about the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in a Moscow prison for more than 100 days. The European Commission is helping the UN and Turkey try to extend a deal allowing the Black Sea export of Ukraine grain and is open to \u201cexplore all solutions\u201d, an EU spokesperson said on Thursday, ahead of the deal\u2019s possible expiration on Monday. Three people have been killed by Russian shelling across Ukraine. A man in his 40s was killed by shelling in the Zaporizhzhia region. A 60-year-old in Sumy and an 85-year-old woman in Kherson were also killed by Russian shelling. Russia\u2019s nuclear chief denies claims Moscow has plotted to blow up Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Alexei Likhachev said that only \u201ca complete idiot\u201d would do such a reckless thing. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have received cluster munitions promised by the US to help boost Kyiv\u2019s slow-moving counteroffensive, senior military officials from the two countries say. \u201cWe just got them, we haven\u2019t used them yet, but they can radically change [the battlefield],\u201d Ukrainian army commander Oleksandr Tarnavskyi told CNN on Thursday. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said he is certain Ukraine will become part of Nato after Russia\u2019s war against the country ends. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Austin said on Thursday: \u201cI have no doubt that will happen, and we heard just about every country in the room say as much.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s top security official has dismissed criticism of Kyiv from the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, suggesting Wallace misspoke due to a surfeit of emotion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to what he said,\u201d Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s security council, told the Guardian in Kyiv on Thursday after Wallace said Ukraine should show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west. \u201cEveryone can say something when they are emotional and then regret it \u2026 I know for sure this isn\u2019t his actual position.\u201d A Russian general said he had been fired as a commander after telling the military leadership \u201cthe truth\u201d about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine, as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of Wagner\u2019s short-lived mutiny. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms Army, which is fighting on the front in Ukraine near Zaporizhzhia, said in a voice message that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield. A senior Russian official has described Gen Sergei Surovikin as \u201cresting\u201d and \u201cnot available\u201d.

MP Angus MacNeil has had his membership of the SNP suspended after he refused to rejoin the party\u2019s Westminster group. MacNeil, who has often voiced criticism of the SNP leadership, was kicked out of the Westminster group for a week after reportedly clashing with chief whip Brendan O\u2019Hara, PA reported. The MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) later said he would not seek to rejoin the group until at least October, accusing the party of a lack of urgency on its goal of Scottish independence. He said the Scottish government was \u201cutterly clueless about how to pursue independence\u201d since losing the Indyref2 case at the supreme court. MacNeil has now been administratively suspended while the party\u2019s member conduct committee considers his decline of the offer to re-join. An SNP spokesperson said: Angus MacNeil MP was advised by the SNP National Secretary on Wednesday that she considered him to be in breach of the party\u2019s code of conduct by his decision to resign from the SNP Westminster parliamentary group. Having acknowledged this, Mr MacNeil did not take up the offer to rejoin the SNP parliamentary group and the matter was, therefore, yesterday referred to the SNP member conduct committee for consideration.

Downing Street said it hoped junior doctors and consultants in England would consider the pay rises offered as it confirmed there will not be further talks on wage increases. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson told reporters: We would hope that junior doctors and consultants \u2013 on around \u00a3120,000 a year \u2013 will look at the offer again today and speak to their unions and consider whether it is appropriate for it to keep disrupting patient care in the way they are doing, in light of junior doctors on average (being offered an) 8.8% pay increase and consultants a 6% pay increase. And consultants, of course, are some of the best-paid public sector workers \u2013 and indeed public or private sector workers. So it is for them to consider whether it is appropriate. Our position is clear: we have accepted the independently decided recommendation of the pay review body. We are more than happy to talk about wider workforce issues but we won\u2019t be having further talks on pay. Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said junior doctors were being offered \u201cone of the biggest pay increases across the whole public sector\u201d and that the lowest paid in their ranks were being offered a 10.3% uplift in their pay as part of the package. \u201cAnd that is on top of their pension contributions, which are far and above those in the private sector,\u201d the No 10 official added. Rail passengers are being warned of disruption to services next week because of fresh industrial action by train drivers and other workers in long running disputes over pay, jobs and conditions. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) will strike on 20, 22 and 29 July, while drivers in Aslef will ban overtime from 17 to 22 July, PA reported. RMT members including station staff, train managers and catering staff will be involved in the action. Passengers were advised to check their travel arrangements in advance as the level of service will vary across the country. The strike action at 14 train companies will see wide variations of services across the country with trains due to start later and finish much earlier than usual. In some areas, only around half of train services will run, while others will have no services at all. Evening services on some lines are likely to be affected on the days before each strike and on the mornings after the action. The overtime ban by drivers in Aslef on 14 train companies will affect train services between 17 and 22 July. A parliamentary committee is renewing an inquiry into sexism and misogyny in the City after a spate of sexual harassment allegations rocked the business world. MPs on the influential Treasury committee said the new inquiry would examine the barriers faced by women in financial services, and determine whether meaningful progress had been made since its last investigation in 2018 raised concerns over the gender pay gap, stigmas against working mothers, and an \u201calpha male\u201d culture. It will also explore what kind of role City firms, the government and regulators including the Financial Conduct Authority should play in \u201ccombating sexual harassment and misogyny\u201d. The inquiry comes after two scandals that have raised serious concerns about abuse and harassment against women in business. Earlier this year the Guardian revealed multiple claims of sexual misconduct at the Confederation of British Industry, which prompted a string of companies to terminate their membership, including Aviva, NatWest, John Lewis and BMW. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been invited to the UK on an official visit in late autumn, the first such visit by the heir to the Saudi throne since he was accused of masterminding the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and dissident. Numerous UK ministers have been to Saudi Arabia in the interim, and senior Saudi ministers have also come to the UK, including the foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. Prince Mohammed also spent nearly a week in Paris last month meeting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and attending a climate finance summit. News of the UK visit, first revealed by the Financial Times, comes as Saudi Arabia tries to end the war in Yemen, and has opened up diplomatic relations with Iran. The US is seeking to persuade Saudi Arabia to also normalise diplomatic relations with Israel, but Riyadh, unlike its Gulf Arab allies the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, is resisting until there is progress on the Palestinian issue. Rishi Sunak must uphold his \u00a311.6bn climate finance commitment, conservative parliamentarians, including the former net zero tsar, have said. Writing to the prime minister in a cross-party letter, they say recommitting to the target and clearly demonstrating how it would be met would \u201cavoid doing further damage to the UK\u2019s climate leadership, and help to build a safe and more prosperous future\u201d. Chris Skidmore, the MP who authored the government\u2019s net zero review, is among 51 parliamentarians, including four Tories, who have written to the prime minister urging him not to let down developing countries. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, who also signed the letter, told the Guardian: The government\u2019s commitment to \u00a311.6bn in climate finance isn\u2019t a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s an absolutely critical part of the global effort to tackle the accelerating climate emergency, and a solemn promise to the international community that cannot simply be abandoned on a whim. It must be new and additional money, too. Giving with one hand and taking with another, by diverting cash from an already depleted aid budget, won\u2019t help those on the frontline of this crisis. Any backsliding on this commitment would leave any remaining semblance of the UK\u2019s global climate leadership in tatters. In case you missed it earlier, a senior cabinet minister has urged health unions to take the government\u2019s pay offer \u201cseriously\u201d, after union leaders said the proposed deal would drive doctors out of the profession and could lead to further strikes. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, defended the offer of a 6% pay rise for junior doctors, a day after the government accepted the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies. Keegan said the pay review bodies had taken into account how much money would be needed to recruit and retain NHS staff without adding to the UK\u2019s stubbornly high inflation rate. The British Medical Association however called the offer \u201ca huge missed opportunity\u201d, while the Royal College of Nursing said it highlighted the unfairness of the separate offer to nurses of 5% plus a one-off payment. Rishi Sunak continues to trail Keir Starmer in the polls as his personal favourability rating slides further into negative territory. The prime minister\u2019s net favourability rating has fallen to -21, according to a poll published by Ipsos UK on Friday, with 47% of people saying they had an unfavourable view of him, PA reported. The figures are Sunak\u2019s worst since he quit as chancellor in July 2022, helping topple Boris Johnson, when Ipsos found 50% of people had an unfavourable view of him. The poll, carried out between 30 June and 3 July, found Labour leader Starmer\u2019s ratings had improved slightly over the past month, with 32% saying they had a favourable view of him and 39% saying they had an unfavourable one. There was more bad news for Sunak when Ipsos asked about the qualities people look for in a prime minister. On the factors people said were most important to them, Sunak received overwhelmingly negative ratings while impressions of Starmer were more mixed. Half of the 1,000 people polled by Ipsos said they had a negative view of Mr Sunak\u2019s policies for dealing with the cost of living and his understanding of the problems facing people in Britain. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that ministers were not planning to make further compromises, after peers pressed for further changes to the Illegal Migration Bill. Members of the Lords want further concessions on limits to the detention of children, modern slavery protections and the provision of safe and legal routes for refugees to the UK. The Lords inflicted a string of fresh defeats on the government this week over the much-criticised Bill, which ministers insist is integral to efforts to tackle small boats crossings in the Channel, PA reported. It means the continuation of the parliamentary tussle over the bill, known as ping-pong, where the legislation is batted between the Lords and Commons, until agreement is reached. The Commons had overturned a raft of earlier revisions by the unelected chamber, despite rebellions by Tory MPs concerned about the flagship reforms. But Jenrick told the BBC that critics of the Bill had not put forward any \u201ccredible alternative\u201d, adding: It\u2019s incumbent on those who choose to criticise our approach to provide an alternative. It\u2019s not a serious or grown-up way to conduct a debate to say, \u2018well we have concerns about Rwanda\u2019, \u2018we don\u2019t like the compliant environment\u2019 \u2013 \u2018We don\u2019t want this, we don\u2019t want to\u2019, but not to come up with an alternative.\u201d The bill now heads back to the Commons where MPs will consider the latest changes made by peers. Around 950 workers at Gatwick airport will take eight days of strike action beginning later this month in a dispute over pay. Unite said that members who carry out roles including baggage handling and check-in would strike. There are employed by ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services. The workers will strike initially for four days beginning on Friday 28 July ending on Tuesday 1 August. Then a further four days from Friday 4 August until Tuesday 8 August. The union\u2019s general secretary Sharon Graham said: Our members at Gatwick airport undertake incredibly demanding roles and are essential to keeping the airport and airlines working, yet their employers somehow think it is acceptable to pay them a pittance. As part of Unite\u2019s unyielding focus on the jobs, pay and condition of its members, the union has drawn a line in the sand and is committed to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport. Pupil absences are at \u201ccrisis\u201d level, the education secretary has said, as she endorsed headteachers driving children to school if necessary. Gillian Keegan told Sky News that headteachers had a \u201cduty\u201d to get children to school. Figures released earlier this year showed that about 125,000 pupils last year were severely absent, effectively meaning they were absent more often than they were in classrooms, PA Media reported. Keegan, who rejected the suggestion that the government did not have a grip on the problem, was asked about examples of headteachers driving to children\u2019s homes to pick them up and bring them to school. \u201cThey have a duty,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have to play our part. \u201cI have a number of headteachers who work with me on policy and sometimes you just have to do that \u2013 sometimes you have to go or you have to text the parent in the morning \u2026 you do whatever is possible.\u201d Pressed on whether that was a good use of headteachers\u2019 time, Keegan said: It is a good use to have all kids in school. That\u2019s not what we want headteachers doing all of their days. But to be honest, right now, if that works to get somebody in school, it\u2019s worth it. Education secretary Gillian Keegan also said this morning that the government would honour the 6.5% pay rise offered to teachers into the long term. She told Times Radio that the process of ensuring the pay cost could be covered and paid for without affecting frontline budgets had been \u201ctricky\u201d and \u201chard\u201d. She also rejected suggestions that the prime minister had caved in to union demands, adding: No, I think Rishi has shown great leadership. It isn\u2019t easy to do, and what you have to do is try and set expectations, to make sure people have reasonable expectations. Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. We start the day with comments made by the education secretary urging the British Medical Association (BMA) to accept the recommended pay offer to public sector workers. The chair of the BMA\u2019s UK council said Rishi Sunak\u2019s pay increase offer \u201cfails to address\u201d years of below-inflation pay deals. Prof Phil Banfield added that the government\u2019s offer \u201cis exactly why so many doctors are feeling they have no option but to take industrial action\u201d. But this morning Gillian Keegan said the organisation is being \u201cunreasonable\u201d and called on junior doctors to \u201clook at\u201d the 6% pay offer. She told LBC radio: Their starting position is an unreasonable position. We all understand there\u2019s been inflation and there\u2019s been a huge spike in inflation. And that\u2019s impacting all of us. That\u2019s why the main goal is to halve inflation. You can\u2019t chase it. I would urge them to take the same approach as everybody else actually. Keegan also told Sky News: I would urge the BMA, the independent pay review bodies have done a very thorough analysis and they look at rates of recruitment, retention, they look at all the other sort of professions or similar professions so they do a very thorough job."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380ae6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/14/the-guide-festivals", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guide #95: One-day festivals, week-long Wembley residences \u2013 have we reached peak big gig?", "lead": "In this week\u2019s newsletter: Wherever you look there\u2019s a pricey new event \u2013 but the majority of the industry isn\u2019t in such rude health", "author": "Gwilym Mumford", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 12:07:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096256", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/388d0464506d32ce4dfb2a01c6b18afafd71c11f/0_261_5713_3428/500.jpg", "body": "Were you watching live music in a field/city park/stadium/arena/back room of a pub last weekend? If so, you weren\u2019t alone. Wherever you looked there seemed to be a festival or mega-gig blaring away. London alone felt like it might collapse under the force of decibels as a reported one million people went to a gig last week. I was at Blur for the first of their two Wembley stadium gigs, but you could have taken your pick between The Weeknd, shaking off the stink of The Idol at the Olympic stadium across two nights; The Boss at Hyde Park on Friday and Saturday; Lana Del Rey (making curfew this time), at the same venue on Sunday; the, ahem, delights of Black Eyed Peas and Kaiser Chiefs at Greenwich Summer Sounds; or a bouncing Wireless festival weekend in Finsbury Park featuring Playboi Carti, Travis Scott and Lil Uzi Vert. And that was just London. Elsewhere in the UK, you could have caught Pulp, Sam Fender and The 1975 at the T in the Park-usurping TRNSMT festival in Glasgow, or enjoyed the noughties rock-tastic lineup (Rival Schools! Hundred Reasons! Hell is for Heroes!) at 2000trees in Gloucestershire. You could have also been in Malvern to see KC and the Sunshine Band and Sampa the Great at the good-vibes-only El Dorado festival, or you could have seen Pulp in Scarborough, The Lumineers in Halifax, or any one of the hundreds of regular gigs motoring along across the length and breadth of the UK. But how many gigs is too many gigs in one weekend? There was a feeling, best articulated in this Clash piece about the risible numbers for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Def Leppard at Wembley the weekend before, that there might be an unsustainable number of live events at present: too many gigs, not enough people to attend them, certainly at some of the prices being asked for. In the event, despite Blur having to slash prices for some of the nosebleed seats for the second night at Wembley, all of those many London gigs and festivals last weekend seemed to be full or close to it. Besides, you suspect last weekend might have been a bit of a unicorn \u2013 a perfect storm of lots of big venues being available on the same weekend (want to book the Olympic Stadium this weekend? Tough luck, the monster trucks are on), lots of artists wanting to tour at the same time, plus the usual summer festival glut. More generally, this has been a year where the gig industry is trying to play catch up after that long pandemic-affected period. Sure, 2022 might have been the year where normality started to return to gig-going, but a lot of the bigger touring shows \u2013 scheduled and booked in some cases more than a year in advance \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have been in a position to commit to dates that early \u2013 hence the surge of shows in 2023. What\u2019s striking about the surge of big-name shows is how detached it seems from the far bleaker outlook for live music in this country, where 100 festivals have packed up since Covid, artists are struggling to make a living from live performance and smaller venues are closing en masse due to rocketing costs, noise complaints or vampiric property developers. There\u2019s a growing disconnect between the top rung of live music \u2013 where eight vast new venues are currently in development, city parks are booked up for gigs and festivals all summer (to the inconvenience of local residents), and ticket prices continue to spiral \u2013 and its struggling lower rungs. As is often pointed out, it\u2019s the grassroots scenes that facilitate that top rung, providing a valuable platform for artists on their way up, and offering younger audiences an affordable chance to see live music and build a habit of gig going. Take that away and the whole edifice starts looking shaky. Soon we might not be asking why there are so many gigs going on every weekend \u2013 but why there are so few.

What is measles? Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease that, as the NHS notes, often begins with cold-like symptoms before a rash develops all over the body. The disease can cause fatal problems including pneumonia and meningitis, with babies and people with weakened immune systems at greater risk. It is also dangerous for pregnant women, as measles can cause miscarriages, stillbirths or premature births. Isn\u2019t there a vaccine to protect against measles? There is. In the UK, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, is offered to all children, with two doses offering protection for life. However, uptake of the jab fell dramatically after the now discredited gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield hypothesised in 1998 that it was linked to autism. Study after study has found this is not the case. Why is there talk of outbreaks? Lingering reluctance among some parents to vaccinate their children has continued around the world, linked not only to the Wakefield scandal but to far-right political parties. In addition, the Covid pandemic disrupted many routine immunisation programmes, meaning some children missed out on their MMR jabs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2021 only 81% of children around the world were given their first dose of measles vaccine and 71% received two doses \u2013 the lowest global rates since 2008. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), says uptake of two MMR doses in children aged five in England is 85%. These rates matter. As the WHO notes, coverage of 95% or greater of two doses of a measles vaccine is needed to create herd immunity, which protects those too young to be vaccinated, have weakened immune systems or are otherwise vulnerable. \u201cNo country is exempt from measles, and areas with low immunisation encourage the virus to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated children at risk,\u201d the WHO has said. There have already been huge surges in measles cases in many countries, with about 9m cases and 128,000 deaths globally in 2021, predominantly in children under the age of five who had not been vaccinated or had not received full vaccination. What is the situation in the UK? Measles was considered to be eliminated in the UK in 2016 and 2017, but since 2018 its transmission has become re-established. Cases fell during the pandemic as a result of restrictions but have since risen. According to UKHSA, in the first six months of 2023 there were 128 cases of measles in England, 66% of which were detected in London. This appears to be linked to particularly low vaccine uptake in some areas of the capital. As a result, while UKHSA says the risk of a measles epidemic across the UK is low, an outbreak of between 40,000 and 160,000 cases could occur in London. What should people do? The main message is to ensure you and any children in your care have had two doses of the MMR vaccine. This can be done by contacting your GP or, in the case of children, checking their red book. Catch-up jabs are being offered in schools, GP practices and community clinics."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380ae8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/14/new-host-new-set-same-fiendish-questions-behind-the-scenes-with-the-all-new-university-challenge", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New host, new set, same fiendish questions: behind the scenes with the all-new University Challenge", "lead": "Forget the revamp, the quizshow is as tricky as ever.

The new host of University Challenge, the third in the show\u2019s 61-year history (following Bamber Gascoigne and, of course, Jeremy Paxman) is wearing his trademark suit and tie. He is also holding a bag for life full of tins. \u201cWho wants a gin and tonic or pi\u00f1a colada?\u201d he asks. This is not a moment I expected. Filming has just finished (the tins are Rajan\u2019s way of thanking the crew) and I\u2019m here because, as well as talking to him about taking over as host of the iconic student quizshow, I have been invited to try it out. You won\u2019t be surprised to find out that it is hard. So hard, in fact, that having just played I rummage through Rajan\u2019s bag and down an entire pi\u00f1a colada in one go out of stress. An hour earlier, I arrived to watch an episode being recorded. What strikes you when you enter the studio is that there\u2019s very little difference to what you see on TV. The quiz is similar in length, but occasionally Rajan says \u201cStop the clock\u201d to pause proceedings to confer with the quiz specialists in his earpiece or after someone accidentally swears on air. I cannot see Roger Tilling, who introduces each contestant, but his voice booms through the studio as if he were God. Multiple episodes are recorded in one day, so there is the surreal twist of having one team play a new team 20 minutes after facing their previous opponents, only stopping to change their outfits for the camera. They are all pretty calm, jovial even. At one point during a warmup, one contestant uses their buzzer specifically to ask someone for a glass of water. What a badass. Keeping the contestants relaxed is one of Rajan\u2019s key goals in fronting University Challenge. He knows its importance only too well, having been a contestant himself on the Christmas series several years back: \u201cWhen I was a contestant, I didn\u2019t have that skill, which comes with practice, of being able to forget the last question and really focus on the new one. I was really annoyed at myself that I hadn\u2019t got the last one.\u201d How well did he do? \u201cNot great,\u201d he admits. University Challenge naturally became moulded round Paxman\u2019s image, so it must have been tempting to copy his authoritative, sometimes impatient presenting style. But Rajan is going his own way, aiming for an energetic and enthusiastic approach. \u201cI want to establish a rapport with them. Partly because they\u2019re really nervous. Partly because I want them to have a nice experience. \u201cYou have to say things they don\u2019t like. You have to make adjudications on tight things, or ask them to hurry up. You need to have that authority over them. But it helps if you\u2019ve got a rapport.\u201d As the students are asked a few test questions to get into the flow of things, I meet my competition and teammates, some of whom are journalists. I realise that I\u2019m incredibly nervous. Thirty minutes later, we take our seats at the famous desks. Our names are placed in the slots in front of us. At this point I realise I don\u2019t have a mascot. Rajan introduces us, the camera pans to my face \u2013 and I temporarily forget what I studied at university. Then comes our first starter for 10: \u201cWho is this? Born in York in 1570, he converted to Catholicism and fought for the Spanish army in the Low Countries, and at the siege of Calais. After returning to England he adopted the name John Johnson and was arrested at Westminster in November 1605.\u201d I don\u2019t buzz. I don\u2019t know. Neither does anyone else, so an agonising silence ensues. In the heat of the moment, I decide this is worse than someone giving a wrong answer. So I buzz. \u201cUniversity Challenge Bryan!\u201d yells the voice of God. The camera zooms in on my face again. I have no clue what to say. \u201cChristopher Columbus?\u201d The crew in the studio gasp. Rajan\u2019s head is on his desk. When he eventually sits up, he helpfully says: \u201cChristopher Columbus had set sail nearly a couple of centuries before then. Do we dock them five points for a ridiculous answer?\u201d It passes to the other team, who get it right (it\u2019s Guy Fawkes). Things move quickly. Rajan makes frequent (and polite) uses of \u201cc\u2019mon\u201d whenever a team take a while to answer. Ensuring there\u2019s no time-wasting is a priority for him. \u201cIf a team is 25 points behind with three or four minutes to go, that\u2019s only a starter and a set of bonuses, you know?\u201d Putdowns will only be used if he genuinely knows the answer, he says. A hurdle of being quizmaster, he has learned, is mastering reading out very long questions while also having to enunciate clearly. \u201cI actually had a really, really meaningful conversation with Jeremy, and one of the things he said was: \u2018Make the question second nature to you.\u2019\u201d While the set has been refreshed, and there\u2019s a new host, Rajan emphasises that the show is carrying on much as it did before: \u201cThere are little things you can do to reassure fans that you paid attention to Jeremy. There are all these institution-like phrases, like: \u2018Fingers on buzzers, here\u2019s your first starter for 10.\u2019 We have still got the gong, we still have the ritual of saying the team that lost first. I\u2019ve still got that thing Jeremy did where if a team nearly gets it but doesn\u2019t, I say: \u2018Bad luck.\u2019 I hope that despite all the change, there\u2019s a bit of reassurance.\u201d From here, things start to go a bit better for me \u2013 though it\u2019s not like they could get worse. My teammate gets the next question right, leading to a set of bonuses on the Marvel Cinematic Universe: \u201cThe Avengers film, released in 2019, has what subtitle? It was also the name of a one-act play by Samuel Beckett that premiered in 1957.\u201d \u201cAge of Ultron?\u201d I say. Incorrect. Although that would have been one hell of a Beckett play. Another starter question: \u201cBorn in 1833, the German geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen is often credited with coining what two-word term for the Eurasian network of overland routes by which ideas and merchandise were transferred between east and west?\u201d Silence. \u201cYou got this,\u201d says Rajan. To make us feel better, he gives clues: \u201cEurasian! The famous roads!\u201d I guess the Silk Road. Correct. Elation. \u201cYour bonuses are on an organic compound,\u201d says Rajan. My heart sinks. I would write out the next question for you but I cannot even transcribe four of the words despite replaying them many times. It is at this moment that my teammate wants to offer an answer but I cannot nominate her. Having only met an hour earlier, I have forgotten her name. Leaning over the desk to find it out feels a bit rude. \u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d \u201cOf the naturally occurring metallic elements, which has the lowest density at room temperature, one of the lowest melting points at 180C, and the lowest atomic mass?\u201d At this point I am willing to throw anything in the ring. Buzz. \u201cCopper?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says Rajan flatly. The other team don\u2019t get it either. It\u2019s lithium. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all night,\u201d he jokes. I buzz for the next starter. I didn\u2019t mean to this time but my finger slipped: \u201cWhat short word denotes the strictest form of contrapuntal imitation? In another sense, it might indicate an accepted body of work or the recognised genuine works of an author?\u201d \u201cOmnibus?\u201d No, it\u2019s canon. It turns out the University Challenge buzzers are very sensitive. And the gong goes. It has gone way worse than I could possibly have imagined, and the gong feels like the sweet release of death. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t quite work for you,\u201d says Rajan, remarking on our final score of 25. Our rivals? 45. At this point, a member of the production team reminds us that all the questions we have been asked were real University Challenge questions from a round one match. I feel a bit better, until she adds the caveat: \u201cObviously, without all the extra clues Amol gave.\u201d Later, as Rajan and I reflect on the experience, I ask whether he was nervous on his first day of filming. He admits he was, but that the main thing on his mind was his late father. \u201cI was really nervous, but it was emotionally powerful because of my dad.\u201d When Rajan was announced as the show\u2019s host last August, he said his first starter for 10 would be devoted to him. \u201cWhere I sit, there are all these people you can\u2019t actually see, you just know that they\u2019re there. On the first day, I did think about him a lot, probably too much. Because it would have been wonderful for him to watch. Even now, I imagine him sitting there in the darkness.\u201d It\u2019s time for me to leave the studio. I look in my bag and see a rolled-up lamination with my surname emblazoned across it. I feel a bit of pride, knowing that I would never have made it academically to go on the real University Challenge, but somehow I managed it anyway. This pride, however, is short-lived, as I remember what Rajan said to our team after we lost. \u201cWell, we won\u2019t see you again.\u201d University Challenge returns on 17 July on BBC Two at 8.30pm"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380ae9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jul/14/matildas-vs-france-live-updates-score-australia-aus-v-fra-womens-world-cup-warm-up-kick-off-start-time-scores-football-soccer-latest-news", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Matildas 1-0 France: Australia win Women\u2019s World Cup warm-up \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Mary Fowler\u2019s goal proved the difference as the Matildas defeated world No 5 France in Melbourne", "author": "Jonathan Howcroft", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:59:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096313", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bb9f620871f3cd50d3d148128967e92ff19337b4/0_61_6854_4115/500.jpg", "body": "Thank you for joining me tonight on an historic occasion for Australia. Over 50,000 fans packed Marvel stadium for a match that ended with victory over the fifth-ranked side in the world. These set-piece World Cup send-offs risk hubris, but tonight served only to increase the hype around the tournament and the potential for the Matildas to go far in it. All of that kicks off on Thursday with New Zealand hosting Norway in Auckland, followed by Australia welcoming Ireland to Sydney. We\u2019ll be right here to cover all the action. I\u2019ll leave you with Kieran Pender\u2019s match report from Melbourne. Stay tuned for stacks more World Cup content over the coming days as we count down to the biggest sporting event of the year. Goodnight! For Herv\u00e9 Renard, other than the injury to Bacha, there seems no reason to dwell on the defeat. His side controlled possession for long periods and didn\u2019t want for commitment. However, the lack of a skilful #10 in the final third could become a concern at the World Cup if they fail to unpick defences through their slick ball movement. The pace further forward is a weapon no side wants to come up again, and in Raso, Carpenter, and Vine in particular, Australia can play on the counterattack with real purpose. That\u2019s helped by the ability of Kerr and Foord to hold the ball up and straighten the lines in attack, as they did often in the first half. Plenty of promising signs for the Matildas, who, in the past few months, have really grown into a team with the all-round potential to live up to the hype. Tony Gustavsson will be thrilled by his side\u2019s resilience in the second half as Australia defended their lead with great composure. The back four, with the returning Kennedy partnering Hunt, was going to be scrutinised, and aside from a couple of cheap turnovers in the first half they performed outstandingly. An end-to-end first-half gave way to a scrappy, disjointed second, one that unraveled as the substitutions began to flow on the hour mark. Fowler\u2019s finish will lead the match reports, but the injuries to Bacha and Yallop could prove the lasting storylines from the 90 minutes. Sam Kerr goes straight to goalscorer Mary Fowler for a big high five and embrace as the players shake hands and draw breath. The Matildas prepare for next week\u2019s World Cup with a hard fought victory in front of a record crowd. Roll on Thursday! 90+7 mins: Lyon clubmate Ellie Carpenter is in tears at the distress Bacha is suffering. 90+6 mins: Another injury, this time for France. And this one looks devastating for the talented Bacha. The 22-year-old has impressed tonight, but she rolled her ankle contesting possession with Raso, and now she\u2019s being carried from the field on a stretcher in obvious distress. 90+5 mins: France are refusing to go quietly and Feller almost gets her head onto a teasing cross, but Arnold gathers easily and Australia are safe. 90+3 mins: Le Garrec blazes miles over. For all their possession, France have created very little this second half. 90+2 mins: More crosses blocked, this time by Hunt and Raso. Commitment and determination to the fore for Australia late in the piece. 90+1 mins: Five minutes of stoppage time remaining for France to find an equaliser. 90 mins: Becho has been lively since her introduction and she creates a chance down the right with a lovely flick, but she then fails to finish the move with a snatched volley dribbling wide. 89 mins: The substitutes Mateo and Becho look to combine down the left but Polkinghorne does well to cover the near post and shut down the opportunity. Backs to the wall stuff for the Matildas as France hurl everything towards Australian territory. 87 mins: It is going to be attack v defence until the final whistle now with Australia happy to defend their lead in numbers. France are full of endeavour but little inspiration. Meanwhile, Yallop is seen limping slowly towards the tunnel. I fear her World Cup is over before it\u2019s begun. 85 mins: France are not giving up hope in these closing stages but Australia have defended the space around their penalty area superbly all night. Substitute Becho does well down the right but once Geyoro takes the ball in the box the space is closed down quickly. 83 mins: But now Yallop has finally accepted her fate and is replaced by the veteran Luik. fingers crossed for Yallop\u2019s fitness. 80 mins: Play gets back underway after changes aplenty for both teams. Yallop, however, remains on the field. 78 mins: Now Kennedy\u2019s down, but this looks just like cramp. This delay allows players from both sides to pause, take on fluids, and steel themselves for the final ten or so minutes. 76 mins: Yallop is back on her feet but not back in the action as France force a corner. 74 mins: Gah! That doesn\u2019t look good for Tameka Yallop. Fighting for possession with Cascarino on the left her left leg buckled in contact and she hit the deck in pain. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s nothing serious. 72 mins: France back on the front foot, but there\u2019s no penetration in central areas. Australia\u2019s control of their own penalty box has been impressive tonight. 70 mins: The referee is not in France\u2019s good books. Aside from the penalty call, a throw-in and a free-kick have both now gone against the visitors in quick succession. From the set-piece Gorry dinks a dangerous ball into the mixer that Les Bleues do well to clear. There\u2019s a gold jersey in an offside position when the second ball threatens to lead to a chance. 68 mins: Bacha\u2019s decision making and execution in the final third has left plenty to be desired at times tonight. Not for the first time she lets fly with a wild effort that fails to trouble Arnold. Of course, just as I type that the Matildas score a perfect Matildas goal. Raso accepts the ball on the right and uses her pace to dart towards the byline, from where she picks out Fowler with the cutback. The Manchester City star drills home a composed first-time finish. Australia ahead, somewhat against the run of play. 64 mins: Raso, now playing up front, does well to buy a free-kick with her back to goal. It\u2019s brief respite though with France dominating possession and controlling the game. Australia\u2019s bold raids are reducing in both frequency and potency. 62 mins: The night as a first-XI v first-XI is over. Australia put Foord and Kerr on ice with Yallop and Van Egmond coming on. Not sure quite how Australia fashion a forward line now. 60 mins: France are stringing the passes together again, pushing Australia deeper and deeper, nullifying the press and denying the Matildas any clearing outlet. But despite probing left and right and over the top, nothing of substance materialises. Just as the pressure builds towards inevitability Sam Kerr does incredibly to collect the clearing ball, spin out of trouble and charge into French territory, relieving the stress on her defensive colleagues. During a short break in play, replays confirm that was a stonewall penalty earlier on by the way. VAR not in action tonight, but it will be during the World Cup. 58 mins: Penalty surely! No! Le Sommer accepted a looping cross on her chest and was absolutely thumped from behind by Catley. Stonewall for mine. But play goes on. Sacre bleu! 56 mins: France can\u2019t play their way out of defence and Catley gallops down the left to create the overlap and stand up a perfect cross to the penalty spot but Kerr can\u2019t win the aerial battle. Australia recycle play nicely but Raso\u2019s centring ball from the right skews out of play. Australia look much more promising when they assert themselves out of possession. 55 mins: Now it\u2019s Australia\u2019s turn to attack with Gorry driving at the heart of the France defence with purpose. A couple of ricochets later and the Matildas haver a corner. Gorry takes it herself, and it might be the worst set-piece you will ever seen, curling meekly straight out of play. 53 mins: France have settled now and they\u2019re exploiting the space through Australia\u2019s lines, this time down the right, but Bacha can\u2019t capitalise at the far post, smashing a presentable chance high and wide. 52 mins: Without the ball Australia have shifted to a mid-block from the aggressive press of the first half, and it allows France to progress the ball forward easier. A free-kick in midfield sees Dali lump a ball into the box but after a gold jersey wins the initial header, Cascarino drags a weak effort wide. 50 mins: A rare France counterattack forces Hunt to concede a corner but Renard can\u2019t win the header and the Matildas clear. 49 mins: It\u2019s been a scrappy start to the second half with neither side settling into their game. France again are looking to play possession football and craft openings, Australia are 100mph on the front foot as soon as they seize the ball. 47 mins: Fowler into the action early with a nice interception then a brisk pass forward to Kerr, who was offside. Fowler appears to be in a #10 role, with Foord moving out to the left. 46 mins: Back underway after the break, and there was a change apiece at half-time with Fowler replacing Vine for Australia and Cascarino replacing De Almeida for France. \u201cEvening Jonathan,\u201d evening Phil Withall. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to miss most of the first half, dogs don\u2019t fully appreciate football unless they are chasing one, but from what I\u2019ve seen the tempo of the game is working against the French. Seemingly forcing them to rush their decision making in the final third when a calmer head would possibly have seen them ahead by now. It\u2019s an interesting contest, evenly poised and a hard one to pick an obvious winner from. A perfect appetiser for next week.\u201d Astute observations, as ever Phil. Tactically, France want a moderate tempo, time to spray the ball around, work space, and score a very specific goal \u2013 namely a finish in the box from an overlap cross or cutback. Australia, by contrast, are like a bunch of labrador puppies let loose in an off-leash dog park, eager to chase anything that moves with pure abandon. For France, that means they have to match Australia one-on-one all over the park, dragging them out of position and draining them of energy. For the Matildas, it means they have to make the most of their opportunities because supply will be at a premium against the best sides who have the discipline and technique not to be drawn into the vortex. Plenty of energy and entertainment at Marvel Stadium, but neither side has broken the deadlock. 45+2 mins: Kerr again profits from a ball in broken field after good pressure from the Australian midfield. The cross into the box is not dealt with by France but Raso and Foord get in each other\u2019s way until the former squirts a weak bouncing shot away that Pevraud-Magnin handles with aplomb. 45 + 1 mins: Lovely control from Raso to cushion the long pass out of defence. Neat interplay with Kerr follows, but France do well to win back possession. 45 mins: Catley\u2019s floated delivery flicks away off a head and France clear. 44 mins: After a hectic couple of minutes Karchaoui is booked for a bodycheck on the advancing Foord. It\u2019s fair to say France were not impressed with the decision. 43 mins: Kerr\u2019s ability to make something out of nothing comes to the fore again as she bullies Renard into an error. She wants a free-kick, but it doesn\u2019t arrive, and France go down the other with Geyoro demanding a penalty after tumbling in the box on the burst but Hunt\u2019s slight shirt tug goes unpunished. 41 mins: France enjoy a spell of pressure but the best they can make of it is a Le Sommer header that dribbles wide after a late run into the box. 39 mins: Carpenter is a joy to watch. First she cuts out a dangerous crossfield pass, but she doesn\u2019t just admire her work, she hares off for the return pass and takes play deep into France\u2019s half before trying to trick her way into the box. So dynamic for a nominal right fullback. 37 mins: This Matildas team, set up to play this way, must be very annoying to play against. Effectively more dangerous without the ball, and designed to thrive on broken play and one-percenters. 35 mins: Australia\u2019s approach of backing individuals to win one-on-one duels doesn\u2019t sound the most repeatable strategy, but it continues to offer outlets. A hopeful punt to the left wing ends with Kerr wriggling clear and driving into the box, but not for the first time tonight the cutback fails to hit a target. 33 mins: A scrappy few minutes bursts into life when France pounce on an errant Australian pass. Again they look to the left, and again the cross into the box is dangerous, and again there\u2019s a blue jersey ready to pound home the second ball, and again there\u2019s a gold jersey there to block. Catley denying Diani \u2013 the pair recovering quickly from their clash of heads. 30 mins: Australia\u2019s strategy from defence to attack is so direct. First Carpenter runs 50m with the ball at her feet but the forward combination can\u2019t fashion an opportunity, then Foord shows her super footwork once again and earns a corner. France deal with the set piece confidently, but there\u2019s a stoppage in play after a clash of heads between Catley and Diani. 28 mins: France are concentrating plenty of attention on their left flank where Dali and Bacha have looked bright. They combine to earn a free-kick in a dangerous situation but Renard\u2019s looping flick lands on the roof of the net. 26 mins: That\u2019s better from Pevraud-Magnin, diving bravely at the feet of Foord in the six-yard box after a superb run from the Arsenal forward that saw her played in by Gorry, and waltz beyond Renard with a beautiful bodyswerve. 24 mins: Gorry\u2019s delivery to the near post should be claimed easily by Pevraud-Magnin but she elects to punch, leading to chaos in the box that ends only when Kerr is unfortunate to feel the ball on her hand following a ricochet. 23 mins: Vine and Catley combine well on the left to earn a corner. 22 mins: Australia\u2019s inability (or reluctance?) to retain possession is starting to hurt. France are dominating the ball and squeezing higher up the field. With the pace less frantic the passing is crisper and more methodical. This is exactly the test the Matildas need to work their way through. 20 mins: France should be ahead. The combinations in midfield are starting to click and the ball movement opened space on the left. The dinked cross is headed out but only as far as Geyoro, who smashes a shot into the outstretched leg of Hunt who blocks a certain goal. 18 mins: France have looked as though they\u2019re about to get on top in midfield for the past ten minutes or so, but they keep misplacing a crucial pass and succumbing to Australia\u2019s pace on the counter and having to rebuild from scratch. The latest example sees Vine fail to capitalise on a bouncing ball just on the edge of the penalty area with Les Bleues out of position. 17 mins: The first shot on target comes from France with Bacha stinging Arnold\u2019s palms after a cheap turnover from Hunt coming out of defence. 16 mins: That early frantic energy has dissipated, but neither side has settled into their work yet. Oddly, that quite suits Australia, who hit overdrive at the flick of a switch and turn innocuous broken field play into dangerous sorties. 14 mins: Kerr can\u2019t convert a classic Australian counterattack! After a couple of minutes of French pressure the ball finds Foord in midfield and she accepts the invitation to gallop into space. She has the poise to slide in Kerr behind the defensive line, but the skipper\u2019s first touch is poor and denies her what should have been a clear shooting opportunity. 12 mins: France are starting to grow in midfield with Toletti busy, but Australia have defended the edge of their box stoutly. 11 mins: Gorry\u2019s dinked free-kick from the left of the box looks dangerous in the air but there\u2019s no golden jersey steaming in at the far post to honour the delivery. 10 mins: France are trying to build slowly from the back, but Australia are refusing to allow them an easy out ball with a disciplined press. It\u2019s more urgent and direct when the Matildas get the ball, and from one such incursion Kerr wins a free-kick shielding possession. 8 mins: It\u2019s still like pinball in midfield with neither side able to establish clear patterns of play. 6 mins: Pace again almost works for Australia with Vine storming down the left to overlap but failing to turn the industry into an opportunity. The strategy of using the control and technique of Kerr and Foord centrally, with pacy runners around them, feels like a winning one. 5 mins: A couple of half-chances for France. First Diani has a shot charged down, then Dali drags a better effort wide of the post. There isn\u2019t much a pattern to this game yet, both sides trying to take advantage of scraps of broken play. 3 mins: Raso wastes a good counterattacking opportunity, dwelling in possession and finding her options closed down instead of taking the game on. She also eschewed the overlapping Carpenter, who tore fully 80m at full pelt to join in the forlorn move. I bet she\u2019s thrilled about that. 2 mins: But it\u2019s Australia with the first chance. The Matildas capitalised on some loose passes in the France defence with Kerr eventually sent clear behind, but facing away from goal. Her cutback fails to find a target and the visitors smuggle clear unconvincingly. 1 min: Australia get the ball rolling by pinging a massive long diagonal from the centre of defence to the right wing and out for a France throw. Hopefully not a sign of things to come. France are the first to settle, getting the ball down and giving plenty of players in blue a touch. The Women\u2019s World Cup is 90 minutes away\u2026 Australia will be in their trademark gold jerseys, green shorts and white socks. France top to toe in blue. The Welcome to Country was a powerfully delivered statement, enhanced by the presence of first nations former internationals on the podium. The anthems were as you\u2019d expect with the stirring La Marseillaise making Australia\u2019s effort sound like a twee nursery rhyme. The two sides make their way up the race and into a raucous Marvel Stadium. This is a special moment for women\u2019s football in Australia. By the same token, I\u2019d like to see France play a composed, slow tempo, low block, to ask exactly the kind of questions the Matildas don\u2019t want to answer. Spain passed them to distraction in February with a B team and Australia need to figure out how to respond to those challenges. They will face opponents in the World Cup whose focus is on retaining possession and grinding through a game with multiple stoppages, doing their best to deny that high octane momentum that makes the Matildas look so threatening at their best. There\u2019s going to be plenty of energy from the stands tonight, and lots of expectations around how the Matildas should play. I would like to see them channel that and go full throttle. Take full advantage of the pace of Carpenter, Vine and Raso, and make a statement to France and the rest of the World Cup they\u2019re here to play a certain way, and that way is a million miles per hour. Light the blue touch paper and watch the fireworks. This is very good content. This World Cup really does feel like a tipping point in the perception of women\u2019s football to uninitiated audiences. Joyeux quatorze Juillet mes amis Fran\u00e7ais! Les Bleues also go in with close to their best XI. It\u2019s a side dominated at the back by the powerful Wendie Renard, one of the stars of the past decade, and at the front by goal machine Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer. The Lyon pair may well be heading to their final World Cup, and desperate to do well. France (4-3-3) : Pevraud-Magnin (GK), Lakrar, Renard, De Almedia, Karchaoui / Geyoro, Toletti, Dali / Diani, Le Sommer, Bacha. Gustavsson said he wasn\u2019t going to mess around with his team selection tonight, and he has been true to his word. The starting XI is as expected, and includes the returning Alanna Kennedy for the first time since September. The back four will be the focus of attention with Kennedy partnered by the inexperienced Clare Hunt, while Clare Polkinghorne nurses a foot injury. Both will be delighted that on their outside they find the class of Ellie Carpenter and Steph Catley. Australia: (4-4-2) Arnold (GK), Carpenter, Hunt, Kennedy, Catley / Raso, Cooney-Cross, Gorry Vine / Kerr, Foord. It\u2019s been a chilly midwinter\u2019s day in Melbourne but the frigid air and howling gale will not penetrate a Marvel Stadium with its roof closed. There are expected to be around 50,000 fans crammed inside - which would set a new record for a standalone Matildas fixture. Then we have a focus on the World Cup debutants: As well as the full squad overview: With the World Cup around the corner, there\u2019s plenty of Matildas content to chew over while we wait for kick-off. There are recent features on Katrina Gorry: Kyah Simon: And my personal favourite (and new Real Madrid signing) Hayley Raso: Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of Australia v France from Melbourne\u2019s Marvel Stadium. Kick-off in this World Cup send-off is 7.30pm. With the World Cup kicking off in under a week, tonight offers one last precious opportunity for Tony Gustavsson and Herv\u00e9 Renard to work through their options before the serious action begins. Tenth-ranked Australia and fifth-ranked France will consider themselves among the contenders for the biggest prize in the sport. The Matildas, on home soil, are unlikely to ever have a better opportunity. And they are rising to the occasion nicely. After a long bedding-in period under Gustavsson, performances and results have started to come good. Eight wins from nine matches, dating back to last October are testament to the progress, a run featuring five clean sheets, an away win to European champions England, and the development of impressive squad depth. Another win tonight will light the blue touch paper on the most eagerly anticipated World Cup campaign in Australian history - male or female. After a tumultuous few months last year, France are also peaking just at the right time under the experience of men\u2019s World Cup specialist Renard. Les Bleus are unbeaten in seven - a stretch featuring six wins - as the squad returns to normality, just as it seemed their World Cup hopes would be wrecked by infighting. Bastille Day offers an ideal opportunity to channel that revolutionary spirit. I\u2019ll be back with teams news and insights from the two camps shortly.

Without an improvement in MMR vaccination rates, the capital could experience an outbreak of between 40,000 and 160,0000 cases, fresh analysis by the UKHSA suggests. Experts said an outbreak of this scale could lead to dozens of deaths and thousands of people hospitalised. Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: \u201cMeasles can be a serious infection that can lead to complications especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems. Due to longstanding suboptimal vaccine uptake there is now a very real risk of seeing big outbreaks in London.\u201d Official data published on Friday revealed a steady rise in measles cases this year, indicating a resurgence of the illness. Between 1 January and 30 June this year there have been 128 cases of measles, compared with 54 cases in the whole of 2022, with 66% of the cases detected in London, although cases have been seen in all regions. Measles can lead to severe illness, with an estimated 20-40% of children hospitalised, according to the UKHSA. The US Centre for Disease Control estimates one to two in 1,000 children infected will die from measles, with a larger number suffering serious complications, including intellectual disabilities and deafness. \u201cUKHSA is right to be worried about this,\u201d said Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, saying that an outbreak of the scale described would be expected to lead to \u201cdozens of deaths\u201d. \u201cMeasles is one of the most infectious viruses to infect humans,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout two in 1,000 infected people will die, the main risk being in children under five years old, but adults can get very sick as well.\u201d Measles is the most infectious of all diseases transmitted through the respiratory route. In a population with no immunity, a single case of measles will infect between 10 and 20 others. To maintain herd immunity, the World Health Organization set a target of 95% vaccination uptake. But the UK is far below this target, with uptake for the first dose of the MMR vaccine in children aged two years in England at 85.6%, the lowest level in a decade. In some parts of London, coverage of the first MMR dose at two years of age is as low as 69.5%. \u201cWith measles being so infectious once the vaccine uptake rate falls you can\u2019t rely on herd immunity from other parents vaccinating their children to protect you child if you do not get them immunised and in London particularly we are approaching that point,\u201d said Hunter. Susceptibility is particularly high among 19- to 25-year-olds, affected by unfounded vaccine scare stories in the early 2000s linked to publications by the discredited doctor Andrew Wakefield. Until now, unvaccinated people in this group had benefited from \u201cherd immunity\u201d, the indirect protection given by good overall vaccine coverage in the population. This also shields very young infants and other vulnerable groups. Outside London, the risk of a large measles outbreak is low, UKHSA modelling suggests, but there is the potential for smaller outbreaks in specific populations including teenagers, young people and under-vaccinated groups, such as the Charedi Orthodox Jewish community, Travellers and recent migrants. MMR is part of the NHS routine childhood immunisation programme and parents whose infants missed out, or anyone of any age unvaccinated, are urged to come forward. Parents should check their children are fully vaccinated with two MMR doses, which gives 99% lifelong protection, by checking their red book or with their GP practice, which younger and older adults can also do. Anyone not up to date should make an appointment as soon as possible. The NHS has launched a national campaign to encourage the uptake of the MMR vaccine, included target outreach work in London for those at highest risk and in communities with the lowest update. All children at primary school who have missed one or both doses of the MMR vaccine are being offered the opportunity to get up to date at school. Parents of those children will be contacted by the NHS school immunisation service. Parents of younger children or those who are home-schooled can make an appointment with their GP practice or visit a community clinic. \u201cMeasles spreads very easily but is preventable,\u201d said Saliba. \u201cTo help protect ourselves, our families and those around us it is vital we all ensure we are vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine, free on the NHS whatever your age.\u201d Jane Clegg, the chief nurse for the NHS in London, said: \u201cMeasles can easily spread between unvaccinated people and can be serious, but it is preventable, which is why we continue to encourage Londoners to take up the vaccine \u2013 with GPs calling over 10,000 parents of unvaccinated children, and hundreds booking appointments to get vaccinated as a result.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380aeb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/13/more-extreme-weather-across-us", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Floods, tornadoes, heat: more extreme weather predicted across US", "lead": "Over a third of Americans under extreme heat warnings as Vermont, still recovering from historic flooding, prepares for more storms", "author": "Kari Paul and agency", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:57:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096350", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4ca50fbeec2c85cf9d8dc0f406cdc73ba03c1a81/0_0_4930_2958/500.jpg", "body": "The US is bracing for more extreme weather from coast to coast, with a heatwave hitting California, tornados in the midwest and the east expecting more rain as it continues to reel from historic flooding. Residents of Vermont, still suffering from an onslaught of dangerous weather in recent days, are preparing for another round of severe storms in the area beginning as early as Thursday night. Historic flooding in the state has damaged thousands of homes, businesses and roads, and has left some residents stranded. One death was confirmed by the state department of health, a 63-year-old man who drowned in his home. More than 200 rescues and 100 evacuations have taken place as a result of the extreme storms. Across the US, more than a third of Americans were under extreme heat advisories, watches and warnings as the heatwave baking the nation spread further into California. The sweltering conditions were expected to build on Friday and through the weekend in central and southern California, where many residents were told to prepare for the hottest weather of the year by the National Weather Service. Highs in inland desert areas were predicted to top 120F (48.8C) during the day and remain in the 80s (above 26.6C) overnight, offering little relief. Elsewhere, officials prepared to repurpose public libraries, senior centers and police department lobbies as cooling centers, especially in desert areas. In Death Valley, visitors who dare venture into the hottest and driest place on will be watching the thermometers this weekend to see if the national park in California breaks the record for highest recorded temperature there \u2013 134F (56.6C) in 1913, according to the National Park Service. In Vermont, as floodwaters receded, dams were holding up on Thursday and more roads reopened. But strong thunderstorms are expected to move into parts of the state by Thursday night, which could cause hail, more flash floods and even a tornado. Transportation officials were moving equipment to areas that were considered more flood-prone to prepare for the storms as they continued to evaluate damage, including to rail lines. Amtrak and other railroad service has been suspended. \u201cThe period we are more concerned about is Sunday because that could be more widespread and heavier, but not nearly on the scale of what we saw earlier in the week,\u201d said Seth Kutikoff, a National Weather Service meteorologist. Other north-eastern states have been affected by the storms, including Connecticut, where officials warned boaters and others about dangerous debris in the Connecticut River, and New Hampshire, where some roads, towns and campgrounds have seen flooding. \u201cWe strongly encourage residents and visitors, especially campers staying at sites along rivers and streams, and campgrounds in low-lying parts, to know what to do if evacuation is needed,\u201d said Robert Buxton, the director of the state\u2019s homeland security and management agency. One death in New York was blamed on the storm \u2013 a woman whose body was found after she was swept away in Fort Montgomery, a small Hudson River community about 45 miles (72km) north of New York City. At least eight people were rescued as torrential rain deluged central Mississippi and sent water over roads and into homes and businesses. Louisville\u2019s mayor, Will Hill, declared a state of emergency on Thursday and urged people not to drive during the storm, saying the situation was not a typical flash flood. On Thursday evening he said flood waters were subsiding but that \u201cwhat we experienced was not just a 100-year flood but a 1,000-year flood\u201d. The extreme weather trend this week has not been isolated to the north-east: the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for parts of Colorado and Kansas, and issued a severe thunderstorm watch for parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The agency also warned of severe thunderstorms in areas of Oklahoma, with risks of very large hail and damaging wind gusts. Phoenix hit 110F (43C) for the 14th consecutive day on Thursday, putting it on track for a possible new record next week. The longest measured stretch of 110F-plus temperatures for the city is 18 days, recorded in 1974. The overnight low temperature at Phoenix Sky Harbor international airport on Thursday morning was 95F (35C), which means temperatures may not be dropping far enough to allow people to recover after dark. Forecasters said the long-duration heat wave was extremely dangerous, especially for older people, homeless residents and other vulnerable populations. The heat could persist into next week as a high-pressure dome moves west from Texas. In California, with the state fair prepared to kick off on Friday in Sacramento, organizers were forced to cancel planned horseracing events due to concerns for animal safety. Florida has experienced record-breaking temperatures this week, with the National Weather Service issuing alerts for southern parts of the state into late Thursday. The onslaught of extreme weather has brought into focus the dire implications of the climate crisis, which rages on with little meaningful intervention from lawmakers, according to advocates. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration revealed in its latest monthly global climate report that this June was the hottest month globally on record, on both land and sea.

On the evidence of Friday night\u2019s friendly in Melbourne, she was right. Australia\u2019s only warm-up match on the eve of the Women\u2019s World Cup was near-perfect preparation, downing European championship semi-finalists France with a solitary strike from substitute Mary Fowler. With fluid counter-attacking, defensive mettle and composed displays from veterans and newcomers alike, the Matildas appear in fine form ahead of their campaign opener against Ireland next week. Expectations are sky-high, but just six days out from their first home World Cup, the Australians seemed unfazed. Before a near-capacity crowd of 50,629 \u2013 a record attendance for the Matildas on home soil \u2013 Australian coach Tony Gustavsson opted for a full-strength line-up. Alanna Kennedy was back in the fold after a nine-month injury-induced absence, while Steph Catley and Caitlin Foord also returned to the starting XI. Since taking over the Matildas in late 2020, Gustavsson has emphasised the importance of playing against highly-ranked opposition \u2013 and this game would be no different. But there was no gulf in class in the opening tussles, as No 5-ranked France struggled to contain the No 10-ranked Australia. It may have been pin-ball football, with neither team able to find a consistent tempo, but it suited Australia all the same. The Matildas\u2019 attacking quartet of Kerr, Ford, Cortnee Vine and Hayley Raso \u2013 aided in large measure part by flying wingbacks Catley and Ellie Carpenter \u2013 frequently found space on the counter-attack. Kerr had an early chance with barely two minutes gone, while Foord tried to dribble the ball into goal midway through the half. Wave after wave of attacking football lit up crowd; too often the decisive penultimate pass or final touch were missing, but it offered good omens for the tournament ahead. Yet in what might be another theme of the World Cup to come, the attacking raids also left the Matildas defensively exposed on more than one occasion. France\u2019s first chance came after 16 minutes, with a driving effort from Lyon\u2019s Selma Bacha instinctively parried by Australian custodian Mackenzie Arnold. Another opportunity came for Les Bleues just minutes later, the ball bobbling around dangerously in the Matildas\u2019 box, but France failed to capitalise. And so it would remain for the rest of the first-half: partial chances aplenty, France boasting more of the possession and the Matildas happy to hit on the counter-attack. Following the evenly-balanced first-half, lady luck shone on the Matildas midway through the second and the game changed with two decisive moments only minutes apart. Just as France\u2019s midfield was beginning to assert its dominance, French forward Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer was brought down heavily by Catley in the Matildas\u2019 box. Replays suggested a penalty was deserved, but with the video assistant referee not operational until the tournament begins next week, the Matildas escaped unscathed. A handful of minutes later, half-time substitute Fowler ended the deadlock. It was vintage Matildas: Kyra Cooney-Cross marauding forward on the counter-attack, finding Raso who burst down the right-hand flank towards the byline, picking out the on-rushing Fowler in the French box. The 20-year-old had earlier looked nervous in her opening touches, but there was no hesitation as she controlled the ball with one touch and fired past Pauline Peyraud-Magnin. France were unable to wrest back control in the final part of the game, stunned by the double-blow of the non-penalty and Fowler\u2019s strike. The only asterisk to the Matildas\u2019 perfect preparation was an injury concern for Yallop, who twisted her leg awkwardly in a challenge. The national team stalwart tried to jog off the pain, but was ultimately withdrawn. Gustavsson will be hoping that Yallop\u2019s fourth World Cup is not over before it began. France\u2019s Bacha also suffered in a late clash, stretchered off in the dying minutes of extra-time \u2013 causing visible distress to club teammate Carpenter, only recently recovered from a long-term injury herself. Despite the date, there would be no Bastille Day celebrations for the French visitors at Marvel Stadium. But for Australian fans, Kerr\u2019s Matildas were true to their word. They\u2019re ready \u2013 and the World Cup is almost here."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380aed", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/14/not-just-for-the-boys-women-take-on-worlds-toughest-mountain-bike-track", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s super-important\u2019: women take on world\u2019s toughest mountain bike track", "lead": "Female bikers at Hardline course in Wales hope to inspire girls to compete on extreme courses", "author": "Steven Morris", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:55:05", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096385", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2232ae42aba202f1f902c6890eaa1683495cac65/0_386_8192_4918/500.jpg", "body": "Snaking down a Welsh mountain, featuring nerve-jangling jumps and screeching turns, the Hardline course is reputed to be the toughest downhill mountain bike track in the world, a severe test of body and mind for the boldest riders. Until now it has been a male preserve, but this year a group of women from the UK, New Zealand, Canada and Argentina have joined the men hurtling through the forest at up to 40mph (64km/h), determined to show that this toughest of tracks is not just for the boys. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely important for the sport,\u201d said Tahn\u00e9e Seagrave, one of the two British women who have been tackling the course at Dinas Mawddwy on the rugged fringes of Eryri (Snowdonia) national park. \u201cWe\u2019re followed by a lot of girls and young riders on social media. If they see us here, they\u2019ll get inspired.\u201d Another of the six women, a New Zealander, Jess Blewitt, said: \u201cIt\u2019s super-important women are doing it. Everyone\u2019s always saying: \u2018Girls can\u2019t ride like the boys.\u2019 It\u2019s not just in this sport but in every sport. Girls are just not part of some events. So it\u2019s good to push the women\u2019s side.\u201d The Hardline course was built a decade ago to challenge the world\u2019s best downhill mountain bikers. Each year a small invited field \u2013 around 30 this summer \u2013 gather on the mountain above the Dyfi valley for the Red Bull Hardline race. It takes about three minutes to get down, negotiating features including the infamous Road Gap, which requires riders to complete a 17-metre (55ft) jump over a fire road high above the heads of spectators, but also dodging outcrops of rocks, tree roots, narrow gaps, coping with mud and the unreliable Welsh weather. Over the years the course has broken bones and bruised egos, but some of the world\u2019s best riders come and the magazine GQ has called the race one of the greatest live sport experiences on earth, putting it alongside events like Wimbledon and the Masters golf tournament. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing that compares to Hardline,\u201d said Seagrave, a world-class downhill mountain biker born in London and based in Wales. \u201cThe jumps are huge, the technical element is intimidating. And you\u2019ve often got tough weather. It was surreal the first time I put tyres to dirt \u2013 incredible\u201d The race itself takes place over this weekend and the women are unlikely to take part, especially as the weather is dodgy, but having them on site training at what organisers are calling a \u201cprogression camp\u201d is seen as a positive development. Seagrave isn\u2019t keen on the term \u201cprogression camp\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a hangout, a chance to see what the women can do.\u201d She says there are a number of reasons why women have not competed on the Hardline yet. \u201cWe\u2019re not built the same, we\u2019re wired sightly differently.\u201d But Seagrave thinks the main issue is that women have not had the experience of this sort of extreme track. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been exposed to the features. It\u2019s very intimidating when you see them for the first time. The men have been coming here for years.\u201d The male riders have been supportive, taking the women on runs through the sections, \u201ctowing\u201d, or guiding, them through the route. \u201cFor me the win has been having the girls on bikes on the track ticking off some of the features,\u201d said Seagrave. Blewitt, 21, was the first woman to get out on the Hardline last year. I wanted to start pushing the women\u2019s side of the sport there,\u201d she said. It ended painfully when she broke her collarbone after falling on a feature called The Renegade. \u201cThere are five other girls with me this year, which is a big deal. Some of the drops are so heavy. The landings are definitely a lot harder for a female. And we don\u2019t have the same mentality as the guys. They say: \u2018My mate\u2019s hit it, so I\u2019m going to hit it.\u2019 They don\u2019t care as much. Girls definitely take a bit longer to think: \u2018I\u2019m going to hit that.\u2019\u201d Gee Atherton, a two times downhill mountain bike champion and Hardline veteran, said he was pleased the women were there. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying course to roll up to - intimidating with the mountain looming over you. If you turn up with a good crew, you spur each other on.\u201d He says it isn\u2019t the physicality that makes it such a hard course for women. \u201cI think it\u2019s the aggression. You have to rip the bike through some of the sections. There are heavy landings and turns, sometimes you have to be a bit aggressive with the bike. That\u2019s what they have to learn to deal with. It will come, no doubt.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380aee", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/14/nokia-and-ericsson-shares-fall-as-cost-of-living-crisis-hits-telecoms-sales", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nokia and Ericsson shares fall as cost of living crisis hits telecoms sales", "lead": "Finnish company lowers profit expectations, while Swedish firm expects flat or \u2018slightly up\u2019 margins", "author": "Mark Sweney", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:45:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096404", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fc2235b14d623ac83a5b2313055741af65757c8d/24_211_3908_2346/500.jpg", "body": "Shares in Nokia and Ericsson fell after the telecommunications equipment suppliers warned that profits and sales were being hit by a slowdown in spending as the cost of living crisis hit consumer spending. Nokia moved to cut its annual sales forecast and lowered its expectations on profit margin this year citing the knock-on effect of high inflation and rising interest rates on consumer spending. The Finnish company, which in 2021 announced up to 10,000 job cuts globally in an attempt to compete with rivals in the race to supply 5G telecoms equipment, cut the range of expected sales this year from between \u20ac24.6bn (\u00a321.1bn) and \u20ac26.2bn to \u20ac23.2bn and \u20ac24.6bn. Shares in Nokia, which also reduced the top end of its range for profit margins from 14% to 13%, plunged by 9.6% on Friday \u2013 the biggest fall in two years. \u201cThe weaker demand outlook in the second half is due to both the macroeconomic environment and customers\u2019 inventory digestion,\u201d the firm said, indicating belt-tightening consumers are holding back on upgrading devices such as mobile phones. \u201cCustomer spending plans are increasingly impacted by high inflation and rising interest rates along with some projects now slipping to 2024 \u2013 notably in North America.\u201d The company, which this year completed a two-year plan to reduce its global workforce to \u201creset\u201d its cost base for future investment, hinted that more cuts could be on the way. \u201cAcross the group, Nokia has been proactively managing costs to protect profitability,\u201d it said. \u201cAs it progresses through this period of uncertainty, Nokia will continue to take measures to ensure it remains on track towards its long-term targets of growing faster than the market.\u201d Shares in Ericsson fell by 8.7% to the lowest level since 2018 after the Swedish telecoms equipment maker said profit margins would be only flat or \u201cslightly up\u201d in the third quarter, compared with analyst consensus expectations of 10%. \u201cWe expect that the market will see a gradual recovery in late 2023 and improve in 2024,\u201d said B\u00f6rje Ekholm, the president and chief executive of Ericsson. In February, Ericsson announced plans to cut 8,500 employees globally to reduce costs. Like Nokia, Ericsson pointed in particular to the deteriorating market in North America, where the company experienced a \u201csharp decline\u201d in sales in the second quarter, although it said this was partly offset by growth in India. The cost of living crisis is forcing telecoms companies to cut staff and costs to compete, while also introducing inflation-busting price increases for customers. In May, the mobile operator Vodafone announced that it would cut 11,000 jobs globally over the next three years as part of a \u20ac1bn savings strategy. BT recently said it expected to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, about 40% of its total workforce, because of factors including the completion of building 5G and full-fibre broadband networks and the implementation of artificial intelligence throughout its business."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380aef", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/14/reading-mess-men-women-relegated-squad-part-time", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A right Royals mess: Reading paying heavy price for rolling the dice ", "lead": "Relegated men have threadbare squad and may be docked points and women\u2019s team, also demoted, are now part-time", "author": "Ben Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:39:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096425", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/45265f92a0f5df307b5b8e07213109303c26675e/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Roll the dice. It is said to be one of the Reading owner Dai Yongge\u2019s go-to phrases but it can feel foolish at the best of times, let alone amid the current backdrop. A thirst to hurriedly elevate the club to the Premier League, after a near-miss six years ago, has spectacularly backfired. Three weeks out from Reading\u2019s first season in the third tier since 2001-02, they are playing catch-up. They have a threadbare squad with a handful of fit senior players, a disillusioned fanbase and a manager who only took charge on Friday, 18 days after being appointed, because of delays obtaining a work permit. They also face the threat of another points deduction after failing to pay wages on time. Dai, who made his fortune turning disused air-raid shelters into shopping malls in China, has spent about \u00a3250m in the six years since he and his sister, Dai Xiu Li, acquired Reading but aside from a sleek training facility, he has very little to show for it. \u201cIt\u2019s legalised gambling,\u201d says Paula Martin, chair of the Supporters Trust at Reading of the financial approach. \u201cThrow money at it, and possibly with better advice so that we bought more appropriate players at the time, the gamble might have paid off and we might have been in the Premier League by now.\u201d But it didn\u2019t. Local MPs, including Theresa May, recently raised concerns with the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Lucy Frazer. Since reaching the Championship playoff final in 2017, Reading have been in steady decline, circling the drain almost every season until being relegated in May. The entire club has been affected by dropping into League One, with the women\u2019s team going part-time after relegation from the Women\u2019s Super League. Thirteen players were released, including Grace Moloney, who had been at the club for 14 years. It is symptomatic of Reading\u2019s troubles that their flight from a pre-season training camp in Alicante was cancelled last week, leaving the squad to make their way back to England in dribs and drabs and prompting their friendly at Bristol City to be cancelled at short notice. So too is Paul Ince, who was sacked in April, still being listed as first-team manager on the club\u2019s website. The former Southampton interim manager Rub\u00e9n Sell\u00e9s, appointed after talks with Chris Wilder broke down, was at the training camp in Spain, getting to know the squad, but was not able to take any sessions because his work visa was not approved until this week. The fear is that Reading have been left firmly behind by their promotion rivals. In recent weeks Mr Dai has effectively drip-fed payments to lift some of the gloom. A few glimmers of light arrived this week, first when Reading\u2019s academy regained Category One status after satisfying the Football Association their debts were in hand. Then a transfer embargo was lifted on Wednesday after Reading paid an outstanding \u00a3500,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, which had served the club with a winding-up petition over unpaid tax. The hearing, scheduled for 9 August, should now pass without note. Two other factors had been behind the embargo: breaching the terms of a business plan agreed in November 2021 after breaking the English Football League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules, and failing to pay loan clubs. Reading owed about \u00a3500,000 to clubs from whom they loaned players last season but settled that last week. While under the embargo they were limited to signing free agents, unable to pay agents and could offer players a maximum of \u00a31,400 a week. Reading still face severe restrictions around paying fees owing to previous breaches. Reading want to add 10-12 playersbut have missed out on targets because of the embargo. Agents have naturally looked elsewhere for their clients. Many of the players who have stayed had their wages halved upon relegation. The 34-year-old Theo Walcott, who has a strong relationship with Sell\u00e9s from their time at Southampton, has been training with the club and could join. Andy Carroll has a contract until next summer. Reading failed to pay players on time and in full on three occasions last season. Those payments are understood to have arrived a few days late and Reading cited mitigating circumstances, including administrative delays because of a public holiday. Staff have heard various stories but the recurring one relates to issues with cashflow and getting money out of China. Reading are optimistic they will receive a suspended points deduction but an independent commission will determine the sanction. A hat-trick of points deductions in three successive seasons remains a distinct possibility. Reading lost all their senior players who were out of contract, with Tom Ince among those who walked away. He has joined Watford. Yakou M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 has signed for Cardiff. The squad that flew to Spain was beefed out by academy players and trialists, one of whom, Harvey Knibbs, signed on Thursday. A reasonably positive week, by recent standards, papers over the cracks. \u201cWe can all get very positive and think, \u2018Here we go\u2019, but how long for?\u201d says Martin. \u201cAt the moment it is short-term problems but they are indicative of long-term problems.\u201d Mr Dai speaks little English and communication between the owner and decision-makers is largely dependent on Dayong Pang, the chief executive and a de facto translator. Pang replaced the respected Nigel Howe, who served on the EFL board. Another key departure was Bryan Stabler, the finance director who retired last month after 22 years at the club. Kia Joorabchian, the agent who has disputed his influence at the club, is a confidant of the owner. The relationship between the owners and the fanbase is severely fractured and a protest by the fans\u2019 group Sell Before We Dai, an umbrella of five supporters\u2019 groups, is scheduled for Reading\u2019s friendly at Sutton United on Saturday. \u201cThere is a lot of panic at the moment,\u201d says Nick Houlton of Sell Before We Dai. The protest group has written to Mr Dai and Pang in Mandarin to raise concerns. They are still none the wiser as to Mr Dai\u2019s motivations for taking ownership of the club. The previous Thai owners still own the land surrounding the stadium. There is plenty of work to do on the women\u2019s side too. The job advert for a manager, after Kelly Chambers departed after 16 years, closed on Monday. Their only contracted goalkeeper, Jackie Burns, will miss the start of the season through injury. Emma Mukandi, one of those players to depart, said she hopes the club \u201cbegins to back women\u2019s football and gives the players and staff the respect that they deserve\u201d. Mr Dai has invested \u00a36m across the past five years but the annual funding required for the second tier has dropped to a five-figure sum. \u201cIt is so disappointing that basically the women\u2019s team are taking the hit for what\u2019s happening to the club in general,\u201d says Martin. The women\u2019s football review published on Thursday highlighted concern around the reliance on men\u2019s teams\u2019 infrastructure. There is a general understanding that it would be better, to coin a phrase used by Reading\u2019s former owner Sir John Madejski, for the team to be able to wash its own face.

West Lindsey district council is challenging the plans to move people into the RAF Scampton site in Lincolnshire, while Braintree district council and a local man, Gabriel Clarke-Holland, are bringing a case over moves to Wethersfield airbase in north Essex, where the Home Office started placing asylum seekers on Wednesday. A high court challenge earlier this week sought permission for judicial review of this issue. The two councils and Clarke-Holland brought the case against the home secretary and the levelling up secretary. Fifteen grounds were brought forward and three were granted on Friday, including permitted development planning grounds, and equality impact grounds. The first 46 asylum seekers who arrived at Wethersfield on Wednesday were brought from a processing facility in Kent over the weekend after crossing to the UK in small boats. Home Office officials said there would be 4,200 new bed spaces created by moving people on to the Bibby Stockholm barge, which will be moored in Dorset, and the two military bases. The three claimants argued in the high court that the plans were being forced through by Suella Braverman, the home secretary, using wartime emergency powers to circumvent adequate planning consultations. Lawyers for Clarke-Holland said the judicial review claims were significant for asylum seekers and communities across the UK, because they would affect whether the government could set up \u201cpotentially unsuitable and harmful military-style accommodation for asylum seekers, without any consultation, in remote areas of the UK, by using emergency powers to bypass planning regulations\u201d. Mrs Justice Thornton DBE heard arguments in all three claims jointly to decide if they should be granted permission to proceed to a full hearing. The court heard that the far-right group Britain First had demonstrated at Wethersfield. The claimants argued that government should not rely on a planning rule known as Class Q \u2013 where planning permission is not required because usage is for a maximum period of 12 months when there is an \u201cemergency\u201d \u2013 while, in fact, the government\u2019s intention was to use the sites for a much longer period. Therefore, they argued, ministers should obtain planning permission and an environment impact assessment screening. In written arguments submitted to the high court, the government dismissed these arguments and said that if any longer-term use was required planning permission could be sought further down the line. The Home Office stated that an \u201cemergency\u201d could be defined not just as a one-off event but as something that could occur \u201cover a period of time and/or which is of a continuing nature\u201d. Councillor Graham Butland, the leader of Braintree district council, said: \u201cWe are pleased that [the judge] granted us permission to proceed with our judicial review on the following challenges: environmental impact assessment, reliance on the use of permitted development rights and equality impact assessment. \u201cWe are grateful to have had another opportunity to put our views and the views of our local community across to the high court. We still believe Wethersfield airfield is not a suitable site for these plans.\u201d The Home Office has been approached for comment."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380af1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/14/thanks-to-barbie-the-high-ponytail-is-back-in-but-is-it-for-everyone", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Thanks to Barbie, the high ponytail is back in \u2013 but is it for everyone?", "lead": "With Greta Gerwig\u2019s hotly anticipated film upon us, interest in the Barbie aesthetic has shot up.

However, some are slightly newer devotees. With the new Barbie film \u2013 starring Margot Robbie and directed by Greta Gerwig, hitting screens next week \u2013 Barbie-inspired style has boomed. From collaborations with Crocs and Aldo, to searches for \u201cBarbie-inspired outfit\u201d up 600%, magenta mini dresses and rose-coloured heels are swishing firmly into the spotlight. But it\u2019s Barbie\u2019s hair that is most interesting, at least to me. High, slick Barbie ponytails have evolved over the years with small tweaks, but their inspiration is still very much focused on the original doll \u2013 and mostly on caucasian hair types. The first Barbie doll, released in 1959, featured a ponytail with bumped ends and a mullet-like fringe (pictured above). Margot Robbie was shown in one trailer with a revised version of the original look: a sleek half-up, half-down do and a braided low ponytail with a Barbie twist. \u201cThe Barbie ponytail we are seeing now is a playful look on a classic up-do, so the tail itself has a bit more swing,\u201d says celebrity hairstylist Pete Burkill, whose clients include Kylie Minogue. Since the trailer was released, searches for \u201cBarbie ponytail\u201d have shot up, according to Pinterest\u2019s Tom Spratt. Data from the image-sharing site from January to April captures the demand, with searches of \u201cBarbie ponytail\u201d increasing by 190%. Elsewhere, videos with the hashtag #barbiedollponytail on TikTok have had more than 410m views, while celebrities such as Lizzo and Millie Bobby Brown are championing it, both on and off stage. This hype has caused the Barbie ponytail to inspire new variations. These include the side-swoop pony (where hair is parted to the side in an arch like shape, framing the face) a tightly slicked-back pony, and another with dramatic edges with baby hairs styled artistically around the hairline. \u201cThe most popular look for summer 2023 is ensuring to flick out the ends of your hair for full Barbie effect,\u201d says Burkill. But is this an inclusive trend? Throughout the years, Barbie has grappled with accusations of promoting a lack of diversity, andpushing unhealthy societal stereotypes about desirability. (In response, manufacturer Mattel released a line of Barbies in 2016 that represented society today. Its chief brand officer at the time, Juliana Chung, said: \u201cWe changed Barbie\u2019s shape. We changed her look. But we wanted Barbie to be reflective of society, so that all girls around the world could relate to this character.\u201d) Meanwhile, hair segregation and discrimination has historically been a universal problem in a fashion industry that is often focused on models of European origin. As for the Barbie ponytail, it is typically easier to recreate on caucasian hair because it\u2019s easier to mould, with fewer curls. However, many women of colour have decided to try it nonetheless. TikTok user Jaymme Lassey decided to get a Barbie ponytail for her 23rd birthday party. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if the ponytail would look nice or damage my curls as I have 4c hair [the tightest curl type],\u201d she says. \u201cBut when I searched the hashtag on Twitter I saw so many Black girls getting it done, so I was sold.\u201d Lassey advocates for TikTok as a positive force for changing stereotypes about the versatility of certain hairstyles. \u201cI always thought if I had to straighten my hair it would get damaged and so I automatically excluded myself from what I thought were Eurocentric hairstyles. But the Barbie pony taught me that this wasn\u2019t the case\u201d. As brand Barbie enters into a new era of championing inclusion (the film features \u201cdolls\u201d of many different races and body types), the hair trend has followed suit. Specifically, embellished and creative spins on the Barbie ponytail by Black users have gone viral on TikTok. Of course it isn\u2019t the first time that Black celebrities have sported similar styles (at a Fenty Beauty event last year, Rihanna paired her pony with a custom Coperni outfit which celebrated her baby bump), but it does feel significant that it is part of a wider hair trend from which Black hair may have once been excluded. The hair stylist and forecaster Tom Smith says the look has surged thanks to its simplicity. \u201cWhen something incredibly simple and practical becomes fashionable it is massively attractive for many,\u201d he says. \u201cSo often, following fashion trends or self care routines mean extra work and learning new skills \u2013 for the vast majority, a ponytail is doable.\u201d To read the complete version of this newsletter \u2013 complete with this week\u2019s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved \u2013 subscribe here to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox every Thursday."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380af2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/14/sublime-futurism-renaissance-inspiration-and-getting-smashed-the-week-in-art", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sublime futurism, Renaissance inspiration and getting smashed \u2013 the week in art", "lead": "Herzog &amp; de Meuron build their dreams, Paula Rego cultivates Crivelli\u2019s garden and Lindsey Mendick binge drinks<strong> </strong>\u2013 all in your weekly dispatch", "author": "Jonathan Jones", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:27:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096481", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a355cae289ec0360c0f8fb4c3d1abf06a38cf4/0_668_11051_6632/500.jpg", "body": "Exhibition of the week Lindsey Mendick: Sh*tfaced Ceramics and psychology come together in Shitfaced, a show about binge-drinking.

But far from seeing him as a conservative dullard, the French avant garde recognised his intensity and originality. Corot, born in 1796, ploughed his own furrow, painting silent, calm, poetic rural scenes that straddle the Romantic age and the early years of modernism. This painting may even be subtly influenced by the impressionist appetite for strong sunlight. It\u2019s a tender hymn to the French countryside by an artist who loved his national landscapes as much as John Constable loved Suffolk. \u2022 National Gallery, London Don\u2019t forget To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

The royal imprimatur can only help my campaign for this piece of life-affirming sanity to be imported into our own domestic arrangements. I find that married life requires too many compromises during the daytime for me to contemplate the prospect of more during the night \u2013 getting woken up by snoring and having to prod him on to his side to stop it, getting too hot because of the entire other body next to me, getting trapped under a flung-out deadweight leg etc, etc, etc. The biggest difference between men and women is this: women can turn under a duvet without taking the whole thing with them. I don\u2019t know why \u2013 maybe our socialisation runs so deep that we are able to self-efface even when unconscious,. But until it changes, I shall be citing Charles and \u2018Mills as our bedroom gurus. Not a sentence I ever thought I would be writing but times, if not duvet practices, change, my friends. Tuesday More good news from our anointed leaders! Nigella has announced that she can no longer be arsed to throw fancy dinner parties. The domestic goddess obviously didn\u2019t put it quite like that but that was definitely the gist. Now she\u2019s all about Twiglets starters (well, just once, for Americans to whom she felt she had a duty to introduce to at least one national dish), and a big main course with everybody helping themselves, dressing how they like and just getting stuck in. This is such good news. Not because I have ever had or will have a dinner party (no time, no inclination, no ability, no space, no friends) but because it lessens the guilt about not having them. I\u2019ve reached a stage in life when a reduction in guilt about the things I am not doing is the very most I ask for. All bigger, better dreams and ambitions long ago foundered on the rocks of experience and have been smashed to smithereens by waves of \u2026 well, further experience really. Now when I don\u2019t say: \u201cCome round for a meal!\u201d I am only not saying: \u201cCome round for some crisps and a big panful of stuff\u201d instead of not asking them to turn up for a delicious five-course extravaganza with fine wines, candles\u2019n\u2019nice frocks and an effortlessly contrived air of easeful glamour. Much better. Wednesday OK, I have a question: how do people have time? Time for what? I hear you ask. Time for anything, I mean. And time for the everything they are all apparently doing, a non-comprehensive list of which includes: commuting; doing their jobs (usually including unpaid overtime); side hustles; charity work; maintaining diet; fitness; skincare and depilation regimes; watching and having opinions on all the latest big TV series from Love Island to Succession; and a choice handful of undiscovered gems such as listening to all the podcasts - every single one; curating Instagram accounts; taking care of children (plural, usually); pets and ailing parents; cooking (maybe even for dinner parties \u2013 see above); cleaning; gardening; seeing friends; going to the cinema; reading books. I do my job (which requires no commuting except between bed and desk), have the occasional shower, meet only the most basic needs of one single, amenable 12-year-old child, and fall unstoppably asleep on the sofa every night by 10. I haven\u2019t shaved my legs since 2019. WHERE ARE THE SECRET HOURS EVERYONE ELSE FINDS? And could you send any spare ones to me, please? I \u2013 and anyone who has seen me from the knees down \u2013 am begging you. Thursday News reaches us \u2013 brace yourselves please \u2013 that Nadine Dorries has \u2026 is \u201cwritten\u201d the word? Maybe we\u2019ll settle on \u201ctyped\u201d \u2026 Anyway, she has produced a book called The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson, which is to be published (and consider this a threat, warning or promise according to your affiliations) on 28 September, a few days before Tory conference. The former culture secretary promises it will reveal the \u201cdark arts\u201d behind Johnson\u2019s departure from No 10. Yes, they are a mystery, aren\u2019t they? What has always been a true mystery is quite what drives Dorries in the matter of her unassailable loyalty to Johnson. Many theories have abounded but I would like to put forward my own: it\u2019s the hair. His and hers. She thinks she\u2019s the seventh Johnson (or eighth or ninth or tenth \u2013 however the whole thing eventually plays out on ancestry.com) and is operating out of family loyalty. I mean out of an abstract notion of family loyalty, not the Johnsonian version itself \u2013 that\u2019s a rather threadbare thing \u2013 but still, of all the options this is the only one I can think of that makes even an iota of sense. If someone dyed her hair brunette while she slept one night, this whole thing could be over. Friday As a belated birthday present from my husband and child who apparently cannot follow emailed links to the Moleskine notebooks website, I am being given A Day Off. Truly, this is the world I dreamed of as a 19-year-old feminist clutching my Andrea Dworkin to my chest as I marched to Take Back the Night and sent my boyfriend to buy tampons at every available opportunity. Still, never look a gift horse in the mouth, if one of its panniers is holding the gift of time, even if the other contains a job lot of unequal division of labour to be delivered to the patriarchy at Dobbin\u2019s next stop. I am planning to take myself off to see Mission: Impossible: The Whole Thing Stands or Falls By Tom Cruise\u2019s Hair and then to Indiana Jones and revel in the nostalgia while also weeping for the remorseless passing of the years.

Colette Joan Harmsen, a 47-year-old veterinarian and seasoned \u201cpeaceful forest protester\u201d with the Bob Brown Foundation, was sentenced to three months in prison for breaching a suspended sentence for protesting against a mine on the west coast of Tasmania. Harmsen appeared in Hobart magistrates court on Friday after pleading guilty to four counts of trespassing, as well as other related offences. It comes just a year after the Tasmanian government passed anti-protest legislation that was aimed at the Bob Brown Foundation and its blockades. Under the laws protesters can be fined up to $12,975 or jailed for 18 months for a first offence. Organisations can be fined up to $103,800 if they are judged to have obstructed workers or caused \u201ca serious risk\u201d. The Bob Brown Foundation campaign manager, Jenny Weber, said police prosecutors had attempted to prosecute Harmsen under the anti-protest laws. \u201cWe are grateful today that the judge threw out an appalling attempt by the police prosecutors to bring in the anti-protest laws,\u201d she said from the courthouse steps. Weber said it was the first time a woman in Tasmania had been sentenced to prison for environmental protesting. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In 2011, the protester Ali Alishah served five months in a Tasmanian prison after he breached a suspended sentence by continuing to protest against logging. Harmsen\u2019s charges relate to her involvement in a protest in 2021 where she locked herself on to an excavator at MMG\u2019s mine on the state\u2019s west coast and refused to leave when asked by police. She was also charged with trespassing during a protest at a forestry site and Venture Minerals\u2019 mine in the north-west, on three separate occasions from 2021 to 23. In his sentencing remarks, Magistrate Chris Webster noted Harmsen had a long history of trespassing, dating back to 2010. \u201cThe original penalty was to encourage [her] to stop her illegal protest activities,\u201d he said. \u201cNo doubt she will learn a lesson from her imprisonment.\u201d Speaking to her supporters on the courthouse steps prior to her conviction, Harmsen called out the Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, for sanctioning \u201cthe destruction of the environment rather than protecting it\u201d. \u201cThe reason I commit these offences is because I am terrified of the worsening climate crisis. I am not a menace to society yet here I am facing a jail term,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not giving a finger to the entire judicial system, I am standing up for the forests, for takayna, a safer planet and if that makes me a dangerous criminal then I think we are going to need bigger prisons.\u201d States introducing anti-protest laws to curtail environmental protesting has become a national trend, with Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and most recently South Australia introducing the laws. The laws have been widely criticised as an affront to the core democratic right to protest. In March, New South Wales climate protester, Deanna \u201cViolet\u201d Coco, was issued with a 12-month conditional release from jail after she was sentenced to 15 months in jail under the state\u2019s anti-protest laws. The district court judge Mark Williams, who issued the conditional release, said police had included a \u201cfalse fact\u201d and a \u201cfalse assertion\u201d in their case against Coco. - Additional reporting by AAP"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380af8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2023/jul/14/british-media-tabloids-huw-edwards-bbc", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why is the British media so utterly bonkers? | Arwa Mahdawi", "lead": "The Huw Edwards saga shows how the UK tabloids are both reckless and dangerously restrained at the same time", "author": "Arwa Mahdawi", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:01:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096588", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/61be93acada96cc31d94a4029db2964131296381/0_222_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "I hesitated about writing this column because, as a Brit in America, I don\u2019t like it when my mother country looks ridiculous. (Yeah, I know, the last decade has been rough.) And there is simply no way to write this without making the UK, and more specifically, its media ecosystem, look ridiculous. Sorry King Charles, I tried my best. So what\u2019s going on? Good question: nobody really knows. But it all started last Saturday when the Sun put out an explosive front-page story claiming that an unnamed but well-known male BBC presenter had been paying a now 20-year-old \u201cmore than \u00a335,000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images\u201d. The British tabloid, which built its brand by featuring topless women on its page 3 for almost 50 years, is not known for being nuanced and restrained. Still, even by the paper\u2019s own questionable standards, the reporting on this was shocking. The Sun rushed out a story suggesting a serious criminal offence, without seeming to possess much of the underlying evidence to support the allegation. On Wednesday, after several days of rabid speculation, the presenter at the center of the story was identified by his wife as Huw Edwards in a statement made on his behalf \u2014a household name in the UK. Edwards, who had been suspended by the BBC, is now apparently in hospital \u201csuffering from serious mental health issues.\u201d The BBC seem to have no idea how to handle this or even what\u2019s happening; on Wednesday, the BBC\u2019s Six O\u2019Clock News reported that its star journalist had resigned and then had to swiftly issue an on-air correction. Meanwhile, officers at Scotland Yard have concluded there is no evidence suggesting criminality and the young person at the centre of the story has issued a statement saying the allegations are \u201crubbish.\u201d The Sun is backtracking and trying to blame everyone else for misinterpreting their reporting. The whole thing is a mess. It\u2019s a mess, but it\u2019s also a microcosm: the story encapsulates the unique tension in the British media between extreme recklessness and extreme restraint. It\u2019s no secret that British tabloids lead the world in rashness. They tear their subjects apart and no tactic is too underhand. See, for example, the famous phone-hacking scandal that brought down Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World 10 years ago. (Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. also owns the Sun). Or see the 2020 suicide of TV presenter, Caroline Flack, who was viciously ripped apart by tabloids before her death. I\u2019m not saying the tabloids are always rash. In certain instances, and when it comes to certain people, they demonstrate extreme caution. They may publish every possible bit of gossip about Harry and Meghan, for example, but they are careful about what they say when it comes to rumors about other members of the royal family. That may be because the rumours are complete rubbish or it may be because there is an unspoken agreement in the British media that you don\u2019t publish things like that about high-ranking royals. It\u2019s not just in reporting about some royals that you see tabloid restraint at work: the likes of the Sun may stop at nothing to drum up drama, but they\u2019re not allowed to say everything they\u2019d like. The reason that Huw Edwards\u2019s identity was a secret for so long wasn\u2019t down to caution by the Sun, it was because of the UK\u2019s rigid media laws. In the US, you are free to criticize public figures without worrying too much about getting sued out of existence thanks to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1964 decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan. The landmark ruling limits the extent to which public officials can sue for defamation and even protects newspapers when they print false statements\u2014so long as no \u201cactual malice\u201d is involved. If you\u2019re a public official who wants to sue for defamation in the US, you bear the burden of proof. By contrast, the UK has libel laws which are a lot friendlier to the person who has been written about. The burden of proof lies with whoever authored the claim. Scumbags of various stripes don\u2019t just have Britain\u2019s libel laws on their side, they can also weaponize Britain\u2019s privacy laws to avoid scrutiny. This is particularly true since a landmark privacy ruling by the UK supreme court in February which made it more difficult for the British media to publish information about people subject to criminal investigations. The case centered on a 2016 article by Bloomberg, naming a prominent business executive under investigation by a British regulator. The businessman, known in the legal filings as ZXC, sued Bloomberg, arguing that the media outlet shouldn\u2019t have disclosed his private information because he hadn\u2019t yet been arrested or charged with anything in the corruption enquiry. He based his argument on expectations of privacy afforded by the European convention on human rights, and the supreme court sided with him. The result of Bloomberg LP v ZXC? A Britain in which it is a lot harder to speak truth to power. Britain is \u201cstumbling toward a system in which tabloids can still peek into celebrities\u2019 bedrooms but serious journalists cannot report on potential wrongdoing at public companies by powerful people,\u201d John Micklethwait, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, said in an op-ed following the ruling. \u201cThe courts have now presented the powerful with a path to keep their names out of print for years\u2026This right to privacy is only for those who can afford it; strangely enough, these often tend to be those who have the most to hide.\u201d If you\u2019re an American reading this and are feeling smug about press freedom in the US compared to the UK, then 1) OK, fair. 2) Don\u2019t get too complacent. Conservatives in the US have long been determined to weaken media protections in the US. \u201cI\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\u201d Donald Trump declared in 2016. He promised to change the law \u201cso when the New York Times writes a hit piece\u2026we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected.\u201d Conservatives haven\u2019t managed to achieve that yet, but they\u2019re certainly trying. There are a lot of people in the US who would like to follow the UK\u2019s example and make the right to privacy a luxury only the rich and powerful can afford.

He belongs to an energized generation of young Democrats. He is a prominent gun safety and LGBTQ+ civil rights activist and, at just 34, is a newly published author. But in Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s Florida, he does not always feel safe. \u201cI have not looked over my shoulder this much since the days after Pulse,\u201d Wolf says via Zoom from a neatly furnished apartment in Orlando. \u201cIt\u2019s because you never know if the person who\u2019s calling you a paedophile in the Twitter mentions is now wandering the aisles of Publix with a gun they learned how to use on YouTube. You never know if the people hopped up on that transphobic hysteria that the governor keeps pumping out are the same ones that are going to show up to an event that you\u2019re at.\u201d Wolf had sought refuge in Florida 15 years ago when he was done with rural Oregon, the childhood home where he suffered embedded racism and homophobia on a daily basis. As he writes in a recently published memoir, A Place for Us, his biological father, a Black man, abandoned him before learning his name and his mother, who was white, died from cancer when he was a boy. He was then raised by white parents. His siblings, classmates and neighbours were white. The young Wolf never got \u201cthe talk\u201d about how to engage with police as a Black man or the chance to talk openly about his recurring nightmares of burning crosses and mutilated Black bodies hanging from trees. Nor could he publicly come out in Oregon despite the whispers and rumours he\u2019d shrugged off for years. Among his motivations for writing the book was to reclaim intersectionality from DeSantis and others on the right who seek to hijack it. He explains: \u201cI wanted to give a human flavour to what intersectionality actually looks and feels like and what it feels like to experience racism and homophobia at the same time. Growing up in a conservative majority white town was difficult because the same kid who would call me the N-word on one day would call me a homophobic slur on another day and I was constantly navigating the intersections of those two things. \u201cAt the same time, I was sitting around a dinner table with my family, who was also conservative and white, and there were just moments where we were never going to understand each other. \u201cAlthough I had a roof over my head, a warm place to lay my head every night, it just didn\u2019t ever feel like home and that can be isolating for a young person and ultimately that\u2019s what drove me to move 3,000 miles from home.\u201d Wolf\u2019s book has been praised for its raw honesty and vulnerability. He describes in harrowing detail surviving a sexual assault that he has never told his family about before (\u201cThat was probably the hardest story in the book to write\u201d). He recalls the palpable fear when his car was pulled over by police who falsely accused him of disrespect and ended with a callous epithet: \u201cFucking faggot.\u201d Then there is the Pulse nightclub shooting on 12 June 2016. By chance, Wolf had stepped into the bathroom when the gunman Omar Mateen entered the club and opened fire, killing 49 people in the deadliest attack affecting the LGBTQ+ community in American history. Among them were Wolf\u2019s best friend, Drew Leinonen, to whom the book is dedicated, and Leinonen\u2019s boyfriend, Juan Guerrero. Some of Wolf\u2019s memories of the event are foggy; others remain vivid, from the painted faces of familiar drag queens on a poster to a clear plastic cup resting on the rim of the sink and containing ice chips and mutilated slices of lime. When President Barack Obama came to pay his respects, Wolf lost his composure. He writes: \u201cI buried my face in the shoulder of his pressed navy suit, blubbering into the soft, brushed fabric. His hug was firm and consoling. His shirt smelled faintly of cologne. Someone joked that he could be my father, and I chuckled, the first time I can remember laughing that week.\u201d Wolf still revisits the Pulse site from time to time. He explains: \u201cIt comes with so much pain and grief, so many memories. I still do like to go there late at night when no one else is there when it\u2019s quiet, because it\u2019s almost as if I can feel like I\u2019m in the presence of my best friends, if for just a moment.\u201d It was the deadliest US mass shooting by a single gunman until, just over a year later, 60 people perished at a music festival in Las Vegas. There has since been more bloodshed at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a school in Parkland, Florida, a school in Uvalde, Texas, and other cradles of lost innocence too long to list. Wolf says he is unsurprised because it has become all too clear that the current generation of political leaders is uninterested in solving the problem. \u201cAt the end of the day, the stealing of human life weighs less on their scale than access to wealth, power and fame. The situation is maybe in their mind too hard to solve, too complicated to solve. It comes with too much political cost if they speak out and so they do nothing and it will continue. \u201cThe number of communities touched by gun violence, the number of people\u2019s home towns that trend on social media, will escalate until, unfortunately, we get a new generation of leadership who doesn\u2019t know any different than active shooter drills and their best friends\u2019 names on concrete walls somewhere etched forever.\u201d Does there need to be systemic change? \u201cI hope that we look back on this day with that same level of disdain for the way in which we allowed those [tobacco] companies and that lobbying industry to have a death grip on our children, because ultimately what tipped the scale in the fight against the tobacco industry was the way in which they were marketing their product to children and it was stealing the lives of young people across the country. You had an uprising.\u201d Wolf, who was a national surrogate for Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign in 2019, has been pleasantly surprised by Joe Biden\u2019s efforts on gun safety and LGBTQ+ rights. But as a resident of Florida, he has witnessed up close a Republican backlash in the form of book bans, attacks on Black people\u2019s voting rights and a law allowing Floridians to carry concealed guns without a permit. DeSantis\u2019s efforts to out-Trump Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary are further turning up the heat. In May the NAACP issued a travel advisory for Florida, highlighting hostility toward Black, ethnic and queer communities. Last month DeSantis\u2019s campaign released an anti-LGBTQ+ video assailing Trump for his past support of gay and transgender people. Wolf comments: \u201cIt is a scary time to be not just LGBTQ but LGBTQ and Black in this state and ultimately that\u2019s the intent. So many of these laws, so much of the rhetoric is about fear, intimidation, bullying a majority of the population into submission so the minority can impose their values on everyone else. \u201cI have to think, as a pretty privileged person to live in downtown Orlando and be a cisgender man in America, if I\u2019m looking over my shoulder, I know that young people are looking over their shoulders. I know that other Black and brown folks are looking over their shoulders. I know that other queer people are looking over their shoulders. \u201cAnd quite frankly it is a disgrace to have a governor like Ron DeSantis that makes people look over their shoulders to win political points. It is a disgrace to have someone like that turning his own residents into refugees fleeing to the north-east so they can get access to healthcare, send their kids to a school that\u2019s going to treat them with respect.\u201d DeSantis has been clear about his ambition to use Florida as blueprint for the nation. Wolf believes he knows exactly what that would look like. \u201cThat looks like the US Department of Education banning books about people across the country, not just in Florida, but in New York City, in Los Angeles and in Seattle too. \u201cIt looks like the US Department of Health and Human Services banning healthcare for trans kids, restricting access to healthcare for trans adults. It looks like trying to ram a near-total abortion ban through Congress so that he can sign it into law. It looks like probably using the US Department of Treasury as a weapon against any business that speaks out in dissent to his policies like he did with Disney. \u201cIt looks like using the IRS as a tool against the Bud Lights of the world for daring to hire a trans person to put something on their Instagram profile. That is the vision for America that Ron DeSantis has.\u201d Wolf, who is press secretary for the LGBTQ+ civil rights organisation Equality Florida, lives in a progressive community in downtown Orlando where rainbow flags and drag shows are still commonplace. He says it is still the same Orlando that he fell in love with \u2013 but he recognises that this is a different Florida. \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be in Orlando, which I see as the seat of the resistance to Ron DeSantis\u2019s rightwing brand of politics. I\u2019m honoured to be able to lift the stories of LGBTQ people every single day, and Florida is my home. I chose this place 15 years ago because I wanted somewhere to belong and I fell in love with Orlando. I fell in love with my friends, my community. I fell in love with the state of Florida.\u201d He adds: \u201cNo matter what kind of response that elicits, I did fall in love with Florida. It is my home and it\u2019s my Florida too so I\u2019m not just going to hand it over to Ron DeSantis and his rightwing allies. They\u2019re going to have to pry the white sandy beaches from my hands. They belong to me too.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380afa", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/galatea-by-madeline-miller-audiobook-review-literatures-first-incel", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Galatea by Madeline Miller audiobook review \u2013 literature\u2019s first incel", "lead": "Actor Ruth Wilson narrates this powerful retelling of Ovid\u2019s Pygmalion myth, in which a sculptor falls in love with a statue of a woman", "author": "Fiona Sturges", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:00:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096624", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5b9ff962c8ae0a2d9577aa3a01393c9c348823c7/163_121_2907_1744/500.jpg", "body": "This short story from The Song of Achilles author Madeline Miller is a powerful reimagining of Ovid\u2019s Pygmalion, in which a sculptor falls in love with a woman he has carved out of ivory and who is, as Miller tells it, literature\u2019s first \u201cincel\u201d.

The severe weather has been going on for days and experts predict it will continue over the weekend and into next week.

When it floods there are issues with the water treatment facilities not working. So we have gotten used to boiling water after floods because sometimes they don\u2019t make the boil-water notice publicly visible.

So we are privileged. However, a year ago this area was struck by wildfire and we were kept out for many weeks. Nearby Mora was devastated by the fire and subsequent flooding and has not recovered. The situation in the cities, especially in Albuquerque, is dire for the unhoused folks, the poor folks, because Albuquerque is a crossroads in the south-west of two major highways so people tend to come there. So there\u2019s a lot of unhoused people there year-round. Temperatures in Albuquerque right now are over a hundred degrees fahrenheit and holding and rising. The weather pattern usually brings monsoons at this time of year but apparently that isn\u2019t immediately happening so the cooling down isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not directly engaged in doing anything now as I\u2019m basically retired, but it has a lot of concern for the people that are there on the streets. Even for people who have to work, Albuquerque does have a construction boom going on, but it\u2019s very hard to work right in the sun and on the road crews. It\u2019s just horrible and yet that\u2019s probably the main employment for labor in the area. Bill Nevins, 75, writer, Black Lake Mountain area, New Mexico \u2018We\u2019re living with the constant threat of wildfires. It can be terrifying\u2019 The Kern River flows, currently rages, from the peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, miles north of this area, into the valley where I live. Most of us, because we choose to live in an area that\u2019s in the wilderness, are equipped with insulation in the sense that in the winter we use wood burning and in the summer we use shade and tarps, whatever it takes to protect us from the sun. For those who don\u2019t, and particularly those who live in mobile homes, it will get increasingly difficult. There are numerous homeless people in California and particularly in the Bakersfield area. When I go in for Costco or Trader Joe\u2019s, the increase of homeless people is jaw-dropping and they will not be protected. Here we\u2019re living with the constant threat of wildfires. We have wildfires almost every year and now we have arsonists. It can be terrifying. We had an arsonist who set five small fires and had it been windy it could have definitely taken out an area that has one access [route] in and the same access to exit out. It would have been devastating. That\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned about, and what we\u2019re concerned about is the floods. I live in an area with the Kern River, which is one of the fastest-falling rivers in the United States. What our concerns are, are the wildfires but mainly what the velocity of the river is doing to the communities and to the reservoir here. Sukey Briggs, 75, southern Sierra Nevada foothills, California \u2018You want to be comfortable in your own home\u2019 I rent an apartment that has not converted to refrigerated air. I have evaporative cooling, so under these conditions inside temps are extremely high. With the apartment being so hot inside, I have become anxious and somewhat depressed. Leaving the apartment to escape the heat isn\u2019t really sustainable for the duration of the heatwave. Lots of fans are going so utility bills will skyrocket and, of course, this is bad for the environment. Going to museums, malls and libraries during the hottest part of the day but not being able to be home is depressing. I\u2019m pretty lucky. I\u2019m certainly not somebody who is in danger. My health is not that endangered or anything like that but, like I said, it emotionally does get to me. You want to be comfortable in your home. You want to be able to come home and relax. But you feel like even if you go out, you\u2019re so drained and so exhausted. You have to make sure you have water with you all the time and you have to be very attentive. Then you\u2019re out and you see people who are working . You wonder when it is going to end and you can\u2019t come home and relax because it\u2019s hot and it\u2019s hard to sleep, so it\u2019s like a 24/7 thing that goes on. Joanne Mihalick, 61, teacher, El Paso, Texas \u2018We adapt \u2013 that\u2019s all we can do at this point\u2019 We are in severe drought and have fairly intense heat. The heat is common in Missouri. The drought is impacting agriculture heavily right now, and the state is starting to discuss stricter management techniques. Last month, my family used over 10,000 gallons of water to keep our native trees and plants alive, which is about three times more than we typically use in the summer. It\u2019s bad, and it\u2019s scary to think about the ramifications of what is happening to our planet right now. Last night we had the first rain we have had in weeks. I had to pull off the road because it was so heavy and the wind was so intense I couldn\u2019t see. We received over an inch in an hour at my house and then it was gone. Last month was the same with the one rainfall we had that entire month. The storms are getting more intense yet are brief and irregular. Temperature fluctuations are more common too: it was 70F in July in Missouri, which is very uncommon, then quickly went to the upper 90s in two days. We adapt \u2013 that\u2019s all we can do at this point. Most people scurry from air conditioned locations to their cars and back. Most laborers know the routine and stay fairly well hydrated while being out in the heat. If I do any yardwork, it\u2019s in the morning while the sun is low. The drought will affect pricing for agricultural products in the fall, so people need to know that\u2019s coming. It\u2019s amazing to read all the stories right now that are happening worldwide. I hope it\u2019s an eye-opener for a lot of people.

Polentina is the work of Sophia Massarella, a photographer and a forensically passionate fan of Italian food, although it is clearly the cooking side that has taken over of late. Massarella, a Canadian, started a business during lockdown to recreate the polenta, pasta and salad dishes so loved by the Italian side of her family. Her next, entirely illogical step was to take on this small space in the staff canteen of the sustainable fashion factory ApparelTasker, though, in a world where rent, rates and food and staffing costs thwart much creativity in cooking, nothing is remotely logical any more. Anyone with enough investment can serve gold-leafed slop in Mayfair, but it requires genuine guts and passion to take on a few tables in Bow that look out on a load of sewing machines. On the day I went for lunch, one dish on the blackboard menu read: \u201cPomodori col riso, \u00a313\u201d. Massarella had stuffed big, fat Sorrento tomatoes \u2013 the type of lush, red fruit we Brits spot on our holidays, eat avidly and declare: \u201cNow this is what a tomato should taste like.\u201d Here, it had been hollowed out, stuffed brimful with herby, tomatoey carnaroli rice, then baked until the sweet flesh was yielding, yet somehow still supportive of its innards. I inhaled this tomato while pointing out to Charles the umpteen ways this \u201csimple\u201d dish would be ruined by a less able cook (ie, me). How was the rice al dente, even though it had soaked up so much flavour? How did the tomato\u2019s skin support the weight of the stuffing, while being so pleasingly squishy? And was this side of fried potatoes for sharing, because, sadly, I had eaten them all? The other main course on offer that day was a bowl of excellent fresh spaghetti aglio, olio, peperoncino and bottarga \u2013 a tangle of pasta, garlic, fish roe and a hint of chilli finished with good olive oil for \u00a315. The food at Polentina is wonderful, but I cannot say that everything else about eating here isn\u2019t rather peculiar, because it absolutely is. Lunch was served at 1pm on the dot, and the factory staff ate at the same time as the random diners, who just have to fit in around them and be respectful of the fact that this is their space. If you can\u2019t do that, I suggest you stay away \u2013 and not just from Polentina, either, but from all hospitality venues. Have a ready-meal and keep your poor manners in the one room instead. If you can share tables and be nice, however, Polentina is a place that plays on memories of Italian nonna food \u2013 stuffed things, layered things, offally things \u2013 mixed with a smattering of soups, dumplings and crepes in broth in a nod to the Austrian side of Massarella\u2019s family. I loved a simple plate of fennel, pickled sharply, but with a good aniseedy kick, topped with some big, fat, soft, green pitted olives collapsing clumsily over the veg, and all scattered with a hint of pecorino. My favourite dish was a large pile of long-stewed, fat bobby beans draped over very good, fresh ricotta, served slightly warm, yet still singing of summer. There\u2019s a range of excellent, if weird kombuchas, too (do try the Matka Ferments\u2019 dehydrated strawberry and sweet cicely). As I ate my pickled fennel, another diner \u2013 at a guess, a factory worker \u2013 opened a plastic box and began devouring a homemade egg-and-salad-cream Kingsmill sandwich and a Wagon Wheel. We are a broad church. Massarella was cooking and serving alone this lunchtime, but at weekend dinners she has recently been joined by Ollie Bass, formerly of Quo Vadis and Sessions Arts Club, because at night the place caters to a bigger crowd and offers a longer menu. Regardless of that, the open kitchen currently operates with only two induction stoves and a bain-marie in a space more suited to making egg and chips. Though, I dare say, in Polentina\u2019s hands, that, too, would be worth travelling for. Desserts were plump homemade iced lemon cookies and little tubs of Puglian lemon ice-cream from La Grotta. Polentina will get bigger, slicker and more famous, for sure, but, like the Sex Pistols\u2019 first gig in the Common Room at St Martin\u2019s College of Art, it\u2019s good to experience a new thing when it\u2019s weird and unsettling, and at the same time already altogether perfect.

Trump has made contradictory comments on LGBTQ+ rights, saying he was \u201cfine\u201d with same-sex marriage during the 2016 campaign but later rolled back protections for transgender patients as president \u2013 the Trump administration reversed an Obama-era rule defining protections against sex discrimination as encompassing gender identity in 2020. The flyers came as a surprise to many in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd piece of advertising,\u201d said Dave Peterson, a professor of political science at Iowa State University and a former editor of the academic quarterly Political Behavior. With months to go before the Iowa Republican caucuses in January, most candidates are still doing most of their advertising on TV, said Peterson. The group Advancing Our Values appears to be a Des Moines-based non-profit that registered with the secretary of state\u2019s office two weeks ago. The Guardian was unable to reach a representative of Advancing Our Values for comment. According to the group\u2019s incorporation papers posted online, it registered as a section 501(c)(4) non-profit \u2013 a status that allows it to \u201cengage in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to candidates for public office\u201d as long as its activity is not the main fundraising arm for any candidate\u2019s campaign. One individual, Kyle Adema, of Nebraska, is listed as its chairperson. The Guardian was unable to reach Adema for comment on this story. Following the blogpost, there was some online speculation, largely by rightwing voices, that the mailers were funded by a progressive group. One such group, Progress Iowa, runs out of the same office building as the non-profit\u2019s registered agent, Cogency Global, Inc. But Progress Iowa\u2019s executive director, Mike Sinovic, confirmed to the Guardian that Progress Iowa had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with these mailers\u201d. \u201cThis is clearly intended to be anti-Trump,\u201d said University of Iowa political science professor Timothy Hagle, who also received the mailer. But it\u2019s unclear if the mailer was associated with a candidate or a \u201crogue outfit\u201d, he said. The non-profit behind the mailer is not a known LGBTQ+ rights advocacy group, writes Laura Belin in the Bleeding Heartland post. That makes it less likely that the ad was intended to draw more voters to Trump, said Hagle. An ad portraying Trump as a supporter of LGBTQ+ rights could turn some Iowa caucus-goers away from him, said Hagle. Just under half of Republican voters say they support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll released in June. Earlier this month, the DeSantis War Room Twitter account shared a now-deleted video attacking Trump for supporting gay and transgender people. \u201cFor any other candidate, you\u2019re going to have to peel off some of those Trump supporters if you expect to win the caucuses,\u201d said Hagle, who is also the author of two books on the 2012 and 2020 Iowa caucuses. \u201cMaybe a mailer like this was intended to do that.\u201d Trump placed second in the Iowa Republican caucuses in 2016 and won overwhelmingly as the incumbent in 2020. Recent polling shows Trump is currently the frontrunner for 2024. Several pools of money can help fund political ads. For US presidential elections, individuals can directly give to candidates themselves. But those donations are capped under current campaign finance laws. Individuals and corporations can drop larger sums of money into Super Pacs, which can receive unlimited contributions from any donor and cannot legally coordinate with any campaign. They must report their donors to the Federal Election Commission. A third type of political fundraisers are billed as \u201cdark money\u201d groups. Organizations in this camp \u2013 including 501(c)(4) non-profits like Advancing Our Values \u2013 are not required by law to disclose to voters the source of their funding."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380afe", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The best recent crime and thrillers \u2013 review roundup", "lead": "The Second Murderer by Denise Mina; Beware the Woman by Megan Abbott; Murder in the Family by Cara Hunter; Black Thorn by Sarah Hilary; The Housekeepers by Alex Hay", "author": "Laura Wilson", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:00:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096701", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e87682e5328409085a78cf8ab7d3644c8dfc944a/670_542_3592_2155/500.jpg", "body": "The Second Murderer by Denise Mina (Harvill Secker, \u00a318.99) Raymond Chandler\u2019s Los Angeles PI Philip Marlowe is reimagined by Mina in a novel that also includes Anne Riordan, who aficionados will remember from Chandler\u2019s 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely, the working title of which was the same as this book. Here, Marlowe is tasked with tracking down Chrissie, only child of stratospherically rich sadist Chadwick Montgomery. The monstrous patriarch isn\u2019t too bothered about being reunited with his daughter \u2013 she\u2019s given him a legitimate grandson, so succession is assured \u2013 and Marlowe, who finds the young woman quickly, isn\u2019t keen to return her. Matters are complicated by the fact that Riordan, now a professional rival, is also on the case, and because the next time Marlowe sees Chrissie she is standing over a corpse in a Skid Row hotel room. Mina, who is a considerably more efficient plotter than Chandler, remains true to his tone and to Marlowe\u2019s character, while cleaning up his attitude to render him more palatable to modern readers: highly recommended. Beware the Woman by Megan Abbott (Virago, \u00a318.99) Abbott\u2019s novel centres on a pregnant junior-school teacher, Jacy, who travels from New York with her husband, Jed, to visit her father-in-law in remote upper Michigan. Dr Ash and his loyal housekeeper are friendly enough, at least initially \u2013 and Jacy puts any misgivings down to hormones. However, it gradually becomes clear that unspoken family history simmers beneath the pleasant surface, not least the fact that Jed\u2019s mother died giving birth to him. After Jacy has a miscarriage scare, Dr Ash is increasingly controlling, and Jed sides with him in infantilising his wife and putting her under the care of a judgmental local doctor. Jacy, already struggling with a body that feels no longer her own, grows distrustful as the men override her wishes, effectively imprisoning her. Abbott expertly rachets up the menace towards an unexpected and shocking ending in a claustrophobic and timely chiller about how men deny women agency. Murder in the Family by Cara Hunter (HarperCollins, \u00a38.99) The first standalone from the author of the bestselling DI Fawley series is an innovative take on a cold-case whodunnit. In 2003, Luke Ryder was found murdered in the garden of his expensive west London home but, despite a lengthy investigation, nobody was charged. Nearly 20 years later, his film-maker stepson Guy, who, at 10, was the only other person in the house when Ryder was killed, is making a documentary series about the case, using a team of experts who are re-examining the evidence. Guy\u2019s mother has dementia, but neither of his two sisters \u2013 teenagers at the time \u2013 is keen on the idea, possibly because they have something to hide. Events take unexpected turns, and revelations and cliffhangers come thick and fast. Hunter\u2019s device of using transcripts, emails, text messages and newspaper cuttings to tell the story takes a bit of getting used to, but the result is ingenious, complex and immersive. Black Thorn by Sarah Hilary (Macmillan, \u00a316.99) In Hilary\u2019s novel a family is on the edge: literally \u2013 the cramped caravan to which they have been relegated is perched on the Cornish cliffs \u2013 and metaphorically. After dream homes built by Adrian Gale and his partner turn out to be a jerry-built nightmare, with several inhabitants, including three children, dying of carbon monoxide poisoning, Adrian sinks into depression. He awaits the investigator\u2019s report and a possible charge of corporate manslaughter, while his wife, Ruth, desperately looks for work. Meanwhile, his autistic daughter, Agnes, 29 and recently back from London after a breakup, is doing her best to keep her 13-year-old brother out of mischief. Agnes is determined to find out what happened and who is to blame when a journalist turns up, asking questions. A creepy and atmospheric tale, beautifully and sensitively written. The Housekeepers by Alex Hay (Headline, \u00a316.99) Upstairs, Downstairs meets Ocean\u2019s 8 in Hay\u2019s debut, an Edwardian caper set in a grand mansion on London\u2019s Park Lane. Its owner, parvenu Wilhelm de Vries, has died and his daughter, who wishes to gain social clout by marrying into the aristocracy, flouts the conventions of mourning by hosting a ball. Housekeeper Mrs King, who has just been dismissed, plans to use the festivities as cover for an audacious robbery that will strip the house of valuables. She teams up with crime boss Mrs Bone and a gang of thieves, including former domestic servants, an actor and a pair of circus performers. The various participants have their own schemes and competing interests, and Mrs King\u2019s motive is not just revenge, but something more personal. Hay sets a cracking pace in a novel that wears its historical research lightly; with plenty of twists and a great deal of fun, this is the perfect holiday read."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380aff", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/14/what-if-ups-workers-strike-shipping-delay-why", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How likely is a UPS workers strike and how would it affect shipping?", "lead": "Negotiations between the US\u2019s largest shipping company and its union have stalled less than a month before the contract expires \u2013 here\u2019s what we know", "author": "Lauren Aratani", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:00:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096719", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/19ad33fc8cf98b9bf197287c8500d1fa5469eeca/0_134_4027_2417/500.jpg", "body": "Time is running out for negotiations to avert the largest strike against a single employer in US history. Contract negotiations between UPS, the largest shipping company in the US, and its workers\u2019 union have stalled less than a month before the union contract expires on 31 July. Without a contract, the union said that its 340,000 full- and part-time workers will strike, something that would significantly disrupt the US economy. Here\u2019s what we know so far about negotiations and the potential strike: Why are UPS workers potentially striking? UPS workers have been pushing for higher pay, more full-time jobs and better workplace health and safety conditions. The company and its union have been in intense negotiations over its contract over the last month and have come to a few agreements, including getting rid of its two-tier programs for drivers which means some part-time drivers are paid less than full-time drivers on an hourly basis. The company has also tentatively agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr Day a holiday and has agreed to install air-conditioning units in more of its trucks, since heat is a growing hazard for drivers as temperatures continue to soar. But the union for UPS Workers, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, known as Teamsters, said the company had not agreed to all of their demands. In the early hours of 5 July, negotiations broke down with both sides saying that the other walked away from the negotiating table. \u201cThis multibillion-dollar corporation has plenty to give American workers \u2013 they just don\u2019t want to,\u201d said the Teamsters general president, Sean O\u2019Brien, in a statement. \u201cUPS had a choice to make, and they have clearly chosen to go down the wrong road.\u201d \u201cThe Teamsters have stopped negotiating despite historic proposals that build on our industry-leading pay,\u201d UPS said in a statement. \u201cRefusing to negotiate, especially when the finish line is in sight, creates significant unease among employees and customers and threatens to disrupt the US economy. Only our non-union competitors benefit from the Teamsters\u2019 actions.\u201d How likely is a strike at this point? It is unclear when and if UPS and the union will go back to the negotiating table. Even before talks broke down, O\u2019Brien said that a strike appeared \u201cinevitable\u201d. The stickiest point between the two parties appears to be over pay increases. If the current contract ends up expiring on 31 July without a new one to take its place, the union could start its strike as early as 1 August. The Teamsters have been holding rallies and practice pickets around the US in preparation for the possible strike. What happens if there is a strike? There will probably be significant delays and increased costs in shipping around the country. UPS is the largest private shipping company in the country, just behind the US Postal Service (USPS) as the largest delivery company. The company handles about a fourth of all packages in the US, shipping 5.2bn parcels in 2022. FedEx, in comparison, shipped 4.1bn packages last year. USPS and FedEx both released statements that essentially encouraged UPS customers to act fast and start using their services, in anticipation of a strike. USPS announced the launch of the USPS Ground Advantage program that offers coast-to-coast delivery in two to five days. \u201cWe are ready to compete for an increased share of the growing package business,\u201d Louis DeJoy, US postmaster general, said in a statement. FedEx said that the company\u2019s priority was \u201cprotecting capacity and service for existing customers\u201d. \u201cTherefore, shippers who are considering shifting volume to FedEx, or are currently in discussions with the company to open a new account, are encouraged to begin shipping with FedEx now,\u201d the company said. Even though USPS and FedEx could take on some UPS customers, the companies will not be able to handle the 24.3m packages UPS delivers a day in addition to their existing loads. How will UPS be affected by a strike? A 1997 UPS strike that lasted 15 days cost the company a total of $850m at the time. A New York Times report of the strike from 1997 said that small businesses struggled to restock their shelves, while hospitals had a hard time getting needed supplies. USPS and FedEx were overloaded with packages and cut overnight delivery services. And now, e-commerce sales are over 15 times what they were then. Bloomberg estimated UPS could lose about $170m a day with the strike, based on its latest revenue reports. With the growth of online shopping during the pandemic, UPS has posted record profits over the last two years, with revenue in 2022 reaching $100bn for the first time in the company\u2019s history. But the meteoric growth seen in the pandemic has slowed, and a potential strike has loomed over the company over the last few months. Given UPS\u2019s share of the shipping industry, any major loss of customers will probably be temporary, but will still cost the company millions."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b00", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/chef-grade-ingredients/2023/jul/14/helen-grahams-recipe-for-peanut-date-and-tahini-banoffee-pie", "primaryCategory": "chef-grade-ingredients", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Helen Graham\u2019s recipe for peanut, date and tahini banoffee pie", "lead": "A Middle Eastern twist on this classic sweet treat sees Bubala\u2019s executive chef combine her favourite flavours for a \u2018life-affirming\u2019 result", "author": "Helen Graham", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:58:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096757", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f4393756e42e97f6e529d57eb79ac728f647c879/0_0_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "This vegan treat is a little bit bonkers: banoffee pie by way of the Middle East.

Peanut, date and tahini banoffee pie Prep 15 min Cook 20 min Chill 4 hr Serves 6-8 Pie crust 80g coconut oil 250g ginger nut biscuits (suitable for vegans) 20g cocoa powder \u00bc tsp Maldon salt 20g Belazu Date Molasses Tahini caramel 400ml coconut milk 50g cornflour 200g Belazu Date Molasses 100g Belazu Tahini \u00bc tsp Maldon salt 1 tbsp lemon juice Coconut cream 40g coconut oil 350g coconut yoghurt 50g maple syrup 1 tbsp white miso paste 70g smooth peanut butter Macerated bananas 2 ripe bananas 1 tbsp lemon juice Garnish 50g dark chocolate 1 orange, zest only Belazu 100% Humera sesame seed Tahini is nutty, creamy and perfect for sweet and savoury recipes To make the pie crust, begin by lining the bottom of a 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin with greaseproof paper. Warm the coconut oil in a saucepan to melt it, then put it into a food processor along with the rest of the pie crust ingredients. Pulse to form a coarse crumb, which you can then tip into the cake tin. Use your fingers to press the crumb into the bottom and up the sides, ensuring you create an even layer. Cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for two hours. To make the tahini caramel, add the coconut milk and cornflour to a saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to the boil, whisking continuously, until it thickens \u2013 this should take around 5-8 minutes. Strain into a bowl to remove any lumps, and add the Belazu Date Molasses, Belazu Tahini, salt and lemon juice. Whisk thoroughly before spreading evenly over the pie base. Cover and refrigerate for another two hours, until the caramel is completely set. For the coconut cream, melt the coconut oil in a saucepan before combining with the rest of the ingredients in a medium sized bowl. Whisk for five minutes until the mixture has thickened. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and chill for an hour. Now for the bananas \u2013 slice slightly on the diagonal, about 1cm thick. Combine with the lemon juice and set aside. When you are ready to serve, take the caramel-filled base from the fridge, top with the bananas, and smooth on the coconut cream. Use a peeler to shave over the chocolate, then finish by sprinkling the banoffee pie with orange zest.

What happened? Paavo Arhinm\u00e4ki: It was Midsummer, which is a time of the year when nothing much happens in Helsinki. In the early evening, a friend of mine and I drove down to Vuosaari harbour freight tracks just outside of Helsinki. My friend and I drove past this tunnel that reminded us of an old freight tunnel in Pasila, the neighbourhood where we had grown up. Pasila is really the cradle of graffiti culture in Finland: an area full of freight yards, train tunnels and a massive number of concrete walls. It\u2019s where I learned painting my own pictures after school in the late 80s and early 90s. We stopped the car and got our spray cans out. The tunnel wall wasn\u2019t an official wall for graffiti, but there were already lots of old paintings on it that no one had cleaned up for years, so we thought people just didn\u2019t care. It took us two hours to finish the painting. We were about to take pictures of our work when there were suddenly guards everywhere, shouting at us not to try to escape. I mean, were were two middle-aged guys, we weren\u2019t going to run anywhere. What kind of graffiti did you paint? These days, graffiti is mainly about the lettering, but when my friends and I got into painting in the 80s, the backgrounds were more important. We painted the skyline of Pasila, with the sun going down. The two grey things in the middle of the text are two famous tower blocks in the neighbourhood. The words I painted are really a reference to the early New York graffiti of the 70s: \u201cGCM\u201d, which stands for \u201cgreat career moves\u201d. Which I guess is ironic given that I got caught and some people even called on me to resign. Have you been fined? Not yet, the police hearing will be after the summer. But if I do get fined, I will pay it. Of course, it was a really stupid thing to do. My friend and I will also pay the cleaning costs, which may be around \u20ac3,000. It\u2019s a shame that it had to be removed so quickly \u2013 I didn\u2019t even get a chance to take proper pictures. But I can see why, because it would have probably become a tourist attraction otherwise. What\u2019s the history of graffiti in Finland? In a way graffiti came to Finland via the same route it came to most countries in Europe: there was the 1983 documentary Style Wars, Martha Cooper and Henry Chalfant\u2019s 1984 book Subway Art, and the more Hollywood-style film Beat Street around the same time. Finland was a special case because even though we weren\u2019t on the wrong side of the iron curtain, we were still somewhere in between east and west. So graffiti arrived a bit later, but there was a massive boom in the late 80s: every boy and girl at my school had their own tag. It wasn\u2019t legal then, but it also wasn\u2019t taken too seriously. Things really changed when Helsinki was announced as the cultural capital of Europe for the year 2000, and the city started a big anti-graffiti campaign in the run-up. Paradoxically, the idea was to clean away lots of culture to make way for culture. Graffiti writers were effectively declared enemies of the state. There was a huge campaign trying to paint them as criminal and drug addicts, and the city hired plain-clothes security guards to catch them in the act. I got back into graffiti through politics, when I got elected as a member of Helsinki city council as a 23-year-old in 2000. After I initiated a motion to paint back an erased graffiti in east Helsinki, I got a lot of phone calls from the mums of kids who had been beaten up by security staff. Young men were fined or sent to prison: the war on graffiti was destroying lives. I campaigned against Helsinki\u2019s harsh measures and the waste of taxpayers\u2019 money for seven years, and eventually people started to listen. In 2008, we succeeded in scrapping the zero-tolerance policy of old. Now we have official walls where people can paint all around the city, and see graffiti as a colourful part of our city\u2019s culture. The most commonly cited argument against graffiti is the \u201cbroken windows theory\u201d, proposed by social scientists James Q Wilson and George L Kelling in 1982: that allowing visual signs of civic disorder creates an environment that breeds more of the same disorder. Are you not convinced by that argument? The broken windows theory cannot be really applied to graffiti in a straightforward way. You can fix a window, but when you paint over a graffiti you destroy an artwork. And that often provokes other artists to spray over the same surface again, and often with less beautiful artworks. Critics of our liberal approach say legal walls incite more illegal graffiti elsewhere, but we haven\u2019t seen that. There\u2019s always going to be some illegal graffiti, but every can in front of an official wall is one that isn\u2019t used on an unofficial one. Haven\u2019t your own actions undermined the official wall policies you introduced? Having official walls doesn\u2019t mean that graffiti as a whole has been decriminalised. We don\u2019t tolerate it everywhere, and the city still uses about \u20ac500,000 a year to clean up surfaces that have been painted on. But I believe there are different types of unofficial graffiti: painting on the backs of abandoned or industrial buildings or on concrete walls along freight-track lines is different to painting on listed buildings or private houses. I believe that graffiti has been the most powerful art form of the last half-century, and official walls are important not just as a distraction for bored or disaffected youth, but as a training ground for future artists. It has brought countless young people into the art world. For many of the kids who painted or tagged around Helsinki in the 1980s, it became a springboard into fine art or the creative sector. The graffiti artist EGS is now one of the most interesting artists working in Finland, with a solo show coming to Helsinki\u2019s Didrichsen Art Museum next year. During the era of zero-tolerance policy, all those kids would have immediately got a criminal record. Were you pleased with the mural you got into trouble for? It\u2019s not for me to judge. When I was Finland\u2019s minister for culture, I used to say politicians shouldn\u2019t determine what is good art and what is bad art, and I\u2019d better stick to that."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b02", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/a-charter-for-change/2023/jul/14/the-toughest-qualification-in-finance-why-its-now-more-achievable-than-ever", "primaryCategory": "a-charter-for-change", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The toughest qualification in finance?

A rewarding, if somewhat daunting undertaking. But 60 years since candidates sat the first exams, the CFA Program has changed. Mirroring transformations in the financial sector and society at large, the master\u2019s-comparable qualification has become more accessible and appealing to a broader range of people than might have previously considered it \u2013 or even considered a career in finance. \u201cWe\u2019re showing young people that finance careers play their part [in tackling wider social issues],\u201d says Peter Watkins, senior director for university relations at CFA Institute, the global association of investment professionals that provides the qualification. \u201cSustainable projects are financed \u2013 they need capital, they need people who manage it. So it\u2019s all connected. Young people have a need to embark on a career that\u2019s making a positive impact.\u201d The finance industry has become central to global efforts to shift to a low carbon economy. As well as better reflecting this new financial landscape, CFA Institute has evolved the CFA Program and its structure to make it more accessible and in tune with the way today\u2019s candidates learn \u2013 as well as helping them to be better prepared for the workplace. To appreciate these changes \u2013 and dispel some of the notorious myths around the qualification \u2013 it\u2019s worth taking stock of why the CFA Program has long been regarded as the gold standard for those seeking to work in finance. \u201cBecause of the global recognition of the CFA charter, it gives students global mobility,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cThis is a qualification that\u2019s recognised everywhere. The CFA charter has this global benchmark standard.\u201d There are more than 190,000 qualified CFAs \u2013 or charterholders as they are technically known \u2013 in more than 160 markets worldwide. Perhaps surprisingly, the course has very few prerequisites and you don\u2019t need a degree in finance to embark on it. For example, Justin Kew, a CFA charterholder currently working for an asset management firm in London, studied engineering at university and was working as an engineer before job circumstances prompted a career change. \u201cI had no idea what finance was at first but I soon became intrigued,\u201d he says. \u201cYou realise it touches every industry.\u201d A firm grasp of business English and maths (especially algebra) are necessary, but you could have a degree in music production and still get on to the course. \u201cAbout 7% of our candidates don\u2019t have bachelor\u2019s degrees, and have not been to university,\u201d says Rob Langrick, general manager of the CFA Program. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more people from non-finance degrees coming on to the CFA Program, particularly from Stem, as well as engineering and other subject areas,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cEmployers find that very attractive. Having a combination of a particular [specialist] background with finance is appealing. So it\u2019s broadening out\u201d. When the CFA Program first started in 1963, the minimum age to sit the exam was 30. Over the past six decades, and especially more recently, CFA Institute has removed certain barriers to entering the programme. It has become more accessible, which has cultivated a more diverse demographic to join. Although there is still some work to be done to address gender disparities, stats show that the tide is beginning to turn. In 2012, the split between male and female students stood at 72% male compared with 28% female globally. This number now stands at 61% male compared with 39% female. This has been encouraged through progressive changes, including a women\u2019s scholarship that was introduced in 2017. \u201cThere are some criteria that need to be cleared, but we have a generous portion of scholarships that are available for female applicants,\u201d says Langrick. As for the CFA Program\u2019s tough reputation, it isn\u2019t simply a case of being thrown in at the deep end. Prep communities are easily accessed online. These groups, such as the subreddit space on popular community network platform Reddit, give prospective students a chance to connect with others who are more experienced. There, they can ask questions and develop a better understanding of the course, what\u2019s required of them and what it actually entails, in order to prepare themselves before embarking on it. Once studying for the CFA Program, these groups can also be used for guidance and clarity. Similarly, pre-programme support is available in the university sector. \u201cWe have a very large network of affiliated universities that have aligned content with the CFA Program,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cSo students at those institutions are covering similar topics to the CFA Program.\u201d From this year, CFA Institute has significantly increased the number of practice questions and mock exams that candidates can access, in response to surveys that found candidates felt they would benefit from these. Another significant change is a reduction in the volume of study materials at Level I. \u201cOur brand promise is that, on average, it takes 300 hours to get through [each level],\u201d explains Langrick. \u201cSo it\u2019s a sizable commitment \u2013 it\u2019s not for everybody, it is a tough exam, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s valued by employers.\u201d Watkins stresses how important it is that students give the qualification enough time. \u201cIt correlates very strongly with starting early and giving it the time it needs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you can do as a crash course. It\u2019s more of a marathon than a sprint.\u201d Kew agrees. \u201cYou need to have a plan. You cannot cram everything into two weeks and it\u2019s best to take it in bitesize chunks. But the most important thing is to have fun along the way. You cannot lock yourself away for four or five months or you will go mad.\u201d The reduction in the volume of study materials forms part of the biggest overhaul since the qualification\u2019s inception. Another key development is that CFA Institute has allowed students to start registering and getting ready for the exam in the penultimate year of a bachelor\u2019s degree. \u201cWe\u2019ve increased that flexibility now and students can start to take the exam within two years of completing their degree,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very popular because it\u2019s a period of life when people are really focused. This is their study time.\u201d As the CFA Program has evolved, CFA Institute has introduced modules that offer the chance to learn practical skills. This is in direct response to demand, as savvy students recognise the benefit of having practical experience, which can be applied directly when they enter the workplace. Similarly, CFA Institute is creating the option to specialise in private markets, due to the growth in private equity over the last 20 years. The onward march of AI has also been on the agenda, with AI modules featuring in the CFA Program since the middle of last decade. One of the new modules introduced this year incorporates data science, AI and Python programming. \u201c[AI] is going to keep growing as a portion of the programme, because the reality is that finance has become a technology job,\u201d says Langrick. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more and more technology woven into the curriculum.\u201d If you\u2019re interested in finding out more about the CFA Program, and how you can enrol, visit cfainstitute.org/en/programs"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b03", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/a-charter-for-change/2023/jul/14/from-crypto-sleuth-to-carbon-cutter-five-little-known-jobs-you-can-do-as-a-chartered-financial-analyst", "primaryCategory": "a-charter-for-change", "subCategories": "test", "title": "From crypto sleuth to carbon cutter: five little-known jobs you can do as a chartered financial analyst", "lead": "Qualified chartered financial analysts typically go into the financial sector at an investment firm, but there are a number of less familiar career paths that can be taken too", "author": "Mike Pattenden", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:40:25", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096813", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1988c5effb48dbbe6b5c5319c9c2c66443bfeea0/0_127_5700_3420/500.jpg", "body": "To be a chartered financial analyst (CFA) is to possess one of the highest business qualifications available. Awarded by CFA Institute, it is internationally recognised as a gold standard by financial institutions and corporations. Most CFA charterholders (as those who complete CFA Program are known) will go into the financial sector at an investment firm \u2013 either managing investments as a portfolio or fund manager, or as a research analyst. According to CFA Institute, about half of the world\u2019s portfolio managers are CFA charterholders. But if you\u2019re looking to apply your credentials in a newly developing sector or seeking a mid-career switch, there are some less obvious roles where the knowledge and skills of a CFA charterholder would prove invaluable. Here are five lesser-known career paths CFA charterholders can take. Crypto sleuth The labyrinthine world of cryptocurrencies is wide open to abuse \u2013 as the recent collapse of crypto trading company FTX demonstrated. The combination of blockchain technology, cryptography and digital finance can make the sector particularly hard to navigate. The CFA Program equips charterholders with the type of forensic skills needed to follow digital breadcrumbs or paper trails. This is particularly useful when trying to establish misappropriation and other wrongdoings. CFA charterholders also find their way into investigating other types of financial crime. It was a charterholder, Harry M Markopolos, who uncovered US financier Bernie Madoff\u2019s infamous Ponzi scheme \u2013 a financial swindle in which early investors are repaid with money acquired from later investors rather than from actual investment income. Likewise, many charterholders work in regulation at public bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US or the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Approximately 11,000 charterholders currently work in regulation. \u201cEthics is at the core of the CFA [qualification] at all three levels,\u201d says Rob Langrick, general manager, CFA Program at CFA Institute. \u201cIn fact, many of our exam questions concern compliance issues.\u201d Carbon cutter Understanding a business\u2019s carbon emissions, particularly those that emanate from its suppliers (known as scope 3 emissions) is a complex business, but it\u2019s also fundamental for the global shift to a zero carbon economy. As regulation and disclosure requirements expand, and carbon measurements become more precise, the ability to audit and benchmark companies against their peers is a vital skill \u2013 particularly in the financial sector, given the rapid rise of so-called ESG investment funds, which explicitly take into account environmental, social and governance factors. Carbon analysts are responsible for tracking carbon emissions, assessments, analysis, and reporting in companies or public sector bodies. CFA Institute has put climate change at the core of the CFA Program and its impact has been a key part of its syllabus for several years. Last year, CFA Institute launched a Climate Finance course in partnership with ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) to provide investment professionals with a better understanding of the economic and environmental impacts related to the climate crisis, as well as climate solutions. Quant geek Financial markets are growing in complexity all the time, fuelling demand for people who can understand the automated trading systems that drive them. Quantitative traders, or \u201cquants\u201d, use mathematical and statistical models to identify trading opportunities and buy and sell securities. Investopedia refers to them as the \u201crocket scientists of Wall Street\u201d because the work is highly intellectual, abstract and pressurised. Due to the opportunities in this specialism, data scientists who are often highly computer literate but unfamiliar with the financial services industry are now enrolling in the CFA Program. CFA Institute has also created a Data Science Certificate to expand finance professionals\u2019 knowledge on the use of AI and machine learning in the investment process. Fintech entrepreneur Digital transformation is disrupting finance, creating new services and products. Two notable fintech companies, PocketSuite and Grow were both founded by CFA charterholders, Samuel Madden and Kevin Sandhu. The CFA Program curriculum includes an understanding of digital applications such as machine learning, algorithmic trading and data science, ensuring charterholders are capable of entering fintech with confidence. \u201cEntrepreneurs in this space have typically earned their CFA charter and then go on to fintech,\u201d says Langrick. \u201cThey\u2019re well equipped to succeed in this space given the fact that they know who they\u2019re selling to and why they\u2019re buying it.\u201d Behavioural guru Behavioural finance is the study of the effects of psychology on investors and financial markets, with the aim of explaining why people often make irrational decisions either with their own money or other people\u2019s. It\u2019s increasingly used by the leading investment firms to understand common pitfalls in areas such as adviser and client relationships, portfolio construction and board groupthink. The CFA Program curriculum includes an understanding of behavioural biases, which means charterholders are well placed to meet the demand for expert behavioural finance analysts and advisers. \u201cIt\u2019s now a hot topic but we\u2019ve been thought leaders in that space for some time now,\u201d says Langrick. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the typical mind traps that people fall into or how to avoid errors like loss aversion, sunk costs and so on.\u201d The CFA Program provides expertise and real-world skills in investment analysis, preparing candidates for successful careers as investment professionals.

With refunds to be offered on repairs to clothing and household appliances, limits on single-use plastics in fast food and other restaurants and punitive parking fees for SUV owners, the recent green focus has targeted the consumer. It is the latest phase in the government\u2019s environment roadmap, pledged by Emmanuel Macron in his presidential re-election campaign last year and announced by the prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, in May. Borne described it as a \u201ccomplete strategy\u201d to reduce waste and emissions in each economic sector, from large companies to individual households. \u201cIn total, half of the effort will be made by businesses, particularly large companies, a quarter by the state and local authorities, and the final quarter by households,\u201d she said. Environmental campaigners and critics, however, question whether putting the responsibility on individual consumers is the right approach as the country faces another scorching summer of record temperatures, wildfires and water shortages. Arash Derambarsh, the centre-right deputy mayor of the town of Courbevoie, north-west of Paris, who instigated a 2016 law forcing supermarkets to stop dumping and destroying unsold food, was dismissive of the government\u2019s latest measure: a \u20ac6-\u20ac25 \u201crepair bonus\u201d to have clothes and shoes mended. \u201cIt\u2019s just pathetic, a pittance,\u201d Derambarsh said. \u201cThe government is talking about zips and buttons when far more ambitious measures are needed. And why should the French taxpayer be subsidising this? If the government was really serious about this it should make clothes manufacturers and sellers offer to repair clothes for a period of time, say five years. It would also encourage them to produce better quality goods.\u201d Sophie Bussi\u00e8re, a spokesperson for the Europe \u00c9cologie Les Verts party (EELV), agreed. \u201cWhat we need is for companies to be encouraged to act with constraints and fiscal advantages. Personal actions make up 25% of the effort necessary but what is really needed is action by businesses and local authorities. Of course we should encourage individual people to evolve their behaviour, but there needs to be structural change in the politics and less cynicism.\u201d The government argues its environment and climate policy is ambitious, coordinated and far-reaching. As a follow-up to the 2009-10 Grenelle laws, in 2020 France passed an anti-waste and circular economy law (AGEC), which outlines five main areas of attack in five-year chunks until 2040, and the following year a climate bill addressing France\u2019s pledges under the 2015 Paris agreement. Legislation now includes a more ambitious target of a 55% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030 (the EU\u2019s new target) compared with 1990, up from 40%, with the slogan Fit for 55. There are also small, soundbite policies, including vegetarian meals in schools, a watered-down policy on short-haul flights, rent caps for landlords with badly insulated property, and an obligation for public buildings to have water fountains \u2013 policies critics call \u201cpragmatic ecology\u201d they say has little impact. The 2021 legislation emerged from Macron\u2019s climate convention, a panel of 150 randomly selected people brainstorming ideas, which the president was accused of then mostly ignoring or allowing business leaders to dilute them. Greenpeace said the law did not address \u201cthe emergency of the situation\u201d and described it as a missed opportunity. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question of left or right it\u2019s about going forward and doing so more quickly,\u201d Derambarsh said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t seem to be even going forward under this administration.\u201d The criticism has come not only from political opponents. In 2021, France\u2019s top administrative court, the Council of State declared the government\u2019s efforts \u201cinsufficient\u201d and threatened sanctions and fines. It concluded France was not on track to meet its emissions goals. The country\u2019s independent High Council on Climate has repeatedly warned the government was falling short of its commitments and the rapporteur public, an independent commissioner, has also judged the government\u2019s actions inadequate. In a historic judgment in February 2021, the Paris administrative tribunal convicted the government for \u201cnon-respect of its engagements\u201d on combatting global heating. Environmental groups who brought the case were further outraged when in May this year Macron called for a \u201cpause\u201d on EU environment regulations, a suggestion Bussi\u00e8re said was \u201cscandalous and goes against all the scientific evidence\u201d. \u201cWhen he was elected, people naively believed Emmanuel Macon was an environmentalist. He said France would be an example in Europe and would lead the way on the environment. But while he speaks the right words and makes engagements and promises \u2013 and in different languages \u2013 we see that in reality there is little of substance in what he says.\u201d She added: \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to lay this on the French people to make them feel guilty when what we need is major political change. And it\u2019s not just EELV saying this but the courts.\u201d Barbara Pompili, a former minister for ecological transition, has defended the consumer-targeted politics, saying a \u201ccultural shift\u201d was needed. This was brought home last year in what Le Monde described as \u201cthe summer that ended French indifference to climate change\u201d, with record temperatures, rampant wildfires, drought, thunderstorms, flooding and hailstones the size of marbles. When a Beluga whale, normally found in the Arctic, was stranded in the Seine, it seemed a potent symbol of impending climate apocalypse. A few months later, France introduced rules requiring new items of clothing in shops to carry \u201ceco-labels\u201d detailing where they were made, with what and how they could be recycled. In one supermarket this week, shoppers were surprised to be shown the labels. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed them to be honest, and I can\u2019t see how adding another label is good for the environment,\u201d said Marie, 62, a retired teacher. Jeanne, 20, a law student, had not noticed the labels either, but was more impressed. \u201cAnything that encourages people to recycle is good, but perhaps it could have been better publicised.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b05", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/14/first-thing-florida-republicans-target-voter-registration-groups-with-thousands-in-fines", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Florida targets voter registration groups with thousands in fines | First Thing", "lead": "Fines on list given to the Guardian were levied by agency created at Ron DeSantis\u2019s behest to investigate voter fraud, which is rare.

Florida Republicans have hit dozens of voter registration groups with thousands of dollars of fines, the latest salvo in an alarming crackdown on voting in the state led by the governor, Ron DeSantis. At least 26 groups have cumulatively racked up more than $100,000 in fines since September last year, according to a list provided by Florida officials to the Guardian. The groups include for-profit and nonprofit organizations as well as political parties, including the statewide Republican and Democratic parties of Florida. The fines, which range from $50 to tens of thousands of dollars, were levied by the state\u2019s office of election crimes and security, a first-of-its-kind agency created at the behest of DeSantis in 2022 to investigate voter fraud. Voter fraud is extremely rare, and the office has already come under scrutiny for bringing criminal charges against people who appeared to be confused about their voting eligibility. Election watchdogs worry the new policies could have a chilling effect on engaging voters. There has already been a drop in voter registrations this year compared with 2019, the last full year leading into a presidential election, according to Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida. Through 1 June of this year, 2,430 new registrations had come from third-party voter registration organizations, he said. That\u2019s on pace to be a sharp decrease from the 63,212 new voter registrations from third-party groups submitted by the end of 2019. Who is most likely to be affected? A crackdown on third-party voter registration groups is likely to disproportionately affect Floridians of color, who are about five times more likely to register with third-party groups than white voters are. Floods, tornadoes, heat: more extreme weather predicted across US The US is bracing for more extreme weather from coast to coast, with a heatwave hitting California, tornadoes in the midwest and the east expecting more rain as it continues to reel from historic flooding. Residents of Vermont, still suffering from an onslaught of dangerous weather in recent days, are preparing for another round of severe storms in the area. Historic flooding in the state has damaged thousands of homes, businesses and roads, and has left some residents stranded. One death was confirmed by the state department of health, a 63-year-old man who drowned in his home. More than 200 rescues and 100 evacuations have taken place as a result of the extreme storms. Across the US, more than one-third of Americans were under extreme heat advisories, watches and warnings as the heatwave baking the nation spread further into California. The sweltering conditions were expected to build on Friday and through the weekend in central and southern California, where many residents were told to prepare for the hottest weather of the year by the National Weather Service. What\u2019s happening elsewhere? Mild El Ni\u00f1o climatic conditions brewing in the Pacific Ocean will strengthen throughout the year, with an outside chance of a record-breaking event that will further turbocharge already sweltering temperatures around the globe, scientists have forecast. As well as the US, heatwaves have roiled China, India, parts of Europe and the Arctic. Fran Drescher\u2019s fiery speech against Hollywood studios goes viral as actors strike Fran Drescher has blasted Hollywood studios in a fiery speech after talks between the actors\u2019 union and studios failed to avert a strike, calling them \u201cdisgusting\u201d for claiming \u201cthey\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs\u201d. In a speech that was widely circulated yesterday \u2013 particularly among many who did not know the star of The Nanny was heading up Sag-Aftra, Hollywood\u2019s biggest union \u2013 Drescher said actors were being \u201cmarginalised, disrespected and dishonoured\u201d by a business model that had been drastically changed by streaming and artificial intelligence. \u201cWhat happens here is important because what\u2019s happening to us is happening across all fields of labor, when employers make Wall Street and greed their priority and they forget about the essential contributors that make the machine run,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are the victims here. We are being victimised by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us. I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them. They stand on the wrong side of history.\u201d What\u2019s happening with the strike? On Thursday it was announced that 160,000 Sag-Aftra members \u2013 from big stars to background actors \u2013 would be joining the Writers Guild of America in a strike, marking the biggest shutdown of Hollywood since both unions last went on strike together in 1960. Sag-Aftra members have been ordered to stop any work connected to productions, including red carpets and promoting their work on social media. What do actors want? The unions are fighting for better terms with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, an entity that represents major studios and streamers, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros Discovery. In other news \u2026 Wagner mercenaries are no longer participating in \u201cany significant capacity\u201d in combat operations in Ukraine, says the Pentagon, more than two weeks after the group\u2019s aborted mutiny in Russia. The Pentagon press secretary, Pat Ryder, said the US assessed that \u201cthe majority\u201d of Wagner fighters were still in areas of Russian-occupied Ukraine. Federal prosecutors asked the judge presiding over the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case yesterday to reject Donald Trump\u2019s request that any trial should not take place until after the 2024 presidential election and reset the trial date for December. \u201cThere is no basis in law or fact,\u201d they said. Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner was among several witnesses to testify before a grand jury in recent weeks about the former president\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, US media reports. Kushner reportedly said it was his impression that Trump truly believed the 2020 election was stolen. At least 30 people died when the Sudanese army shelled a market in Omdurman during what residents of the country\u2019s most populous city described as the worst week for civilian casualties since the outbreak of war in April. Most of the victims were children and women, according to witnesses. A teacher in Wisconsin has been fired from her job after she criticized her public school district\u2019s decision to ban the song Rainbowland, which exalts the virtues of inclusivity, from a children\u2019s concert at her campus. The members of the board governing public schools in the solidly Republican community of Waukesha voted unanimously to dismiss Melissa Tempel from her job. Stat of the day: Anchor, first and oldest US craft brewery, to shut down after 127 years After 127 years, Anchor Brewing is no more. The first and oldest craft brewery in the US, which started in San Francisco in 1896, announced this week that it would end its operations after struggling financially as a result of a competitive market, inflation and declining sales, particularly after the storied brand\u2019s 2017 acquisition by the Japanese beer distributor Sapporo. Those factors \u201cleft the company with no option but to make this sad decision to cease operations\u201d a company spokesperson, Sam Singer, said in a statement. Garrett Oliver, brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery, mourned the loss in an interview with the Guardian: \u201cAnchor was essentially the grandfather of all American craft brewing \u2026 You know that old saying about a band who only had maybe 50 people at its first show \u2026 but every one of those people went and started a band? That was Anchor Brewing Company. And all their people were the best.\u201d Don\u2019t miss this: Boundaries are suddenly everywhere. What does the squishy term actually mean? We are obsessed with invisible circles. \u201cPersonal boundaries\u201d \u2013 or often just \u201cboundaries\u201d \u2013 are nowadays seen as the hallmark of emotional maturity. Wellness influencers promise that if you clarify the line dividing you from those around you, children will stay out of your home office. Friends and lovers will stop using you as a screen for their projections. As you are released from everyone else\u2019s psychodrama, your racing thoughts will quiet, and your ability to concentrate will return. You will learn to say the word \u201cno\u201d, protect your time, and double your salary. This is how the concept is sold to us by an army of life coaches and content producers. But boundaries have a moral authority that\u2019s easy to abuse, and the actor Jonah Hill\u2019s text messages to his then-girlfriend Sarah Brady are an especially drastic example. The notion of \u201cboundaries\u201d is a seductive metaphor for how our relationships should work \u2013 but where did it come from? Climate check: US Republicans oppose climate funding as millions suffer in extreme weather Swaths of the US are baking under record-breaking heat, yet some lawmakers are still attempting to block any spending to fight the climate crisis, advocates say. Nearly 90 million Americans are facing heat alerts this week, including in Las Vegas, Nevada, which may break its all-time hottest temperature record, and parts of Florida, where a marine heatwave has pushed up water temperatures off the coast to levels normally found in hot tubs. Stifling heat is also blanketing parts of Texas, which for weeks earlier this summer sweltered under a record-shattering heat dome, which one analysis found was made five times more likely by the climate crisis. Despite this, the state\u2019s Republican senator Ted Cruz is rallying his fellow GOP members of the Senate commerce committee to circulate a memo attacking climate measures in Biden\u2019s proposed 2024 budget, Fox News reported on Wednesday. Last Thing: My big day out as Barbie\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 \u2018Is topless mermaid Ken a step too far?\u2019 Everybody wants to be a Barbie. But who wants to be a Ken? Barbie\u2019s on/off boyfriend has happily remained in the background since 1961, with Barbie hogging the spotlight and glory. Even the Ken from the forthcoming Barbie film, played by Ryan Gosling, seems dutifully aware of his role in life: making Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie look good, with no rewards, physical or otherwise. The movie\u2019s tagline: \u201cShe\u2019s everything. He\u2019s just Ken,\u201d has spawned memes on everyone from Princess Diana and Prince Charles to Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Anakin Skywalker. The insinuation is: for every alpha Barbie, there is a beta Ken behind them, and even Ken knows it. We are in the midst of a Kencore summer \u2013 but Barbie\u2019s dream guy is still being overshadowed and overlooked. I set out to change all that, with just a pair of rollerblades and some unbridled Ken-ergy, writes Rich Pelley. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Numerous UK ministers have been to Saudi Arabia in the interim, and senior Saudi ministers have also come to the UK, including the foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. Prince Mohammed also spent nearly a week in Paris last month meeting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and attending a climate finance summit. News of the UK visit, first reported by the Financial Times, comes as Saudi Arabia tries to end the war in Yemen, and has opened up diplomatic relations with Iran. The US is seeking to persuade Saudi Arabia also to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel, but Riyadh, unlike its Gulf Arab allies the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, is resisting until there is progress on the Palestinian issue. Saudi Arabia is also courting the UK vote in a November ballot to stage Expo 2030 in Riyadh, the point at which Saudi Arabia 2030 Vision, weaning the kingdom off fossil fuels, is supposed to be realised. The kingdom\u2019s chief rival for Expo is Rome. The UK is negotiating a free trade deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), of which Saudi Arabia is a leading member, and is anxious not to fall down the pecking order as Riyadh\u2019s key European partner. After a third round of trade talks in March, the UK said its analysis showed that, in the long run, a deal with the GCC would increase trade by at least 16%, adding at least \u00a31.6bn a year to the British economy and contribute an additional \u00a3600m or more to UK wages. In a blow to Saudi-UK commercial relations, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, this week announced he was not sanctioning the sale of Eurofighter jets to Saudi Arabia. Britain\u2019s BAE Systems struck a deal five years ago for the arms maker to supply 48 of the jets but a third of the components for them come from Germany, providing Berlin with a veto over where the jets are sold. Germany wants to see more progress in the Saudi peace talks with the Houthi rebels who seized the Yemeni capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2015. Saudi Arabia is also increasingly at odds with the United Arab Emirates over Yemen\u2019s future, with the two countries backing rival groups in the country\u2019s south, something that disturbs the Foreign Office. In a shift in diplomatic direction, the crown prince invited the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to address the Arab League in Jeddah on 19 May, a decision hailed as a turning point by Macron. For most of the war, Saudi Arabia has been cooperating with Russia to keep oil prices high. The UK visit also comes as controversy spreads over Saudi\u2019s alleged sportswashing, including investments in Newcastle United, the expansion of the Saudi domestic football league and the proposed merger between the PGA and Saudi Arabia\u2019s money-laden LIV. The golf merger is the subject of US Senate hearings, with senators trying to see if it breaches antitrust laws. In 2022, Saudi Arabia executed 196 people, the highest number of annual executions that Amnesty International has recorded in the country in the last 30 years. On 12 March last year, the government executed 81 men, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian, in the largest known mass execution in the kingdom\u2019s history. Polly Truscott, Amnesty International UK\u2019s foreign policy adviser, said: \u201cThere must be no question of the UK rolling out the red carpet for Mohammed bin Salman, or of the Saudi ruler being able to use this visit to rehabilitate himself on the world stage. \u201cThe visit looks set to coincide with the five-year anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s sickening assassination and dismemberment at the hands of Saudi agents in Turkey, a crime which has essentially been covered up by the unrepentant Saudi authorities. \u201cMohammed bin Salman and his government must be properly held to account for abuses by Saudi officials, including Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the widespread use of torture in Saudi jails and the indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yemen. \u201cAmong numerous other cases, Rishi Sunak must be prepared to confront the crown prince over the outrageous jailing of Salma al-Shehab, the Leeds PhD student who\u2019s serving a 27-year jail sentence after an unfair trial for her tweets supporting women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b07", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/14/theres-still-time-to-sow-basil-seeds-garden", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Reliable, aromatic and delicious \u2013 there\u2019s still time to sow basil seeds", "lead": "Sweet Genovese is great for pesto, purple basil is sweet, Thai basil is intense, British basil is hardy \u2026 This is a good month to grow your own", "author": "Claire Ratinon", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:00:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096888", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/890174142306cfaef80a9b6a58183d68da653595/0_212_4862_2918/500.jpg", "body": "It wasn\u2019t the best spring for growing edible plants \u2013 at least not in my veg patch. Those long weeks of cool, gloomy weather were the backdrop to my first sowings of climbing beans, courgettes and their kin being ravaged by slugs, snails and peculiar winds. Yet there\u2019s one plant that, no matter how wobbly the start to the main growing season, I always trust will grow reliably and pleasingly \u2013 and that\u2019s basil. Possibly not the most exciting plant choice to write a love letter to, but I was just potting on the various varieties I\u2019ve been growing and basking in their delicious scent and sturdy growth. They are far more robust when grown from seed than the potted basil sold in supermarkets, which is often floppy and less flavoursome. Basil is a delightful plant with simple needs. It needs a little warmth to germinate, some well-draining soil or compost to root into (which is why I like to grow it in containers) and regular watering. You can still sow basil seeds in July \u2013 the temperature is just right \u2013 and be in with a good chance of a harvest before the colder weather arrives. Plus, if you like to grow some of your herbs in pots, they can be brought inside to live on a windowsill and used to flavour your cooking well after summer has faded. Every year I grow the classic Sweet Genovese basil, the variety familiar to most \u2013 and if you like to make pesto from scratch, then this is basil for you. Alongside, I\u2019m always growing purple basil, which is similarly sweet but produces striking leaves in the deepest of purples. It\u2019s as tasty but far more attractive to look at and wouldn\u2019t seem out of place in a luscious flowerbed. Somewhere in between these two varieties in looks, but in another realm when it comes to taste, is Thai basil. With intense aniseed and almost floral notes, this basil is like no other, and I first met its special taste piled up with mint and bean sprouts next to a bowl of Vietnamese pho. This season I\u2019m growing \u2018British Basil\u2019 to see whether \u2013 as the description promises \u2013 it performs well in cool weather. The best approach to harvesting basil is to pinch out the growing tips, as this will encourage your plants to produce side shoots and more leaves. Basil does have a tendency to bolt in hot weather, so if you spot that happening, try pinching out the flowers to delay the process. Failing that \u2013 as I did in last year\u2019s heatwave \u2013 a basil plant left to flower is beautiful and fragrant, and the pollinators will be grateful for the extra forage. Also grateful for the presence of basil are tomatoes, not only because their flavours go together perfectly but because basil\u2019s strong scent is said to repel aphids and other sap\u2011sucking insects."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b08", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/14/rishi-sunak-must-stick-to-116bn-climate-commitment-say-mps", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rishi Sunak must stick to \u00a311.6bn climate commitment, say MPs", "lead": "Tories, including former net zero tsar, among signatories to letter urging PM not to let down developing countries", "author": "Helena Horton", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:00:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096908", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3ff48a20bb3909a2005c80414b6a3d079c7fdb28/678_930_4739_2844/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak must uphold his \u00a311.6bn climate finance commitment, Conservative parliamentarians, including the former net zero tsar, have said. Writing to the prime minister in a cross-party letter, they say recommitting to the target and clearly demonstrating how it would be met would \u201cavoid doing further damage to the UK\u2019s climate leadership, and help to build a safe and more prosperous future\u201d. Chris Skidmore, the MP who authored the government\u2019s net zero review, is among 51 parliamentarians, including four Tories, who have written to the prime minister urging him not to let down developing countries. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, who also signed the letter, told the Guardian: \u201cThe government\u2019s commitment to \u00a311.6bn in climate finance isn\u2019t a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s an absolutely critical part of the global effort to tackle the accelerating climate emergency, and a solemn promise to the international community that cannot simply be abandoned on a whim. \u201cIt must be new and additional money, too. Giving with one hand and taking with another, by diverting cash from an already depleted aid budget, won\u2019t help those on the frontline of this crisis. Any backsliding on this commitment would leave any remaining semblance of the UK\u2019s global climate leadership in tatters.\u201d Sunak has drawn up plans to ditch the promise, the Guardian revealed earlier this month, after a leaked document showed officials had warned that the spending commitments to climate breakdown mitigation in the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries were not being made. The \u00a311.6bn is the UK\u2019s contribution to the $100bn of climate finance from wealthy countries that was pledged in 2009 at Cop15 in Copenhagen has still not been delivered by rich nations. The UK spent \u00a35.8bn over the previous five years up to 2021. This was doubled to\u00a311.6bn between April 2021 and March 2026, \u00a33bn of which was earmarked for protecting and restoring nature, meeting commitments made in Cop15 last December. This is now at risk, with civil servants revealing in a leaked briefing that it was almost impossible to meet the funding at current levels of spending. The Labour party has also refused to commit to meeting the target. \u201cWe are writing to you as a group of cross-party Parliamentarians to express our profound concern at media reports that the government is considering reneging on its commitment to spend \u00a311.6bn on climate finance between financial years 2021-22 to 2025-26, and to urge you to uphold this vital pledge,\u201d the letter to Sunak, delivered on Friday, reads. Skidmore, the MP Derek Thomas, Lord Randall, and Lady Hooper were the Conservatives who signed the letter, along with Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, and the Lib Dem net zero spokesperson Wera Hobhouse. They added that they were concerned that other parts of the Foreign Office development budget would have to be redirected as climate finance to meet the target: \u201cWe cannot take from one pot which provides lifesaving assistance to fill another, particularly where it is those least responsible for climate change who are being worst hit.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b09", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/14/republican-senator-tommy-tuberville-white-natiomalists", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Republican senator finally ends crusade to defend white nationalists ", "lead": "Tommy Tuberville, from Alabama, had seemed determined to support extremists despite condemnation from his colleagues", "author": "Adam Gabbatt", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:00:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096926", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f787021e4e09a7f86d3d62fc9dcd72448d87aa2b/0_0_4022_2415/500.jpg", "body": "Politicians typically enter office with a variety of interests, goals and focuses.

Donald Trump wanted to build a wall, \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d, and force people to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d. Tommy Tuberville, the Republican senator from Alabama, has taken a different tack. In a series of interviews and statements in recent months, he has invested his political capital in an attempt to defend white nationalism, and white nationalists, in what one anti-racist group called a \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d crusade \u2013 one that only appeared to come to an end this week, after condemnation from his Republican colleagues. Tuberville\u2019s dalliance with white nationalism \u2013 understood by most in the US and elsewhere as a racist ideology \u2013 began in May, when he used a local radio interview to criticize the government\u2019s efforts to \u201cget out the white extremists, the white nationalists\u201d from the military. Asked in that interview if white nationalists should be allowed in the military, Tuberville, an avid supporter of Trump, said, \u201cWell, they call them that. I call them Americans,\u201d before going into a rambling aside about the January 6 insurrection. \u201cRight after that, we, our military and Secretary Austin, put out an order to stand down and all military across the country, saying we\u2019re going to run out the white nationalists, people that don\u2019t believe how we believe,\u201d Tuberville continued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not how we do it in this country.\u201d Invited to clarify his remarks a couple of days later, Tuberville did anything but. He said the military \u201ccannot have racists\u201d, but, when asked if white nationalists should serve in the military, said: \u201cYou think a white nationalist is a Nazi? I don\u2019t look at it like that,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI look at a white nationalist as a Trump Republican. That\u2019s what we\u2019re called all the time. A Maga person.\u201d As Tuberville\u2019s comments gained more attention, few have seemed to agree with his sanitized definition. \u201cWhite nationalism is undoubtedly, nakedly racist,\u201d Dr Cassie Miller, lead senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Guardian. \u201cTo suggest anything otherwise would seem to be an attempt to make white nationalism an acceptable political position. That a senator would try to carry water for a violent, racist political movement is deeply disturbing.\u201d Tuberville, 68, was elected to the Senate in 2020, after spending most of his career as a college football coach. (His website still refers to Tuberville as \u201ccoach\u201d, and his official Senate portrait shows him tossing a football in the air.) If a defense of white nationalism seems a strange hill for a new senator to die on, his other main interest also fits in with a far-right cause: abortion. Tuberville, who sits on the Senate armed services committee, has single-handedly held up hundreds of military appointments as part of his opposition to abortion being provided in the armed forces. His continued opposition has left the Marine Corps without a confirmed leader for the first time in 150 years, and on Thursday Joe Biden accused Tuberville of \u201cjeopardising US security\u201d. While the Marine Corps was wondering who was going to be in charge, Tuberville instead kept plugging away about white nationalism at the beginning of the week, in an interview with CNN. After Tuberville suggested that a white nationalist was \u201cjust a cover word for the Democrats now where they can use it to try to make people mad across the country\u201d, The CNN host Kaitlan Collins stated that the definition of a white nationalist is someone \u201cwho believes that the white race is superior to other races\u201d. \u201cWell, that\u2019s some people\u2019s opinion,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cMy opinion of a white nationalist \u2013 if somebody wants to call them a white nationalist \u2013 to me, it is an American,\u201d Tuberville reiterated. \u201cNow, if that white nationalist is a racist, I\u2019m totally against anything that they want to do. Because I am 110% against racism.\u201d Rolling Stone seemed to capture the saga best. \u201cTommy Tuberville Is Either Extremely Dumb or Extremely Racist,\u201d read the magazine\u2019s headline (the article clarified that Tuberville could also be both), and even members of Tuberville\u2019s own party condemned him on Tuesday. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate minority leader called white nationalism \u201cunacceptable\u201d, while John Thune, the Republican Senate whip, said: \u201cI mean, I would just say that there is no place for white nationalism in our party, and I think that is kind of full stop.\u201d On the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, was more robust. \u201cFor the senator from Alabama to obscure the racist nature of white nationalism is indeed very, very dangerous,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHis words have power and carry weight with the fringe of his constituency, just the fringe, but if that fringe listens to him excuse and defend white nationalism, he is fanning the flames of bigotry and intolerance.\u201d Tuberville\u2019s website lists six different office locations, in Washington and across Alabama. No one answered the phone at any of the offices on Tuesday morning, as it seemed Tuberville was in the middle of a period of reflection: that afternoon the senator seemed to back away from white nationalism. Asked by CBS, on Capitol Hill, to define a white nationalist, Tuberville said: \u201cA white nationalist is somebody that thinks that they should be the only ones in this country.\u201d The CBS reporter followed up: \u201cRacist, all the time?\u201d \u201cRight, right: racist, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Tuberville said. All it had taken was two months, a series of botched interviews, a slew of negative headlines and a rollicking from his party leaders, for Tuberville to get on board with the most of the rest of the US."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b0a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/14/benji-reid-find-your-eyes-manchester-academy-review-tino-sehgal-this-entry-juan-meta-whitworth-art-gallery-manchester-international-festival-2023-mif", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Manchester international festival: Benji Reid: Find Your Eyes; Tino Sehgal: This Entry \u2013 review", "lead": "A belief in the transformative power of art unites Reid\u2019s sensational autobiographical work and Sehgal\u2019s meditation on the grace of football", "author": "Sarah Crompton", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:00:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096944", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/91a9632612c45e7503db490c3ab2b51dc031c96e/0_42_5344_3207/500.jpg", "body": "Benji Reid sits centre stage, flanked by two huge screens, his hunched shoulders lit by a single spotlight. Camera in hand, he looks intently at the figures posing in the light in front of him. A bell rings. Act one. He soundlessly presses the shutter. There\u2019s a pause. Then the photograph he has taken appears in sharp focus on the screens. Life and art in a single moment, its transformative power embodied in front of our eyes. Reid used to be a famous dancer, a leading member of Soul II Soul, and an early pioneer of hip-hop theatre. Then he turned away from performance and with equal success took up photography. John McGrath, director of the Manchester international festival, has coaxed him back to the stage. The result is sensational. Reid now describes himself as a \u201cchoreo-photolist\u201d, someone who combines photography, dance and theatre. It would sound pretentious, except that the results are so original that he really can call himself anything he wants. Find Your Eyes is a quotation taken from the American photographer Alec Soth. The show, as that title suggests, is about seeing and seeing differently. But it is also about imagining, about finding different ways to frame the world and to cope with its challenges and complexities. On stage, we see Reid photographing three exceptional dancers \u2013 Slate Hemedi (AKA Crazy), founder of Alliance Crew; pole dance champion Yvonne Smink; and Salom\u00e9 Pressac, who works with Studio Wayne McGregor. We witness their physical ability and how Reid\u2019s vision shapes it. On the soundtrack, carefully honed by dramaturg Keisha Thompson, Reid creates a fractured narrative of his life, his battles with mental health, his sense that black people are engaged in a conflict zone. Combined with varied, dense, music, it is haunted by images of depression and despair. In front of us, he shows images that match those brutal emotions but also of extraordinary, poised beauty. In one sequence of portraits, Hemedi and Pressac move swiftly through playful joy to resistance, anger and sorrow. Reid choreographs their moods, offering instructions. Each pose is carefully set; there\u2019s an almost religious atmosphere to the ritual, emphasised by the way that every image is shown as a triptych on Ti Green\u2019s clever set, with the live action in the middle, the photographs on either side. There are so many riches: the difference between the photographer\u2019s eye and your own; the atmosphere of Tupac Martir\u2019s lighting; the quiet precision of the studio assistants whose workings are in full view yet still conjure wonders. As the show progresses through three acts and 90 minutes, the scenes staged become more elaborate, the dancers wearing fantastical, futuristic costumes to change their shape and form. In one extraordinary sequence, Smink becomes a human kite, holding position with breathtaking aplomb as a wind machine blows silk around her. Finally, Reid brings on a real deus ex machina as Pressac, a dancer endowed with an uncanny ability to communicate sadness, lies on a light box, racked with pain. We hear the story of his mother, felled by a stroke, tapping out messages to the gods: \u201cCome and save me.\u201d A god appears; she is resurrected. We see the trick. Yet it still has the power of a miracle. That\u2019s the secret of the entire show; Reid has taken his vulnerabilities and transmuted them into art. The metamorphosis is overwhelmingly moving. Tino Sehgal\u2019s workings are more cerebral but equally interesting. This Entry is the first of a series of commissions co-curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist and the Spanish footballer Juan Mata, hero to all who love Manchester United. (I do.) The idea is that artists work with footballers around the theme of a type of creative midfielder known as the trequartista, whose visionary moves transcend time and space. Sehgal has invited four talented people \u2013 a violinist, a cyclist, a dancer-singer and a footballer \u2013 to conjure that playfulness in the confines of a gallery. At first they seem to be noodling around; the violinist (Adela Philippi on the day I was there) producing mournful notes as the cyclist (Lea Schaepe) cycles backwards and the footballer (William Cochart) sends the ball into the air, balancing it on his head, neck, upturned ankle. Gradually, the similarity between their skills becomes more pronounced. As they stand or lie alongside one another, like a living sculpture, you notice the minute adjustment of balance that the cyclist must make to stay upright, or that the footballer needs to make the ball land precisely on the sole of his foot. The violinist lies on the floor, moving only her bow, her other hand plucking the air; it\u2019s a movement later repeated by all of the participants. At one point they split into pairs to ask the audience about their own artistic engagement. At another, the dancer Sandhya Daemgen fills the gallery with snatches of song. All the time, they gently interact with the viewers, transfixing us, inducing a meditative state. Like Reid, Sehgal is asking us to look differently, to watch carefully. He makes us understand the tiny calibrations of movement that we are all engaged in all the time as we seek balance and interaction. But he also makes visible the instinct to create art, to participate, to improve. It\u2019s not as exciting as seeing Mata ping a pass into the penalty area, but it\u2019s just as beautiful.

But Sienna Jackson stood emotionless on the pitch. The 24-year-old American forward couldn\u2019t believe she had just scored the first goal of the Homeless World Cup, hosted for the first time in the United States. Just a few years ago, Jackson was sleeping on the streets of downtown Sacramento, less than 5 miles away from the Hornet Stadium at California State University where she was now playing. \u201cI went from laying out there with the cockroaches, sleeping out with rats, to scoring a goal for my country,\u201d Jackson said. Organized by Street Soccer USA and its chapter in Sacramento, the Homeless World Cup aims to use the sport of soccer to inspire unhoused people and reshape attitudes towards homelessness. More than 300 players are competing in the tournament, divided over 40 national teams \u2013 28 men\u2019s teams and 12 women\u2019s teams, hoping to reach the finals on 15 July and getting back into society eventually. The tournament comes at a time when California is battling a dire homelessness emergency. The state counts more than 171,000 people experiencing homelessness, a third of the homeless population in the US. In 2022, the state reported nearly 10,000 unaccompanied unhoused youth on a single night, the largest number in the country. California is considered the most unaffordable state in the country, with people earning the minimum wage having to work 90 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a California problem, it\u2019s a global problem, and what we need to be doing is not continually talking about the problem, but actually concentrating on what the solution is,\u201d Mel Young, a Homeless World Cup co-founder, said, two decades after he arranged the first tournament in Graz, Austria. \u201cWe are using the sport in a constructive way to get people off the streets, so that\u2019s the message we are giving to people in Sacramento and in California.\u201d \u201cIn our collective frustration about homelessness, unsheltered people too often get stripped of their humanity. The World Cup shows a different side,\u201d Sacramento\u2019s mayor, Darrell Steinberg, said in a statement. Jackson, the US player, became unhoused at the age of 19, she said, when her mother kicked her out of the house after finding out she had been drinking while attending a community college in Sacramento. Jackson dropped out of school and spent weeks searching for a place to live until other young unhoused people told her about Wind Youth Services, an organization and haven for homeless teenagers in need of refuge and basic necessities. \u201cEverybody there was either battling an addiction related to drugs or alcohol,\u201d Jackson said, recounting her first days in the shelter. \u201cIt was tough seeing other kids high off of heroin, sitting there scratching their bleeding faces.\u201d Jackson said she had been nervous before the tournament, eager to make a remarkable performance since she knew this would be her only appearance in a World Cup of this sort. The tournament forbids players from competing more than once. Playing for the US represented a second opportunity, Jackson said, and she didn\u2019t want to disappoint her team and, more important, herself. Soccer helped Jackson discover a new path amid her struggles with her family, she said. \u201cIt created a safe environment for me to be able to step into and know people that have been through the same thing \u2013 maybe worse,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cI could calm down and re-evaluate my life. It just gave me something to look forward to.\u201d Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Jackson, still homeless, participated in a program organized by Street Soccer USA. Its managing director, Lisa Wrightsman, told her she was good enough to compete at a World Cup. Wrightsman, too, has a personal connection to the cup. When she was a senior at Sacramento State, her goal was to become a professional soccer player, but that year, in 2003, the Women\u2019s Soccer League folded after three seasons. Unable to find a purpose, Wrightsman started drinking frequently and was arrested multiple times for driving under the influence, she said. But in 2010, she was invited to the Homeless World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, an experience that transformed her life, she said. \u201cThe tournament allows people to be seen for who they want to be and who they are trying to be,\u201d said Wrightsman, a 42-year old Sacramentan. \u201cIt gives them confidence like it did to me. Like maybe you have one foot in, one foot out, but soon both feet will be there and moving forward.\u201d Sacramento has seen its homelessness emergency grow significantly in recent years. In 2019, the year Jackson arrived at Wind Youth Services, at least 5,570 people were homeless in Sacramento county, according to a report from California State University. By 2022, that number had risen to 9,278, or 59 out of every 10,000 residents. Last year, voters in the city approved Measure O, which prohibits homeless encampments on public property and requires the city to authorize new shelter spaces. A progress report from the city in April stated the city had identified 655 shelter spaces, but the homeless population in the county has continued to grow, with the majority of unhoused people living in outdoor tents, vehicles or other locations not suitable to house humans. A year after leaving the shelter, Jackson now is months away from earning a dental hygiene degree from Carrington College and living in an apartment with her dog, the same one that once accompanied her when she slept in the streets. Back at the Hornet Stadium, Jackson was congratulated by her teammates and coach because she played a pivotal role in the 3-0 victory over Finland. Although she was out of breath from the intensity of the 15-minute game, Jackson smiled thinking of the goal she scored, which she had dreamed about the night before, she said. But there was something else on her mind, she added: she was thinking of herself, younger, wandering at night, looking for something to eat, somewhere warm enough to stay. When asked what she would tell her 19-year-old self, Jackson didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cJust hang in there girl, don\u2019t give up \u2026 Opportunities are always around the corner. Just hang in there.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b0c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/14/a-walk-along-the-essex-coast-to-a-historic-pub-the-crooked-billet-leigh-on-sea", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A walk along the Essex coast to a historic pub: the Crooked Billet, Leigh-on-Sea", "lead": "This stroll past beach huts, wartime ruins and wildfowl cuts through Southend and ends in a 16th-century boozer", "author": "Stephen Emms", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:00:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.096982", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/10ce16c032ff3bfdedf757d941395097955ae4ed/0_81_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Why is the Essex coast so underrated? Close to London, and arguably as pretty as any other, is it because there\u2019s something unchanging about it \u2013 perhaps even conventional? And yet stepping off the train at Shoeburyness \u2013 the last stop on the capital to coast railway from Fenchurch Street \u2013 feels gently discombobulating. There\u2019s always a romantic quality about the end of the line, and just a few minutes\u2019 walk away there is a vast estuary foreshore with rocky outcrops under an expansive Essex sky. It\u2019s here, on a blustery Sunday, that my boyfriend and I survey the view at the start of our seven-mile coastal hike to the village of Old Leigh. To our left is a mile-long defence boom, built in the second world war to prevent submarines from accessing the Thames, now protected as a historical monument. To our right is Shoebury garrison, formerly owned by the Ministry of Defence, which sprang up during the Crimean war in the 1850s. We begin by strolling past its historic buildings, including the officers\u2019 mess, now converted into prestigious housing, while an adjoining park is dotted with grassy mounds, once air-raid shelters. A vantage point over the beach houses the imposing quick-firing battery, built in 1899 as a coastal artillery training facility. We learn from one of the many info plaques that a 1940-built machine-gun emplacement set into the seawall is the only second world war anti-invasion facility to have survived in the garrison. We read about the magnetic mine dropped on to the tidal flats in 1939 by German seaplanes, and the remains of the concrete Mulberry harbour, designed as a supply base for the allied invasion of Normandy. At this point the 25-hectare (60-acre) Gunners Park and Shoebury Ranges nature reserve runs parallel to the coastal path. As well as containing structures built when it was key to MoD testing and training \u2013 such as the two brick powder magazines and the experimental casemate \u2013 it\u2019s a site of special scientific interest. The relatively undisturbed habitat \u2013 which has been closed to the public for 150 years \u2013 is now home to migratory birds, rare plants and lakeside paths. Leaving the military ruins behind as gulls shriek above us, the path becomes Thorpe Esplanade, lined by pastel beach huts. At the water\u2019s edge we spot dozens of sanderlings and turnstones; another plaque informs us that the Thames supports the fifth-largest total of wintering waterfowl of any estuary in the UK, including short, stocky grey wading knots and black-and-white oystercatchers. The light here is stunning: clouds part celestially, a flash of sun illuminating the mirror-flat turquoise water. Southend pier is already visible, yet still deceptively far away. We\u2019re now in a more built-up suburb, the housing an eclectic mix of seafront mansions and Edwardian piles, some more tasteful than others. We pass the Roslin Beach hotel, set in tropical gardens, where I\u2019ve previously stayed, an inviting pit stop for a cocktail or lunch, but we persevere, instead breaking for coffee and carrot cake halfway, at the cute Dog &amp; Co artisan cafe on Eastern Esplanade. Opposite are tapas bars Ocean Beach and Billy Hundreds, both with the inviting air of Spanish chiringuitos. But, caffeine-fuelled, we avoid the temptation of grilled sardines and crisp verdejo and continue along the traffic-heavy coastal thoroughfare. On our left, boats perch in the low-tide mud, surrounded by hazy pools of water, while on our right cars roar past, windows open, music pounding. And, just like that, we\u2019re sucked into the blur of Southend. There are several demands now for our attention, from the sealife centre and Mediterranean-style park to flashing arcades with names like Monte Carlo or New York New York. But it\u2019s the grand dome of the Kursaal that holds our gaze: built in 1901, it mutated from amusement park to live-music venue, casino and bowling alley. Now derelict and decaying, it\u2019s owned by the UK arm of an American investment firm with a 200-year lease and no break clause. This section is dominated by Southend pier. Opened in 1889, it\u2019s the longest pleasure pier in the world \u2013 at 1.34 miles, a 25-minute walk each way, or a seven-minute ride on new electric trains, which last year replaced the old diesel engines. A bottleneck of daytrippers vie for tickets, while others head for the big wheel and Adventure Island rides. Opposite is newish arts space and cafe Twenty One, a welcome retreat from the crowds. Here, too, we spy the elegant Regency terrace above Southend Cliff Gardens, where both the Royal hotel and Hamiltons boutique B&amp;B are situated. We\u2019re now on Western Esplanade, towering palms lining the pavement, walking towards the Cliffs Pavilion theatre, past a spate of seafront cafes and restaurants, including popular ice-cream parlour Rossi\u2019s. At Chalkwell beach, walkers congregate around the Crowstone, a stone pillar on the mudflats which, until 1857, marked the seaward limit of the jurisdiction of the City of London over the River Thames. As the afternoon wears on, the light on the watery pools shimmers, the path narrowing alongside Essex Yacht Club, mastheads rattling in the breeze. We finally reach Old Leigh, the oldest part of Leigh-on-Sea, up on a steep hill. Cottages and clapboard buildings line the cobbled streets, former industrial storehouses and boatsheds have become bars and restaurants, and the briny whiff of seafood stalls is pervasive, just-caught fish glistening. Eagerly we stop for a pint at Ye Olde Smack, whose rear terrace enjoys views over the creek. A more spacious gastropub, the Peterboat, is a little further down, past the Boatyard restaurant and Old Leigh Art Studios, but our hungry eyes are on the strip\u2019s oldest boozer, the Crooked Billet. At the threshold we pause to listen to the warbles emanating from the mudflats. Google map of the route Start Shoeburyness station Distance 7.5 miles Time 3 hours Total ascent 0 metres Difficulty Easy The pub The late 16th-century Crooked Billet is the tiniest pub in Old Leigh. It\u2019s opposite Billet Wharf, home to the Osborne Brothers cockle sheds, and the pub\u2019s own waterside terrace, where a handful of drinkers are nursing pints. The story behind the name is appealing: from the early 1850s, an organisation \u2013 which became known as the Billet Club \u2013 was formed here to help sick fishermen. Nowadays, the cosy dining room is on the left, the lively bar on the right; both have roaring fires. Grabbing the last available table, we devour excellent calamari, chargrilled rose ribeye and a game suet pudding (from the seasonal menu), all washed down with a hearty Portuguese red. Where to stay Old Leigh\u2019s accommodation comprises mostly Airbnb options, but if it\u2019s an independent boutique hotel you\u2019re after try Hamiltons in central Southend. Housed on the 1790s Regency parade known as Royal Terrace, which runs along the Cliff Gardens, it was fully restored in 2007. There are six rooms \u2013 a top tip is the balcony suite with its wrought-iron veranda, where you can drink in the lofty views over the park, promenade and estuary.

But outside of the Netflix building on Sunset Boulevard on Thursday, the striking writers finally got some news they wanted to hear. \u201cSag is going on strike!\u201d someone called, and the crowd of picketing writers roared their approval. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra), whose 160,000 members include some of the most famous performers in the world, had officially announced its members would be joining Hollywood\u2019s 11,500 writers on the picket lines outside Disney, Warner Bros, and other major film and TV studios. But it\u2019s Netflix, and fellow streaming disruptors like Amazon and Apple, that are at the heart of the growing labor disputes that have now brought the film industry to a virtual standstill. Both writers and actors say that technological changes in the industry are forcing them to negotiate hard for major changes in their contracts. The new era of digital streaming has led to a dramatic decrease in how much money they make, they say. The rise of new artificial intelligence technologies is only adding to their concern. \u201cYou really can\u2019t make a living any more,\u201d said actor Felicia Day, who has been working in the industry for more than two decades. Day, who showed up at the Sag-Aftra headquarters for the official announcement of the strike on this sweltering Thursday, said she gets bigger checks for television residuals for roles she played back in 2004 than she does for much more recent performances. \u201cPeople are having a harder and harder time just supporting themselves and staying in the industry,\u201d she said. As pay for individual roles declines, Day said, actors have to secure twice as much work just to make rent \u2013 even though auditioning for and obtaining roles has not become any easier. A few years ago, four to five guest star roles on television shows would be enough to get an actor through a year, she said. Now, it takes double that number of roles to make the same amount of money: \u201cIt\u2019s a constant hustle and it\u2019s very demoralizing,\u201d she said. Hollywood\u2019s striking writers have made similar arguments, pointing to television writing contracts that have become shorter and more precarious, a development they argue is increasingly turning writers into gig workers. Inside Sag-Aftra\u2019s headquarters, union president Fran Drescher made it clear that actors were fed up and fired up, saying, \u201cWe are the victims,\u201d and telling studio executives: \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on the wrong side of history.\u201d The star of The Nanny, a sitcom from the 1990s about a wealthy Broadway producer whose family is rescued by a straight-talking woman from Queens, Drescher is now being hailed as a labor hero for her blunt denunciations of studio executives. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers had released a statement ahead of the formal strike announcement blaming the actors\u2019 union for the breakdown of negotiations, saying it had offered actors \u201chistoric pay and residual increases\u201d and that the union\u2019s refusal would lead to widespread economic suffering among its members. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of expectation that they have, that is just not realistic,\u201d Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC in an interview on Thursday, speaking of both writers and actors. \u201cAnd they are adding to the set of the challenges that this business is already facing that is, quite frankly, very disruptive.\u201d Some industry analysts have argued that the transition to digital streaming has left Hollywood as a whole in a shaky financial situation. \u201cThe studios are in crisis,\u201d Kim Masters, the editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter, told NPR in advance of the strike. \u201cStreaming has really hurt them. They haven\u2019t figured out how to make money on it except Netflix, finally, after a lot of investment.\u201d But during a week in which anonymous studio sources told Deadline that their plan for the writers\u2019 strike was to delay further negotiations until the fall, when they thought writers would be out of money and at risk of losing their homes and apartments, many Hollywood workers don\u2019t have much sympathy for the financial struggles of the studios. Iger\u2019s reported compensation at Disney is $27m per year for two years. His predecessor, Bob Chapek, was forced out but reportedly received a $20m severance deal. Drescher, the Sag-Aftra president, did not dispute that a prolonged, dual strike by Hollywood\u2019s actors and writers would lead to economic hardship for the workers on strike and many other Angelenos affected by the fallout of halted productions, studio cutbacks and belt-tightening by tens of thousands of workers on strike. \u201cOur hearts bleed that we had to make this decision, but we can\u2019t not get what these members deserve, because it\u2019s only going to get worse,\u201d Drescher said. \u201cWe were forced into it.\u201d Outside Sag-Aftra headquarters, Danny Hogan, an actor who lives in New Jersey, said he had flown to Los Angeles to be on the ground during a historic moment. \u201cSince 1960, WGA and Sag have not been united like this,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWe are at a crisis point. Most actors want to have this as their full-time work. It seems like studios are forcing people to do this as a hobby more than a job.\u201d With artificial intelligence, he added, \u201cAre you going to take my image and my voice, replicate that, and then I\u2019m expendable?\u201d After trying to build a career for 17 years, Hogan said, he\u2019s finally been seeing momentum in his career, with recent roles in several Lifetime movies and on NCIS: Hawaii. The strike will halt that momentum, he said, but he still voted to support it: \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate necessity.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cour job, as actors, to be focused and present\u201d, Hogan said, and for now, he sees that job not on a set, but on the picket line."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b0f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/14/the-rise-of-the-cost-cutting-wedding-joint-booze-free-crowdfunded-micro-wedding", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Would you share your big day?

Online wedding planner Hitched\u2019s National Wedding Survey shows an increase in dry weddings in the UK last year, with 11% of couples choosing to host booze-free big days in 2022 compared with 10% in 2021. Meanwhile, TikTok is full of ideas for wedding mocktails. Paul, 32, and Becky, 29, both from Coventry, decided to throw a dry wedding last summer, asking guests not to bring any alcohol with them. Some struggled to hide their disappointment when they were told of this in advance, despite knowing that neither Paul nor Becky drink. \u201cWe have various friends who would normally be partying until 4am and they warned that our party would be over very quickly,\u201d says Paul. In the end, the wedding lasted till 1am \u2013 which Becky and Paul were \u201cvery happy\u201d with \u2013 while many guests said they were pleased to have been able to drive home afterwards and save on accommodation. (According to new research, British people spend an average of \u00a3604 to attend a wedding, with accommodation being the most costly factor). \u201cOther guests just said it was really nice to have such a \u2018chill\u2019 event without any worry of the party going over the edge and getting messy or dramatic,\u201d says Paul. Hosting a dry wedding often means having to think carefully about the entertainment, as guests may not be in the mood for dancing without dutch courage. Paul and Becky opted to have a ceilidh because, as Paul puts it: \u201cThe beauty of a ceilidh is that the caller is telling you exactly where to go and what to do\u201d \u2013 which may help loosen up sober guests. Karaoke was less of a success, he says, with several people deciding to up and leave at that point. Having a dry event led to big savings, with the whole wedding coming to \u00a32,600. \u201cAt the end of March 2023 we completed the purchase of our first home,\u201d says Paul. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the generational wealth that made it more possible for us \u2026 but it certainly didn\u2019t hurt that we barely dipped into our savings in order to fund the wedding.\u201d * * * Microwedding Microweddings have been steadily growing in popularity since the pandemic made smaller ceremonies a necessity. But while the idea of an intimate ceremony may appeal to many, in practice, slimming down the guest list is often no easy feat. This was something Lucy, 23, from Sheffield, had to contend with when she organised a ceremony in the Lake District with just 10 guests earlier this year. For Lucy and her partner, cost was a big factor in their decision to limit the guest list. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen the point of spending so much money on a single day,\u201d she says. On top of this, Lucy says she has suffered from social anxiety in the past, while her husband has \u201cnever been a fan of being the centre of attention\u201d. For this reason, he didn\u2019t give a speech \u2013 even in front of such a small group. For Lucy, a smaller wedding allowed her to \u201cmake the most of the day, with the people you love the most\u201d. The couple held two different activities on the day, which would not have been possible with more guests. \u201cMore is more when it comes to the entertainment. It meant that the day was more full and fun,\u201d she says. But having a limited number of guests poses its own problems. Her uncle was hurt not to be invited, as was one of her friends, for whom she had been a bridesmaid. Lucy relented eventually and invited her uncle, but only after it sparked a family drama. As for the friend: \u201cI should have invited her,\u201d says Lucy. After the initial quarrel, they\u2019re friends again. \u201cWe are both adults, and a wedding isn\u2019t worth throwing a decade-old friendship away over,\u201d she says. Originally, Lucy had planned to elope, with no guests. \u201cThere were times I wish we had,\u201d she says, reflecting on the tensions it caused with family and friends. \u201cAlthough with hindsight, I\u2019m glad we had our day the way we did. My advice to anyone planning a microwedding would be to make sure all the guests know, right from the start, that it is a small wedding only and there is no wriggle-room or compromise on guest numbers,\u201d she says. * * * Group-effort wedding In 2023, getting married is \u00a31,385 more expensive than it was a year ago, as inflation pushes up wedding costs. It has left many couples who are looking to tie the knot in a difficult position. As the cost of living crisis worsens, people are increasingly turning to friends and family to help with the costs, materials and logistics of staging their wedding. When Tanya Antonio, 39, and her husband Kevin, both from Swindon, got engaged last year, they were struggling with rising bills. Aware of the couple\u2019s situation, friends and family rallied to throw the perfect day for them, in lieu of giving presents. \u201cThey knew we were in a tight spot, but also this was their way of giving a gift to us,\u201d says Tanya. The couple hired a village hall so they could provide the food and drink themselves. Kevin\u2019s aunt handled the food, waking up at 5am on the morning of the wedding to prepare a variety of Caribbean dishes for the guests \u2013 a nod to where Kevin\u2019s family is from. Later on, other guests helped out with the catering, serving the food and drink. One guest who works as a venue dresser provided the chair covers, centrepieces, sashes, tablecloths and runners. Two guests took charge of decorating the hall, while another offered to do the cake. \u201cIt made it more meaningful that it was a joint effort,\u201d says Tanya. The wedding cost \u00a32,500. \u201cHaving family do the food and cake saved a lot of money that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford otherwise \u2026 It was a brilliant day, better than we imagined it would be.\u201d * * * Crowdfunded wedding Asking guests and strangers to donate to the cost of getting married is controversial, but it has become increasingly common as the cost of living crisis bites. From 2021 to 2022, GoFundMe saw a 24% increase in fundraisers set up in their \u201cnewlyweds\u201d category \u2013 which includes couples fundraising for their weddings and honeymoons. Martin, 46, and Emma, 39, both from Dorchester, recently set up a GoFundMe page for their wedding, which is taking place later this year. It reads: \u201cWe have been unable to save much at all in the 18 months we have been engaged \u2026 We can\u2019t wait to start a new life together as husband and wife. If you feel you can help, even a little, it would really be appreciated.\u201d The couple, who are hoping to raise \u00a33,743 (\u201cWe did a fair bit of research on the cost of things, plus a small contingency. It didn\u2019t feel right rounding it up to \u00a34,000 \u2013 more than we really need \u2013 and we hated the idea of raising \u00a33,500 and being short\u201d), say they were nervous to publish the fundraiser. \u201cIt feels a bit weird basically asking friends, family and random people to donate,\u201d says Emma. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day out for people, but let\u2019s face it: it\u2019s our big day. So can we expect other people to bend over and pay for it?\u201d Despite these anxieties, Martin and Emma have been sharing the page on social media. \u201cIt was something we did out of necessity, trying to think of ways to actually afford the wedding,\u201d says Martin. While both admit that the response to the GoFundMe so far has been fairly muted \u2013 they have only raised about \u00a3120 \u2013 they\u2019re hopeful that they\u2019ll receive more donations closer to the big day. And it has prompted guests who say they can\u2019t or would prefer not to donate to offer to lend a hand in other ways. Since the fundraiser launched, one guest has said they will sing at the wedding free of charge, while another friend has offered to help with the food. \u201cIt\u2019s a really difficult thing to do,\u201d says Emma of the GoFundMe. \u201cBut to have people come back and want to help in some way is really special.\u201d The couple believe that guests donating to the cost of weddings rather than giving gifts should become normalised. \u201cThis way the money has gone to something real that guests enjoy too,\u201d Emma says, \u201cinstead of something that\u2019s going to sit in a cupboard for a few years.\u201d * * * Double wedding Weddings are usually about all eyes on one couple, but it doesn\u2019t always need to be this way. Earlier this year, David, 41, and Nathan, 32, both from County Down, held a double wedding \u2013 a single marriage ceremony and reception for two couples \u2013 after initially planning a smaller wedding for just the two of them. It was Nathan\u2019s mother who suggested the couple share the event with Nathan\u2019s brother, Daryl, and his fiancee, Renee, while they were visiting the UK from their home in Australia. The idea of sharing the spotlight appealed to Nathan and David. \u201cWe wanted something low key to start with, because we didn\u2019t really like all eyes being on us,\u201d says David. Everything was shared, from the photos (there were ones of the couple on their own, too) to the vows and even the cake, which had David and Nathan\u2019s initials on one side, and Daryl and Renee\u2019s on the other. The couples did their vows one after the other, with David and Nathan going first. The only thing that wasn\u2019t shared was walking down the aisle: while David and Nathan chose to, Renee and Daryl opted not to. As Renee and Daryl live in Australia, David was only able to meet them two weeks before the wedding, so planning it together was always bound to be risky. One disagreement took place over the colour of the dresses Daryl and Renee\u2019s two young girls would wear. \u201cI was very much about doing a green, white and gold wedding,\u201d says David. \u201cAnd they wanted their two children to wear pink dresses.\u201d After an awkward back-and-forth, the couples eventually settled on white. \u201cYou have to be willing to compromise,\u201d says David. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone who has a picture of a perfect wedding day in your head, a double wedding probably isn\u2019t for you.\u201d Ultimately, sharing their wedding meant David, Nathan, Daryl and Renee could afford to rent a house for all 29 guests to stay together in and enjoy Northern Ireland for a couple of days after the celebration. It helped bring the two couples together, too. \u201cWe got to know each other very well, and it was a bonding experience.\u201d Photography assistant Harry Brayne.

Speculation about How Do You Live? had been building for months, not least because it is expected to be the last by the 82-year-old, who spent five years making the film after reversing a decision to retire. His Studio Ghibli \u2013 the artistic force behind Spirited Away, for which he won an Oscar in 2003, My Neighbour Totoro and Howl\u2019s Moving Castle \u2013 took the unusual step of keeping details of the plot secret. The film, previously described by Ghibli only as a \u201cgrand fantasy\u201d, was released with no trailers and publicity limited to a single poster, published last December, showing a sketch of a birdlike creature with white and blue feathers. While the film\u2019s title was taken from a best-selling 1937 novel by the Japanese children\u2019s author Genzaburo Yoshino, Ghibli stressed that the plot was a Miyazaki original. A surge in interest in Yoshino\u2019s work among fans trying to decipher clues about Miyazaki\u2019s valedictory anime and its release prompted publishers to issue reprints of the book and a manga adaptation. The novel also makes an appearance in the 124-minute film, which centres on a boy who moves to the countryside with his father after his mother dies in a fire in wartime Japan. There, he meets a heron who transports him to an alternate universe, where the mystery of his mother\u2019s death is slowly revealed. \u201cIt was a very Ghibli-esque movie,\u201d said Eisaku Kimura, a university student who was among the Miyazaki devotees who had queued outside a cinema in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district on Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I felt there was anything special about it just because it was his last work, but I definitely saw a lot of Miyazaki in the movie \u2026 and it was exciting.\u201d Valeriia Matveeva, an English teacher from Russia, described How Do You Live? as \u201ca crazy mixture of all the Ghibli movies I\u2019ve seen before\u201d. \u201cI think it takes the best of it, and I think it\u2019s kind of scary at times but it\u2019s also magical. Because there was no promotion, I had no idea what to think about it, but it was good.\u201d The film\u2019s producer, Toshio Suzuki, said last month that the studio had decided not to advertise How Do You Live? over concern that the promotions for previous Ghibli anime had verged on excessive. \u201cI thought giving out too much information would reduce audience interest,\u201d Suzuki said, according to Nikkei Asia. \u201cIn this age of information technology, I thought that the lack of information itself would be entertaining.\u201d After the release of his previous anime, The Wind Rises, in 2013, Miyazaki announced he would no longer make feature-length films, saying his age was beginning to inhibit his perfectionist approach. But four years later, Ghibli said the director was coming out of retirement to make what would be \u201chis final film, considering his age\u201d. Miyazaki was nominated for two further Academy Awards \u2013 for Howl\u2019s Moving Castle in 2006 and The Wind Rises in 2014 \u2013 the same year he was chosen to receive an honorary Oscar. One fan who had just watched the film at a cinema in Tokyo said the film was the \u201cculmination\u201d of Miyazaki\u2019s anime output. \u201cI couldn\u2019t digest it all by just watching it once \u2026 I feel like I want to watch it again immediately,\u201d he told Kyodo News.

The brand, best known for its signature check bags and raincoats, said that global sales grew 18% year on year to \u00a3589m in the quarter to 1 July \u2013 its fastest growth rate in two years. The company pointed to a strong sales recovery in mainland China, which suffered from Covid-19 related lockdowns last year, where sales rose 46% year on year. However, the US was a weak spot, with the Americas region reporting a sales decline of 8% year on year in the quarter. The luxury fashion retailer, which this week kicked off its \u201cbest of Great Britain\u201d campaign as it gears up for the September launch of its autumn/winter collection, said that outerwear and leather goods proved a hit with shoppers. Sales of outerwear, led by the 167-year-old brand\u2019s classic heritage rainwear, soared 36%, with vintage Burberry check and Frances shapes handbags also selling well. The company also said that leather goods sales rose by 13% year on year. However, the company, which said that tourist growth across Europe rose 53% year on year, said that the UK government\u2019s decision to stop allowing tourists to reclaim VAT on shopping purchases was hurting Britain\u2019s status as a holiday shopping destination. \u201cLondon has strength but we are definitely seeing a stronger recovery of [shopping] in continental tourists compared to the UK,\u201d said Ian Brimicombe, the interim chief financial officer at Burberry. \u201cAt the moment we are seeing Britons going to Europe and other nationalities going to continental Europe for their buying as opposed to London.\u201d Brimicombe said the UK needed a new scheme because European rivals offered various incentives to shoppers. \u201cBeing a home British brand we would love to attract [more] tourists [shopping] here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not really a level playing field at the moment. We need to even up the competition with continental Europe.\u201d He said that tourists had not been put off shopping in Paris despite the recent riots and unrest in France. Sales across Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa rose 17% in the first quarter. Burberry also enjoyed a strong performance across Asia Pacific. Sales in southern Asia rose 39%, with Japan up 44%. \u201cThe luxury market continues to thrive unabated as more well-heeled shoppers continue to purchase items consistently, with the demand levels this provides helping to maintain the market,\u201d said John Coldham, a retail partner at the law firm Gowling WLG. Burberry has been implementing a return to the \u201cBritishness\u201d of the brand\u2019s roots in a refocus under its chief executive, Jonathan Akeroyd, 56, who started last April. The Briton joined from Versace, which he had run since 2016. \u201cEncouragingly, it isn\u2019t just China driving the growth,\u201d said Charlie Huggins of the investment service Wealth Club. \u201cThis suggests Burberry has seen a good early response to brand elevation efforts and new designs.\u201d However, trading in the US continues to be tough, with the Americas region reporting a sales decline of 8% year on year in the quarter. In September, the Bradford-born designer Daniel Lee\u2019s first runway collection, which debuted at London Fashion Week in February, will be available in-store. Lee joined in October last year, replacing the creative head Riccardo Tisci, who left just a year after his fellow Italian Marco Gobbetti\u2019s departure as chief executive. \u201cBurberry is likely to face a big test of its luxury credentials in the coming months,\u201d said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. \u201cWhen economic times are tough, sales of true luxury goods are often relatively unaffected, as the wealthy clientele who buy them are insulated from the worst of the impact. \u201cDoes Burberry have the necessary cachet? The reception given to the work of Burberry\u2019s new design chief Lee will be important for the business.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b14", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/14/aspartame-is-safe-in-limited-amounts-say-experts-after-cancer-warning", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Aspartame is safe in limited amounts, say experts after cancer warning", "lead": "Up to 14 cans of diet drink a day considered safe for 70kg person, as WHO says sweetener is \u2018possibly\u2019 carcinogenic in larger amounts", "author": "Caroline Davies", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 09:23:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097127", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ad7b4a2fb996adc743e257f3fd88b3027dc5700e/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "A widely used artificial sweetener deemed a \u201cpossible\u201d cause of cancer is safe in limited quantities, such as consuming fewer than nine to 14 cans of soft drink a day, experts have said. The sugar substitute aspartame, used in thousands of products including diet fizzy drinks, ice-cream and chewing gum, was classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d in a report released on Thursday by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The IARC has two more serious categories: \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d and \u201ccarcinogenic to humans\u201d. But the Food and Agricultural Organisation\u2019s Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, which carried out a complementary study, retained its advice that it is safe for a person to consume 0-40mg for every kg of body weight each day. The WHO said a person weighing 70kg would need to drink more than between nine and 14 cans of diet soft drink a day to exceed the daily guideline. Dr Francesco Branca, director of the WHO\u2019s department of nutrition and food safety, said: \u201cThe assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies. \u201cWe\u2019re not advising consumers to stop consuming [aspartame] altogether. We\u2019re just advising a bit of moderation.\u201d Both studies cited \u201climited evidence\u201d and called for more research into the issue. The WHO said it and the IARC would continue to monitor evidence and encourage independent research groups. Used as an artificial sweetener since the 1980s, aspartame gives a taste 200 times sweeter than sugar for few calories. The chemical is also found in products including some yoghurts, breakfast cereals, toothpastes and medications such as cough drops and chewable vitamins. Harriet Burt, a senior policy and international projects officer for World Action on Salt, Sugar &amp; Health based at Queen Mary University of London, said the report emphasised the need for a new approach by food and drink manufacturers. \u201cThis new report from the WHO shows that companies need to reduce the overall sweetness of their products rather than relying so much on sweeteners,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen done correctly, reformulation can gradually remove excess sugars, salt and saturated fat from foods to improve their overall healthiness without the need for replacement ingredients such as non-sugar sweeteners.\u201d She continued: \u201cWorryingly, sugar consumption in the UK is still double the recommended levels due to a food system that promotes overconsumption of excessively sweet products high in salt and saturated fat. This is why reducing sugar consumption should remain a priority. \u201cBased on recent WHO reports, it is clear that the UK government urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to reduce not just sugar but overall product sweetness, including the use of non-sugar sweeteners like aspartame.\u201d Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, told the BBC the \u201cevidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough\u201d and that \u201cthis is really more a call to the research community\u201d to study the sweetener more."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b15", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/14/renegade-queensland-senator-gerard-rennick-appeals-after-being-booted-from-lnp-ticket", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Renegade Queensland senator Gerard Rennick appeals after being booted from LNP ticket", "lead": "Speculation he could move to crossbench if appeal is unsuccessful as allies suggest he may run as an independent at next election", "author": "Amy Remeikis", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 09:21:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097145", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/359ea35db2830f923b7fb8eafb09b46cdfad5fcc/1088_173_4864_2920/500.jpg", "body": "The Liberal National party senator Gerard Rennick is appealing against his dumping from a winnable spot on the party\u2019s Queensland Senate ticket. Rennick lost the number three spot on the Queensland ticket to the party treasurer, Stuart Fraser, in a tight vote of the LNP faithful last week. The Guardian understands just three votes made the difference, with Fraser receiving 134 votes to Rennick\u2019s 131. The close vote is one of the reasons for the appeal, along with claims of a disorganised process. Rennick did not respond to requests for comment, but a LNP source confirmed the appeal had been lodged on Tuesday. An LNP spokesperson said the party did not comment on candidate selection processes. Under the party\u2019s constitution any applicant can appeal against a selection vote decision to the disputes committee \u201con the ground of unfair treatment or grave irregularity\u201d. A written statement and appeal lodgement fee of $1,000 needs to be lodged within three working days of the selection vote. The disputes committee then asks the state council for a report and will make a decision on whether or not to uphold the vote. In the event it is not upheld, a fresh selection vote can be held or, in some cases, the council can select the nominee itself. Rennick faced a challenge from the more moderate wing of the LNP which had grown increasingly uncomfortable with his statements on vaccines, climate change and Ukraine. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, had backed in Rennick ahead of the vote, given he was a sitting senator. Rennick having lost the vote is being seen by some within the party as a chip in Dutton\u2019s control of the party, which he had exerted strong influence over during his time in government, before taking over the parliamentary leadership. Meanwhile, there were concerns Rennick would choose to spend the rest of his Senate term on the crossbench given the party\u2019s decision to dump him from the ticket. While Rennick is considering his appeal options, he has so far showed no indication of jumping ship, with One Nation having no winnable spots on its ticket while Malcolm Roberts remains a frontrunner and the United Australia party failing in its bid to win either a house or Senate seat at the last election. Some allies believe Rennick, if unsuccessful in his appeal, may decide to run as an independent in the next election, which would put him in competition not only against Fraser, but also One Nation\u2019s Roberts. While the number three spot on a party ticket is not guaranteed, it is considered a strong chance, although at this point in the electoral cycle, the LNP remains unconvinced it would win three Senate quotas in a normal general election, with the Greens having continued to grow its vote in Queensland, along with Labor."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b16", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jul/14/australia-news-live-reserve-bank-rba-governor-philip-lowe-peter-dutton-indigenous-voice-cost-of-living-interest-rates", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nationals accuse Labor of \u2018hypocrisy\u2019 over response to scathing APVMA report \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed", "author": "Cait Kelly (now) and Rafqa Touma (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 09:05:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097163", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/89e2f848d02c97739afc0b5e267cfc82c5b3afc6/0_418_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "And with that, we are going to put the blog to bed - thank you for spending part of your day with us.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) published the draft guidance on Friday after its recent greenwashing internet sweep identified concerning practices ranging from overstating climate action to companies developing their own certification schemes. ASX enjoys best week since November on back of cooling US inflation The local share market has enjoyed its best week since November after cooling US inflation increased expectations of an end to domestic interest rate hikes, AAP reports. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index finished Friday up 56.2 points, or 0.78 per cent, to 7,303.1 \u2013 a gain of 3.7% for the week. The broader All Ordinaries rose 61.7 points, or 0.8%, to 7,517.1. A weaker-than-expected inflation print out of the US filled the sails of local traders, who hope the rapid deceleration in inflation will soon be blown on to Australian shores. The producer price index released overnight showed price pressures decelerating, with wholesale prices increasing just 0.1% for the month of June. Local markets have priced down the possibility of an August rate rise considerably, but JP Morgan Australia chief economist Ben Jarman believes the Reserve Bank will raise the rate once more before calling it quits.

Wong calls for details of China-Solomon Islands policing deal The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has raised a policing deal signed between Beijing and Solomon Islands in a meeting with China\u2019s top diplomat. Australia, along with the US and New Zealand, has called for the details of a security deal between China and the Pacific Island nation to be released. Senator Wong spoke with China\u2019s top-ranking diplomat Wang Yi while in Jakarta for the Asean foreign ministers\u2019 meeting. The foreign minister confirmed she asked about the policing deal during the talks, which followed their meeting in Beijing in late-2022. \u201cWe take the view, along with all other members of the Pacific Island Forum \u2026 that security is best provided for within the Pacific family,\u201d Senator Wong told reporters. \u201cWe urge there to be transparency about the nature of the agreement, we understand that countries made their sovereign decisions. \u201cThe security of the Pacific is something we all have an interest in.\u201d Solomon Islands government has rejected suggestions its policing deal could jeopardise peace in the Pacific region. In a statement on Friday, the office of prime minister Manasseh Sogavare said Chinese police will add to the existing support provided by Australia and New Zealand. \u201cNo one has a monopoly of knowledge,\u201d the statement said. Senate could compel consultancy fims to give evidence A senate inquiry examining the conduct of government consultants could compel firms that have so far declined to give evidence in person to appear at hearings. The inquiry, triggered by the scandal engulfing PwC, is investigating whether government information was also misused by other big consultancy firms. Consultancy giants EY and Deloitte will appear before the inquiry early next week, days after disclosing conflicts of interest and misconduct breaches. Boston Consulting Group was invited to appear before senators but \u201crespectfully declined\u201d, telling senators that it would instead provide written submissions. McKinsey has also declined to appear. Senators can compel the people to appear before hearings and will consider doing so on Monday. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock has criticised some firms for declining to provide answers to questions: Declining to appear for no good reason and failing to answer questions on notice are a good indication that these firms regard themselves as immune to the scrutiny and accountability that the people of Australia expect from those who draw so heavily on the public purse. Sydney WorldPride drew $235m in visitor spending, analysis finds The glitter has settled, the rainbow floats are parked and the results from Sydney\u2019s WorldPride LGBTQ+ extravaganza are in, AAP reports. Nearly 70,000 tourists from 71 countries descended on Australia\u2019s harbour city for the 17-day festival in February and March, surpassing all expectations and marking Sydney\u2019s biggest event since the 2000 Olympics. Among them were 21,000 international visitors, mainly from the US, the UK, Germany, New Zealand and Canada, spending an average of $497 each night. The results are part of a Deloitte Access Economics analysis released by WorldPride organisers. It shows the parties, performances, talks and events across 17 days in February and March drew in an audience of 1.08 million people and drew $235m in visitor expenditure to the state. Organisers initially forecast the festival would inject $100m into the NSW visitor economy. The tourism minister, John Graham, said the high expectations for the event were \u201coutperformed and well exceeded\u201d. Sydney WorldPride and similar events lead to real change in community attitudes, policies and laws, WorldPride chair Damien Hodgkinson said. Nationals accuse Labor of \u2018breathtaking hypocrisy\u2019 over APVMA report The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has criticised Labor for its response to the scathing APVMA report, accusing the government of \u201cbreathtaking hypocrisy\u201d. The report into the governance of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, released today, found \u201cserious and systemic issues\u201d within the organisation. Agriculture minister Murray Watt said the independent report, from law firm Clayton Utz, uncovered \u201cserious allegations of poor governance, poor workplace culture and poor leadership that are clearly left the APVMA at risk of not meeting those integrity standards\u201d. Littleproud, the shadow agriculture minister, claimed Labor had not supported a Coalition push for a governance board for the APVMA between 2019 and 21. \u201cLabor is now complaining about a lack of governance into the APVMA from 2019 to 2022, despite originally being opposed to a board that would have provided governance to the APVMA,\u201d he said. Littleproud noted that the report found systemic issues between 2019 and 22, \u201cwhich was the time the former Coalition Government was trying to make improvements\u201d. An APVMA spokesperson directed questions about the review to the minister. \u201cThe APVMA Board and interim Executive accept the findings of the Final Strategic Review Report and Ministerial Direction and have undertaken to continue to work diligently towards addressing the findings of the review and act in accordance with the directive immediately,\u201d they said. Colonial super agrees to $100m class action settlement A $100m settlement has been reached on behalf of Colonial First State superannuation fund members who were allegedly charged excessive fees, with thousands eligible for reimbursements, AAP reports. The class action alleged the super trustee, owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, charged excessive fees as part of arrangements to pay ongoing commissions to financial advisers who did not provide continuing services to customers in return. The settlement, brought by law firm Slater and Gordon and subject to court approval, relates to fees charged to members of the Colonial First State FirstChoice Superannuation Trust between July 2013 and June 2020. The class action alleged Colonial continued to charge thousands of existing members high fees under the commission arrangements despite legislation banning the charging of commissions on new super accounts from 2013. It was alleged that Colonial had the power at the time to reduce the fees or transfer existing members to identical products with lower fees and where commissions were not paid, but this did not happen until 2019 and 2020. Former customer and lead applicant Marcel Krieger joined Colonial\u2019s FirstChoice Personal Super after a bank financial adviser recommended the product during a branch visit to the Commonwealth Bank in 2010. Vales Point seeks four-year extension to ageing coal-fired power plant One of Australia\u2019s oldest and dirtiest power stations reckons it can extend its life by another four years. Vales Point, near Newcastle in New South Wales, had been slated to shut in 2029 but its new owners - Sev.en Global Investments - say they have advised the market operator (AEMO) they plan to keep the clunker going until 2033. Built in 1978, the 1320 megawatt plant supplies about a 10th of New South Wales\u2019 electricity. It was formerly government-owned and sold in 2015 to Delta Energy for a $1m, and then on sold last year to Czech billionaire Pavel Tyka\u010d, \u201cAs the 2029 date draws closer, Delta has been able to estimate plant technical capabilities with a greater level of accuracy,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe Vales Point Power Station continues to be a key asset in the transitioning energy market by providing essential firming capacity to support the growing integration of renewable energy and ensuring a reliable and secure source of electricity.\u201d Of course, coal plants can\u2019t ramp up or down very fast at all so there is no real firming capacity as such. Still, with the speculation swirling about the future of the less-clunky 2880MW Eraring power station nearby, Vales Point\u2019s likely extension is notable. Origin Energy has today dismissed a report that the NSW government was ready to intervene to keep Eraring going beyond August 2025 in the Daily Telegraph as a \u201cwhole lot of nothing\u201d. That 2025 date is the earliest possible closure date for Australia\u2019s biggest power station and it doesn\u2019t mean all of the plant would shut at the time. Watch out for more on this issue tomorrow. South Australia\u2019s acting chief public health officer Chris Lease on the state\u2019s vaping blitz: Our vaping blitz has already targeted a range of businesses through the week and found that a third have not been complying. We are urging businesses to comply with new licence holder changes as we will be inspecting them throughout the eight weeks and the appropriate action will be taken. Businesses have been put on notice that it is illegal to sell any nicotine vaping products in South Australia unless you are the holder of a licence under the Controlled Substances Act (such as a pharmacy) and the purchaser is in possession of a valid prescription. Vapes seized as South Australia cracks down on \u2018scourge\u2019 Earlier today we reported that 1200 vapes, believed to contain nicotine, had been seized in South Australia. I\u2019ve got some more information for you from SA Health about the state\u2019s blitz against vapes. As part of the eight-week crackdown SA Health compliance officers are inspecting businesses that sell vapes, including convenience stores, service stations, gifts and accessories stores, and supermarkets to check that licence holders are meeting the new conditions. SA Health: In the first four days of the eight-week operation, 1200 vapes suspected of containing nicotine have been taken off shop shelves by SA Health officials, worth a total estimated street value of $36,000. So far this week, 18 inspections have been held across metropolitan Adelaide. About a third of businesses inspected have been found to be stocking vape products listed on the TGA website as containing nicotine. All seized property will be laboratory tested over coming weeks to confirm the presence of nicotine. Once results are verified, SA Health will consider enforcement action, including issuing cautions or expiations and commencing legal proceedings or the cancellation of business licences. The eight-week enforcement blitz began on Monday, coinciding with tough new licence conditions imposed by the Malinauskas Labor government to crack down on the vaping scourge. Flu deaths prompt alarm over low vaccination rates in Queensland Everything is on the table \u2013 including free jabs for all \u2013 as health authorities figure out how to get more Queenslanders immunised against the flu. Health minister, Shannon Fentiman, says providing jabs free of charge again is a possibility amid rising influenza cases and vaccination fatigue following the COVID-19 pandemic. Influenza B has become the state\u2019s dominant strain this winter and is a particular danger to children, fuelling concerns about the low rate of vaccinations among under-fives. Fentiman\u2019s meeting to address the issue this week with chief health officer John Gerrard followed the flu-related deaths of an 11-year-old girl on the Sunshine Coast and a year-nine student on the NSW Central Coast. \u201cI have requested the chief health officer and the department to put together all options about how we can get the message out there to families that they need to get the flu vaccine,\u201d Fentiman told reporters on Friday. \u201cReally, the message is not getting through and there is a level of vaccine fatigue. So we\u2019re going to redouble our efforts.\u201d - AAP What are your questions on the proposed voice to parliament?

Campaign urges government to address shortfall in social housing National housing campaign Everybody\u2019s Home warns the rental crisis will continue unless there\u2019s a significant increase in social housing, as new figures show persistently slow growth. Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows between 2006 and 2022, social housing stock grew by just 36,200 dwellings. That\u2019s about 2,260 homes each year. The figures over the same period show just how much federal governments have walked away from providing homes, with Australia losing 43,800 public dwellings. Everybody\u2019s Home spokesperson Maiy Azize said: Every year, we are getting further behind on social housing. With sky-high need and long waiting lists, it\u2019s not hard to see how we ended up in this housing crisis. Our social housing shortfall is massive. Australia needs 640,000 homes for people experiencing homelessness and extreme housing stress. But these numbers show that the shortfall is getting worse, not better. With so many people in extreme housing stress, competition for rentals is fierce. We need the federal government to step up and make a plan to end the social housing shortfall. We are calling on the federal government to build at least 25,000 social homes each year to end the shortfall and tackle rental stress. Almost 80 people to be rehoused in Rochester nine months after floods Almost 80 flood-affected Victorians will be rehoused before an emergency accommodation centre closes to make way for an agricultural event. The Elmore accommodation site has housed more than 300 people from towns such as Rochester and Echuca since record floods surged through northern Victoria in October 2022. The Victorian government and Emergency Recovery Victoria are delivering short-term modular housing at the local caravan park in Rochester to house people still unable to return, nine months after their homes were damaged or destroyed. The acting emergency services minister, Anthony Carbines, said the caravan park location would be convenient for locals as they rebuilt their homes. \u201cWe know how important it is for people to stay connected to their community when recovering from disaster \u2013 so people can keep close to loved ones, keep going to work and school, and stay connected as one,\u201d Carbines said in a statement. Fewer than 80 people remain in accommodation at the temporary housing site in Elmore, which is required for the Elmore Field Days agricultural event in October. Opposition criticises Labor over new NSW transport department boss A former Labor staffer will head up Australia\u2019s busiest transport network, prompting accusations it\u2019s a case of \u201cjobs for the boys\u201d, AAP reports. The Laing O\u2019Rourke executive Josh Murray will take the wheel of the NSW transport department as the Minns government promises radical improvements to tollways, bus services and train maintenance. His 15 years of experience at the global construction and engineering firm meant he had the right skills and experience to lead a 28,000-strong organisation heavily reliant on frontline workers, the transport minister, Jo Haylen, said. The new secretary was chosen after market testing and a recruitment process by the head of the premier\u2019s department. But the opposition dubbed the appointment an \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented case of \u2018jobs for the boys\u2019.\u201d \u201cMr Murray\u2019s only qualification for the role is that he is an ex-Labor staffer,\u201d the opposition transport spokeswoman, Natalie Ward, said today. South Australian authorities seize 1,200 vapes suspected of containing nicotine More than a thousand vapes have been seized for testing in a crackdown across Adelaide targeting illegal nicotine sales, AAP reports. In the first four days of the eight-week operation, 1,200 vapes with an estimated value of $36,000 and suspected of containing nicotine were taken off shop shelves. All seized products will be laboratory tested which could lead to legal action or the cancellation of business licences. The health minister, Chris Picton, said it was concerning young people could pick up vapes so easily not knowing they contained highly addictive nicotine. \u201cThe rates at which young people are becoming hooked on vapes is alarming and we must act now to turn this around,\u201d he said on Friday. SA this week introduced new conditions requiring retailers to provide proof vaping products being sold are nicotine-free. Retailers also need to provide information about their e-cigarette suppliers, importers or manufacturers to allow products to be traced. The new conditions are an interim measure, while the federal government works through plans to stop the importation of non-prescription e-cigarettes along with the banning of vapes in retail settings and the sale of single-use vapes. Albanese government advertises jobs for new in-house consultancy after PwC controversy Friday is usually taking out the trash day \u2013 a euphemism to describe politicians announcing or releasing information they aren\u2019t too keen on getting a lot of attention when people\u2019s attention is elsewhere \u2013 usually on the weekend, or in some cases, the announcement of a new RBA governor. This isn\u2019t quite trash \u2013 but still interesting \u2013 it seems the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet have quietly released the job applications for the new in-house consultancy it is establishing with the Australian public service. Australian Government Consulting is to do just that \u2013 build up in-house capacity for the APS to consult, without having to go to private consultants. It was one of the things Anthony Albanese said he was going to prioritise upon winning government. Once the PwC controversy hit, it became obvious why the government was focused on rebuilding internal capacity within the APS. The last budget included $11m over the next two years to establish the in-house consultancy and now we can see why \u2013 seven jobs have been loaded onto the PMC vacancies portal that we can see \u2013 with pay from the low six figures. \u2018Huge impact on people at the bottom\u2019: ACTU urges RBA caution on rates McManus agrees the new RBA governor will have difficult decisions in the months ahead: The trade union movement think that the Reserve Bank has already gone too far in putting up interest rates and they should have paused those several rate rises ago. We say that because we can see the huge impact on people at the bottom, working families, and they\u2019ve been crushed by either their own interest rate rises or by their landlords passing those on and we can see what\u2019s happening there. So whenever your own domestic economy suffers, the whole economy suffers when working people are under stress. We are the economy. So we would like that to continue to pause and to see what\u2019s happening in terms of the dropping of inflation around the world. \u2018They have punished working families\u2019: ACTU urges RBA to focus on wages The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, is on the ABC, talking about what changes she would like to see at the RBA: I\u2019d like to see first of all them recognise that wages in Australia are not going to magically just go up. You can see what\u2019s happening now in the United States. There\u2019s been a big drop in inflation and their wage rises have been way higher than ours. And so I think that they have punished working families for a problem that they did not cause, and making workers poorer actually doesn\u2019t help the economy. So I would like them to update their understanding about how wages work because that\u2019s a key part of their overall thinking in terms of their decisions. PM urges Greens to back housing fund Anthony Albanese is in Jordan Springs, in Sydney\u2019s west, to talk about housing. The PM urges the Greens to back the Housing Australia Future Fund: All we need for someone to be able to be sitting in a new home that is for them, to make a difference to their lives and their children\u2019s lives, is for the Greens party to get up off their seats and go sit on the right side of the chamber. \u2018We understand there are some people who are doing it really tough,\u2019 PM says The PM is talking about the global economic outlook, and how Australia, despite the challenges is in a good position. We understand there are some people who are doing it really tough. We will do our best each and every day to make a difference to their lives. The PM has been asked about the Fadden byelection. Albanese starts by talking about how governments usually see swings away from them during byelections: Fadden and the northern part of the Gold Coast have only ever returned LNP members. They\u2019ve never returned Labor members federally. But our confidence is, we have a great candidate, I was out there happy to launch our campaign. The Labor party are running so people have that choice, but I don\u2019t expect anything like the Aston byelection result. That was an extraordinary result. But I don\u2019t expect anything will change for the Coalition. PM focused on cost-of-living relief while not putting pressure on inflation The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and housing minister, Julie Collins, are speaking to reporters in NSW. Albanese says the government is focusing on relieving the cost of living while not putting pressure on inflation: What we are doing is putting in place positive plans that make a difference for people on childcare, housing, healthcare costs, education, including the provision of Tafe, while managing the economy so we take that pressure off inflation. Highly sensitive Victorian government data has been published to the dark web but authorities are still working out the extent of the compromise, AAP has reported. The information, which was stolen during a cyber-attack on a top law firm, has been leaked to the dark web. The data was taken during the HWL Ebsworth hack earlier this year. A spokesperson for the Victorian government said it was aware a number of files had been released and was still in the process of working out the extent of the compromise. \u201cWe have been advised by HWL Ebsworth that information affected includes highly sensitive documents from legal files with state government departments and agencies,\u201d they said on Friday. \u201cWe know this could be a distressing situation for the people affected and we are working to notify all those affected as soon as possible.\u201d The law firm has clients at government level in every state and territory. Australia\u2019s top cybersecurity coordinator, Air Marshal Darren Goldie, previously said several government entities had been impacted. In June, hackers from Russia claimed to have published data stolen during the attack. ACTU calls on new RBA governor to halt interest rate hikes Hello everyone, this Cait Kelly. What a busy morning! I will be with you for the rest of the day \u2013 so let\u2019s get into it. First up, I\u2019ve got a statement from the Australian Council of Trade Unions for you. The council has welcomed Michele Bullock as the new RBA governor and called on her to stop the interest rate hikes. ACTU secretary Sally McManus said in a statement: We welcome the changing of the guard of the Reserve Bank. New leadership needs to consider the realities of the Australian economy with fresh eyes. It is time to stop fighting mythical wage price spirals and to recognise we have a very different wages system to the 1970s. Working people have been punished for an inflation problem they did not cause and this has put severe pressure on working families. We hope the new governor will consult directly with the people who understand these issues. In the last 14 months we\u2019ve seen 12 interest rate rises, that can\u2019t go on. Workers have been feeling the brunt of inflation rate rises and we call on the Michele Bullock to take a different approach than her predecessor. We also reiterate our call that the RBA fulfill its commitment to full employment. Handing over now to Cait Kelly, who will take you through the afternoon\u2019s news. Thank you for joining me on the blog this busy morning \u2013 I\u2019ll see you next week. Shadow treasurer thanks Lowe, welcomes Bullock into RBA governor role Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor has thanked Philip Lowe for his service as Reserve Bank governor, and congratulated Michele Bullock on her appointment. Dr Lowe has been an independent, distinguished, and dedicated governor who has helped to steer Australia through some of our biggest economic challenges. Michele Bullock is a highly capable economist, with qualifications from the London School of Economics and University of New England, who has served the Reserve Bank with distinction for 38 years. Taylor says it is essential Australians have confidence in the RBA, amid feeling the impact of high inflation: With inflation at its highest level in three decades, it is essential Australians can have confidence in this crucial economic institution and that we continue to have a credible and capable Reserve Bank. Families are feeling the impacts of higher prices and rising interest rates every day. Along with strong economic management, a strong Reserve Bank is essential to addressing the inflation that is driving higher prices. A temporary halt to clearing at Lee Point in Darwin has been extended while the environment minister Tanya Plibersek considers an application by Larrakia traditional owners to protect the site from a proposed defence housing development. Defence Housing Australia has agreed to pause planned clearing of woodlands until 11 August. It follows a community campaign in Darwin to protect the area which is home to species including the Gouldian finch and black-footed tree rat and to coastal reserve that acts as a corridor to other woodland areas. Lawyers at Environmental Justice Australia, acting for Larrakia traditional owners, have applied to Plibersek for a declaration to protect a significant Aboriginal area under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. Under the act, the government can make a declaration to protect traditional areas and objects of significance to First Nations peoples. Larrakia traditional custodian Lorraine Williams said Larrakia people had not been properly consulted about the housing development and wanted the minister to meet with them in Darwin: Please minister Plibersek, come and speak to Larrakia people on the ground before any further works take place. We would like to talk to you about the importance of the area, the plants and the animals here, not just for Aboriginal people, but for all Territorians. No one wants to see this place destroyed. You can read more about the story here: ABC asks court to discharge orders over revealing confidential source The ABC has asked a court to discharge orders that the broadcaster revealed a confidential source for an investigative story about the alleged actions in Afghanistan in 2012 of the November platoon. Former commando Heston Russell is suing the ABC for defamation over the story. The ABC dropped its public interest defence in the case at the 11th hour on Wednesday after a federal court order. On Friday morning Justice Michael Lee was hearing a submission from Russell\u2019s lawyers that the source should still be revealed because it is relevant to damages. The ABC\u2019s barrister said: My clients are faced with the choice between prosecuting a public interest defense under Section 29A, and adhering to its promise to a source not to disclose his name has chosen to withdraw the public interest defense. The court has adjourned until 12.15pm. Review into Eraring coal power station handed down by August The New South Wales government says no decisions about the future of the Eraring coal-fired power station have been made following media reports it would remain open past 2025. A spokesperson said a review into the state\u2019s energy outlook was underway and all decisions would be made after it was handed to the government next month. The spokesperson said: A health check is underway regarding the NSW energy outlook. It\u2019s being conducted at arms-length from the NSW government. Its report is due to be handed to the government in August and the government will consider its response in due course. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has repeatedly said all options were on the table relating to the plant owned by Origin Energy. It is due to be turned off in 2025. The Clayton Utz review of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority uncovered serious allegations of poor governance, poor workplace culture and poor leadership. Agriculture minister Murray Watt adds: Concerningly the review also includes allegations of industry capture of the APVMA. It appears to have played a key role in the APVMA not performing its full regulatory responsibilities. Watt says the authority is left at risk of not meeting integrity standards. He says the findings join a \u201clong line of examples of incompetence\u201d under the former government: Unfortunately this saga is just another in what has become a long line of examples of incompetence and maladministration under the former Coalition government. This happened on their watch but I\u2019m determined to clean up their mess. By taking the firm action I have outlined today we will ensure the integrity of Australia\u2019s outback chemical regulation and we will maintain competence in our world leading food and fibre industries. Agriculture minister Murray Watt also confirmed the CEO and board chair of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority have resigned. Finally I would also like to advise that in recent days, both APVMA CEO and board chair have tended the resignations from the respective roles. A nationwide search is conducted for their long-term replacements. Long delays in chemical review program The review of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority also highlighted long delays in its chemical review program, agriculture minister Murray Watt says. He says: In some cases these reviews have been going on for over 20 years. He has issued APVMA with a ministerial directive to finalise outstanding reviews for eight chemicals currently in use. Those reviews have been underway for more than 17 years each. This is the first time ever that this type of ministerial direction has been given to the APVMA. Agriculture minister says findings from chemicals regulator require \u2018serious, firm action\u2019 Agriculture minister Murray Watt says findings from the review of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority require \u201cserious, firm action\u201d. Watt says: Our first course of action will be a rapid evaluation of the APVMA\u2019s structure and governance. The evaluation will be conducted by Ken Matthews, former public servant. The report will be submitted to Watt by 30 September. It will include recommendations on the future governance, structure and funding arrangements of the APVMA. A review of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has found the organisation has \u201can unacceptable volume of personnel-related complaints\u201d with a formal complaint recorded every four to six weeks for the past five years. It also found the APVMA had focused on targets around the timeframes for registering agvet chemicals at the expense of undertaking monitoring and compliance activities, that it had taken an \u201ceducational approach\u201d to enforcing regulations rather than applying stronger penalties, and that its approach to regulation \u201cappears to align with industry interests\u201d. The desktop review by law firm Clayton Utz was released this morning by agriculture minister Murray Watt, who commissioned it to look into broader compliance issues at the regulator. It follows allegations at senate estimates that a senior member of staff at the APVMA had urinated on other staff members at a Christmas function in Armidale in 2021. A separate report into that incident was completed in February 2023 and the matter was referred to the Australian federal police. It found that the agency, which employed 129 people as of 30 June 2022, had recorded 56 personnel-related complaints between 2018 and 2023, of which 21 were allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The report said: There were clearly cultural issues with the organisation given that on average there was a formal complaint about once every 4-6 weeks for 5 years. It added that while \u201csome of the complaints were very serious\u201d there appeared to have been \u201clittle if any reporting of these matters to the Board\u201d. There was no reporting that we could find of any kind of these matters to either the department or the minister meaning that matters were not escalated and relevant action could not be taken. Yes/No cases to be published on AEC site The AEC has announced that the Yes and No cases for the Indigenous voice to parliament will be published on its website on Tuesday. Each committee has until 11.59pm on Monday and whatever the AEC has received will be published. Which makes it sound like a bad group assignment where you don\u2019t know what is going to be actually handed in, but we are sure it is a lot more professional than that. The committees are made up of MPs who voted yes and no on the referendum legislation which was passed by the parliament in the last sitting and are bipartisan. Electoral commissioner Tom Rogers says: Each case will be published in separate, unedited, and unformatted documents, exactly as they have been received by the deadline. The deadline for case committees to submit each case is 11:59pm on Monday. Whatever we have received will be published the very next day, in order to provide visibility to voters. Our role here is as a post-box only and this impending raw publication of each authorised case is the first aspect of our independent delivery role. We\u2019ll then get to work to complete the Yes/No case pamphlet for printing and create a range of translated and accessible versions. These will also be on the AEC website as they become available. Which is very polite speak for THIS IS NOT THE AEC\u2019S OR BELIEFS \u2013 it is only the messenger. China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi said China and Australia\u2019s relations have \u201cstabilised, improved and developed\u201d under the joint efforts of both countries, Reuters reports. In a Chinese foreign ministry statement, Wang also said he hoped Australia will provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and operate in the country. Both sides should respect each other, treat each other as equals, properly handle differences, and cultivate a friendly atmosphere of mutual understanding and appreciation, he said. \u2018Vindication for the Greens\u2019: Greens senator on Lowe\u2019s term not being extended Greens senator Nick McKim says Michele Bullock\u2019s appointment as Reserve Bank governor is \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d. Replacing one RBA insider with another is business-as-usual, and a clear signal that renters and mortgage holders will keep getting smashed to solve a problem they didn\u2019t cause. Labor needs to tax corporate super profits and wealth. That would be anti-inflationary and reduce the pressure on the RBA to use the only tool it has. McKim says Philip Lowe\u2019s term as governor not being extended is \u201cvindication for the Greens\u201d: The decision to sack Dr Lowe is vindication for the Greens who have been calling for him to go for some time. Dr Lowe made a series of mistakes and poor calls that resulted in renters and mortgage holders getting smashed for inflation they didn\u2019t cause. But corporate Australia will be heaving a giant sigh of relief today. It\u2019s clear that interest rate rises will continue to be used as a tool to increase unemployment and suppress wages, and that monetary policy will not be used to address inequality or climate breakdown. If you missed it, here is prime minister Anthony Albanese announcing Michele Bullock as the new Reserve Bank governor, and treasurer Jim Chalmers thanking outgoing governor Philip Lowe for his service: Bullock acknowledges challenging timing entering RBA governor role Deputy governor Michele Bullock says: I am deeply honoured to have been appointed to this important position. It is a challenging time to be coming into this role, but I will be supported by a strong executive team and boards. I am committed to ensuring that the Reserve Bank delivers on its policy and operational objectives for the benefit of the Australian people. In a statement, The Reserve Bank of Australia have outlined the responsibilities Bullock will inherit when she becomes governor, including management of the bank, and being chair of the Reserve Bank Board, the Payments System Board and the Council of Financial Regulators. \u2018First-rate appointment\u2019: Lowe congratulates Bullock Governor Philip Lowe says Michele Bullock is a \u201cfirst-rate appointment\u201d to take over his role from mid-September: The treasurer has made a first-rate appointment. I congratulate Michele on being appointed governor. The Reserve Bank is in very good hands as it deals with the current inflation challenge and implementing the recommendations of the review of the RBA. I wish Michele all the best. Bullock to implement RBA review recommendations Treasurer Jim Chalmers says part of Michele Bullock\u2019s role will be implementing recommendations of the Reserve Bank review \u2013 which said the organisation needs a shake-up. [Michele] has made clear \u2026 how we can implement in the best possible way the recommendations of the Reserve Bank review. We\u2019ve had a number of conversations about that and I know that Michele Bullock is committed to the RBA review process, as am I, as you know. There is a lot of work to do to agree to the new statement of conduct this year, and to introduce the legislation this year ideally as well. The fact that Michele Bullock brings that experience and expertise, but also that heft and gravitas, will be a really important asset when it comes to the relationship with the RBA board and when it comes to implementing \u2026 the review. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says Peter Dutton\u2019s negativity \u201cis bordering on the pathological,\u201d following the opposition leader saying he would not support a move to appoint the next governor from the ranks of the public service yesterday. At today\u2019s press conference, Chalmers says: I wasn\u2019t obligated to consult the Opposition on this appointment, but I did it anyway. I thought it was important that I do that and I thank Angus Taylor for making the time on a couple of occasions, including this week, to talk about this appointment. When it comes to Peter Dutton, [he] is so relentlessly negative that he is even now bagging things that aren\u2019t happening. This is bordering on the pathological when it comes to his negativity, and to describe people of the calibre of Steven Kennedy and Jenny Wilkinson, who have advised both sides of politics in a frank and fearless and impeccable way \u2026 it is not those two who are tainted. Chalmers says having Wilkinson, Kennedy and Bullock in three key positions \u201cis the best of all worlds\u201d. We get Michele Bullock at the Reserve Bank, and we get Steven Kennedy at the Treasury, and we get Jenny Wilkinson at Finance. I couldn\u2019t have more respect for Kennedy and Wilkinson and Bullock. Michele Bullock rundown So who is Michele Bullock? Peter Hannam, our economics editor, will fill you in more fully very soon. But in the mean time, here is your quick cheat sheet. Bullock went to the University of New England where she received her bachelor of economics (honours) in 1984 and then graduated from the London School of Economics with her masters in 1998. From there, Bullock worked at the RBA in a bunch of different positions before becoming the chief manager of the payments policy department in 1998. She was in that role until 2007 before she was promoted to the department\u2019s chief manager. From there, Bullock climbed the ladder to deputy governor, which she was appointed to in April 2022 after Guy Debelle\u2019s shock resignation. From 18 September 2023, Bullock will be the governor. Bullock will be the 9th Governor of the RBA and the gig lasts for seven years, with an option to be extended. Five of the eight governors have served one term \u2013 recent governors have seen their terms extended, but it is not the rule. Chalmers says it\u2019s \u2018not unusual\u2019 to forgo extending tenure of RBA governor Treasurer Jim Chalmers says it is \u201cnot particularly unusual\u201d to not extend the tenure of the Reserve Bank governor at the end of their term. We considered Philip Lowe on a shortlist of appointable candidates. This idea that I think backbench members of the Opposition put around, that this is unusual not to extend him, I mean, is frankly not right. Typically Reserve Bank governors haven\u2019t been extended. The last couple have, but there has been eight, and five of them haven\u2019t been extended, so \u2026 it is not particularly unusual. I think once we realised we had the right candidate, there is no point extending governor Lowe if you have the right candidate ready to go. So we\u2019re appointing Michele Bullock from 18 September, and Philip Lowe goes with our thanks, gratitude and dignity. \u2018It is an absolute honour\u2019: New RBA governor thanks government Prime minister Anthony Albanese and treasurer Jim Chalmers are now meeting with Michele Bullock, the incoming Reserve Bank governor. Bullock says: Thank you very much. It is an absolute honour and I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019ve got such great support from the government. I think a big part of my role is going to be \u2026 leading the bank through change, which is a very important part of the next days also. Most of Chalmer\u2019s appointments are women As both Jim Chalmers and Anthony Albanese have mentioned, Michele Bullock is the first woman to hold the RBA governor role. That continues a trend in Treasury appointments since Chalmers took over as treasurer \u2013 most of his appointments in his first six months in the job have been women. That includes Catriona Lowe as deputy chair of the ACCC and Elana Rubin to the RBA board. Chalmers\u2019 chief of staff Claudia Crawford is the first woman to lead a treasurer\u2019s office in about fifty years. Katy Gallagher celebrates first female RBA governor Responses to the new Reserve Bank governor appointment are rolling in. Finance minister Katy Gallagher says: This is a historic moment for Australia with Michele\u2019s appointment seeing our RBA led by a woman for the first time! And former RBA board member Warwick McKibbin says Bullock is \u201ca great appointment\u201d and that it is \u201crare to have three outstanding options to choose from\u201d. Albanese shares other potentials for governor role You may have heard Anthony Albanese just mention some of the other potential names which were in the mix for the governor job \u2013 he was speaking in the context of Peter Dutton\u2019s attacks that the appointment needed to be \u201cindependent\u201d and not a departmental official. That attack was ridiculous for a number of reasons \u2013 departmental officials are meant to be independent from government anyway and the people mentioned, treasury head Steven Kennedy and deputy treasury secretary Jenny Wilkinson were both appointed by the former Coalition government. Wilkinson was floated as one of the front runners, but there was always the question of whether or not the government would want to lose one of the best macroeconomic minds in the country to the RBA. Wilkinson\u2019s expertise, as well as Kennedy\u2019s guidance of the treasury, obviously proved pretty valuable to Chalmers. Michele Bullock knows the RBA and is also across the review which she will now be implementing, so it seems like it was a fairly obvious choice for Chalmers. Bullock the best choice for RBA governor, Chalmers says Treasurer Jim Chalmers is glad to \u201cend the speculation\u201d about who would replace Philip Lowe as governor of the Reserve Bank. Obviously, an appointment of this magnitude, there is lots of speculation and I think it is a good thing today that we can end the speculation about the next governor of the Reserve Bank. Chalmers says that, although the decision was not made until Cabinet discussion today, he has believed Michele Bullock is the best choice for RBA governor \u201cfor a while now\u201d: The decision was not taken until it was taken by the Cabinet collectively today, and that\u2019s important, but it has been my view for a while now that Michele Bullock is the best person to take the bank into the future. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says Philip Lowe is a \u201cterrific guy\u201d as he thanks the outgoing governor for his commitment to the RBA and \u201cour country as well\u201d: We thank Phil Lowe for more than four decades of dedication and commitment and service, not just to the Reserve Bank and not just to the economy, but to our country as well. Phil Lowe goes with our respect, he goes with our gratitude, and he goes with dignity, and I want to make that clear. On a personal level, I have really valued my working relationship with Phil. I have known Phil for a long time. He is, on a personal level, a terrific guy, and he has handled himself impeccably, as we\u2019ve gone through this process. RBA governor one of the most important appointments, Chalmers says Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the appointment of Michele Bullock as the ninth Reserve Bank governor is \u201cnot an easy call\u201d. Chalmers says: This is the right call, but it\u2019s not an easy call. This comes after months of deliberation and consultation, and we have come at this in the most methodical and considered way that we could.\u201d This is one of the most important appointments that we will make as a government. Just a couple of examples of Michele Bullock\u2019s communication style \u2013 here is the incoming governor speaking on mortgage rates in July 2022: And here is how she saw the economy in September 2021 and what she saw the risks as: RBA\u2019s direction under Bullock expected not to change much The new governor of the RBA, Michele Bullock replaced the man who was widely tipped as the next governor \u2013 Guy Debelle as deputy governor of the RBA. Don\u2019t expect too much change in the RBA\u2019s direction under Bullock\u2019s tenure \u2013 her recent speeches have been in line with what Dr Philip Lowe has been saying. In terms of communication, Bullock is a policy head \u2013 her explanations have been bureaucrat-speak heavy, but she has also given a little more information in terms of how the decisions have been impacting those on the margins. The RBA tends to focus on the aggregate \u2013 Bullock has made mention of those outside the aggregate in some of her recent speeches. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how that continues in her role as governor. \u2018Outstanding economist and leader\u2019: PM announces new RBA governor Prime minister Anthony Albanese calls new RBA governor Michele Bullock an \u201coutstanding economist and leader\u201d. She is an outstanding economist and leader with a deep understanding of the RBA\u2019s role and operations, built up over her long and distinguished career with the central bank. Bullock will be the first woman to lead the RBA in its 63-year history. Albanese says: Her appointment strikes the optimal balance between providing exceptional experience and expertise and offering a fresh leadership perspective. Bullock has been the RBA deputy governor since April 2022. Her appointment will take effect from 18 September. Michele Bullock will be appointed as the ninth Reserve Bank governor, prime minister Anthony Albanese and treasurer Jim Chalmers have just announced. With the RBA governor role pending, one of the more hawkish banks has modified its view on rate changes. ANZ now expects the RBA will extend its pause to August at least. Here is ANZ\u2019s announcement: While it\u2019s possible the RBA could hike in August, on balance we think an extended pause at 4.1% is most likely. This change in our view is unrelated to any decision regarding the RBA governor. Rather it reflects an assessment of the economy based on a deterioration in forward\u2011looking labour market indicators, good news on the global inflation front and increasing anecdotal evidence (including in our own spending data) that the most recent rate rises have had an impact on consumer behaviour. In ten minutes, prime minister Anthony Albanese and treasurer Jim Chalmers will hold address a press conference in Canberra. They are expected to announce the replacement for the role of RBA governor. Stay tuned. Wong pushes faster action on China\u2019s trade sanctions Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong pushed for faster action on China\u2019s crippling trade sanctions in her second round of talks with top diplomat Wang Yi, AAP reports. The foreign minister also raised her \u201cdeep concerns\u201d over Hong Kong\u2019s pursuit of overseas pro-democracy activists, including two living in Australia. Wong is in Jakarta for the Asean foreign ministers\u2019 meeting. She told reporters after the meeting: My view is we\u2019re seeing some progress on trade \u2013 we would like to see more. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and treasurer Jim Chalmers will hold a press conference at 9.40am in Canberra. We will bring you updates to the blog as they come \u2013 stay tuned. Voice would help Indigenous health and education, Burney says The Indigenous voice would help \u201cchange the frustration\u201d of Aboriginal Australians in health and education, the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said at a major community meeting in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region. She added that those issues had been \u201cghettoised\u201d into her portfolio in the past rather than dealt with more closely by responsible ministers. You get better outcomes if you listen to local people. It shouldn\u2019t all come from Canberra, but that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening, and it ain\u2019t working. Read more from Josh Butler, reporting from the Yule River bush meeting, here: National Australia Bank workers earning up to $100,000 a year will be paid an extra 17.5% over four years in a deal that also enshrines a right to work from home. The union-negotiated agreement, which will now be voted on by Nab staff, comes amid a tussle between the big banks and their employees over work arrangements, as the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions try to entice, and sometimes demand, workers return to the office. Finance Sector Union national secretary Julia Angrisano said: While some improvements have been made to address the hours of work crisis at Nab that is putting immense strain on employees\u2019 physical and emotional wellbeing, more needs to be done. Under the arrangement, Nab employees can request to work from home and appeal unreasonable refusals. A recent push by the major banks to bring workers back to the office has led to an increase in foot traffic in Sydney. Some Australian companies, including Nab, now require senior managers to work in the office while offering hybrid arrangements for other staff. Nab was contacted for comment. Bee-killing mite spreads to inland NSW The bee-killing varroa mite has been found in inland NSW \u2013 at Gumble, west of Molong \u2013 hundreds of kilometres from where it was first detected in the state, AAP reports. The deadly mite was first detected near the Port of Newcastle in June 2022. Authorities tried to halt the spread of the parasite, but more than 14,000 hives were destroyed in the first four months of the outbreak. Varroa mite has the potential to decimate the beekeeping industry and hit other pollination-dependent sectors, such as horticulture. But the Department of Primary Industries has reassured producers that its operation \u2013 resembling contact tracing for Covid-19 \u2013 is working. Deputy incident controller Shannon Mulholland said: Whilst the discovery of a new mite location is disappointing, it provides further confidence that our tracing and surveillance strategies are working. Only one mite has been discovered at Gumble and this low mite count suggests we\u2019ve detected the movement early, and the fact it was a recent legal movement gives us some confidence we can control this spread quickly. Toyota-backed rental service to offer hybrid only Toyota-backed car rental service Kinto will offer only hybrid electric versions of passenger cars and SUVs in a bid to meet customer demand for more eco-friendly solutions, AAP reports. It has revealed its fleet will feature almost 500 hybrid cars. The move comes in the same month Australia sold more than 9000 new hybrid vehicles \u2013 recording a 40% jump in sales compared to June last year. Kinto general manager Mark Ramsay said the company had seen customers increasingly choose greener cars. We started with a range of vehicles to test the market in March 2021 and we\u2019ve seen the preference for hybrid vehicles. In our most popular car, the (Toyota) Corolla, when we had petrol and hybrid models available, the hybrid was more popular and that confirmed our suspicion it was the right way to go. Kinto\u2019s hybrid transition will not extend to light commercial vehicles, such as utes and vans. The company is also not adding battery electric options yet. Cabinet meeting to decide Lowe\u2019s successor today Philip Lowe will be replaced as the Reserve Bank governor, with today\u2019s cabinet meeting to decide his successor, Guardian Australia has confirmed. Lowe\u2019s seven-year term expires on 17 September, and he was widely expected to be replaced \u2013 though the timing was unknown. Lowe said on Wednesday: If I was asked to continue in the role, I would be honoured to do that and I would continue. If I am not asked to continue in the role, I will do my best to support my successor, and the treasurer has said he will make an announcement before the end of this month. You can read the full story from Paul Karp and Peter Hannam here: Guardian Australia\u2019s chief political correspondent Paul Karp has confirmed Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe will be replaced. Lowe\u2019s exit as RBA governor won\u2019t be a big surprise Few have expected Philip Lowe would have his seven-year term as Reserve Bank governor extended when it ends in September. Speculation is in a frenzy mode that we\u2019ll have that confirmed later today by treasurer Jim Chalmers. The two previous RBA governors had three years tacked on to their terms, so Lowe\u2019s exit would be something of a rejection by the government. Lowe has, of course, overseen 12 interest rate rises in the past 14 months to try to rein- in inflation \u2013 not exactly boosting his popularity. We looked at the likely candidates to replace him in this piece: There\u2019s always been the issue of who os best qualified for the job and whether that person wants the job. One rumour had it that Carolyn Wilkins \u2013 a Canadian with central bank experience in both her own country and in the UK and a member of the RBA review panel \u2013 had been approached but turned down the offer. It\u2019s also worth remembering that the government will also soon name the members of a separate monetary policy board within the RBA to set rates. The next RBA governor in other words is likely to have a diluted role \u2013 that\u2019s worth keeping in mind. As we understand it, Chalmers will take just the one name to cabinet and he\u2019ll seek endorsement of it. That name will, it seems, be someone other than Lowe. For what it\u2019s worth, a lame duck Lowe is not expected to raise rates at the 1 August meeting. Investors now rate the odds of a 25 basis point increase to 4.35% at less than one in three, according to the ASX rates tracker. No campaign\u2019s tactics revealed The no campaign in the Indigenous voice referendum is running three different social media strategies \u2013 each one targeting different groups of Australians with apparently contradictory messages, a Guardian Australia investigation can reveal. The lobby group Advance, one of the lead organisations in the no camp, runs one Facebook page highlighting conservative criticism, another highlighting progressive complaints and a third portraying itself as a neutral news source. You can read our exclusive from Josh Butler and Nick Evershed here: Crackdown on greenwashing The consumer watchdog has published draft guidelines today warning against misleading advertising in an attempt to improve confidence in environmental standards claimed by companies, AAP reports. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission announced a crackdown in 2022 on businesses greenwashing \u2013 which involves making false claims to deceive consumers into believing a product or service is environmentally friendly. An internet sweep found 57% of businesses reviewed were making potentially misleading environmental claims. ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said businesses needed to be honest and transparent when making claims so they didn\u2019t undermine consumer confidence: Our draft guidance sets out what the ACCC considers to be good practice when businesses make environmental claims about their products and services, as well as making them aware of their obligations under the Australian Consumer Law. Businesses that are taking genuine steps to adopt sustainable practices are put at a competitive disadvantage by businesses that engage in \u201cgreenwashing\u201d without incurring the same costs. Philip Lowe will be replaced as RBA governor, ABC says The Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe will reportedly be replaced when his seven-year contract concludes in mid-September, according to the ABC. An announcement from treasurer Jim Chalmers is expected to follow today\u2019s cabinet meeting, when the topic of Lowe\u2019s replacement will be discussed. Guardian Australia has not yet been able to confirm this. We will bring you updates as they come. In the meantime, here is more on what the future may look like for the Australian economy, the RBA and Lowe, from our economics correspondent Peter Hannam: I\u2019m Rafqa Touma, taking the blog for the day. Thanks to Martin Farrer for kicking us off this morning. If you see anything you don\u2019t want us to miss, let me know on Twitter or Threads. Let\u2019s get into it. Penny Wong has met top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi for the second time in a year, at a meeting for south-east Asia\u2019s foreign ministers, AAP reports. The foreign affairs minister, who is in Jakarta for the Asean foreign ministers\u2019 meeting, said: We had a constructive discussion about the bilateral relationship and the value of ongoing dialogue. I reiterated Australia\u2019s position on a range of issues, including trade impediments, consular cases, human rights and Hong Kong. Australia will continue to work with China to grow the bilateral relationship, navigate differences and engage in the national interest. Asked before the meeting if she would raise a policing pact signed between China and Solomon Islands, she said Australia maintained the view shared by its regional neighbours that security should be provided by Pacific nations. She told the ABC\u2019s 7.30: We are continuing to call for transparency from China and Solomon Islands in relation to this agreement. I think it is of benefit for the Pacific Islands Forum to discuss it. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Solomon Islands prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, jointly announced a comprehensive strategic partnership in Beijing this week. Wong reassures Asean nations about Indo-Pacific security The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has placed Asian nations at the forefront of security in the Indo-Pacific even as Nato considers expanding its presence in the region, AAP reports. The military alliance proposed opening a liaison office in Japan\u2019s capital Tokyo, in an attempt to deepen cooperation with partners in the region. But the proposal was strongly opposed by China. Wong is in Jakarta for the Asean foreign ministers\u2019 meeting and, asked if Australia backed Nato\u2019s expansion, she said the government maintained \u201cAsean as the centre of the region\u201d. She told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 last night: Asean centrality within the Indo-Pacific is so critical to peace and prosperity and stability. We are providing support that we think is appropriate and that is needed. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. This is Martin Farrer bringing you some of the early headlines this morning but my colleague Rafqa Touma will soon be here to guide you through the day. With speculation mounting that cabinet could sign off on the appointment of a new Reserve Bank governor today, Peter Dutton has said senior public servants should not be considered for the job to avoid any connection with past governments. If Philip Lowe is to be replaced once his term expires, two of the leading candidates for the position are the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, and the finance department secretary, Jenny Wilkinson. But the opposition leader indicated he would oppose such an appointment. In the second part of his investigation into the tactics being used by the no campaign in the Indigenous voice referendum, our political reporter Josh Butler reveals today that opponents of the change are running three different social media strategies, each targeting different groups of Australians with apparently contradictory messages. The lobby group Advance, one of the lead organisations in the no camp, runs one Facebook page highlighting conservative criticism, another highlighting progressive complaints, and a third portraying itself as a neutral news source. After the death of two children from flu, people are asking why it\u2019s happening and what can be done to stop it. Our science writer Donna Lu hears that that although the influenza A and B strains circulating appear to have a greater impact on children, the key to cutting infections is to make sure more people are vaccinated. There has been a drop of 10 percentage points in young people getting flu jabs since the pandemic, doctors say.

This starts with nuts-and-bolts functionality: shoes that can get you to the day\u2019s step count without blisters, that kind of thing. But there is way more to it than that. A good outfit makes your day better in less obvious but equally powerful ways. It smooths your passage through the world. When you walk into a room, before you say a word, good clothes are a charm offensive. Take, for example, the perfect travel outfit: that it has to be comfy is non-negotiable, obviously. And it needs to be made up of layers that will flex to accommodate changes in temperature. It must be reasonably hardy against smudges and creases. And if your destination is a holiday, it needs to be made up of pieces that will make themselves useful in your holiday wardrobe. Logistical stuff, all important, which I will return to in a moment. But it is expedient for a travel outfit to look good, too. Do you remember when looking SFU \u2013 suitable for upgrade \u2013 was a thing? The idea was that if you were catching a plane then you should dress to impress the check-in desk because you might get yourself bumped up to business class. Nobody talks about SFU any more. I expect check-in software has evolved algorithms to filter and rank passengers, and the days of an upgrade being based on whether someone likes your shoes are over. Nonetheless, dressing SFU \u2013 I don\u2019t mean in a designer-luggage way, just a well-put-together look \u2013 can make your day easier every bit as much as comfortable shoes or a drawstring waist can. The upgrade analogy sounds mercenary, but the clothes you wear affect how people react to you. This is about human transactions, not financial ones. A day when you are travelling is the sort of day that the kindness or otherwise of strangers can make or break. The sort of day when you cross paths with people who make split-second decisions about, say, whether they move their stuff so you can have a nice seat on a train, or whether they tap you on the shoulder and tell you that your bag has come unzipped and your wallet is about to fall out. This isn\u2019t about dressing to impress \u2013 it\u2019s about dressing in a way that makes people minded to see you, to feel comfortable with you, to like you. That travel outfit, then. Ballet flats are a good start, fashionable again now, and with a polite, won\u2019t-recline-my-seat-fully-without-asking kind of energy. Out-of-office trousers that are relaxed but not scruffy \u2013 you are not going to whip your laptop out and start leading a meeting on Teams, but neither are you going to get drunk and try to recruit fellow passengers into a conga. A T-shirt under a shacket. A shacket is super useful on holiday. It is kind of like a denim jacket, but a bit smarter and easier to roll up and stuff into your bag if you get hot. It can be a top layer, or a bottom layer under a jumper, or worn as a shirt on its own. It makes you look more dynamic and more fun than a cardigan does. A comfortable pair of cushioned-sole ballet pumps, an elegantly tapered pair of joggers, the right weight of layers on top. This outfit is good for morale. A good look wins people over, just like a smile or saying please and thank you does. Good manners get you a long way in life. And the right outfit gives you a head start.

But, for 400 years, no one has been able to read passages on hundreds of pages of this manuscript because they had been so heavily revised and self-censored by their 17th-century author, apparently to avoid punishment for offending his patron. Now state-of-the-art imaging technology has enabled the British Library to read hidden pages of William Camden\u2019s Annals for the first time, \u201ca significant finding in early modern historical scholarship\u201d. Those pages had been either over-written or concealed beneath pieces of paper stuck down so tightly that attempting to lift them would have ripped the pages and destroyed evidence. Enhanced imaging technology, involving transmitted light, has revealed those texts, offering new insights into the queen and the political machinations of her court, to the excitement of scholars. It casts new light on significant historical episodes such as Elizabeth\u2019s excommunication by Pope Pius V and her nomination of James as her successor. Julian Harrison, the British Library\u2019s lead curator of medieval historical and literary manuscripts, told the Guardian that seeing unknown passages emerge for the first time was \u201cheart-stopping\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s really one of those moments where \u2018now you can\u2019t see anything, now you can\u2019, the absolute reversal of \u2018now you see it, now you don\u2019t\u2019. The imaging is revolutionary. We\u2019ve never done anything quite like this before. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d Written in Latin, the Annals were based on first-hand evidence such as witness reports and official parliamentary records, collected by Camden, who died in 1623. Harrison said: \u201cWe have 10 volumes of the handwritten manuscripts \u2026 [of which] literally several hundred pages \u2026 [have] passages which had been covered up.\u201d He added: \u201cModern historians have commonly relied on Camden\u2019s Annals as an impartial and supposedly accurate record. This new research reveals that key sections were revised \u2026 It implies that Camden\u2019s Annals were deliberately rewritten to present a version of Elizabeth\u2019s reign that was more favourable to her successor.\u201d He noted, for example, its claim that Elizabeth I had named James VI of Scotland as her successor on her deathbed: \u201cElizabeth never married and she died childless in 1603, to be succeeded on the English throne by Mary\u2019s son, James VI of Scotland. Analysis of the manuscript drafts shows that the deathbed scene was a fabricated addition that Camden did not intend originally to put into his history. \u201cHe presumably included it to appease James, so that his succession looked more predetermined than it had actually been. Elizabeth was too ill to speak in her final hours and no other historical evidence points to this deathbed scene being true.\u201d In 1570, Pope Pius V excommunicated Elizabeth. Harrison said Camden originally said the pope was motivated to do so by \u201cspiritual warfare\u201d, only to replace it in the published version with the statement that Pius was creating \u201csecret plots\u201d against Elizabeth: \u201cBy removing the previously inflammatory wording, Camden made the official record more neutral in tone.\u201d Historians will now want to pore over this material. \u201cThere\u2019s still more to be discovered,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be interesting is how modern interpretations of Elizabeth I, such an important historical figure, are potentially going to be changed.\u201d The researcher Helena Rutkowska has been working on the Annals as part of a collaborative doctoral award in a partnership between the University of Oxford, where she is a DPhil student, the British Library and the Open University. She spoke of the excitement of seeing original texts for the first time: \u201cIt was incredible \u2026 We\u2019ve been able to clearly see new information that no one has seen for 400 years.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b19", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2023/jul/14/the-ice-cream-man-targets-the-adult-market-the-stephen-collins-cartoon", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The ice-cream man targets the adult market \u2013 the Stephen Collins cartoon", "lead": "You, a grown, adult want an ice-cream \u2013 we both know it", "author": "Stephen Collins", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 09:00:05", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097218", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/397257c3c52afb5cb17f02b742ffd562f9751cfb/44_13_381_229/master/381.jpg", "body": ""}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b1a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/14/experience-we-adopted-the-loneliest-dog-in-britain", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Experience: we adopted the loneliest dog in Britain", "lead": "He\u2019d been in the rescue centre for 500 days.

It was about a nine-year-old dog, Charlie, dubbed the loneliest in Britain. He had been in an RSPCA rescue centre in Somerset for more than 500 days. For some reason, nobody wanted to adopt him. I clicked on the link and straight away these huge, sad eyes stared back at me. I was smitten. I turned to my husband, Sam, and said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have him.\u201d He read the article over my shoulder and felt exactly the same way. We wanted to give Charlie a happy home and a new lease of life. Over the past few years we have tried to adopt a few different dogs, but we haven\u2019t had any luck \u2013 we were never top of the list. Sam and I got used to filling in forms and not hearing anything. We\u2019d almost given up hope. But Charlie is an older dog and we felt we\u2019d be suited \u2013 even older dogs have a lot of love left to offer. So we took our time with the application, sent photographs of our house and garden. We explained why Charlie would be happy with us, then forgot all about it. A few days later we received an email from Brent Knoll animal centre, saying we\u2019d been shortlisted. We were gobsmacked and thrilled. They asked us to visit Charlie to be interviewed and to see if he liked us. When we arrived we were taken to the staff room. We didn\u2019t know what to expect. We hadn\u2019t been told much about Charlie\u2019s circumstances, but as he had been given up for adoption and hadn\u2019t been placed with a new owner for so long, we thought there might be issues. But the dog that bounded in was full of joy and charisma. He came straight over to us, all inquisitive. We had been told he was wary of men, but as soon as he saw Sam, he jumped on his lap as if they\u2019d been best friends for ever. That day, we gave him treats and played ball. The centre wanted us to come back the next day, when the final decision would be made. When we returned, Charlie jumped up and wagged his tail. We were delighted when they said we could take him home. The staff at the centre became teary when it was time to say goodbye. They had looked after him brilliantly for almost two years. The drive back took a few hours, and I don\u2019t think Charlie had ever been in a car for that long. He was well behaved, if a little queasy. We thought he might feel nervous in a new environment, but as soon as he got to our house he immediately made himself at home. He went into each room, had a good old sniff, then jumped into an armchair. Charlie is a dog who knows exactly what he wants \u2013 and that\u2019s to be with us all the time. That first night he jumped on our bed and slept between us. That\u2019s become his habit. He\u2019s so warm-hearted. He has none of the trauma you might expect after spending so long in a rescue centre. Charlie has short legs like a corgi, a big body like a staffie and the lovely head of a beagle. He\u2019s very affectionate. Our daughter is in love with him as well. She brings him presents every time she comes round. We\u2019ve had dogs, cats and horses in the past, but no pets for a long time before him. If you give a dog love, they\u2019ll give you a bundle of wonderful things in return. Charlie gets two walks a day and is getting better at walking on a lead: when we first got him, he pulled a lot. He\u2019s a bit antisocial at the local park, always up for a fight. He thinks he can take on more than his match. We feel proud that we\u2019ve given Charlie a new home and a second chance. He\u2019s done the same for us. Now we get out every day on walks and we\u2019re more active. He\u2019s always so happy to see us when we come through the door. He\u2019s spoiled and we enjoy him so much. It\u2019s important for people to adopt animals, especially older ones. People often go for puppies or trendy breeds, so it was good to take on a dog who was a bit older and had been unwanted for so long. Charlie was once the loneliest dog in Britain. But he\u2019s not alone any more. \u2022 As told to Sophie Haydock Do you have an experience to share?

Unite\u2019s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: \u201cOur members at Gatwick airport undertake incredibly demanding roles and are essential to keeping the airport and airlines working, yet their employers somehow think it is acceptable to pay them a pittance. \u201cAs part of Unite\u2019s unyielding focus on the jobs, pay and condition of its members, the union has drawn a line in the sand and is committed to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport.\u201d Earlier this week, the union announced a deal for a 16% pay rise for security staff at Gatwick employed by ICTS and said that it would be \u201ca benchmark for all other pay deals\u201d at the airport. Unite said the airlines affected by the coming strikes included British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair, Tui, WestJet and Wizz. More than 4,400 flights are scheduled to depart from Gatwick over the planned strike days, according to data from the analytics firm Cirium. A Gatwick spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the recent ballot result and will support our airlines with their contingency plans to ensure that flights operate as scheduled.\u201d Gatwick has suffered disruption in recent weeks because of air traffic control issues in Europe, with airspace constrained by the war in Ukraine and a series of strikes in local control centres around the continent. It is one of the busiest single-runway airports in the world, and last week submitted a planning application to develop a second runway. Elsewhere, 150 Birmingham airport security guards and terminal technicians in Unite are preparing to start an all-out strike from next Tuesday in a row over pay. A threatened summer of strikes at Heathrow by security guards in the Unite union was called off last month after 18 days of walkouts this year, with the London airport agreeing a two-year deal worth at least 15.5%."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b1c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/14/environment-charity-bids-to-encircle-london-in-m25-for-nature", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Environment charity bids to encircle London in \u2018M25 for nature\u2019", "lead": "CPRE London hopes to surround capital in trees by weaving existing areas of green belt in outer boroughs", "author": "Clea Skopeliti", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 08:39:55", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097271", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/99d68b230c2ce845b73534d8b9fc8abfe5e68919/0_117_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "An environmental charity is bidding to create an \u201cM25 for nature\u201d that would encircle London in woodland, hedgerows and street trees to boost biodiversity, carbon capture and wellbeing. The countryside charity CPRE London hopes to weave together existing areas of green belt in the city\u2019s 18 outer boroughs to create an uninterrupted ring of trees around the capital. The director of CPRE London, Anna Taylor, said the charity was applying for funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and called on Londoners to assist in identifying potential sites that could be used to connect woodland areas to create a \u201ccorridor for wildlife\u201d. Britain has lost almost half its biodiversity since the Industrial Revolution, and Taylor underlined the potential role of a \u201ctree ring\u201d in protecting ecosystems. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely key that we\u2019re focusing on strengthening the habitats around London. Woodland is one of the most diverse habitats once it becomes established \u2013 a mature oak tree on its own can host 2,300 species.\u201d Some places may be less suited to planting traditional native woodland, Taylor said, explaining that alternatives such as hedgerows, orchards, and street trees could also be used to maintain an unbroken ring of plant life, allowing wildlife to move between wooded areas. While the precise route would be determined by the mapping, the first phase of the project in north London is expected to focus on the areas in, around and between Epping and Hainault forests, while planting in the south of the city would initially concentrate on restoring areas previously covered by the Great North Wood, she said. Mapping is under way with Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). \u201cOur role is going to be advocating to local authorities and private landowners about the benefits of planting and the urgency of taking action,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt may be thicker in some boroughs than others \u2013 it depends on the underlying habitats. \u201cWe\u2019d be particularly keen to hear about opportunities for buffer planting to grow existing wooded areas, planting on the edges of playing fields where a wooded area could provide a shady respite on hot days \u2026 or planting near streams and rivers that could contribute to natural flood management.\u201d The project would include residents from the outset in a way that is adaptive to local land use. \u201cThe idea of a community forest is all about multi-purpose planting that really serves communities, rather than blanket planting of trees.\u201d The tree ring has strong potential to bolster access to green space for Londoners, Bridget Fox, the Woodland Trust\u2019s south-east regional external affairs officer, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades how important woodland is for climate and for biodiversity. But something that was heightened during lockdown and since is how important having access to green space is for people\u2019s wellbeing. \u201cWhether that\u2019s the cleaner, moister, cooler air, or the just the tranquility of being in touch with nature \u2026 There\u2019s even been research on the savings to the public purse of better wellbeing from being out and about in nature. \u201cPeople now recognise the green belt needs to earn its keep as land use, whether that\u2019s in terms of sequestering carbon or helping deliver nature recovery. But [having] countryside on London\u2019s doorstep, giving everyone better access to nature, is really important too.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b1d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/14/minister-calls-for-pay-offer-to-be-taken-seriously-as-doctors-in-england-strike", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Minister calls for pay offer to be taken \u2018seriously\u2019 as doctors in England strike", "lead": "Health unions suggest industrial action likely to continue as Gillian Keegan defends 6% rise on the table", "author": "Kiran Stacey Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 08:36:47", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097288", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6053eee159f0dba9be315ca6fcc22992a62b2b/0_120_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "A senior cabinet minister has urged health unions to take the government\u2019s pay offer \u201cseriously\u201d, after union leaders said the proposed deal would drive doctors out of the profession and could lead to further strikes. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, defended the offer of a 6% pay rise for junior doctors, a day after the government accepted the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies. Keegan said the pay review bodies had taken into account how much money would be needed to recruit and retain NHS staff without adding to the UK\u2019s stubbornly high inflation rate. The British Medical Association however called the offer \u201ca huge missed opportunity\u201d, while the Royal College of Nursing said it highlighted the unfairness of the separate offer to nurses of 5% plus a one-off payment. Keegan told Sky News on Friday morning: \u201cTrying to give public sector workers pay rises, but also trying to make sure that we halve inflation \u2013 this is not easy. \u201cThe independent pay review bodies have done a very thorough analysis, and they look at recruitment and retention, they look at similar professions \u2026 I think it\u2019s only fair that [the BMA] should look at that and take that seriously.\u201d Her comments came as junior doctors in England began the second day of their five-day strike in a pay dispute and the doctors\u2019 union, the British Medical Association, told ministers: \u201cDoctors are in this for the long run.\u201d Prof Philip Banfield, the association\u2019s council chair, told LBC the chances of further doctor strikes were \u201cvery high\u201d. He pointed to the Scottish government\u2019s offer of a 12.4% increase for junior doctors this year. Those in England are being offered around half of that, and are due to take part in the second day of a planned five-day stretch of industrial action on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s equally possible that a UK government with higher access to funds could make that kind of negotiation possible as well,\u201d Banfield said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t believe that this is all over. I do believe that doctors are in this for the long run because we are seeing so much harm come to patients every day because of the underfunding of the NHS.\u201d On Thursday, cabinet ministers welcomed the decision by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to accept the public sector review bodies\u2019 recommendations to grant pay rises of between 5% and 7% for the next financial year. In recent weeks, Downing Street had refused to guarantee Sunak would accept the recommendations once they were made. But on Thursday, the prime minister said the government would be able to afford to meet them using money from existing departmental budgets rather than by borrowing more or raising taxes. He added, however, that there would be no further talks with unions over pay. Teaching unions said they would recommend that their members accept an offer of 6.5%, which Keegan insisted on Friday would not be taken from existing school budgets, but instead from anticipated underspends which would otherwise have gone back to the Treasury. \u201cThe Treasury has worked with us \u2026 [and] they\u2019ve given us the flexibility to take anticipated underspends and to move them into teachers\u2019 pay,\u201d she said. Keegan urged junior doctors to accept the deal on the table, saying that anything extra would add to inflation. \u201cJunior doctors are not unusual, we have all got the impacts of inflation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really quite quite difficult to agree a pay increase without adding to inflationary pressures.\u201d In a separate interview about the problem of high levels of pupil absences in schools, meanwhile, Keegan said it was partly the responsibility of headteachers to ensure children were in class. \u201c[Headteachers] do have a duty,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cWe all have to play our part. Sometimes you have to go [to the home] or sometimes you have to text the parent in the morning. Sometimes you just have to do whatever is possible.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b1e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/14/football-transfer-rumours-could-neymar-be-on-way-chelsea", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football transfer rumours: could Neymar be on his way to Chelsea?", "lead": "Thiago to return to Barcelona? | Spurs join the Levi Colwill queue? | Brennan Johnson wanted by Villa?", "author": "Rob Smyth", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 08:09:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097306", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a091198a6f56b3be7afe55c553d8b4004e9a6ca5/0_94_4030_2417/500.jpg", "body": "Neymar to Chelsea, eh?

Departed legends from Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald to Mark Murphy and Betty Carter have epitomised that, as idiosyncratic muses such as C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant and Gretchen Parlato continue to do today. But few contemporary jazz-influenced singers manage to sound so intensely like themselves while drawing on such a variety of genres, languages, and cultural backstories as the Albania-born vocalist Elina Duni. A Time to Remember is Duni\u2019s ninth album and second with the UK\u2019s Rob Luft (guitar), Fred Thomas (piano/percussion), and Switzerland\u2019s Matthieu Michel (flugelhorn) \u2013 a trio impeccably attuned to her ability to convey intensity with the most delicate yet diamond-bright sounds, cannily improvising in ways that stretch the songs without disrupting Duni\u2019s surefooted control over their shape.

But Duni\u2019s and Luft\u2019s travels have since taken them on expeditions to the Sinai Desert and the Red Sea, and a sense of appreciative awe touches much of this music, particularly the pair\u2019s daydreaming, note-gliding title track and the wordlessly rapturous, cymbal-shimmering Dawn. Duni\u2019s excited gasps on the turns of the skipping Albanian traditional E Vog\u00ebl (Little One) evoke a child\u2019s impetuousness, while the beautiful Charlie Haden ballad First Song opens on Luft\u2019s echoing Bill Frisell-like effects, and unfolds in Duni\u2019s softly yearning delivery of the Abbey Lincoln lyrics. Send in the Clowns, a much-covered tough call for any singer, similarly manifests this fine vocalist\u2019s remarkable capacity for expressing strength and resolve by the most reticent of means.

It appears to have played a key role in the APVMA not performing its full regulatory responsibilities.\u201d Watt confirmed the CEO and board chair had tendered their resignations from their respective roles \u201cin recent days\u201d, and said a nationwide search would be conducted for their long-term replacements. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Among the findings was \u201can unacceptable volume of personnel-related complaints\u201d with a formal complaint recorded every four to six weeks for the past five years, with the agency \u2013 which employed 129 people as of 30 June 2022 \u2013 having recorded 56 personnel-related complaints between 2018 and 2023. Of those, 21 were allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The report authors concluded there were \u201cclearly cultural issues\u201d with the organisation and that while \u201csome of the complaints were very serious\u201d there appeared to have been \u201clittle if any reporting of these matters to the board\u201d. \u201cThere was no reporting that we could find of any kind of these matters to either the department or the minister, meaning that matters were not escalated and relevant action could not be taken.\u201d It also found the APVMA had focused on targets around the timeframes for registering agvet chemicals at the expense of undertaking monitoring and compliance activities, that it had taken an \u201ceducational approach\u201d to enforcing regulations rather than applying stronger penalties and that its approach to regulation \u201cappears to align with industry interests\u201d. Watt said the report also found that the former Nationals leader and agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce\u2019s decision to move the regulator to Armidale resulted \u201cin a loss of corporate knowledge, a loss of corporate culture and a loss of experience and knowledge of public sector values\u201d. Joyce\u2019s office was contacted for comment. Watt said he had asked for a \u201crapid evaluation\u201d of the APVMA\u2019s structure and governance, which the former public servant Ken Matthews would undertake and report back on by the end of September. A nationwide search for the head of the agency and board was under way and Watt had also issued a ministerial direction for the finalisation of reviews of eight chemicals which had been ongoing for more than 17 years, each. \u201cThis is the first time ever that this type of ministerial direction has been given to the APVMA,\u201d Watt said. \u201cI have conveyed to the APVMA board and executive the need for swift action on these reviews. We cannot continue to have reviews of chemicals drag on for decades, this is not good regulatory practice.\u201d Watt said he maintained confidence that the nation\u2019s food was safe, with the review finding no examples of chemicals being used inappropriately while other programs which monitor chemical usage have not raised any concerns. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, criticised Labor for its response to the scathing APVMA report, accusing the government of \u201cbreathtaking hypocrisy\u201d. Littleproud, the shadow agriculture minister, claimed Labor had not supported a Coalition push for a governance board for the APVMA between 2019 and 2021. \u201cLabor is now complaining about a lack of governance into the APVMA from 2019 to 2022, despite originally being opposed to a board that would have provided governance to the APVMA,\u201d he said. Littleproud noted that the report found systemic issues between 2019 and 2022, \u201cwhich was the time the former Coalition government was trying to make improvements\u201d. An APVMA spokesperson directed questions about the review to the minister. \u201cThe APVMA board and interim executive accept the findings of the final strategic review report and ministerial direction and have undertaken to continue to work diligently towards addressing the findings of the review and act in accordance with the directive immediately,\u201d they said."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b23", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/14/accc-to-compel-companies-to-back-up-environmental-claims-with-evidence", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "ACCC to compel companies to back up environmental claims with evidence", "lead": "Australia\u2019s competition watchdog publishes draft guidelines in a bid to stamp out greenwashing", "author": "Lisa Cox", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 07:06:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097398", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/12b7ef0ae1fa1bc96e8969c8f9c41cb682e9a97d/0_227_5567_3342/500.jpg", "body": "Companies should have evidence to back up claims they make about their environmental sustainability, according to draft guidelines developed by the competition watchdog in a bid to stamp out greenwashing. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) published the draft guidance on Friday after its recent greenwashing internet sweep identified concerning practices ranging from overstating climate action to companies developing their own certification schemes. That survey found 57% of the businesses reviewed were making potentially misleading environmental claims. The draft guidelines propose eight principles that companies should follow if they choose to make environmental and sustainability claims to ensure they comply with Australian consumer law and so consumers can make informed decisions. The principles include making accurate and truthful claims that don\u2019t, for example, exaggerate the environmental benefit of actions taken by companies, and having clear, independent and scientific evidence to demonstrate to consumers that those claims can be trusted. Another principle warns companies they should not omit or hide important information that would enable consumers to get a full picture of their practices. For example, \u201chighlighting the positive aspects of your product, service, or business while omitting information about the negative aspects\u201d, which could give consumers the false impression a product or service had a lower environmental impact than it actually did. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report points to a hypothetical case study of a plastic cosmetics pump bottle labelled \u201cplastic free\u201d but with small text on the back noting this only applied to the external bottle and not to the cap, pump or internal tube that sits inside the bottle. \u201cWe did observe in the businesses that we swept late last year that there were situations which we thought were likely to be exaggerating benefits or understating harm or omitting relevant information,\u201d the ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said. Erin Turner, the chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, said the guidelines were necessary and an important first step to improve green claims made by Australian companies. \u201cWhat we want is for companies to give customers information that helps them compare options and make meaningful choices. That\u2019s not happening now,\u201d she said. The centre conducted research last year that examined claims consumers saw in the Australian market every day and found many of them were \u201cvague and unhelpful\u201d. Turner said this included the use of words such as \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201ceco\u201d without promising a business was actually doing anything specific. \u201cThe one that stood out to me was \u2018our freezers are greener\u2019,\u201d she said. Turner said in addition to guidelines, legislation was needed to require businesses to put more information into the market. \u201cWe need claims that help people put options side by side and answer basic questions like, \u2018how long will the product last\u2019, \u2018can I repair it\u2019 and \u2018is this better than another company\u2019,\u201d she said. The Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) has been involved in 10 complaints to the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission about greenwashing in the past year. EDO managing lawyer Kirsty Ruddock said the firm would continue to highlight to the ACCC the need for companies to show a clear scientific basis for their net zero claims, in particular. \u201cFor net zero claims to be credible, they must reduce absolute emissions and limit the use of offsets to situations where there are residual or unavoidable emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many net zero claims rely on offsets instead of reducing emissions.\u201d Consultation on the draft guidelines will run until 15 September. After the guidelines are finalised the ACCC will develop sector and issue-specific guidance. Cass-Gottlieb said she expected one of the issue-specific areas would be emissions reduction and offsets. The watchdog is seeking feedback from companies about what was practical and what information they needed so that businesses that were legitimately investing in sustainable practices could confidently make their claims. Cass-Gottlieb said they also wanted feedback from consumers about what information would be helpful to assess claims about green credentials and how they would like to see that information and access it. \u201cFalse or misleading claims can undermine consumer trust in all green claims, particularly when consumers are often paying higher prices based on these claims,\u201d she said. \u201cSimilarly, businesses that are taking genuine steps to adopt sustainable practices are put at a competitive disadvantage by businesses that engage in \u2018greenwashing\u2019 without incurring the same costs.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b24", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/14/get-stuffed-why-the-beanie-bubble-is-a-joyful-funeral-for-the-american-dream", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Get stuffed!

Sunny optimism was, she says, \u201ca very 90s thing\u201d. \u201cPeople who are 19 now don\u2019t feel that,\u201d continues Kulash. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t if I were 19. I don\u2019t myself. Because it\u2019s just as bad or worse!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s total bullshit that there\u2019s a level playing field,\u201d agrees Gore. \u201cIt\u2019s all completely skewed.\u201d What today\u2019s teenagers needed, she felt, was a roadmap to show them that you can still succeed in a cracked system if you have a strong moral compass \u2013 and a nose to sniff out the myths. So the couple made a movie. All part of the day job for Gore, 46, who has been a writer and producer on the likes of Futurama, Saturday Night Live, Her and Nailed, as well as an editor on An Inconvenient Truth \u2013 made by her father, Al Gore. More of a jump for Kulash, 47, the frontman of OK Go, the rock band best known for their inventive one-take videos. They envisioned the film as a cuddlier version of Foxcatcher, the chilly 2014 drama that Gore worked on. Both are about a real-life creepy billionaire \u2013 in Foxcatcher\u2019s case; a wrestling coach, taxidermy fan and murderer John du Pont; in theirs, Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner, who dissected scores of soft toys to figure out how best to stuff his own (\u201cI\u2019m not a psycho,\u201d he says early on. \u201cBut it is fun\u201d). And both films, says Gore, are \u201cfunerals for the American dream. But this one is a bit more joyful. A second line parade through the French Quarter kind of funeral.\u201d The Beanie Bubble is certainly colourful \u2013 as well as being, as Kulash admits, a bit of a bait-and-switch. Its red herrings are the slightly hideous plush cats that abruptly became hot property around the advent of eBay, leading to \u201cone of the biggest and most absurd speculative crazes in history\u201d. The scale \u2013 and democracy \u2013 were unprecedented. \u201cIt used to take a big reserve of capital for you to buy into some market where you could make this type of error,\u201d says Kulash. \u201cEven with the tulip craze, you had to be a member of the landed gentry to be able to afford that stuff. Same with real estate or gold. But as soon as you have a market at the $5 level, everyone can get sucked into the mania.\u201d Those who profited the most, he says, were \u201cmostly stay-at-home mums in suburban Chicago\u201d \u2013 a sector of society not usually invited into the back room. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible! But now we see the same craziness over and over; this arbitrary value system. NFTs are no different from Beanie Babies or crypto or anything with false scarcity.\u201d So why do we keep repeating the same mistake? Kulash rubs his forehead, an enthusiastic cultural student. \u201cThe whole American ethos \u2013 maybe western or capitalist ethos in general \u2013 is that there\u2019s a loophole in \u2018it\u2019s too good to be true\u2019, and you\u2019re gonna be the one who finds it.\u201d Gore nods next to him, all serene good humour. \u201cBubbles of hope are sort of irresistible,\u201d she says. \u201cThis feeling that maybe I have finally discovered the thing that will solve all of my problems. Human nature is always hoping and there\u2019s something beautiful about that. Naive and terrible, but also beautiful. I\u2019d rather have hope as a guiding light than cynicism. Even when it comes with some pain.\u201d Most of the pain meted out in the movie is to the women who enter \u2013 and then try to extricate themselves from \u2013 partnerships with Warner, played by Zach Galifianakis. All three are lightly fictionalised versions of real Warner victims: company co-founder Robbie (Elizabeth Banks), Maya (Geraldine Viswanathan), a tech whiz who joins as a student, and Sheila (Sarah Snook), a single mother who falls for him. It\u2019s really all about their stories, Gore and Kulash are eager to stress. Yet Warner does remain The Beanie Bubble\u2019s ghastly heart: an ebullient manchild who turns a marriage proposal into a spotlit ego trip and suggests his fiancee have her nose fixed before the honeymoon. For Warner, explains Kulash, there is no arc: he is the American dream, in all its hideous, irresistible vainglory. \u201cIn the same scene, one woman sees him as this Willy Wonka ball of charm and another goes: he\u2019s terrible. He\u2019s not acting differently, and they\u2019re seeing the exact same thing, they\u2019re just at different places on the cycle.\u201d He also remains weirdly true to himself. \u201cFrom what I know of toxic narcissists,\u201d says Gore, \u201cthey truly believe what they\u2019re saying in the moment. There\u2019s something authentic about them, and that is even creepier.\u201d Dotted through the film are photos of political leaders at key points in their careers, partly as anchors (the structure time-shuffles a lot), partly as commentary. There are none of Joe Biden\u2019s predecessor, yet there\u2019s something inescapably Trumpish about Warner: his arrogance and sexism, lack of empathy or impulse control. \u201cThose people are capable of winning the game at the highest levels,\u201d says Gore, \u201cbecause we have somehow culturally come to celebrate and reward some of the worst traits of sociopaths.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d says Kulash, \u201cwe root for them. We don\u2019t just say: \u2018Oh gosh, here\u2019s the capitalist, we\u2019re gonna have to fight him.\u2019 We all want what the women want \u2013 at first.\u201d Understanding such desire doesn\u2019t make it more palatable. There are nauseating scenes showing insatiable adult appetite for children\u2019s comfort objects. Wanting excess seems to be an innate impulse, says Kulash. He tries to explain to their five-year-olds that if he took away 10 of their toys, \u201cyou\u2019d love the 10 you have left more. And if I give you another one, you\u2019ll love them all less. And yet you want another one. And eventually, we will probably give in. You so want to reason with them, and it will never, ever work. It doesn\u2019t work when I tell it to myself.\u201d The Beanie Bubble is a film sceptical about branded goods released into a market awash with movies that celebrate them. And its directors are understandably uncomfortable sitting on the same shelf as Barbie and Air, BlackBerry and Flamin\u2019 Hot. \u201cAs much as I loved Air,\u201d says Kulash, \u201cI don\u2019t think at the end you\u2019re supposed to be like: \u2018God, should we be wearing those shoes?\u2019\u201d To make a movie like that 30 years ago, says Gore, would have meant you were a \u201csellout\u201d. \u201cTo me personally, it\u2019s sort of depressing this confusion of capitalism and democracy that seems to be taking hold. It would be nice if all that passion was directed into things that made civilisation healthier and more loving, if it wasn\u2019t just this kind of competition over products.\u201d Still, Gore says that she\u2019s been buoyed by the reaction of some of the beleaguered teens who have seen the film. They successfully spotted the flaws in the system, she reports, and reached not for the roadmap but the detonator. \u201cThey were like: \u2018I don\u2019t really want to win in a system I don\u2019t believe in. I\u2019d rather blow it up.\u2019\u201d Plus, she grins, she\u2019s conscious that she and her husband are, for all their hand-wringing, flogging a film they made about Beanie Babies. \u201cBut it was an accident!\u201d protests Kulash. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Gore agrees. \u201cIt was so incidental to the stories we were actually trying to tell. But yeah: we\u2019re aware of the hypocrisy.\u201d \u2022 The Beanie Bubble is released in cinemas and on Apple TV+ on 28 July"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b25", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/14/naomi-girma-uswnt-center-back-world-cup-soccer-2023", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Naomi Girma: the brilliant scientist at the heart of USA\u2019s defense", "lead": "After a formidable academic and athletic career at Stanford University, the Californian is an integral part of the defending champions\u2019 World Cup campaign", "author": "Jeff Kassouf", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 07:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097434", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/25cbea4c1be61b63effff034d001947fa86f3e4e/0_539_8000_4799/500.jpg", "body": "Each Saturday morning as a young child growing up in San Jose, California, Naomi Girma would show up to the park to play a version of soccer that was \u201cas informal as you can think\u201d, she says now. The children were divided by the adults into three groups: little, medium, and big. From there, the kids would scrimmage, their voices cutting through the crisp, California air uninterrupted by any formal coaching. Girma never made it to the big-kids group \u2013 which still upsets her, she jokes \u2013 but for good reason. By the time she reached third grade, Girma\u2019s talent had become clear. She entered the formal, competitive US youth soccer landscape, ascending from the complicated system that she and her parents learned on the fly to her position today as a budding star for the United States women\u2019s national team. \u201cI kind of just walked into [soccer], and I\u2019m very grateful I did,\u201d Girma tells the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s always just been around.\u201d Girma will most likely play an integral role at center-back for the USA this summer in the team\u2019s bid to win an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup. She only turned 23 last month but has already positioned herself to be one of the next great center-backs for the United States by combining her exceptional one-on-one defending with a calmness on the ball to spark attacks. Who Girma is today \u2013 as a player and a person \u2013 was shaped by her formative years growing up in the Bay Area. Her father, a refugee from Ethiopia who arrived in San Francisco in the early 1980s, established those Saturday morning gatherings in the park as the basis of the Maleda Soccer Club, \u201cmaleda\u201d meaning \u201cdawn\u201d in one of Ethiopia\u2019s languages. The purpose was then and is to this day to gather Ethiopian families \u2013 tens of thousands of Ethiopians are estimated to live in the Bay Area today \u2013 and strengthen community bonds. Those Saturday mornings also served as the dawn of Girma\u2019s soccer career. \u201cI think it just really made me value community and family,\u201d Girma says. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s really big in Ethiopian culture and not always as big in the American culture, so that was definitely something that my parents wanted to make sure was ingrained in us from a young age.\u201d Saturdays in the park for Girma soon became weekly jaunts around California. Her mom, who also came to the United States from Ethiopia, would drive the two around in their navy blue 2000 Toyota Camry. Together, they figured out the USA\u2019s complicated pay-to-play youth soccer system in the country\u2019s largest hotbed of talent. For Girma\u2019s mother, who didn\u2019t share a soccer background with her husband, some of the lessons were a little more basic. Explaining the offside rule to her mom was a particular process, Girma recalls. Those years paved the way for Girma\u2019s path to Stanford University, the prestigious school where she earned nearly perfect grades in symbolic systems \u2013 a combination of \u201cmind and machine\u201d in a world of technology and artificial intelligence \u2013 before pursuing her master\u2019s degree in management science and engineering. She captained Stanford\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team to an NCAA national championship in her hometown in 2019. Then came the professional and international opportunities. Even as the stakes on the field rose, Girma \u2013 \u201cNay,\u201d as most know her \u2013 remained grounded. Her joy is unabating, summed up by a beaming smile she carries with her on and off the field. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met anybody that\u2019s as good as her and doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re as good as what she is,\u201d says Casey Stoney, Girma\u2019s head coach at the National Women\u2019s Soccer League\u2019s San Diego Wave FC. \u201cShe\u2019s so humble. Humility is a big thing for her but I\u2019m trying to get her to realize how good she is at the same time, so she plays with that confidence every single week.\u201d Stoney was adamant with her team\u2019s management that the Wave use the top pick in the 2022 draft on Girma. Most players are either good defenders or can distribute the ball. Girma does both, Stoney said recently. Stoney would know, having played for England as a defender at three World Cups. \u201cI wasn\u2019t half as good as what [Girma] is and can be,\u201d Stoney said recently. Stoney was speaking about Girma in response to the club announcing a long-term contract extension for the defender that will keep her in San Diego through 2026. It doesn\u2019t take long to recognize Girma\u2019s unique skills in the position. Less than five minutes into the match against Jamaica at World Cup qualifying last year, Girma hit a diagonal ball to Sophia Smith, who brilliantly beat her defender to open the scoring for the United States. Girma attributes her ability on the ball to spending most of her youth career as a central midfielder. She was converted to a center-back with the USA\u2019s youth national teams in her early teens. \u201cHitting any and every type of ball: whipping it, hitting it over,\u201d Girma says of her strengths before stopping herself to say that she must still improve this skill, among another 10 or so on her list. \u201cI think having that from a center-back is so dangerous because you never know what to expect when the team is building out and that sets up the midfielders and forwards to be even more dangerous and have more time.\u201d Last season, Girma was named the NWSL Rookie of the Year and Defender of the Year while finishing as a finalist for MVP. She was integral to the success of a San Diego team that gave up the second-fewest goals in the league and sat atop the table for half the season. Girma did that in an even larger role than expected after 2019 World Cup champion center-back Abby Dahlkemper missed most of the year due to injuries. Girma admits that her comfort zone was stretched. \u201cI think it was me finding my voice and then kind of being put in a position where I had to find my voice and I had to be a leader in that role as the season progressed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt only pushed me more.\u201d A similar situation is now playing out at the international level. United States captain Becky Sauerbrunn, the center-back who anchored the team\u2019s 2015 and 2019 triumphs, will miss this World Cup due to a foot injury. The news was confirmed only in mid-June, adding to a long list of major injuries for the USA. Previously, Girma was competing for a starting role alongside Sauerbrunn. Dahlkemper\u2019s ongoing absence meant the USA had a particular need for a player capable of accurate, long-range distribution, a trademark of Dahlkemper at her best. Now, given Sauerbrunn\u2019s injury, Girma is almost certainly a starter who must once again assume a leadership role. Girma and Alana Cook, the other regular center-back in the regular rotation, have a combined 41 caps; Sauerbrunn has 216. USA head coach Vlatko Andonovski must now figure out a new plan. Girma and Cook make sense to pair together, although Julie Ertz could move back from a holding midfield role to center-back, where she played at the 2015 World Cup. Andonovski was also a defender as a player and knows that his young center-backs are still in the nascent stages of their careers. Mistakes are to be expected, he says. Girma is \u201cone of those special players\u201d who makes fewer errors than most \u2013 but she will still make them. \u201cIn order to become a good defender, unfortunately, you go through a few mistakes and sometimes it costs you a lot and sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Andonovski says. \u201cWith Naomi, we see potential, and we understand that she will make mistakes in the stage that she\u2019s at and we\u2019re OK with that and we will support her regardless, because we know she\u2019s going to be one of the most important players on this team.\u201d It is possible that three of the four USA starters in defense will be playing in their first major international tournament. How they perform under their greatest stress test to date will go a long way in determining the team\u2019s success. Girma plays with a noticeable calmness on the field, a reflection of her internal state. \u201cI try to keep a level head during the game,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that helps me perform better. I think it\u2019s calm in my head, too.\u201d Keeping perspective is important to Girma, her past serving as motivation for her present. There are her parents and her older brother, who she still often sees thanks to San Diego\u2019s proximity to home. There is the best friend she lost in early 2022, former Stanford teammate and goalkeeper Katie Meyer, who was found dead in her dorm room in what was ruled a suicide. \u201cMy parents came over here from Ethiopia and sacrificed a lot for me to be in this position,\u201d Girma said. \u201cAll of the work that they\u2019ve put in and their support and their love is a big driver for me. \u201cAnd my best friend passed away last year, Katie. Playing for her, honoring her: she was one of the most competitive people, loved soccer. I think just continuing her legacy is a big thing for me.\u201d Next in that process is Girma\u2019s first senior World Cup. Millions of eyeballs on a game in Auckland, New Zealand \u2013 or Sydney, Australia, should the United States make it to the final \u2013 is about as far away from a quiet park in San Jose, California, as Girma could get.

We are housemates and best friends, but she flushes her tampons down the loo and it frustrates me. Occasionally they don\u2019t flush and I see them when I use the bathroom. Maura is apologetic when they don\u2019t flush, but also says I shouldn\u2019t tell her whether or not to flush her tampons. Other women I know are mainly on my side about this, but when the subject has been discussed in front of Maura and her two sisters, they say: \u201cNo womb, no say.\u201d This has been going on for the whole three years we\u2019ve lived together, and Maura doesn\u2019t budge or admit she\u2019s in the wrong. She won\u2019t stop doing it. It\u2019s a bit disgusting to look at when they are in the toilet. When I see them I joke to her: \u201cGuess what I\u2019ve found floating in the loo?\u201d I think: why not wrap them up and put them in the bin, as that\u2019s how I\u2019m told most women deal with them. But Maura thinks that\u2019s more unhygienic. The heart of my prosecution, though, actually concerns the environment. Our old Victorian sewers can\u2019t handle tampons. I also go swimming in the river, and, when it rains, raw sewage can overflow into it. The thought of swimming beside a load of tampons is gross. In general, Maura is the tidy one and does more of the cleaning. I am super aware about that gender disparity and that makes me less inclined to pull her up on this, as usually I am the one being pulled up for my habits. As a man, who doesn\u2019t get periods, I sometimes wonder if Maura has a point about the tampons, given all the housework she does. When I asked Maura about giving readers their say on this matter, she asked about the anonymity of the piece. This suggests to me that she knows she is guilty but doesn\u2019t care enough to change. I\u2019m hoping everyone will agree with me on this. I don\u2019t have a problem with seeing tampons in general, and believe that they should be more normalised in society \u2013 I just don\u2019t need to see them floating in the toilet. The defence: Maura It\u2019s my job to take the bins out \u2013 and handling used tampons makes me feel sick Jeremiah and I have been friends for nine years and have lived together for the last three. I\u2019d say we are best friends. We get on really well as housemates, but when it comes to the tampons I agree with my sisters when they say: \u201cNo womb, no say.\u201d He doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to have a period, so I don\u2019t really want to debate this issue with him in the first place. However, my main point of defence is that I would never deliberately leave tampons in the loo, but the flush in our toilet isn\u2019t great, so sometimes it just happens. Jeremiah likes to dance around and shout whenever he finds a tampon floating in our loo. It\u2019s become this debate because he\u2019s made it into a big deal. The first time he brought it up was in front of my sisters. I reckon that Jeremiah thought they were going to take his side, but in fact they didn\u2019t because they are fiercely loyal to me. I do have a bit of an issue with Jeremiah taking the piss out of me about all this because I already feel shame and embarrassment. His jokes just add to the fuss of having a period. I think that looking at used tampons is gross, so I feel even more embarrassed when Jeremiah sees mine floating in the loo. I also have an issue with Jeremiah\u2019s complaints because I do way more of the housework than he does, which he admits. I like to keep things clean, whereas he\u2019s just not as on it. It is always my job to take the bins out, so I\u2019m less keen on leaving tampons in the bin as this makes me feel a bit sick. I would much rather flush them away than have to see them again. On the issue of toilet waste leading to fatbergs in the sewers, I agree that it is really bad. But since Jeremiah has never had a period, can he really say much on this? I have also told him before that I make sure to buy organic, compostable tampons, as these are much better for the environment. I don\u2019t want to stop flushing my tampons away, and think Jeremiah should not bring it up every time he sees one. The jury of Guardian readers Should Maura stop flushing tampons? I can\u2019t get my head around Maura\u2019s point of view. I would never dream of flushing a tampon down the toilet \u2013 not only because of the effect on the environment but also the effects on my own toilet. Who wants a blocked-up loo?! What a strange and selfish thing to do \u2013 poor Jeremiah. Hannah, 30 Sure, maybe Maura could double-check whether it has flushed (although double flushing is also bad for the environment), but it isn\u2019t worth shaming Maura for her periods, which are natural and normal. I wonder if he reacts the same towards residual loo roll? Hadia, 29 \u201cNo womb, no say\u201d really doesn\u2019t apply here; the toilet getting clogged up is a problem for everyone. Sure, we\u2019ve all forgotten to throw away used sanitary products from time to time, but there\u2019s a relatively easy compromise \u2013 Maura should throw her tampons in the bin, and Jeremiah should step up and take the bins out. Georgina, 25 Simply for environmental reasons, Jeremiah is right. However, as a compromise Jeremiah could offer to do the rubbish and take on more cleaning in exchange for Maura putting her tampons in the bin. Sam, 44 Maura is in the wrong. This is unsightly and bad for the environment. Periods are normal and in no way disgusting, but used sanitary products are not the most pleasant things to see. Wrap them up, put them in a sanitary bag and place in the bin. Womb or not, it\u2019s just not right.

The historic gold standard for any blitz achievement is Bobby Fischer\u2019s 19/22 at Herceg Novi 1970 in what was an unofficial world blitz championship and the strongest speed tournament of the 20th century.

On to this week\u2019s Aimchess Masters, where Carlsen first overcame his aide Jorden van Foreest in a knight ending where the world No 1 sacrificed his knight for unstoppable pawns, then retreated all his king\u2019s flank pieces to the back row before they emerged to defeat his old rival and US champion Fabiano Caruana, before defeating the rising star Nodirbek Abdusattorov to qualify for Friday\u2019s final.

It drives the intellectual capacity and prosperity of nations. It has developed the minds that took us to the moon and eradicated previously incurable diseases. And the special status of education is why generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are likely to profoundly disrupt this sector. This isn\u2019t a reflection of their intelligence, but of our failure to build education systems that nurture and value our unique human intelligence. We are being duped into believing these AI tools are far more intelligent than they really are. A tool like ChatGPT has no understanding or knowledge. It merely collates bits of words together based on statistical probabilities to produce useful texts. It is an incredibly helpful assistant. But it is not knowledgable, or wise. It has no concept of how any of the words it produces relate to the real world. The fact that it can pass so many forms of assessment merely reflects that those assessments were not designed to test knowledge and understanding but rather to test whether people had collected and memorised information. AI could be a force for tremendous good within education. It could release teachers from administrative tasks, giving them more opportunities to spend time with students. However, we are woefully equipped to benefit from the AI that is flooding the market. It does not have to be like this. There is still time to prepare, but we must act quickly and wisely. AI has been used in education for more than a decade. AI-powered systems, such as Carnegie Learning or Aleks, can analyse student responses to questions and adapt learning materials to meet their individual needs. AI tools such as TeachFX and Edthena can also enhance teacher training and support. To reap the benefits of these technologies, we must design effective ways to roll out AI across the education system, and regulate this properly. Staying ahead of AI will mean radically rethinking what education is for, and what success means. Human intelligence is far more impressive than any AI system we see today. We possess a rich and diverse intelligence, much of which is unrecognised by our current education system. We are capable of sophisticated, high-level thinking, yet the school curriculum, particularly in England, takes a rigid approach to learning, prioritising the memorising of facts, rather than creative thinking. Students are rewarded for rote learning rather than critical thought. Take the English syllabus, for instance, which requires students to learn quotations and the rules of grammar. This time-consuming work encourages students to marshal facts, rather than interpret texts or think critically about language. Our education system should recognise the unique aspects of human intelligence. At school, this would mean a focus on teaching high-level thinking capabilities and designing a system to supercharge our intelligence. Literacy and numeracy remain fundamental, but now we must add AI literacy. Traditional subject areas, such as history, science and geography, should become the context through which critical thinking, increased creativity and knowledge mastery are taught. Rather than teaching students only how to collate and memorise information, we should prize their ability to interpret facts and weigh up the evidence to make an original argument. Failure to change isn\u2019t an option. Now these technologies are here, we need humans to excel at what AI cannot do, so any workplace automation complements and enriches our lives and our intelligence. This should be an amazing opportunity to use AI to become much smarter, but we must ensure that AI serves us, not the other way round. This will mean confronting the profit-driven imperatives of big tech companies and the illusionist tricks played by Silicon Valley. It will also mean carefully considering what types of tasks we\u2019re willing to offload to AI. Some aspects of our intellectual activity may be dispensable, but many are not. While Silicon Valley conjures up its next magic trick, we must prepare ourselves to protect what we hold dear \u2013 for ourselves and for future generations.

Once in a while, Lindstr\u00f8m will make a left-field, exploratory record before snapping back to the space disco that made him famous. Everyone Else Is a Stranger, his first album since the 2020 Prins Thomas collab III, represents the snap-back point: it\u2019s a suite of four gloriously starry-eyed dance epics, filled with cheeky synth whirrs and undulating bass rhythms. It has all the enthusiastic fizz and enticing hue of a \u00a330 bottle of p\u00e9t nat; although it\u2019s slightly less exciting than the seductive, moonlit III, it arrives at the perfect point of summer, when the heat is gruelling and the only thing that might help you cool down is 40 minutes of expansive synth jams. The first half of Everyone Else begins as you\u2019d expect \u2013 heady, fast-building, glamorous \u2013 but in the latter half, Lindstr\u00f8m pulls away from crowd-pleasing into thornier territory. The Rind starts as a rhythmic, floor-filling groove before growing into a chaotic, panicky synth maelstrom. It sets the scene for the title track, a minimalist, ambient odyssey that by its end seems of a piece with the funky guitar-led compositions of III. It feels like a twist ending, although not one that\u2019s unearned or unwelcome \u2013 instead, it\u2019s proof there may be more to Lindstr\u00f8m\u2019s familiar rhythms than meets the ear."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b2a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/14/scientific-kerfuffle-alert-when-did-the-anthropocene-begin-and-what-is-a-golden-spike", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "SCIENTIFIC KERFUFFLE ALERT!

It will also explore what kind of role City firms, the government and regulators including the Financial Conduct Authority should play in \u201ccombating sexual harassment and misogyny\u201d. The inquiry comes after two scandals that have raised serious concerns about abuse and harassment against women in business. Earlier this year the Guardian revealed multiple claims of sexual misconduct at the Confederation of British Industry, which prompted a string of companies to terminate their membership, including Aviva, NatWest, John Lewis and BMW. Then in June, an investigation by the Financial Times and Tortoise revealed accusations of sexual misconduct against the multimillionaire Brexit donor and City boss Crispin Odey, resulting in his \u00a33.5bn hedge fund beginning the process of disbanding in June. Odey has denied any wrongdoing. Harriett Baldwin, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, said: \u201cAs a committee, we\u2019d like to know whether women feel more supported in the financial services industry than at the time of the previous committee\u2019s inquiry five years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ll be investigating if enough work has been done to build more supportive workplace cultures, how harassment and misogyny can be addressed, and the role the government and regulator should play in role modelling behaviours. \u201cHas the culture in this highly paid sector shifted at all in the last five years? This is a subject of marked importance to our committee and we look forward to beginning work on this important topic.\u201d The committee is inviting anyone with experience working in the City to submit evidence via its online portal by 1 September. Although MPs do not have the power to investigate individual cases, they are welcoming anonymous submissions from anyone worried about their safety. Contributions can be kept private, with an option for their responses to be withheld from any publications or subsequent reports. MPs have yet to confirm who will be asked to give in-person testimony. However, the witnesses are likely to include bosses from City firms, the FCA and the Treasury, similar to hearings in 2018, when the committee called on the former Virgin Money chief executive, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, headhunters from Sapphire Partners and partners from PwC. The 2018 inquiry also gathered evidence from Amanda Blanc, the former group chief executive of Axa UK. The insurance boss now leads Aviva, where last year she faced misogynistic comments from shareholders, who said she was \u201cnot the man for the job\u201d and should be \u201cwearing trousers\u201d. Blanc spoke out after the incident at the 2022 AGM, saying that although she was \u201cpretty used to sexist and derogatory comments\u201d after 30 years in financial services, she had faced more misogynistic behaviour as her career progressed. A spokesperson for the FCA said: \u201cWe welcome the committee\u2019s focus on this issue.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b2d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/14/rba-governor-michele-bullock-philip-lowe", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "RBA lifer Michele Bullock may have the luck of playing good cop to Philip Lowe\u2019s bad", "lead": "The Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s first female governor will begin her appointment at or very near the end of the cycle of rate rises", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 06:31:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097578", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/39493827be44ab9b379fe4a01d7af36c915572be/0_89_4685_2811/500.jpg", "body": "Australia will get its first female Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, and the order of the day is continuity with change. Continuity because Bullock is an extremely well qualified RBA lifer with four decades of experience. Change because the biggest thing going for Bullock is that she is \u201cbest-placed to take the Reserve Bank forward into the future\u201d, as Anthony Albanese said, and is \u201ccommitted\u201d to implementing the RBA review recommendations, as the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said. For weeks, some in the Coalition have pressured the Albanese government to reappoint Philip Lowe, warning that appearing to punish him for a cycle of tough but necessary interest rate rises would harm the RBA\u2019s independence. The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg was first out of the blocks on Friday, claiming a failure to reappoint Lowe \u201crisks locking in permanently high inflation as the Bank\u2019s independence will be damaged\u201d: The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, was more measured, welcoming the appointment without implying the bank\u2019s independence is shot. Chalmers insisted on Friday that the government \u201ccherishes\u201d the RBA\u2019s independence. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Beyond the effect on inflation and interest rates, the Coalition has tried to deal itself into the political debate in other ways. On Thursday the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, warned against appointing the treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, or the finance department secretary, Jenny Wilkinson, to the RBA position due to perceptions they would be too close to the government. Labor slapped down that bit of overreach, with Albanese labelling it a \u201ccompletely reprehensible\u201d politicisation of the public service and noting that both Kennedy and Wilkinson have received senior appointments from the Coalition. Chalmers was also in fine form, accusing Dutton of being \u201cso relentlessly negative that he is even now bagging things that aren\u2019t happening\u201d. \u201cWe won\u2019t be taking lectures from the party of robodebt,\u201d Chalmers said. Aside from the continuity and change, a few aspects of the decision sit in tension. Bullock is responsive to the government\u2019s desire for structural change about the way monetary policy is set but fiercely independent when it comes to each individual decision made under the new framework. I doubt punters who\u2019ve experienced 12 interest rate rises really care about that fine distinction, or the Coalition\u2019s weird sledging of the public service, or how an RBA insider can be the best person to shake up the central bank. \u201cWhat is going to happen to my rates?\u201d will be the only question. In this respect Bullock is especially blessed. She will inherit the levers of monetary policy either at or extremely near the end of the cycle of tightening. Inflation, which peaked in late 2022, is on the way down and decreasing at an accelerating rate, with encouraging signs from other developed economies that this trend will continue. Even Lowe, who for months has tortured mortgage holders with references to \u201cfurther increases\u201d \u2013 note the plural \u2013 has eased up. Lowe now says it is \u201cpossible that some further tightening will be required\u201d. Possible, but not definite. Might be required, necessarily implying that it might not. With two more meetings before handing the reins over in mid-September, there\u2019s every chance the first interest rate move under Bullock will be down, not up. That would introduce the new governor to the Australian public as the good cop to Lowe\u2019s bad. Even if the cash rate has to remain where it is or a little higher well into 2024, Labor is hoping that by the next federal election in 2025, the Australian economy will be in a goldilocks zone of low unemployment and not especially high, falling interest rates. The opposition may hope for the best for the economy but, perversely, would benefit if inflation stayed high for a little longer. There\u2019s one last complication to throw into the political mix: stage-three income tax cuts. As the International Monetary Fund warns the UK against pre-election tax cuts and the Tory party accepts that fighting inflation makes tax cuts unlikely, one wonders whether the Albanese government will similarly have to revisit stage three. A week ago, Chalmers said that the tax cuts \u2013 worth $313bn over 10 years \u2013 are \u201cnot necessarily\u201d inflationary. \u201cIt kind of depends what the economy looks like when those tax cuts come into being more than a year away,\u201d he told ABC Melbourne. Labor wants the 12 rate rises to work their magic for two reasons, then: to hold an election during a period of monetary easing; and to avoid difficult questions about why they\u2019re handing tax back while inflation is still high. Lowe may have annoyed many Australians with his incorrect guidance that rates were unlikely to rise until 2024, before turning the screws on mortgage holders. But if the tightening helps the Australian economy achieve that soft landing, then Lowe\u2019s tenure as governor will look pretty good in the rearview mirror. No wonder Lowe, a political punching bag through much of 2022 and 2023, goes with the government\u2019s gratitude. Interest rate hikes have not made him popular, but he\u2019s given his successor and the bank a clean slate."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b2e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/ordinary-human-failings-by-megan-nolan-review-lyrical-tale-of-a-family-accused", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ordinary Human Failings by Megan Nolan review \u2013 lyrical tale of a family accused", "lead": "An Irish family in early 90s London become tabloid scapegoats in this politically astute novel of lives foreclosed", "author": "Keiran Goddard", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 06:30:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097602", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d0cb4322c77030510f990debfce60c753a5ed746/0_0_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Ordinary Human Failings is a considerably more interesting book than it claims to be. It\u2019s pitched as a procedural thriller of sorts \u2013 an unsolved murder, the cops closing in, an ambitious journalist snooping around. While there may be a depressing commercial logic to this framing, it does the novel scant justice; those plot elements amount to little more than a deftly handled framing device. Beyond lies a subtle, accomplished and lyrical study of familial and intergenerational despair, a quiet book about quiet lives. And it also happens to be an excellent novel: politically astute, furious and compassionate. It\u2019s considerably better than Nolan\u2019s first novel, the acclaimed Acts of Desperation \u2013 worth stating, given our neophilic literary culture\u2019s obsession with debuts and novelty. Set mostly in the early 1990s, it tells the story of the Greens, a family of Irish immigrants who have moved to London in the hope of escaping the social stigma of daughter Carmel\u2019s teenage pregnancy and her brother Ritchie\u2019s escalating alcoholism. Judged reclusive and odd by their new neighbours, the Greens are easy scapegoats when tragedy visits their estate. As we gradually learn more about the psychological and structural forces that have shaped the family, a picture emerges of lives foreclosed; of youthful audacity hardening into resignation and resentment, fresh starts rendered heavy by old habit, sadnesses handed from parent to child like cursed heirlooms. The overall effect is claustrophobic and relentlessly melancholic, but that is not to say that the novel is one-note. It is testament to Nolan\u2019s ability as a writer that she is able to wring so much nuance and power out of an emotional palette consisting mostly of greys and blues. Ordinary Human Failings is an achievement of shade and texture, and perhaps above all else an achievement in saying some of the plain, earnest things we are often too embarrassed to say \u2013 that what might seem a perfectly normal life can nonetheless feel empty or insufficient, that sometimes it\u2019s impossible not to feel you are wasting all that you have been given. There is often a lacuna in the cultural timeline of post-1980s Britain, a concertina effect that sees stories leap directly from the dying embers of the Thatcher regime to the short-lived hope of New Labour and the dull drumbeat of Britpop. But there is half a decade in between that is too rarely accounted for artistically, with notable exceptions in the cases of early Patrick Keiller or Naked-era Mike Leigh. It\u2019s precisely that period that is most closely evoked by Nolan, who brilliantly recreates a nation still wounded from the rapid dismantling of the postwar social consensus, a London of dingy hotels and greasy spoons, conversations over halves of bitter or the coveted family landline. Setting the novel in the early 1990s allows Nolan to explore the toxic media culture of the time, with tabloids all too eager to make a grotesque spectacle of poverty and suffering in order to sell newspapers. Nolan\u2019s writing is especially strong in this area, reaching beyond liberal pearl-clutching and towards something altogether more material in its analysis. The character of Tom, a young reporter who has already internalised the amoral logic of his profession, could have read as easy caricature \u2013 the seedy journalist who will do anything for a story. Instead he is an equivocal figure, not entirely unsympathetic but ultimately unable to see past his own class position and recognise that the reality in front of him is not a morality tale but a mundane patchwork of ambient despair. Elsewhere Nolan is excellent on the fungibility of working-class bodies broken by wage labour and then quickly forgotten. This is also a novel about addiction and alcoholism, and one that approaches the subject with rare insight. Nolan is superb on the bargaining that often goes hand in hand with substance abuse. Her characters make endless rules to govern their consumption \u2013 certain drinks in certain quantities at certain times. They spot patterns in the drinking of others, notice that their own lives are getting smaller by the glass. It\u2019s heavy stuff, but it\u2019s well earned. Nolan describes the Greens as having \u201cordinary human failings, tragedies too routine to be of note\u201d. But in this deeply tender book, she not only notes those tragedies, she also bears witness to them. To do so is an act of compassion. To do so with such grace is a genuine achievement. \u2022 Keiran Goddard is the author of Hourglass (Abacus). Ordinary Human Failings by Megan Nolan is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a316.99).

This is how I ended up watching the second series of True Detective, which is dreadful in every possible way: Vince Vaughn is horribly miscast; it\u2019s filmed with all the style of a filler episode of CSI; the central mysterious murder is impossible to care about; and, crucially, it seems to have been written and made and acted in by people who have never consumed any art beyond a mid-game mission from GTA V. Colin Farrell is the only one doing any acting, and even then it\u2019s to such a non-end that I am retroactively rescinding a star from my personal review of The Banshees of Inisherin for his involvement in it. Anyway, I\u2019ve been thinking about second-season syndrome as a result, and how common it used to be. Back in 2015, when True Detective was ruining the legacy of its first season with the doomed second, it was fairly common to see TV shows not know how to start again after neatly finishing up their first series and getting more lauded than expected. It makes sense: when you\u2019re creating a 10-episode run of TV, you truly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to get picked up again, so you try to write a story freestanding enough to make sense if it gets cancelled but with enough loose ends to pick up again should it not be (if you closely watch the early seasons, they kept doing this with Breaking Bad). Then you get the phone call from HBO saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the audience figures and guess what \u2013 we now love it!\u201d and you realise you\u2019ve painted yourself into a corner. Follow-up problems happen with albums, they happen with books. Sometimes you just run out of road. All of this is to say: the second series of The Bear \u2013 last year\u2019s show-of-the-year contender where Jeremy Allen White plays a Michelin-level chef in a T-shirt trying to turn round a doomed Chicago sandwich shop \u2013 is here, and how neatly it has sidestepped every possible second-season syndrome pitfall is wonderful to watch. We start by making them poor again \u2013 and putting the gang in the middle of a spirallingly expensive refit at the behest of a loan shark suddenly brings back the tension that this show needs to thrive. It also does well to mark out how hard the hospitality industry is finding things post-Covid, money and staffing and demand-wise, which is another area where this show sings: it shows you the 5am starts and the bureaucratic paperwork and the need to go outside and smoke a cigarette alone for a second just as much as it does the \u201cDamn, that sauce is good!\u201d moments of magic. Another great decision was to make the city of Chicago a rugged background character (similar to how this year\u2019s Beef made its LA backdrop so crucial to the story \u2013 something True Detective season two completely forgot). But mainly, this series gives every character a (real, good, richly textured) story. An easy way of resolving the huge audience reaction to the first series was to go: \u201cOh, you like these characters, do you? Well what if you watched 10 episodes of nice things happening to them, and some of them fall in love!\u201d which is what Ted Lasso did. The Bear defies that: Ebon Moss-Bachrach\u2019s Richie is 45 and divorced and doesn\u2019t know his place in the world, but he\u2019s trying his best not to yell about it; Lionel Boyce\u2019s Marcus is trying to balance the two opposing forces of a terminally ill mother and finding meaning in boundary-pushing desserts; Tina and Ebraheim are sent to culinary school and having completely different later-in-life experiences of education. The first series made everyone sit up and realise Jeremy Allen White was an absolute star and it\u2019s wild we\u2019ve been messing around with Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet so long when we already had him, and I hope the same happens for Ayo Edebiri this year, because I don\u2019t think anyone on Earth right now is acting at a level where \u201cmoving your mouth into three different shapes and not saying anything\u201d conveys quite as much as she is conveying. I needed this. I really needed this. Right: back to watching Vince Vaughn say something unconvincing to a room full of gangsters for six more hours, to absolve myself of my various sins.

Costing \u00a3579 ($599), it offers top-phone specs for a mid-range price. After the success of its first handset, the Phone 1 last year, Nothing has stuck with its unique design, which takes the classic metal and glass slab of most mobiles and livens them up with a transparent back that exposes a series of LED strips. From the front it looks like most premium phones with a bright, good-looking and smooth 6.7in OLED screen. The aluminium sides are reminiscent of the iPhone 12, but the back glass has a gentle curve to it at the edges, which feels more premium compared with Phone 1. The array of LEDs on the back can be used for more functions than on the Phone 1, and you are now able to adjust brightness automatically and light up in more complex patterns. One strip can be used as a visual countdown timer, another shows charge status and there is even the ability to show progress for activities in third-party apps, but this is now limited to rides in Uber. You can set various flash patterns for different calls and notifications, with the ability to set them to light up continuously for your most important alerts. There are lots of ring and notification patterns included, but you can easily compose some yourself, which is fun. The new device will go on sale in the US, as well as the UK and Europe \u2013 a first for the company. Specifications Screen: 6.7in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (394ppi) Processor: Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 RAM: 8 or 12GB Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: Nothing OS 2.0 (Android 13) Camera: 50MP main and ultrawide, 32MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSS Water resistance: IP54 (splash-resistant) Dimensions: 162.1 x 76.4 x 8.6mm Weight: 201.2g Year-old but top-end chip The Phone 2 has a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip, which is Qualcomm\u2019s top model from last year but has since been replaced. That makes it slightly slower than this year\u2019s fastest phones, but quicker than Google\u2019s Pixel 7 and 80% faster than the Phone 1. The phone is responsive and feels slick. Its battery life is solid, lasting a good 40 hours between charges including five hours of active screen use and four hours on 5G. That is longer than Google\u2019s rival phones of a similar price, but you will still have to charge it every day and a half. Sustainability Nothing says the battery maintains at least 80% of its original capacity for at least 1,000 full charge cycles. The Phone 1 is generally repairable in the UK and the battery is replaceable for about \u00a328 plus labour and shipping by Nothing. The device is made of recycled aluminium, copper, plastic, steel, tin and other materials accounting for 20% of the phone\u2019s weight. It has a carbon footprint of 53.45kg CO2 equivalent. The company publishes sustainability reports. Nothing OS 2.0 Nothing\u2019s take on Android 13 is an interesting mix of clutter-free software with some interesting quirks, compared with most phones. It works like any other with gesture navigation, Google Feed and other standard Android bits. But Nothing has added options to make folders of apps bigger, with one-tap access to some of the apps within them. There are four folder designs to choose from including one with just a cover picture of an emoji. You can have standard small folders too, but the large almost widget-like folders are surprisingly fun and useful. You can also put any of the quick settings that are usually in the notification shade as different-sized widgets on the home or lockscreen, which is equally useful. The phone has a theme that turns everything monochrome, including most third-party apps with a few red colour accents here and there. Like the lights on the back of the phone, these little fun additions just add a bit of novelty to the very samey phone experience of competitors, but without fundamentally altering how Android works. Disappointingly, Nothing will only support the Phone 2 with three years of Android updates and four years of bimonthly security fixes from release, which is at least a year short of the best and is no longer up to standard. Camera The Phone 2 has a similar camera set up to the Phone 1 with two 50-megapixel cameras on the back and a 32MP selfie camera in the screen. Images captured by all the cameras are generally improved over the phone\u2019s predecessor. The main camera shoots good, well-balanced images in bright light as does the wide-angle camera. But as with the Phone 1, photos lack sharpness and detail when viewed at full size, with obvious blurring of moving objects and too much smoothing in more difficult lighting conditions. The phone has no telephoto camera and the digital zoom leaves a lot to be desired. Video recording was solid for the money with a few fun features to play with including slo-mo up to 480 frames a second. The Phone 2 produces generally good images but can\u2019t compete with Google\u2019s cheaper Pixel 7. Price The Nothing Phone 2 starts at \u00a3579 ($599) with 8GB of RAM and 128GB in store on 17 July. For comparison, the Phone 1 costs \u00a3399, the OnePlus 11 costs \u00a3729, the Google Pixel 7 costs \u00a3499, the Samsung Galaxy S23+ costs \u00a3899 and the iPhone 14 Plus costs \u00a3949. Verdict The Phone 2 is a solid update on its predecessor but does not change the core formula of the device. It feels more premium while containing more recycled materials. It has more advanced lights, a significantly faster chip and solid battery life, while continuing to undercut much of the competition on price. It is the novel design across the LED-strewn back and software that is the main draw. There is something very attractive about being a bit different without ruining usability. The Phone 2 ships with an older chip than its rivals, which may not matter to most, and cannot match the competition on camera. But its biggest weakness is software support \u2014 four years of updates from release is simply not good enough anymore, losing it a star. Pros: novel back and light design, great screen, good performance and battery life, recycled aluminium, slick Android 13 software, premium feel but competitively priced. Cons: camera only so-so with no optical zoom, only four years of security updates, only splash-resistant, undercut by chief rival Google."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b31", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/14/councillors-support-ltns-election-impact-research", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pro-LTN councillors do not suffer at ballot box, research suggests", "lead": "Voicing support for traffic schemes has no statistically significant effect on re-election chances, study finds", "author": "Peter Walker Deputy political editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 06:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097657", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce755fe671e0797aae4c3d29140346f3204a6e5/0_279_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "Councillors who publicly declare support for low-traffic neighbourhoods do not suffer at the polls as a result, research suggests, indicating that the schemes might not be as politically divisive as is often believed.

Last week, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, said councils should consider scrapping some LTNs, describing them as schemes that are \u201cmaking it difficult for motorists\u201d. The research, conducted by the Active Travel Academy at the University of Westminster, found that while the majority of councillors did not tweet about LTNs, there was no statistically significant impact on the chances of re-election or vote share of those who did. This seemed to be the case whether it involved Conservatives expressing negative views about the schemes or Labour councillors being more supportive. The study, commissioned by the climate campaign group Possible, used the London elections, in which 80 LTNs \u2013 local schemes that use planters, bollards or cameras to stop direct through-traffic for motor vehicles in some residential streets, while maintaining access for pedestrians and cyclists \u2013 had been installed between March 2020 and May 2022. Of the 32 councils, 18 had LTNs installed, amounting to 631 incumbent councillors, about three-quarters of whom were active on Twitter, a broadly similar proportion for Labour and Conservatives. Just 134 councillors tweeted about LTNs, about a fifth of the total seeking re-election, seen by the researchers as a likely sign of the perceived controversy of the debate. Of those who tweeted, the median number was three \u2013 with one councillor managing 135 missives on the subject. Using an analysis of the sentiments of the tweets, just under 88% of those from Tory councillors were seen as negative, with none positive. For Labour councillors, just under 82% were positive and the remainder neutral, with the figures for Lib Dems \u2013 a much smaller dataset of 77 tweets \u2013 broadly split. Using a complex analysis that adjusted for boundary changes between the 2018 and 2022 elections, and took into account demographic factors, the researchers said they were unable to find any statistically significant impact of tweeting on LTNs for councillors\u2019 chances of re-election or change in their vote share. What effect there was appeared to be slightly positive for Labour councillors, the authors said. They wrote: \u201cDespite the noise on social media, protests on the street and countless articles about the polarising, divisive or simply unpopular nature of LTNs, there is little evidence here to suggest that there are significant electoral consequences.\u201d The report stressed significant caveats, including the possibility that councillors who chose to tweet about LTNs did so because they believed the schemes were popular, or were already confident of re-election."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b32", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/14/camaraderie-love-affection-migration-making-of-nhs", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Camaraderie, love and affection\u2019: migration and the making of the NHS \u2013 a photo essay", "lead": "Heart of the Nation: migration and the making of the NHS is a touring exhibition by the Migration Museum to mark the service\u2019s 75th anniversary and celebrate the crucial role of its international workers", "author": "Christian Sinibaldi", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 06:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097674", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b1ca2eeaf580ac975e02eaed21fc987ce8e4ff38/518_1250_6901_4142/500.jpg", "body": "Since its creation in 1948, people have come to Britain from all over the world to work in the NHS. Today, about one in six people working in the NHS are non-British and many others are the children and grandchildren of migrant healthcare workers. Without its international workers, the NHS would not have become the institution it is today but their crucial role has largely been ignored. Heart of the Nation is an immersive multimedia exhibition which asks: who are the people who care for us? And do we care enough? The exhibition features personal stories contributed by NHS workers from the 1940s to the present day, brought to life through photography, film, oral histories, singing and storytelling. The exhibition is on at Leicester Museum and Art Gallery until 29 October \u2013 the first leg of a national tour. Future locations include Leeds and London.

The British Council were there to receive us and send us to our hospitals. I was homesick, but before I came, my Auntie said I would never complete my course because I had never done any work. And that upset me a lot. She always looked down upon my father for being poor. I was so determined to prove to her that I was not stupid, that I was not worthless. Working in the community was nice: you\u2019d see all types of people with very different lives. I never cared about status or wealth. I used to work with a GP who was gay, and he was involved in Lighthouse, where Princess Diana went. Oh I loved all the Aids patients. At the time a lot of people wouldn\u2019t nurse them. A lot of them were very scared, they wouldn\u2019t go in. To me, they didn\u2019t ask for the virus: it was just there and they needed to be cared for. After my nurse training, I went on to become a midwife and a staff nurse before working at the Western Ophthalmic, the Chelsea hospital in gynaecology, and eventually in the community. I\u2019m glad my children and grandchildren grew up here and that they can accommodate eastern and western culture. That helps in life, wherever you go, to adapt to any situation. Because if you aren\u2019t flexible, your life will be very miserable.\u201d Allyson Williams MBE Arrived in 1969 from Trinidad | Retired midwife \u201cI came to London in May 1969 from Trinidad to train as a nurse at the Whittington hospital in Highgate. To get over the loneliness, I met up with the friends in my set as often as I could. This was usually in the dining room at meal times. The food was full of carbs and very heavy but we had no choice but to eat it. As a result, we all put on loads of weight in a short space of time. I always made sure I was invited out. We went to house parties in places like Wood Green, Tottenham, Golders Green, Brixton and Croydon. When we worked late on Saturday night and early on Sunday morning, we still went out. We would party all night and return to the nurses home about 6am, shower and then go on duty for 7am. No one prepared you for how the patients were going to treat you. They\u2019d slap your hand away and say, \u2018Don\u2019t touch me, your black is going to rub off on me.\u2019 One day I stood up in the ward and said, \u2018I know I am black. I have been black for 21 years. So tell me something I don\u2019t know.\u2019 And there was silence.\u201d Dr Aye Aye Myint and Gordon Paw Dr Patricia Aye Aye Myint and Gordon Paw | Arrived in 1989 from Yangon, Myanmar | doctor and nurse, Lancashire and Newcastle/Sunderland Gordon is a retired mental health nurse from Hopewood Park, Sunderland; Pat works as a consultant psychiatrist in old-age psychiatry at Bensham hospital in Gateshead. \u201cWe both came to the UK for postgraduate studies and chose the NHS for its proud history of providing healthcare from \u2018the cradle to the grave\u2019. We made our own decision to come to the UK after the events of 8/8/88 in Rangoon, for our children to have a better life. We both chose psychiatry and Pat passed the PLab exam and the Royal College of Psychiatry exams to work as a psychiatrist. Gordon trained as a mental health nurse for three years. We weren\u2019t scared of leaving home, but we missed our family terribly. Pat came alone first to work as a junior doctor in Burnley, and Gordon followed with our sons a year later. We always thought we could speak English but discovered we could not always understand the different regional accents. The English culture is easier to adopt and we\u2019ve grown to enjoy rituals like tea breaks, fish and chips, and summer time with strawberries and cream. Also the kindness and understanding of colleagues who helped us adapt to living and working in England and the NHS. The hardest to adapt to professionally were the tea breaks, which couldn\u2019t be interrupted even if a patient needed something done, and the slowing down of services around holidays and school half-terms. The grey, cloudy weather was also difficult, as was having to wear layers of clothing when going out. The values we held on to were having Burmese family meals together and maintaining our Baptist faith. We love to help patients and to work with great teams. The hardest moments are when we lose someone we\u2019ve been helping or when our best efforts were not good enough to help a patient regain their mental health.\u201d Dr Arnab Seal and Dr Sunita Seal Dr Arnab Seal, consultant community paediatrician, Leeds community healthcare NHS trust | recently retired; Dr Sunita Seal, consultant neonatologist, Bradford teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust | recently retired | arrived in 1992 from India \u201cThe first thing that struck my wife and I when we arrived was how quiet it was. We were staying in a small village north of Darlington and it was very rural; we didn\u2019t see anybody on the streets or hear any noise. It was also cold. The house had log and gas fires, but no central heating. The cold and damp came as a shock! Racism was really overt back then. We\u2019d caught a bus from London Victoria to Darlington and arrived around 11pm. While we were waiting to be picked up by our friends at the bus stop, a group of lads were walking down the street, smashing shop windows. As they passed us, they shouted abusive, racist language and threatened us, saying: \u2018Remember, you saw nothing!\u2019 Thankfully, they didn\u2019t do anything to us, but it wasn\u2019t a great start to our time in the UK. Society is very different now, but there\u2019s still some way to go. Following our exams, I got a job in Rochdale, at Birch Hill hospital. My wife got a job down in Exeter. Everyone within the NHS was so kind to us and so polite: they would use \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 several times in the same sentence. I did struggle with the Rochdale accent, but everyone was so helpful. Other than getting used to accents, we didn\u2019t really have any struggles. Mostly, we had to get used to processes and how things were done in the UK. Overt racism in the NHS in the 1990s was not uncommon. There would be families where the parents or grandparents would swear at us or tell us not to touch their children. \u2018Paki\u2019 was a common derogatory term used to refer to anyone of Asian heritage. Thankfully times have changed. Back then we\u2019d walk off and get someone else to treat them. While overt racism is no more, there is still the issue of bias that needs to be addressed. However, the vast majority of colleagues are extremely distressed if they witness any racist incidents and are very supportive of co-workers who have migrated to the UK to join the NHS: the camaraderie, love and affection across the staff is incredible.\u201d Dimov family Prof Dr Galina Velikova-Dimova, professor in psychosocial and medical oncology | Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust Dr Doytchin Dimov, consultant physician, respiratory disease | Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust | Arrived in 1995 from Bulgaria Michael Dimov, head of community health improvement, NHS England | Arrived in 2004 from Bulgaria via New Zealand Stefanie Dimov, senior project manager | outpatients transformation programme, NHS England Tsanko Dimov, senior implementation manager | Greener NHS, NHS England \u201cMy wife, Donia, and I had left Bulgaria with our young son Tsanko in 1995 to settle in New Zealand where we lived for nine years and where our daughter Stefanie was born. I had studied speech-language therapy and psychology at the University of Sofia and joined a neuro-rehabilitation centre in Hawke\u2019s Bay, New Zealand, before developing my career in the New Zealand health system and later on studying health service management at Massey University. We moved to the UK in 2004. My brother Doytchin and his wife, Galina, both physicians, had moved to the UK from Bulgaria a few years earlier. We had all been attracted by the professional opportunities in the UK and the NHS was a natural choice. My wife and I were also excited by the prospect of being closer to family in the UK and Bulgaria, and to Europe. I arrived in the UK under the highly skilled migrant programme, while my brother and sister-in-law had arrived earlier via a different route \u2013 Galina on a grant from the EU Tempus programme. They both started their careers in the NHS on the Royal College of Physicians programme for specialist training for visiting doctors. We had to leave our home in Christchurch, New Zealand, which we loved, and all our possessions, to move to the UK without guaranteed jobs and with a \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d stamp in our passports. My wife and children left a bit earlier and stayed at our parents\u2019 home in Bulgaria, while I finalised our departure from New Zealand and followed them to Bulgaria. We then came to the UK, without the kids, to find jobs and a home. It helped that we could stay initially at my brother\u2019s home in Leeds. My wife, the children and myself ended up being separated for about six months, which we all found very difficult as we hadn\u2019t been apart for more than a few days until then. My children Tsanko [31] and Stefanie [27] have now joined the NHS family. My daughter, who was eight at the time we moved, remembers a feeling of happiness for our family being back together and learning to understand that our lives weren\u2019t going to be the same as they were in New Zealand. People\u2019s politeness and kindness, country walks and Sunday pub lunches come up high on the list of easiest things to adapt to for all of us. My brother remembers people being too polite to express disagreement in a conversation, making it difficult to navigate interactions. There is also certain formality and order in social and family relations here that took a bit longer to get used to \u2013 the need to book a get-together with your friends weeks, if not months, in advance. We all feel grateful and humbled to be part of such a great institution. I feel privileged to have been able to work in different roles and in many NHS organisations, delivering direct care to patients and planning or coordinating important aspects of the way the NHS operates. My son, daughter and I all feel excited and motivated for being involved in the development and implementation of key policies and improvements transforming the NHS and the way care is delivered, making it more responsive, efficient and sustainable. Jessica Anne Filoteo Arrived in 2014 from the Philippines | Cardiac cath lab sister, St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital \u201cWhen I was in my 20s, I read the book Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert. She talked about her travels in Italy in such detail, by the time I finished reading it I decided I wanted to travel around Europe and experience their culture, and the best way for me to do that was to work and live in the UK. I didn\u2019t have any idea what the NHS was, but I was advised by colleagues to read up on it because I would be asked about it in my interview. At that point, it didn\u2019t really matter to me where I worked in the UK as long as I got to step on English soil. It was only when I started working here that I came to understand what the NHS stood for. Moving to the UK from the Philippines was relatively easy. A recruitment agency from the UK worked closely with one based in the Philippines and handled much of the logistics. I was one of the first cohort of Filipino nurses hired by Lewisham and Greenwich NHS trust. They sponsored my visa and shouldered some of my expenses moving to the UK, which later on were deducted from my salary throughout my first year with the trust. Leaving home and moving halfway across the world was one of the most terrifying, yet exciting, things I\u2019ve done. The first few months were definitely challenging. We arrived at the start of winter, so that may have been my first experience with winter blues. It was cold and grey, and it took a while for me to find the people I would eventually call my second family, so there were definitely some moments of loneliness. It was especially hard when I missed out on special occasions like Christmas and birthdays. I\u2019ve settled in very well, but I do find that on days when I get sick, I couldn\u2019t help but wish I had my mum around to make me soup and make a fuss over me! I never wanted to be a nurse but looking back at my journey, it was probably one of the best decisions I have ever made. Leaving the comforts of home and spending years as a nurse in the NHS \u2013 with all its ups and downs \u2013 has definitely moulded me into the kind of person I could only ever dream of becoming. Sometimes I can\u2019t help but look back on how much I have grown as a nurse, and as a person. I think about that shy, timid, and terrified girl about to board the plane and I want to tell her: \u2018Girl, get ready for the biggest adventure of your life!\u2019 Ironically, working during Covid and getting through it is something I am really proud of, and makes me feel like I have done my fair share of good in the world. The resilience of the staff I have worked with, the kindness and admiration strangers have shown me when they found out I\u2019m a nurse, the strength and compassion I\u2019ve managed to find deep in myself \u2013 all these remind me that there is a silver lining in every dark cloud.\u201d Precious Joy James Staff nurse at Royal Brompton hospital under the heart and lung critical care division of Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust | Arrived in 2022 from Nigeria \u201cI felt strongly that it was the right time to move abroad and broaden my horizons. I had some reservations about being so far from home alone, but was deeply convinced it was the right decision, and I relied on God\u2019s direction the entire way. In addition, my confidence was made stronger by the support and encouragement I got from my loved ones and family. I chose the NHS because I\u2019ve always believed that people deserve equal access to healthcare services \u2013 and the NHS actualises that. I wanted to make my parents proud by doing something that would bring them joy \u2013 a national service does just that. Working for the NHS has been a rollercoaster of highs and occasional lows, but the overall experience has exceeded my expectations. The staff, my manager, the support system, and patients have all been incredibly gracious, creating an environment where I have thrived. My current place of practice has given me some of the most fulfilling days in my career as a nurse. I know there are a thousand and one rooms for improvements within the NHS, but it\u2019s also important to recognise that this system is a blessing to millions of people who continue to benefit from it one way or another.\u201d Photography by Christian Sinibaldi"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b33", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/14/post-your-questions-for-mark-gatiss", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Post your questions for Mark Gatiss", "lead": "What does Mycroft actually do in the government?

It consists of a wide, three-mile long sandy stretch from Barricane Beach down to Baggy Point, but dogs are restricted in certain areas. Parts of it are surfing areas and some kiosks even offered boards and lessons for dogs, though I didn\u2019t want to embarrass Bob and Bertrand \u2013 our lovely Beagles \u2013 by insisting they try. Other pet owners were not so bashful. There are lots of dog bins and the cafes have bowls of water for four-legged friends. The Barricane Beach cafe is run by animal lovers, has great coffee and great-value curry nights. Gayle Break for the border (collie), Highlands Oban is a true doggie delight. We stayed a night there with our lovely Evie, a border collie. At the Lorne Bar dogs are not only welcome, but they have their own menu! After local walks and a stroll through the harbour, which Evie found had a lot of interesting smells, we popped in for a drink and a bite. Dog options include sausages and butchers\u2019 dry food and can be accompanied by Belgium doggy beer or \u201cpaw\u201d secco (0% alcohol). Evie opted for the sausages and found there was even more to enjoy in the town than her morning walk by the harbour, with all its interesting smells, suggested. Hannah Kay Walkies on the beach, Ceredigion The coastal walk between the beautiful beaches of Aberporth to Tresaith, west Wales is spectacular. Both beaches allow dogs without restrictions between September and May, but in summer there are some areas of sand where they are not permitted. Both beaches have soft golden sand, beautiful views and, often, sightings of dolphins \u2013 the largest population in Europe. Tresaith is home to a waterfall where the River Saith flows over the cliff top. Many pubs and restaurants in Ceredigion are dog-friendly and we\u2019d recommend The Ship Inn, Tresaith, which has a terrace with panoramic views, and the Driftwood Cafe, Aberporth, which has treats for furry ones. Sinead Evans Panting on the peninsula, Argyll and Bute Stonefield Castle Hotel, near Tarbert on the shore of Loch Fyne, was everything we wished for \u2013 dogs are made very welcome and there are 24 hectares (60 acres) of woodland gardens to explore. Our room had a stunning view of the loch and a full Scottish breakfast set us up for a day spent exploring the Kintyre peninsula. At night we relaxed in the bar, where it\u2019s OK for dogs to eat too \u2013 we all thought the food was delicious! Susanna C Beach walking in Cornwall We try to take our dog Tito for a break straight after our summer holidays, to say sorry for leaving him at home. The best so far has been Porthcurno, Cornwall. A fantastic, dog-friendly beach in a bay you have to clamber down to, with spectacular cliff walks. There\u2019s also the Museum of Global Communications, which allows dogs, and the Minack theatre, where dogs can visit on the lead when a show\u2019s not on. He had a great time. Julie Canines at Camber, East Sussex Jeakes\u2019 House in Rye, East Sussex is a beautiful 17th-century house set on a cobbled street right in the centre of town, and round the corner from Lamb House, which was home to novelist Henry James in the early 20th century. It has an interesting history and has hosted guests such as social reformer Elizabeth Fry and poet TS Eliot. Dogs are welcomed and will thoroughly enjoy romping around the nearby Camber Sands. The layout is charmingly labyrinthine, the food is wonderful and the well-stocked honesty bar is an unexpected delight. Lindsay Hound Tor, Dartmoor Staying at the Mill End Hotel, with its dog-friendly rooms, is a delight for us and pooch. The River Teign is magical, with a wooded path, great for spotting dippers, kingfishers and labradors. The hotel has a boot room with towels and doggie treats. We have been many times and highly recommend it, and of course every dog owner has to make a beeline for Hound Tor. Sharon Lewis Pods for pooches, Cumbria While most of the Lake District is heaving with tourists, there are some lesser-known parts towards the south which are fantastic for a dog-friendly holiday. The vast expanse of Haverigg beach is spectacular for dogs (but keep them on the lead near the RSPB Hodbarrow reserve); along the coastline there are a number of secluded beaches (often completely empty) where responsible dog owners can let their pets run freely. We have stayed in dog-friendly Harbour Lights\u2019 glamping pods (standard pod \u00a368 per night, sleeps four) and can attest to their comfort and cleanliness \u2013 there\u2019s also a family-run ice cream parlour on site. Laura Garry Bay of dogs, Gower, near Swansea The Gower Peninsula is a perfect place for dogs and dog owners. The coastal path from the Mumbles, near Swansea, has wide open trails with green grass and fresh air where you can let your four-legged friends run around, before heading down to huge beaches like Three Cliffs Bay for a final bit of exercise or chilling out time \u2013 for your mutts and you. Further west, in Pembrokeshire, the town of Tenby is a pretty, dog-friendly place, I\u2019ve found. The late afternoon is like promenade time for pooches. Stroll around the warren of streets with an ice-cream with the dog on a lead, before unleashing it on the South Beach for a swim in the sea to end the day. Check Swansea council\u2019s list of dog-friendly beaches on the Gower, and those where dogs are not permitted. In Tenby, dogs are not permitted on several beaches during the summer Neil Winning tip: Muddy mutts, near Glasgow For a prized canine experience that\u2019s just as good for humans, look no further than Mugdock country park (free entry). With 270 hectares (666 acres) of open countryside, crisscrossing paths and an \u201caway from it all\u201d feel, it\u2019s a treasured resource. Whether they\u2019re chasing smells in the woods, getting muddy in streams or making friends in the outdoor cafe area, there\u2019s plenty of dog entertainments and space to enjoy them. For everyone else, there are ruined castles, a loch, picnic spots and nature. Just 10 miles north of Glasgow, with car parking and a visitor centre, it\u2019s an oasis for everyone. Dog owners are asked to keep their animals on the lead in certain areas of the park.

When she was 17, Lapthorn coached Pearce to the verge of French Open glory. But injury ended her career \u2013 although suspicion lingered that there was more to her premature departure than that. When Pearce learns that Lapthorn is re-entering her life, a tale of alleged abuse unfolds. Both leads do a fine job of communicating the confusion and trauma of gaslighting and exploitation. Prime Video, from Friday 21 July *** Kohrra This Indian thriller features a few tropes reasonably familiar to viewers of crime procedurals the world over: two cops with turbulent private lives and unorthodox methods must battle intransigent superiors to get to the bottom of a murder. The victim is a bridegroom, killed in the Punjab countryside just days before his wedding. A little digging reveals that he lived abroad and the marriage was arranged \u2026 This is far from a mould-breaking drama, but is a decent, if melodramatic, slice of mystery. Suvinder Vicky and Barun Sobti star. Netflix, out now *** Unknown: Cave of Bones A documentary exploring what is believed to be the world\u2019s oldest graveyard in South Africa. But the bones found are not human \u2013 which implies that, long before human beings established burial rituals, other ape-like creatures may have been doing something similar. Clearly, this discovery has huge implications for evolutionary theory and our understanding of animal behaviour. Paleoanthropologist Lee Berger does the digging, undertaking considerable physical discomfort to venture into a cave hardly ever penetrated by humans. Netflix, from Monday 17 July *** Dave On the face of it, things have changed for Dave Burd, AKA Lil Dicky. Once he was just a fantasist, dreaming, ridiculously, of making it in the rap game. But as series three of this eccentric comedy arrives, he\u2019s living the dream and touring the US. He\u2019s still the same messed-up loser, though, and the show\u2019s tension \u2013 and intrigue \u2013 thrives in the gap between Dave\u2019s self-image and reality. The show overflows with gross-out humour but its critique of privilege feels increasingly pointed \u2013 Lil Dicky remains a goof who somehow gets what he wants. Disney+, from Wednesday 19 July *** Sweet Magnolias Time to break out the margaritas as this cheerful, undemanding series about female friendship in smalltown America (it\u2019s appropriately set in a place called Serenity) returns for a third season.

The about-face comes two days after the ABC initially abandoned its public interest defence when ordered to reveal a confidential source. Justice Michael Lee said on Friday that to describe the proceedings as \u201cunusual would be an understatement\u201d as he set the trial for later this month. \u201cThis is developing into a bit of a farce,\u201d Lee said as barristers for Russell and the ABC argued over whether the public broadcaster had to reveal a confidential source. The judge said: \u201cThis is a highly unusual case given the amount of information that has already been disclosed by the ABC concerning the identity of the source.\u201d Lee suggested the ABC should continue its public interest defence because Russell\u2019s legal team had revealed they already knew the identity of the broadcaster\u2019s confidential source. \u201cI am no longer satisfied it is necessary for the ABC to be compelled to provide information as to the source in order to allow the trial to be conducted fairly from the perspective of Mr Russell,\u201d Lee said. Nicholas Owens SC, for the ABC, said investigative journalist Mark Willacy would under no circumstances reveal the name of his source and would rather go to jail. The question of whether the source, known as Josh, was confidential was debatable because the ABC used a photograph of him in a report, Lee said. \u201cIf those responsible for publication of \u2018Josh\u2019s\u2019 photograph within the ABC thought there was substance in \u2018Josh\u2019s\u2019 fears of retribution, they must have assumed his potential assailants were a somewhat incurious and lazy lot,\u201d Lee said at an earlier hearing. The ABC maintains Josh is not identifiable by his photograph because he has no digital footprint. Sue Chrysanthou SC, for Russell, accused the ABC of running \u201ca disgraceful publicity campaign\u201d after the broadcaster put out a media release after Wednesday\u2019s hearing. In the media release, the ABC\u2019s director of news, Justin Stevens, said commitments by journalists to sources ensured journalists retained the ongoing trust of people speaking truth to power. \u201cWe wanted the opportunity to defend our journalism in court,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHowever, a greater principle is now at stake \u2013 our ethical responsibility to honour the promise protecting the name of our source. \u201cMark Willacy and the ABC\u2019s award-winning investigations team are experienced journalists with a strong track record of reporting on matters of public interest and the ABC supports them upholding their obligations to their sources.\u201d The federal court found at an interim hearing in February that a series of articles by the ABC had conveyed several defamatory meanings, including linking Russell to war crimes and alleging he left \u201cfire and bodies\u201d in his wake during his service in Afghanistan. Lee found the ABC articles also conveyed that Russell was \u201cthe subject of an active criminal investigation into his conduct as a commando in Afghanistan\u201d and \u201creasonably suspected \u2026 of committing a crime or crimes when he was a commando in Afghanistan\u201d. The ABC responded by stating it would argue a truth defence and that it had acted in the public interest. Russell, a former major in the Australian special forces who served four tours of Afghanistan, has consistently denied all wrongdoing and allegations against him including that he was the subject of a formal investigation. The trial is scheduled to begin on 28 July."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b37", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/14/hollywood-actors-strike-australian-film-tv-workers-stood-down", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hollywood actors strike: hundreds of Australian film and TV workers to be stood down ", "lead": "At least two feature films being shot on the Gold Coast expected to halt production for the duration of the SAG-AFTRA strike", "author": "Kelly Burke", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:43:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097764", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/302d4e1798c78451338bb02f5019333db0b86e15/0_188_5365_3221/500.jpg", "body": "Hundreds of Australian workers are likely to be stood down from film productions as as result of the strike by Hollywood actors and screenwriters. Screen Producers Australia confirmed on Friday Australian cast and crew working on US-backed television series and films were expected to be stood down for the duration of the strike, which begins at 5.01pm AEST. The union representing Australian screen workers signalled its support for the US strike but warned its members they would not be protected if they took similar industrial action. Screen workers on foreign-backed documentaries, light entertainment and reality shows will not be affected. Members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) voted to go on strike after negotiations with Hollywood studios broke down on Wednesday. It is the first time in more than 60 years both sectors of the US film industry have walked off the set in unison. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In a statement on Friday the chief executive of Australia\u2019s Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance (MEAA), Erin Madeley, said the union stood in solidarity with SAG-AFTRA members. Fair compensation from streaming services and concerns by actors over artificial intelligence replacing jobs were universal, she said. \u201cStreaming services are raking in billions of dollars in revenue and earnings as their audiences continue to grow, but these profits are not being shared fairly with actors,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cAlthough series budgets are increasing, that increase is not being reflected in the share of the money going to performers.\u201d Under current US arrangements, streaming services pay lower residuals to actors for repeats of films and television series than broadcast television. In Australia, the MEAA negotiated residual rights for actors in 2015, but payments can vary according to each production\u2019s contracts, across both streaming and TV broadcast platforms. Madeley said rules covering the global screen industry were also needed to regulate the future potential use of artificial intelligence to replace actors. \u201cWe don\u2019t want robots telling our stories in place of humans,\u201d she said. Australian screenwriters are in an even more disadvantageous position than their American counterparts. Claire Pullen, the executive director of the Australian Writers\u2019 Guild (AWG), said streaming services pay no residuals or royalties to Australian screenwriters. \u201cThese agreements are essentially about having an ongoing relationship with your own work, but in Australia, once a streaming service pays for a work, that\u2019s it,\u201d Pullen said. \u201cHere in Australia, the streamers do not offer contracts unless you fully assign them all the rights.\u201d Pullen said although the AWG supported the action taken by the WGA, it was unlikely Australian screenwriters would strike in solidarity as the guild was not entering a period of renegotiation with the screen industry. At least two feature films were set to halt production on Friday \u2013 the Warner Bros martial arts fantasy film Mortal Kombat 2 and the Universal Studios drama based on the Liane Moriarty novel Apples Never Fall, starring Sam Neill and Annette Bening. Both have been shooting on the Gold Coast. Warner Bros and Universal Studios have been approached for comment. Next month\u2019s Melbourne international film festival may also be affected, with a spokesperson saying management was \u201cworking through the sensitivities and obligations of attending guests\u201d. The WGA strike, which began in early May, has already caused the cancellation of the remake of the 1927 Fritz Lang classic Metropolis. The Apple TV eight-part series was supposed to begin filming in Melbourne\u2019s Docklands studios in October. According to the Hollywood news site Deadline, the series was expected to create almost 4,000 jobs in Victoria. Screen Producers Australia said in a statement on Friday Australian-scripted productions using Australian and imported SAG members would not be affected by the strike order if they were engaged under Australian industry contracts agreed to by SAG-AFTRA and the MEAA."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b38", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/first-edition-rishi-sunak-public-sector-pay", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Friday briefing: Rishi Sunak offers a new pay deal to the public sector \u2013 but will it end the dispute?", "lead": "In today\u2019s newsletter: The prime minister has accepted independent pay recommendations after months of strike action \u2013 here\u2019s what he announced", "author": "Nimo Omer", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:40:51", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097781", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/618503e33875d005c62be810b202c860c85ae03e/0_43_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning. It feels like the dispute between workers in the public sector and the government has been going on forever, with fraught negotiations and industrial action now commonplace in many industries. Yesterday, Rishi Sunak decided that it had gone on long enough. The prime minister announced that the government will accept, in full, the recommendations made by various independent pay review bodies for 2023-24. Sunak laid out how much each sector would be receiving and why the government would not be borrowing any money to fund the rises, which will be around 6% depending on the sector, with the money diverted from existing public service budgets. Call off the strikes, he told the unions: this is the final offer. However, Sunak\u2019s words have fallen on deaf ears, with the British Medical Association today starting its second day of a planned five-day walk out \u2013 the longest in NHS history. Junior doctors are asking for their pay to be increased by 35%. This headline figure may seem startlingly high, especially compared to what other sectors have been asking for, but to the BMA this is not a pay rise, it is pay restoration after years of wage erosion. The government\u2019s offer of 6% for NHS doctors is unlikely to satisfy aggrieved workers who are exhausted and angry. It is not in the government\u2019s interests for workers to continue striking, with record backlogs that have only increased since Rishi Sunak pledged to bring them down and a looming general election. However, indefinite striking too seems an unsustainable option, especially if the government is serious about leaving the negotiating table. In today\u2019s newsletter I take a look at what these pay rises could mean for millions of public sector workers. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories BBC | Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK has offered tens of thousands of pounds to the parents who made allegations about Huw Edwards, in return for a television interview, according to sources at the media company. The Guardian understands that an interview with the couple has been recorded and is being edited for broadcast on TalkTV, the sister station of the Sun. Hollywood | Hollywood actors are set to go on strike on Friday. The move, after a decision by the Sag-Aftra union, represents the first time in over 60 years that both writers and actors will strike simultaneously and is expected to bring a halt to the majority of Hollywood\u2019s film and TV production. China | The UK\u2019s approach to a \u201cwhole of state\u201d assault by the Chinese government on its economy, politics, civil infrastructure and academia is completely inadequate, an influential parliamentary committee has found. Education | The school at the centre of a row over whether a student identified as a cat has been given the all-clear after a snap Ofsted inspection. Rye College, in Sussex, was investigated on the request of the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch. Health | NHS dental services are not fit for purpose and need urgent reform, according to MPs who have warned that people are resorting to DIY treatment using pliers. In depth: What junior doctors, teachers, police officers and more have been offered Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt were reportedly making decisions down to the wire yesterday, before the prime minister made the announcement that millions of public sector workers would receive a new pay rise. The figures are: \u2022 Armed forces \u2013 5%, plus a \u00a31,000 one-off payment \u2022 NHS \u2013 6% \u2022 Junior doctors \u2013 6%, plus a \u00a31,250 one-off payment \u2022 Teachers \u2013 6.5% \u2022 Prison officers \u2013 7% \u2022 Police \u2013 7% While the pay rises are more than the government wanted to give, they are still significantly below inflation (currently at 8.7%) and do not account for most civil servants. So, is it enough to quell the appetite for more industrial action? *** Re-prioritising funds The pay rises, Sunak said, would cost the government billions of pounds more than they had budgeted for, but the Treasury has stressed that the money will not be coming from borrowing or increased taxes. Borrowing, Sunak said, would exacerbate already high inflation. Instead, the pay rises would be paid for through existing departmental budgets. The news that no new money will be raised has set off alarm bells from unions, who are concerned that this will lead to cuts in their already hamstrung sectors. Sunak insisted that there would be no cuts, and that departments would instead \u201creprioritise\u201d spending to help cover the pay increases \u2013 but it is unclear how this differs from cutting funding to certain parts of their budgets. The education unions have said that they have received assurances that \u201cfrontline\u201d school services would not be affected or cut, but no other union has had such guarantees. In his press conference, Sunak also said that about \u00a31bn will come from higher visa fees and an increase in the NHS surcharge, but this is only a fraction of the amount that the government needs to cover the costs of the total pay rise. *** The response All of the teaching unions have said that they will be recommending that their members accept this pay rise. They said that 6.5% \u201crecognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession\u201d, adding that it is \u201cthe largest ever recommendation\u201d from their pay review body. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, told Sky News that the increase is a significant move, even though it is still below inflation, adding that their eight days of industrial action forced the government to reconsider their initial offer of 3.5%. The FDA trade union, representing professionals and managers in the public sector, was similarly welcoming of the government\u2019s decision to accept the recommendations of the pay review bodies, describing it as \u201cboth fair and reasonable\u201d. Other unions have not been as optimistic: the president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association said it was unlikely the prime minister\u2019s announcement would end industrial action, describing the offer as a \u201cgrandstanding PR stunt which remains scant on detail\u201d. The general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents staff from the Met Office, Health and Safety Executive, and Natural England said the government\u2019s handling of this process was \u201cchaotic\u201d and that it was \u201ctime the government recognised the value of its public services and allocated the money required to maintain them properly\u201d. And the British Medical Association rejected the deal outright, saying the pay offer \u201cfails to address\u201d years of below-inflation pay deals and that the government was \u201cdriving doctors away\u201d from the NHS. *** What\u2019s next? Sunak stressed that this was his \u201cfinal offer\u201d, and that no amount of strikes would lead to more negotiations. However, the ambiguity around how these pay rises \u2013 which remain below what many sectors would like \u2013 will be funded arguably shows that the government is missing the point. When asked by the Guardian why they were striking, junior doctors in Oxford did not just point to pay. It was also about working conditions, which will only get worse if budgets are in any way reduced. \u201cThere\u2019s no social environment. Nobody\u2019s happy to be there any more. Those days where you had to push were hard. They have become the norm,\u201d one doctor said. This \u201cdemoralising\u201d situation has created a retention crisis that has sent the NHS into a doom loop \u2013 the more people leave, the higher the work load is for those who are left, the poorer the service is for patients, which triggers more people to leave. Even if pay is temporarily settled, it is clear that the government and public sector workers still have much to negotiate.

In a child protection ruling this week, Mac Giolla Ri found that, despite the neglect and abuse Oliver had allegedly experienced while staying with his relative, he was better off living with her than in a residential care home. \u201cReturning Oliver to Ms Boland\u2019s care through the proposed contact order is a very bad option for limiting Oliver\u2019s risk of reoffending \u2026 but having Oliver in the Resicare [option] B would, in my view, be worse,\u201d Mac Giolla Ri said in the written judgment. \u201cI find that the applicant has proved that \u2026 allowing Oliver to reside with her, is better for Oliver\u2019s interests and more consistent with the principles in the [Child Protection] Act.\u201d The magistrate said he asked the director of child protection for evidence of the effectiveness of residential care for children, but was told there was no such data available. \u201cIn short, there is no data to support [the] efficacy of the model of care suggested by the director for Oliver or at all. Equally, there is no data to support the efficacy of any other model of residential care that may be available to Oliver or to any other child,\u201d Mac Giolla Ri said. The court heard Oliver was placed in residential care several hundred kilometres from his home on 7 March, after being granted bail for offences involving \u201cserious interpersonal violence\u201d. He\u2019d only been in residential care for two weeks before he was back in detention as a result of being charged with \u201cextremely serious offences\u201d, including robbery with actual violence and stealing. The magistrate said it appears Oliver allegedly \u201ccommitted these offences \u2026 because he did not like being in the town in which he was placed and preferred to return to detention\u201d. \u201cBased on what happened on the last occasion Oliver was released from detention into the care of child safety, it is highly unlikely that Oliver will stay at Resicare B and he is highly likely to commit a further offence for the purposes of being returned to detention,\u201d Mac Giolla Ri said. If Oliver was to reoffend and return to detention, he would be subject to social isolation due to staff shortages, which have resulted in detainees being locked in their cells for up to 24 hours a day, the court heard. Mac Giolla Ri said there was no other suitable placements that were available to Oliver. The child safety department will retain custody over Oliver to ensure he receives appropriate referrals for his various social and medical needs. * Not their real names"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b3a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/14/tv-tonight-the-bbc-proms-kicks-off-with-a-world-premiere", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TV tonight: the BBC Proms kicks off with a world premiere", "lead": "A new work by Ukrainian composer Bohdana Frolyak will feature at the Royal Albert Hall.

Most of the victims in the incident at the Shaabi souk on Tuesday were children and women, according to witnesses. Medical sources said the shells were fired from the Karri military base, which the army controls, during fierce fighting with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. A vegetable seller who goes to the market on most days to buy his goods wholesale said people trying to steal produce were among the victims. Food prices have risen sharply in recent months and many people living in Omdurman and its sister cities of Khartoum and Bahri have run out of money. \u201cThe majority of the victims were people who had come to loot the market,\u201d the vegetable seller said. \u201cThe market has become very dangerous, especially in the afternoon. You can just get shelled and die.\u201d Another vegetable seller said that as of Thursday some of the victims\u2019 bodies still lay uncovered, and that the bodies of children were covered only by empty boxes. Like other major Sudanese cities, much of Omdurman has come to resemble a battlefield since clashes broke out between the regular army and the RSF on 15 April, in a violent escalation of a years-long power struggle between the two main factions of the country\u2019s military regime. Roads around the market have been occupied by army snipers this week after RSF fighters withdrew from positions they had held since the start of the conflict. Last Saturday, 38 people were killed in Omdurman\u2019s Dar es Salaam neighbourhood in one of the deadliest airstrikes of the war so far, which the RSF blamed on the military. \u201cIt was early in the evening and we were sitting outside with friends when a fighter jet came over,\u201d said Mohamed, a witness who lives in Dar es Salaam and did not want to give his full name. \u201cWe saw the light and heard the explosions. Other people\u2019s houses and cars were burned.\u201d Mohamed said he knew of an entire family who were killed while sleeping on their rooftop. \u201cThe father worked selling and buying cattle, it\u2019s just so sad,\u201d he said. The neighbourhood is mostly populated by members of the Rizagat tribe, to which Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of the RSF, and many members of his core force belong. Mohamed said some of the relatives of the dead were members of the RSF. \u201cThey sometimes bring in their fighter vehicles [to the neighbourhood],\u201d he said. \u201cThis might be the reason why it was targeted. Many families have now left the area.\u201d Rizigat families from across Omdurman have fled the city since Saturday\u2019s strike. \u201cWe have to go,\u201d said one woman who was setting out for While Nile state, south of the Khartoum tri-city area. \u201cThey [the army] killed so many of our relatives. We fear getting targeted by a missile inside our houses.\u201d In a third mass casualty incident this week, a family of nine died in an airstrike that hit a mosque where they lived in Bahri on Sunday. The father worked at the mosque as a prayer caller. More than 3 million people have left the Khartoum area since the start of the war, according to the UN, equating to about 50% of the population. Those remaining are mostly unable to leave for health or financial reasons or because they hail from the volatile provinces of Kordofan or Darfur, where fighting has also been particularly fierce. On Thursday, the UN said the bodies of dozens of people allegedly killed by the RSF had been uncovered in a mass grave in West Darfur. El Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state, is now besieged by the RSF, and civilians there are struggling to access essentials. The international criminal court is investigating a surge in hostilities in the Darfur region since mid-April, including reports of killings, rapes and crimes affecting children. ICC prosecutors are \u201cclosely tracking reports of extrajudicial killings, burning of homes and markets, and looting, in Al Geneina, West Darfur, as well as the killing and displacement of civilians in North Darfur and other locations across Darfur,\u201d the ICC said on Thursday. The intensified fighting in Omdurman followed an announcement by a senior army figure last week that he wanted forces to \u201ccleanse\u201d the city of RSF fighters. Since the announcement, the army has deployed troops from morning until evening in various neighbourhoods in Omdurman for the first time since the start of the war. Intense gunfire has been heard on a daily basis, and civilians have been killed and injured by stray bullets. On Tuesday a resident of the Ombdah neighbourhood, Abdllah Sulieman, was killed by a stray bullet while taking his brother to the only functioning hospital in the area. His brother, who had been injured in a similar incident the day before, survived. Two other men were reportedly killed by sniper fire on their way to bury a neighbour who had died at home from kidney failure after being unable to access medical care."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b3c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/14/labour-power-keir-starmer-politics-crises", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "If Labour wins power, will Starmer\u2019s safe strategy become a huge risk? | Andy Beckett", "lead": "Given the mess he will inherit and potential future crises, \u2018sticking-plaster politics\u2019 may not sustain public support, says Guardian columnist Andy Beckett", "author": "Andy Beckett", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:00:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097856", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb46e0356866a1e9bbab481c11cd6b5250ede00a/546_191_5086_3051/500.jpg", "body": "The bigger Britain\u2019s problems get, the more Labour seems to shrink. As almost every economic, social and public sector indicator flashes red, Labour politicians explain that regretfully they will only be able to do a limited amount in government about the worst set of interlocking crises in our modern history. The more disenchantment with politics grows, the more narrowly Labour defines the kind of politicians and party members it wants. It excludes or marginalises Corbynistas, leftwingers in general, respected local government radicals such as Jamie Driscoll, and even the mild centre-left organiser Neal Lawson. The few clearly left-leaning figures who remain \u2013 for now \u2013 in the shadow cabinet, such as Ed Miliband, are briefed against by anonymous Labour sources in the Tory press. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer has increasingly regular chats with Rupert Murdoch. There is a logic to all this purging and repositioning, lowering of expectations and policy trimming. It is the logic that has underpinned successful election campaigns by both main parties since 1997. From New Labour\u2019s pledge cards, with their concrete but modest promises, to the Tory strategist Lynton Crosby\u2019s advice to David Cameron to \u201cget the barnacles off the boat\u201d before his 2015 victory, electioneering in Britain has often been about discipline, repetition and minimising dissent and unnecessary commitments. It may not be inspiring or innovative, but it works, the advocates of this method argue. Look at Labour\u2019s lead in the polls. Yet poll leads and election victories take a party only so far. Once in office, especially at a time of national crisis \u2013 as Starmer is likely to be \u2013 the gap between wary campaign politics and the more risk-taking and imaginative mode that crises often require can create great tensions in a government. Sometimes premierships are destroyed by them. If Labour wins power, will Starmer\u2019s supposedly safe strategy become a huge risk? Despite the Tories\u2019 claim to be the nation\u2019s natural custodians, Labour usually takes office when Britain is in a mess. Unfortunately, such situations are the only time when many voters are prepared to give the party a try. One example of a cautious Labour government being overwhelmed in such a scenario is still infamous in the history of the party, even though it occurred almost a century ago. In 1929, Labour won power with unemployment rising and industrial relations tense, just as they are now. Within months, the Wall Street Crash and Great Depression made economic and social conditions much worse. Yet the chancellor, Philip Snowden, like today\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, believed that Labour governments needed to prove their credibility by strictly controlling how much money they borrowed. He resisted calls to increase public spending, then supported cuts. The government disintegrated into pro- and anti-austerity factions. An early general election followed, in 1931, and Labour lost spectacularly, shrinking to 52 MPs. The Conservatives got 470. Given the deep problems of the current Tory party, it\u2019s hard to see it making such a dramatic recovery. But a Starmer government struggling with all the problems left by its Tory predecessors, as well as with inevitable fresh crises, while being blamed for everything by the rightwing press, and also attacked by some of the leftwing Britons he has alienated, is only too easy to envisage. Yet a Starmer premiership doesn\u2019t have to play out that way. Governments can rule cautiously, even in a period of crisis, if they are trusted. For the first two years of Tony Blair\u2019s administration, Labour kept to the Conservatives\u2019 existing spending plans, despite the rundown state of public services, and voters did not desert Labour in a disillusioned fury \u2013 probably because they believed, correctly, that better funding from the government would eventually be forthcoming. A prime minister can also persuade enough of the electorate to be patient if they have a clear project. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s long, divisive premiership was partly sustained by the belief of a decisive minority of voters in her vision of a more competitive society. Occasionally, Starmer tries to give a Labour government a similar grand purpose. In January, he promised \u201ca fairer, greener, more dynamic country with an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top\u201d, and \u201ca politics which trusts communities with the power to control their destiny\u201d. So used are we to seeing him as Mr Cautious, these expansive moments do not get the consideration they deserve. He lacks Thatcher\u2019s and Blair\u2019s communication skills, which enabled them to embed their main message even in everyday announcements. He also lacks their consistent quality: the sense that they had an ideology, whether you liked it or not. In three years as leader, he has already shifted from the continuity Corbynism of his initial pledges to the jittery patriotic centrism of his pandemic period to the more confident critic of Conservative Britain that is his current incarnation. In office, he could easily change again. Optimists on the British left \u2013 there are still some \u2013 hope that he will be more radical in government than opposition, because circumstances give him no option. If public services are in even deeper crisis than now, after possibly another 18 months of Tory rule, then he will need new sources of revenue. With Labour\u2019s ambition for Britain to have \u201cthe highest sustained growth in the G7\u201d unlikely to be achieved quickly, if ever, and more borrowing ruled out, then this revenue will need to come from higher taxes. And with most taxpayers struggling financially, raiding the bloated stashes of the economic winners of recent decades is going to be very tempting \u2013 whatever reassuring things Starmer and Reeves say to the rich now. Such a sequence of events could be wishful thinking. But it\u2019s too early to say for sure how Starmer might govern. Next week, Labour\u2019s national policy forum meets to help decide what goes into its manifesto. Further policy announcements are likely at this autumn\u2019s party conference, and during the election run-up, which could include another Labour conference in 2024, if Rishi Sunak delays the election as long as possible. If Starmer treats this whole period as an exercise in risk avoidance, and does the same in Downing Street, then he may join the list of failed British premiers. Helpfully, he has supplied future historians with a phrase of his own for governments that lack boldness: \u201csticking-plaster politics\u201d. Let\u2019s hope he has some stronger remedies hidden somewhere in his medicine cabinet.

Ya Allah!\u201d Lawiza screams. Two friends attempt to comfort her, but their own sorrow takes hold and they too burst into tears. Lawiza had fainted when the news of her husband\u2019s gruesome killing reached her. Usman Buda, a father of six, was stoned to death on 25 June after he made a passing remark to a beggar that was taken by the mob as a slur on the prophet Muhammad. It is the latest in a string of reported attacks that are raising concerns over what many regard as Nigeria\u2019s longstanding failure to address growing religious extremism in some of its poorest communities. Amnesty International, which condemned the murder, has blamed the Nigerian government for \u201ccreating a permissive environment for brutality\u201d, while the US has urged Nigeria to repeal its blasphemy laws. Buda worked on a butcher\u2019s stall at the market in Sokoto, a north-western state with a rich Islamic history. The sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, is the spiritual leader of Nigerian Muslims. It was here in 1804 that the Islamic scholar Usman dan Fodio began one of the most infamous and bloodiest jihads in Africa. In a video clip capturing part of the attack and widely shared across Nigeria, Buda is seen flailing under blows from sticks and stones as children are encouraged to throw rocks. The Sokoto state government issued a controversial response condemning the killing but vowing to \u201cdeal decisively with anyone found guilty of any act aimed at degrading the personality of prophet Muhammad\u201d. It offered no condolences to the grieving family. Forty-eight hours after the killing, only a small group of mourners are gathered around the Buda family\u2019s compound, as being accused of blasphemy in Islam carries a significant social stigma. It is just before Eid al-Adha, a festival that should be an occasion for joy. \u201cHe was everything to us. He provided for the entire family. Who will take care of his children?\u201d asks Buda\u2019s father, Abdullahi Buda. \u201cThey have taken away a great pillar from our lives.\u201d He believes that his son, a devout Muslim, was wrongly accused. According to an eyewitness who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, the butcher made a religious point to the beggar, advising her to seek alms in the name of Allah rather than the prophet Muhammad, referencing a hadith, or teaching of the prophet, that speaks of giving \u201cto him who begs in the name of Allah\u201d. Other traders interpreted his comments as blasphemous. \u201cIt was a murder. I watched helplessly as he was beaten and stoned, his body drenched in blood. Even those who wanted to intervene were unable to do so. It was a horrifying sight,\u201d the eyewitness says. Buda was taken to hospital but died en route, according to a police statement. Buda\u2019s friend Abubakar Sani says: \u201cIf someone is accused of blasphemy, those making the accusations should present evidence. In this case, Usman wasn\u2019t even given a chance to defend himself before the mob descended.\u201d Police have promised to bring the perpetrators to justice but made no arrests at the scene. There is no public record of anyone being prosecuted or jailed in Nigeria for killings relating to blasphemy allegations. As of 2019, 79 countries have legislation on blasphemy \u2013 defined as speech or actions deemed disrespectful towards sacred entities or individuals \u2013 many imposing the death penalty. Twelve northern states of Nigeria, including Sokoto, implement sharia law, under which blasphemy can be punishable by death. But public violence is often triggered before authorities become involved. Nigeria\u2019s population is religiously divided with a Christian majority in the south and Muslim majority in the north. People of both faiths have fallen victim to blasphemy killings in the north, which have received support from influential individuals, including Islamic preachers, businessmen and government officials. In 2021, an Islamic scholar in Sokoto, Sheikh Bello Yabo, openly ordered his followers to murder a man arrested on blasphemy charges. The authorities took no action to reprimand him. Buda\u2019s murder is not an isolated incident. In 2002, more than 200 people were killed in riots sparked by a journalist writing that the prophet would have approved of a Miss World competition in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The Zamfara state government issued a fatwa calling for the writer\u2019s killing, and her newspaper\u2019s offices were torched. Last year, Deborah Samuel, a Christian student at Shehu Shagari college in Sokoto, was beaten and burned to death by fellow students over allegations of blasphemy. No one has been prosecuted for her murder. Experts point out that sharia law states that irrefutable evidence of blasphemy must be presented before competent authorities. Accusations are insufficient. The Nigeria-based lawyer Omotola Ajiboye-abdulkadri says: \u201cThe punishment for blasphemy according to sharia is death, and only Muslims are tried in a sharia court. The punishment for blasphemy in the customary law is two years\u2019 imprisonment. One who has allegedly blasphemed should be charged to a customary or sharia court and not mobbed to death.\u201d Mob killings have left a climate of fear around false accusations. One university student in northern Nigeria, who asked the Guardian not to publish his name, told how his neighbours on campus threatened to accuse him of blasphemy if he did not give up his accommodation to them. In the view of Haruna Lafiagi, an Islamic scholar in south Nigeria, politicians do not pursue justice because \u201cthe governors are afraid of losing elections and that is why they do nothing when misguided Islamic preachers order their followers to go and kill. These clerics are instrumental to their political ambitions.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt is most disheartening how a section of Muslims disregard the sanctity of human life so much that their eagerness to kill unjustly and unjustifiably is triggered at the slightest accusation of blasphemy. This is sheer ignorance, wickedness and barbarism.\u201d In Sokoto, Buda\u2019s mother, Aisha, is left to grieve for her son. \u201cHe was my third child among seven,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I admired most about him was his unwavering love and respect for his father and me. He was always well behaved, never causing any trouble.

Clearly, they had expected a period drama in a more traditional sense, and its bawdy take on history wasn\u2019t for them. The Favourite\u2019s co-writer, Tony McNamara takes another cock-eyed look at history with The Great, debuting its third season in the UK at last. I suspect those cinema-goers would approve of this even less than The Favourite. It\u2019s their loss. For those yet to fall for its ample charms, The Great plays hard and fast with the rise of Catherine the Great, Empress of all Russia, and her attempts to modernise the nation. But newcomers should not start with season three, and in fact should stop reading now. It is well worth going back to the start to see how everybody got to their positions, and almost requires notes to keep up. It is impossible to accuse The Great of being boring, as every episode romps along at speed, fuelled mostly by those twin engines of every good story, sex and death. There is far too much plot to recap succinctly, but, in essence, Catherine (Elle Fanning, who carries the series brilliantly) and her husband Peter (Nicholas Hoult, having a dimwitted blast), the former emperor, have had something of an on/off relationship. When Peter had sex with Catherine\u2019s mother (Gillian Anderson, whose appearance was brilliant but brief), then accidentally killed her by shagging her out of a window, it sparked the beginnings of (another) war between the spouses. Love conquers all, however, and after a short spell of attempted murder, they are trying to work through it. \u201cEveryone has their breaking point,\u201d explains Aunt Elizabeth, perhaps the true mastermind of the court. \u201cMother-fucking is usually it,\u201d concedes Peter. Yet Catherine and Peter begin the third season very much together, seated in front of a \u201cmarriage witch\u201d, whose couple-counselling methods are more inclined towards the killing of doves and chanting than to talking things through. Both the empress and the former emperor have let down their acolytes and supporters by agreeing to work through their issues, and there are some disappointed revolutionaries to soothe. Everyone in this show is horny, murderous or both; sometimes they are also hungry, and that leads to some impetuous decision-making all round. On Catherine\u2019s side, the perpetually disappointed Orlo continues to be disappointed that Peter still lives. \u201cYou are a failure and I was a fool to throw my heart and hopes away on you,\u201d he declares. There are problems, too, with military leader Velementov, who may be celebrated in war, but finds 18th-century ailments harder to defeat. On Peter\u2019s side, his gabbling friends face the wrath of Catherine for their support of her husband/arch enemy, and Catherine\u2019s former best friend, Marial, whose loyalties are only ever her own, is struggling with her marriage to the 10-year-old Maxim. This all makes it sound rather grave and serious, but the joy of The Great is that it is so absurd. A punishment is offered in the form of taking the bullet or the bear \u2013 being shot with a musket or letting a bear have a nibble of a limb and hoping the animal loses its appetite quickly. But this is all about huge, carnal appetites, and there is never any guarantee that either bear, or ruler, will stop when things have gone too far. That means that no character, aside from Catherine perhaps, is safe from the chop, and major players shuffle off their mortal coils with shocking regularity. This certainly keeps it lively. Nestled in among all the killing and sex, however, is a sneaky cerebral streak, and its episodes swoop in on debates about enlightenment and progress, God, tradition, folklore, nation-building, idealism, and whether the pen really is mightier than the sword. It is also very funny and very silly, and while Hoult\u2019s Peter is attempting to undergo a sort of self-improvement, he still has the temperament of a toddler who has been told they are not allowed to watch any more Peppa Pig. The Great continues to be a rich treat of a drama, and it is a shame that Channel 4 no longer shows it in the UK, and it has gone to a subscription channel, presumably limiting its audience considerably. For those who can or do watch it, however, this is bawdy, anarchic fun, still as smart as it is wilfully anachronistic. Huzzah!

Put another way, improving air quality could ease pressure on the NHS. Researchers compared the timing of 114,930 GP and 9,878 A&amp;E respiratory visits in Bradford with air pollution measured around the city. Polluted days were followed by increased health service use for breathing problems, with impacts persisting for more than 100 days. A third of GP and half of A&amp;E respiratory visits were attributed to nitrogen dioxide that was above World Health Organization (WHO) daily guidelines. This pollutant mainly comes from diesel vehicles and was estimated to cost the NHS in Bradford about \u00a31.95m over the four-year study. There is also the hidden cost of time away from work and lost education, as well as the way that illness affects people\u2019s lives. Separate research in south London between 2009 and 2013 also found increases in GP visits and inhaler prescriptions in the days immediately after pollution peaks. Prof Rosie McEachan, the director of the NHS Born in Bradford research programme and co-author of the new study, said: \u201cThere is no safe level of air pollution. We need more ambitious city-wide policies: clean air or low-emission zones, greater regulation of industrial pollution, cheaper and more reliable public transport, and infrastructure to enable people to use greener ways to get around.\u201d The size of the air pollution impact may be related to underlying health problems in the area. Long-term respiratory illness in Bradford is greater than the national average. Even before the cost-of-living crisis, 15% of homes were living in fuel poverty and 22% of children were below the poverty line. A separate study of more than 300,000 people across the UK found that people on lower incomes were more vulnerable to breathing problems from air pollution. McEachan added: \u201cLike other deprived cities in the UK, Bradford has high levels of respiratory illness. This is likely due to air pollution as many deprived urban areas are also pollution hotspots. High pollution events make these problems worse, with clear impacts on health service use.\u201d The UK government\u2019s air quality information service would classify most of these pollution events as low. McEachan commented: \u201cUK air quality information systems should reflect the more stringent levels recently endorsed by the WHO. It is really important that the public understand the impact that dirty air has on their health.\u201d New research from ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, has quantified the impacts from different pollution sources to help local and national politicians to prioritise action. For Bradford nearly half the attributable deaths from nitrogen dioxide in 2015 were linked to traffic. Agriculture in the surrounding area is the top source for health impacts from particle pollution, but reducing pollution from transport, home heating and energy generation will help, too. Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen of ISGlobal said: \u201cIn this day and age, no one should die of air pollution in Europe. Bolder measures are required to drastically reduce pollution and deaths associated with traffic. At the same time, we need to tackle other sources including industry and shipping, along with limiting home wood burning and emissions from farming.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b41", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/14/eu-lifts-japan-food-import-rules-weeks-before-nuclear-wastewater-to-be-pumped-into-ocean", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "EU lifts Japan food import rules, weeks before nuclear wastewater to be pumped into ocean", "lead": "Other countries, including China, have threatened to further restrict Japanese imports if the Fukushima wastewater discharge goes ahead", "author": "Justin McCurry in Tokyo", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 04:01:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097947", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/58cc320e76ee52a1f8e5f13c2279304dacf2ab0e/0_186_4557_2734/500.jpg", "body": "The European Union has lifted restrictions on Japanese food imports imposed after the meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, weeks before Japan is expected to start pumping wastewater from the facility into the Pacific Ocean. China and other countries, however, have threatened to further restrict Japanese seafood imports if the water discharge goes ahead. The EU announcement came after talks at a summit in Brussels between the European Council president, Charles Michel, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida. The EU\u2019s decision to lift all remaining restrictions, possibly next month, comes days after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved Japan\u2019s water release plans in a key safety review, saying the move would have \u201ca negligible radiological impact on people and the environment\u201d. The EU has loosened import curbs several times since 2011, when the plant was struck by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, triggering the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl 25 years earlier. But since 2021 it has required certificates showing levels of radioactive isotopes in wild mushrooms, some fish species and edible wild plants from Fukushima and nine other prefectures. The European Commission said the restrictions would be fully lifted \u2013 reportedly next month \u2013 adding that Japan would continue to monitor produce for radioactivity. \u201cThis will help drive forward the reconstruction of the devastated areas and is one we appreciate and welcome,\u201d Kishida told reporters. The EU\u2019s decision is seen as part of an attempt to make progress on the removal of Japanese trade barriers to EU beef, fruit and vegetables, whose access to Japan is limited by food safety rules. Eleven countries now maintain import controls on produce from Fukushima and other parts of Japan. China, a vocal critic of the water discharge, this week suggested it could widen restrictions on Japanese food imports, while Hong Kong said it would ban seafood from Fukushima and nine other prefectures if the water release goes ahead. \u201cOur assessment shows prefectures near Fukushima have higher risks, so we are now taking a responsible way for our residents,\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for the environment and ecology, Tse Chin-wan, told reporters. Hong Kong is Japan\u2019s second largest market, after mainland China, for agricultural and fisheries exports. It exported fishery products worth \u00a575.5bn ($536m) to Hong Kong last year, according to Japanese government statistics. Russia\u2019s consumer protection agency said it would step up supervision of marine products imported from Japan. South Korea\u2019s government endorsed the IAEA report, but opposition MPs are skeptical of reassurances that the wastewater poses no risk to marine species and humans who consume them. During a visit to Japan this week, opposition MPs said the South Korean government had ignored concerns among members of the public, and called for more expert organisations to review the discharge plans. Speaking in Seoul, the opposition Democratic party\u2019s Jung Choun-sook said the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has shown an \u201cirresponsible attitude\u201d towards public health in endorsing the IAEA report. \u201cIsn\u2019t Yoon the president of South Korea?\u201d Jung said, according to the Yonhap news agency. \u201cTrying to solve a problem directly related to people\u2019s health and safety by relying on the goodwill of Japan is not a responsible attitude for a president.\u201d More than 1.3m tonnes of water is being stored in about 1,000 tanks on the Fukushima Daiichi site, with the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), warning that it is quickly running out of storage space. Tepco\u2019s advanced liquid processing system can remove most radioactive elements from the water \u2013 which becomes contaminated when it is used to cool damaged nuclear fuel \u2013 but it is unable to remove tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. Japanese officials have said the treated water will be diluted so that tritium levels are one-40th of the concentration permitted under the country\u2019s safety standards, before being released into the sea. The operation is expected to take 30 to 40 years."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b42", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/14/hugely-exciting-and-rare-neolithic-polishing-stone-found-in-dorset", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Hugely exciting and rare\u2019: Neolithic polishing stone found in Dorset", "lead": "\u2018Polissoir\u2019, discovered in Valley of Stones nature reserve, was used about 5,000 years ago to hone tools such as axes", "author": "Steven Morris", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 04:00:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097965", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d78420bd523a54a1a41744bc0eba6c65fdf49a2c/0_106_3000_1799/500.jpg", "body": "At first glance it looked like nothing more than a rugged boulder jumbled among many others on the floor of a valley in the West Country. But a smooth, glossy dip in the stone indicated that it was something very special \u2013 a vanishingly rare \u201cpolissoir\u201d, or polishing stone, used 5,000 years ago by Neolithic people to hone tools such as axes. Discovered in the Valley of Stones national nature reserve in Dorset, it is only the second polissoir found \u201cearthfast\u201d \u2013 stuck firmly into the earth in its original position \u2013 in England. The polissoir was found by chance as volunteers cleared scrub to expose sarsen stones that had been hidden by vegetation over the decades. Anne Teather and Jim Rylatt, directors of Past Participate CIC a non-profit company that helps people find out more about local heritage, were working in another part of the valley when they decided to stroll over to see how they were getting on. Rylatt got there first and saw the boulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively unprepossessing boulder on one side,\u201d he said. But then he flicked away some leaves and found the shiny, polished area. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I was surprised. The only other one found in situ in England was found in the 1960s at Fyfield Down [in Wiltshire].\u201d Rylatt said he enjoyed thinking of the work that had gone on there so long ago. \u201cThere are more imposing stones here but this one ticked the boxes for them. They must have spent many hundreds, thousands of hours polishing here.\u201d It may be that this was a work area rather than a living one. \u201cThere may have been people doing other things here, processing animal skins perhaps, cutting up meat to make dinner.\u201d Teather said the polissoir was close to an ancient routeway. \u201cYou can imagine people coming to the stone to polish axes. This was not necessarily a place of settlement but a place people came to and moved through.\u201d She had been joking that if anyone found a polissoir she would buy them a bottle of whisky. \u201cI maintain that Jim got to the spot because he has longer legs than me.\u201d She has bought him a Scottish single malt to celebrate the find. Stone axes were used by the early farming people of the Neolithic to clear woodland and build houses and monuments. The axes were made of various raw materials such as flint, volcanic tuff and granite. There is evidence that many stone axes were moved around widely in prehistoric times, possibly traded as part of exchange systems or carried by their owners from distant sources where the stone was quarried. After the discovery of the polissoir, the area around the stone has been subject to excavation and specialist analysis to see if any traces of the makers of the stone axes are still present. Sasha Chapman, inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said: \u201cThis is a hugely exciting and rare discovery in this little understood historic landscape, which is giving us an opportunity to explore the use of the stone, and the communities who were using it.\u201d Polissoirs can be earthfast or portable with many found in France \u2013 hence the name."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b43", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/will-spains-snap-election-usher-in-the-far-right-or-can-pedro-sanchez-gamble-pay-off", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Will Spain\u2019s snap election usher in the far right \u2013 or can PM\u2019s gamble pay off?", "lead": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez is betting on galvanising leftwing voters to block the far right getting into government for first time since Franco", "author": "Sam Jones in Madrid", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 04:00:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.097983", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/25def15e63019f5ff16b49260574c43c93cea080/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Why is Spain holding a snap general election this month? Spain was due to go to the polls in November, four years after the last general election. But its socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, surprised everyone in May by calling an early election for 23 July, after his party\u2019s poor showing in local and regional polls. Faced with a resurgent opposition conservative People\u2019s party (PP) that exceeded expectations in those elections \u2013 and which is firmly ahead in the opinion polls \u2013 S\u00e1nchez brought forward the election in the hope of mobilising leftwing voters and avoiding months of wear and tear to his coalition minority government. How has S\u00e1nchez\u2019s administration fared over the past four years? When S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) reached a government agreement with the far-left anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance in January 2020, Spain got its first coalition government in 80 years. The coalition would hail its major achievements as the relatively good state of the economy, its labour reforms, the introduction of menstrual leave and the updating of abortion legislation, a euthanasia law and a minimum basic income scheme. It has brought in a democratic memory law intended to give \u201cjustice, reparation and dignity\u201d to the victims of the civil war and the subsequent Francisco Franco dictatorship, and done much to calm the issue of Catalan independence. The alliance has also weathered the Covid pandemic and the effects of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Spain\u2019s inflation rate is now just 1.9%. There have, however, been persistent personal and ideological tensions between the centrist PSOE and the more radical Unidas Podemos, most notably over the latter\u2019s botched sexual consent legislation, under which more than 100 sex offenders were inadvertently released from jail. How do opposition parties view the government and its track record? Less than fondly. Both the PP and the far-right Vox party regularly attack the government for its reliance on the votes of Catalan and Basque pro-independence parties in congress. They accuse S\u00e1nchez of being craven in his dealings with the Catalan independence movement and were bitterly opposed to his decision to grant pardons to nine Catalan leaders for their roles in the illegal, failed push for regional secession six years ago. The PP also frequently deplores a style of government it calls sanchismo, which it views as cynical, opportunistic and fixated on retaining power. What is at stake on 23 July? Put bluntly, the election will determine whether Spain succumbs further to the far-right drift experienced by so many other European countries. The poll is a choice between a leftwing and a rightwing coalition: the PSOE and the new leftwing Sumar alliance on one hand; the PP and Vox on the other. Although the PP is leading the polls, it is not expected to win an absolute majority, meaning it will need to rely on Vox\u2019s support to govern. While the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, has tried hard to emphasise his party\u2019s moderate credentials, it has repeatedly shown a willingness to form coalitions with Vox, as it has in the regions of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Valencia and Extremadura. S\u00e1nchez is hoping that the prospect of a far-right party entering government for the first time since Spain\u2019s return to democracy, after the death of the dictator Franco in 1975, will galvanise leftwing Spaniards to vote in droves. What are the big issues? As elsewhere, the cost of living crisis is a daily reality for Spaniards. A Bank of Spain report published last week found that 9% of Spanish households could not pay their bills last year because of rising costs and interest rates. A recent Ipsos poll for La Vanguardia found that the economy was the single biggest issue for voters, with 31% of those surveyed putting it at the top of their list. Then came unemployment (10%) and healthcare (9%). Immigration, one of Vox\u2019s favourite talking points, was the most important issue for just 2% of those polled. Which parties are taking part in the election? Although the PSOE, the PP and Vox are the biggest hitters in the election, much attention had been focused on Sumar, the new leftwing alliance led by Spain\u2019s popular labour minister, Yolanda D\u00edaz. Support for Podemos, once touted as a party that would eclipse the PSOE, has ebbed away in recent years, and it performed disastrously in the May elections. It has reluctantly agreed to join Sumar but there is bad blood between some in the party\u2019s old high command and the new outfit. Notably absent from this general election is the centre-right Ciudadanos party, which was seen as a possible party of government until a disastrous lurch to the right cost it dearly five years ago. It did so abysmally in the recent regional and local elections it is not running in the general election \u2013 good news for the PP. What is likely to happen on 23 July? Despite the PP\u2019s lead, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s gamble appears to be paying off and the socialists are beginning to rally in the polls. Much will depend on turnout and on what Vox demands in return for helping the PP into government. While the far-right party\u2019s seat count may fall, it may very well achieve its mission of helping to govern Spain. The consulting and strategy company Teneo calculates there is a 60% chance of a PP-led government, a 30% chance of a PSOE-led government, and a 10% chance of another election if no agreement is reached on a new administration (Spain held four general elections between December 2015 and November 2019)."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b44", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/14/mps-demand-urgent-reform-nhs-dental-services-report", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs demand dentistry overhaul as patients resort to DIY treatment", "lead": "Report calls for urgent reform to NHS services with some people unable to access care said to be using pliers to extract teeth", "author": "Anna Bawden Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 04:00:06", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098002", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/22de05399b4c4cb6ce182c0038f989a660ac4f1e/0_245_5937_3562/500.jpg", "body": "NHS dental services are not fit for purpose and need urgent reform, according to MPs who have warned that people are resorting to DIY treatment using pliers. A report published on Friday by the health and social care select committee said it was \u201ctotally unacceptable in the 21st century\u201d that large numbers of patients had to experience pain and distress because they could not see an NHS dentist. Fundamental changes were vital if people were to receive the dental care they were entitled to, the report concluded. Figures obtained by the British Dental Association (BDA) in May showed that 23,577 dentists carried out NHS work in the 2022-23 financial year, down by more than 1,100 on the pre-pandemic level and the lowest number since 2012-13. Up to 90% of practices are not accepting new NHS patients. The inquiry found substantial regional variation affecting people living in rural areas and places with the highest levels of deprivation. People from ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic backgrounds were twice as likely to avoid dental treatment because of costs compared with white people from the same backgrounds. Despite proposals in the NHS workforce plan to increase the number of dental students by 40% by 2031-32, the cross-party committee concluded that the \u201cgovernment and NHS England have not fully grasped the scale of the challenge for the workforce, and the need to urgently provide compelling incentives to attract new and existing dentists to undertake NHS work\u201d. MPs also expressed frustration that the government\u2019s recovery plan for NHS dental services, announced in April, has yet to be published. The Conservative chair of the committee, Steve Brine, said: \u201cRarely has an inquiry been more necessary than this one. To hear of someone in such pain and distress that they resorted to using pliers to extract their teeth demonstrates the crisis in NHS dental services. \u201cWe register in the strongest terms possible our concern for the future of NHS dental services and the patients who desperately need access to them.\u201d The report calls for a permanently ringfenced NHS dentistry budget alongside \u201cfundamental reform\u201d of the failed NHS contract, which is regarded as fuelling the exodus of dentists from treating NHS patients. The current system pays dentists by type of procedure or \u201cunits of dental activity\u201d. Instead, MPs recommended that dentists should be paid to maintain and improve patients\u2019 oral health, and focus on long-term, preventive care, with additional support for patients who have greater need. Experts welcomed the report and called for immediate action. Shawn Charlwood, the chair of the BDA\u2019s general dental practice committee, said the report showed exactly how to \u201csave NHS dentistry\u201d. He added: \u201cFailure to act will condemn this service to oblivion.\u201d Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: \u201cOur helpline takes many calls from patients who can\u2019t find an NHS dentist, live in so-called dental deserts where there simply aren\u2019t any NHS dentists, or are bewildered by the charging system. \u201cDentists are a fundamental element of good primary care. The current situation should never have been allowed by the government to deteriorate to this point. If the government\u2019s ambition is to ensure everyone who needs an NHS dentist can access one then it needs to take action to make that a reality.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cWhile the number of dental appointments available for NHS patients is steadily increasing and the GP Patient Survey found seven out of 10 patients had a good overall experience of dental services, the NHS has already started to address some of these recommendations through initial contract changes last year, \u201cThese significant reforms will continue to further support dental teams to carry out even more treatments and address the inevitable backlogs that built up during the pandemic, while record numbers of dentists, dental therapists and hygienists will be trained as part of the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to improve access to NHS dental care. We invest more than \u00a33bn a year in dentistry and have already increased the funding practices receive for high needs patients to encourage dentists to provide more NHS treatments. \u201cWe also recently announced a 40% increase in dentistry training places and have amended the guidelines so dental therapists and hygienists can deliver more treatments and will set out further measures to improve access shortly.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b45", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/14/wales-launches-campaign-to-help-tackle-misogyny-and-violence-against-women", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wales launches campaign to help tackle misogyny and violence against women", "lead": "Campaign aims to put onus on men to stop violence against women as figures suggest most already feel country safe place for women", "author": "Steven Morris", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 04:00:06", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098020", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1ba20b7e4e6e04ec28d47943c8f0335b17a95d8a/145_171_2355_1413/500.jpg", "body": "A campaign aimed at making young men reflect about violence against women and domestic abuse is being launched in Wales as new figures suggest most already feel the country is a safe place for women and almost 40% believe enough has been done to fill the gender equality gap. The \u201cSound\u201d campaign, which the Labour-controlled government hopes will help tackle the crisis of toxic masculinity, is aimed at men between the ages of 18 and 34, and will try to reach them via social media, podcasts, digital television and streaming channels. Launching the campaign at a boxing gym in Newport, south Wales, the minister for social justice in Wales, Jane Hutt, said the aspiration was to make Wales the safest place to live in the world. \u201cEarly intervention and prevention are vital,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must educate young men and boys about healthy relationships and ensure that we\u2019re putting the responsibility on them to stop violence against women and girls.\u201d The government said there was a \u201cworrying shift\u201d in attitudes perpetuated by the rise of high-profile people expressing misogynistic views. Hutt said the Sound campaign had been designed working with men of the age the government is trying to reach. \u201cSound is there to initiate self-reflection by drawing attention to harmful behaviour such as love-bombing, gaslighting and coercive control, helping men recognise these behaviours in themselves and others, to get trusted, sound advice on how to address them.\u201d In June 2023, the government surveyed 505 men aged 18-54 living in Wales to explore their views and understanding of issues relating to gender equality, gender-based violence and problematic behaviours. It found: 75% of men think Wales is a safe place to be a woman. 37% believe the country has gone far enough in closing the gender equality gap. 39% believe efforts to achieve women\u2019s equality have led to discrimination against men. 43% believe traditional masculinity is under threat. 64% underestimate the prevalence of violence against women. There was a very low understanding of terms such as love-bombing, gaslighting and coercive control. Younger men were both more likely to agree that traditional masculinity is under threat \u2013 and to describe themselves as feminists. They also perceived scenarios involving physical abuse as less harmful and wrong compared with older age groups. The campaign encourages young men to learn about gender-based violence in three ways: \u201cSound It Out\u201d \u2013 have conversations with male peers; \u201cSound Advice\u201d \u2013 get trusted insights; \u201cBe Sound As\u201d \u2013 encourage friends to open up, support them, challenge them, be a role model and emulate the figures you consider \u201csound as\u201d. The campaign will use social media platforms including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and digital sports channels to get the messages out. Cardiff City FC Community Foundation, a charity that works with young people in the capital, helped develop the campaign. Matthew Pugh, the post-16 education, training and skills manager at the foundation, said: \u201cWorking with young men day in, day out, I see the need for this type of campaign \u2013 it\u2019s particularly vital for the boys on our courses who are just heading into adulthood. \u201cThere is an obvious gap when it comes to talking about healthy relationships among young men.\u201d St Joseph\u2019s Amateur boxing gym in Newport has also taken part, filming a conversation between coaches and members about their perceptions of masculinity and how it affects their relationships. Farrell Rafferty, 25, of Pill, Newport, who has been involved in the campaign, said: \u201cI would never talk about my day to day problems with my partner, because in my eyes, I need to be seen as the carer in the relationship. \u201cThis project has shown me that maybe my opinion isn\u2019t always the way forward, or the only one. It\u2019s all about listening to other people, taking in what they say. Being involved has made me realise that maybe I don\u2019t need to be so strong-headed and can talk to others.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b46", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/14/j-hus-beautiful-and-brutal-yard-review-still-britains-most-adaptable-charismatic-mc", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "J Hus: Beautiful and Brutal Yard review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week", "lead": "Back after three years away, the east Londoner is polarised between feelgood summer tracks and bleak reportage \u2013 but he makes it all cohere, despite some terrible sex puns", "author": "Alexis Petridis", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 04:00:05", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098038", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bfdff24c1b94e3b31243c776b4ca735033313f7c/0_0_1464_878/500.jpg", "body": "At the end of last month, a series of cryptic messages appeared on electronic billboards in east London. \u201cWith da Burna. Boy you know I\u2019m masculine,\u201d read one. \u201cI made a comeback as a villain &amp; made a movie so sit back &amp; get the Popcaan my killy,\u201d read another. These turned out to be advance publicity for Beautiful and Brutal Yard (BABY), their announcement of the album\u2019s guest features forming part of a lengthy, mysterious promotional campaign. Everyone they were aimed at seemed to know straight away who they referred to, which tells you a great deal about the status of the album\u2019s creator, J Hus, which only appears to have grown during his absence from the world of music. The east London rapper hasn\u2019t released solo work in the three years since his chart-topping second album Big Conspiracy in 2020 and \u2013 his ability to do so held back by a spell in prison and then the pandemic \u2013 last toured in 2017: an intriguing corrective to the contemporary wisdom that an artist needs to pump out a constant stream of product lest they get forgotten about. The electronic billboard idea was pinched from the launch of Certified Lover Boy, the 2021 album by Drake, who appears as a guest on Beautiful and Brutal Yard, and whose presence also says something about J Hus\u2019s status: here he is on the infernally catchy single Who Told You, audibly playing second fiddle to a British rapper. Drake\u2019s verse is a reprise of the faux-Brit style he showcased on his 2018 Behind Barz freestyle and elsewhere like a hip-hop equivalent of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins: \u201cYour backside is so fit.\u201d Already proclaimed song of the summer by this very newspaper, the breezy Afrobeats rhythm of Who Told You, an ode to the joys of dancing, is at odds with the sound of BABY\u2019s lead single: the brooding, claustrophobic It\u2019s Crazy, which mixes gangster bragging with J Hus pondering whether he might be possessed by Satan. The two singles delineate a curiously polarised album, which keeps flipping from bleak, raw-throated street reportage to easygoing, sun-kissed stuff that frequently sees J Hus ramping up his Gambian accent: the latter substantially outweighs the former, but there\u2019s nothing in between. That its polarities hold together for more than an hour is partly down to J Hus\u2019s famed adaptability, his facility to ride any beat thrown his way, but it also has a lot to do with the production. J Hus\u2019s longstanding collaborator JAE5 is noticeable by his absence (\u201cIf we\u2019re not going in on certain topics, I\u2019m not touching this project\u201d the producer told one interviewer), but his replacements skilfully trick out the tougher tracks with attention-grabbing ideas: a sudden key change when guest CB appears midway through Cream; a musical shift that cleaves Fresh Water/Safa Kara in two; the constant ratcheting up and dialling down of tension behind J Hus\u2019s voice on Bim Bim. Guest musicians add heft to the poppier cuts. The addition of jazz saxophonist Venna (AKA Malik Venner) to Militerian is inspired, his languid contributions underscoring the somnambulant verse by controversial Nigerian vocalist Naira Marley. So are the delicate shadings of flute and acoustic guitar on Massacre. The live backing on Alien Girl, a laid-back but sinuous rhythm courtesy of Nigerian highlife duo the Cavemen, is so fantastic that you wish J Hus had come up with something better to stick over the top than a sex rhyme filled with strained space travel metaphors \u2013 among them, alas, puns about Uranus \u2013 and the flatly awful \u201cShe\u2019s from Russia, I\u2019m from Poland / She was rushin\u2019 to jump on my pole end.\u201d Still, you could argue that J Hus\u2019s reputation is founded less on his lyrics than his delivery, and the latter is spectacular here, verses and choruses colliding in one relentless flow. If he\u2019s after another huge hit to follow Who Told You, he could do worse than Nice Body, a beautifully written me-and-you-against-the-world ballad featuring Jorja Smith, the pleading vulnerability of J Hus\u2019s verses a welcome respite from the immodest stuff about the majesty of his pole end. But then, J Hus has a lot to be immodest about. If BABY feels more like a sharpening of his style than the innovation of his debut Common Sense \u2013 that authentically groundbreaking stew of rap, bashment and Afrobeats \u2013 it\u2019s an exceptionally classy end product. Drake\u2019s presence might have broken Who Told You in territories hitherto resistant to J Hus\u2019s charms, but the album has the ability to follow through. As for Britain, no one who recognised what those illuminated billboards in Stratford were driving at is likely to come away disappointed. This week Alexis listened to Venna \u2013 Sicily\u2019 Box Malik Venner\u2019s star turn on the J Hus album led me to belatedly check out his own work, a superior fusion of jazz, hip-hop and grime: Sicily\u2019 Box is the perfect, recumbent summer afternoon soundtrack. \u2022 This review was updated on 14 July with a correction: J Hus is of Gambian heritage, not Ghanaian."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b47", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2023/jul/14/channel-seven-spotlight-charlie-teo", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Seven back in the Spotlight as Charlie Teo interview raises eyebrows | Weekly Beast", "lead": "Channel gives reprimanded neurosurgeon a platform in Sunday night interview.

Teo, of course, has been the subject of many a current affairs show, including the ABC\u2019s Australian Story 20 years ago, which built up a picture of the doctor as a miracle worker. That was until Sydney Morning Herald reporter Kate McClymont\u2019s year-long investigation in 2019 revealed the \u201cdevastating impact on families of ultimately futile procedures\u201d and sparked a review by the Medical Professional Standards Committee. At the time, Teo said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the publisher has chosen to report inaccurately and in such a sensational and biased manner.\u201d It was Spotlight that won scoop of the year at the Kennedy awards for an interview with Anthony Koletti, the husband of Melissa Caddick, without disclosing to them that he was paid $150,000 to speak to Usher. The network defended its win: \u201cThe story complied with all conditions of entry.\u201d Media consultant Tim Allerton, who represents both Teo and Seven chairman Kerry Stokes, says Teo was not paid for the story. Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes is airing McClymont\u2019s Teo story again on Sunday night. Bluey soothes ABC\u2019s blues The ABC might be in turmoil due to a major restructure and the loss of 120 jobs but there is one constant that still brings joy: the success of kids\u2019 TV show Bluey. This week the show is celebrating its highest-ever audience after the new 10-part series averaged 11 million viewers per episode. Since April, Bluey has had the highest total audience achieved by any series to air in Australia, including Married at First Sight (2.58m), Lego Masters (2.2m) and State Of Origin (2.6m in 2022) on Nine. The way ratings are measured is fraught, and Aunty has added up all the views across ABC broadcast channels and ABC iView, but we will take its claim at face value and say well done. There is more good news for Australian kids\u2019 TV with First Nations content from the Australian Children\u2019s Television Foundation catalogue to air in 29 states across the US after being acquired by First Nations Experience (FNX), a channel devoted to Native American and world Indigenous content. The live-action series Barrumbi Kids and preschool animation Little J and Big Cuz will air in the US for the first time. Jewish News performs Yemini disappearing act Readers of the Australian Jewish News told Weekly Beast they were surprised to see a podcast with rightwing provocateur Avi Yemini promoted on the community newspaper\u2019s website this week. Yemini has a criminal conviction for throwing a chopping board at his ex-wife and is a presenter on the far-right political commentary website Rebel News. As the paper has reported that Yemini \u201cdoes not have any kind of official endorsement from Australia\u2019s Jewish community\u201d, readers were surprised to see a large photograph of him and what was effectively a full-page promotion for his book on the site. Podcaster Maurice Klein spoke with Yemini, who is Jewish, about his book A Rebel From the Start. The AJN article described the book as a \u201cbrutally honest account of Avi\u2019s journey filled with struggles, triumphs and everything in between\u201d. Yemini is a \u201cpopular personality, loving father and husband\u201d and in the podcast itself Klein says \u201cI absolutely love his work\u201d on the \u201cexcellent\u201d Rebel News. Not long after we contacted the AJN about the glowing interview with Yemini, the entire page disappeared, even though national editor Gareth Narunsky never got back to us. Ten still in the doghouse After our story last week that animal welfare groups have complained to Channel Ten about its upcoming show Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly Australia, we heard from the RSPCA which wanted to add its voice to concern about the training methods on the show, which is based on a UK format. The Pet Professional Guild Australia (PPGA) told us the program promotes \u201carchaic methods\u201d to control behaviour in troubled pets and viewers may get the wrong idea from watching the show. The PPGA has revealed Ten responded to its concern by offering the guild a credit on the show, an offer which was rejected. \u201cAt the end of our episodes, we would really love to have some text that reads \u2018if you want to seek advice for your dog, contact Pet Professional Guild Australia for more information\u2019 or something like that so that if any of our viewers need help with their dog, they know who to contact,\u201d an email from Ten seen by Weekly Beast says. \u201cWould it be possible if we could get permission to do that?\u201d The RSPCA said they read our story and have asked Ten \u201cto correct the record\u201d and change the quote they gave Guardian Australia which \u201cimplies that we were somehow OK with it when the opposite is true\u201d. Ten had said: \u201cWe liaised extensively with the RSPCA \u2013 stories were submitted prior to filming, and we appraised them of our plans for behind-the-scenes support.\u201d The senior communications officer for RSPCA Australia, Tim Hurd, said the society was opposed to the use and promotion of aversive dog-training techniques. \u201cWe\u2019re also concerned with the language used in relation to this show, which places blame inappropriately on dogs who display certain behaviours and reinforces negative perceptions that these are \u2018bad\u2019 dogs. We contacted Network Ten in January to express these concerns and subsequently met with them to discuss this. \u201cWe encourage all dog owners to use reward-based training, where the dog is set up to succeed and then rewarded for performing the good behaviour.\u201d Ten declined to comment. Coronation ratings not so sky-high Sky News Australia was boasting about its ratings for King Charles\u2019 coronation recently and it gave us an insight into why News Corp was so critical of the ABC\u2019s coronation coverage and its decision to include Stan Grant on a pre-ceremony panel. \u201cThe coronation of King Charles delivered Sky News\u2019 highest rating day so far in 2023,\u201d the Murdoch outfit told advertisers, delivering an average audience of 91,000 from 4pm. Impressive? Not if you look at the ABC\u2019s figures for the same event. The King\u2019s procession averaged 1,182,000 viewers on the ABC, putting it ahead of Seven\u2019s 1,096,000 and Nine\u2019s 738,000, according to OzTAM which measures viewing through broadcast TV and streaming devices. It\u2019s only a matter of days until Sky News Australia launches a dedicated new channel promising to \u201ccanvass all angles\u201d of the Indigenous voice to parliament, but its After Dark stars are making their views on the voice known. \u201cThere are a multitude of good reasons to reject the race-based referendum,\u201d Sky presenter Rita Panahi wrote in the Herald Sun. \u201cJust in the past week we\u2019ve seen more reasons to vote No to the racial division and privilege the Yes camp wants enshrined in the Constitution.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b48", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/solomon-islands-china-policing-deal-pacific-security", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Solomon Islands denies policing deal with China poses \u2018threat\u2019 to Pacific security", "lead": "Statement comes after US, Australia and New Zealand expressed concerns about new agreement with Beijing", "author": "Guardian staff with agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 03:19:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098078", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6f104a8d05c5664eefd5d18f19177df646799853/0_0_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Solomon Islands has said that its policing pact with China poses no \u201cthreat\u201d to the Pacific, rebuking western powers that raised fears the deal could inflame regional tensions. Prime minister Manasseh Sogavare inked a raft of deals during a trip to China this week, including an agreement allowing Beijing to extend its police presence in the developing Pacific nation until 2025. The US, Australia and New Zealand have expressed unease about the policing \u201cimplementation plan\u201d, urging Beijing to soothe concerns by releasing more details. In response, the Solomon Islands government on Friday declared that critics should \u201crespect our sovereignty and right to make our own decisions\u201d. \u201cSolomon Islands Government fails to see how the improvement of (Royal Solomon Islands Police Force) traffic control and management system in Honiara, provision of police equipment or the completion of the Forensic Autopsy Lab is a threat to the Pacific region peace and security,\u201d it said. A spokesperson for Sogavare said the pact would plug security gaps exposed by violent anti-government riots in November 2021, which destroyed large sections of the Chinatown district in the capital Honiara. The pact will cover areas such as drone training, cybersecurity and the provision of vehicles and equipment, the spokesperson added, saying the government failed to see how this was a \u201cthreat to the Pacific region\u201d. \u201cWe have suffered enough because of these security gaps,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. The 2021 riots were partly fuelled by anger over China\u2019s growing sway in the Solomons, which in 2019 severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of Beijing. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Penny Wong, said she had raised her \u201cclear views on security in the Pacific\u201d with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi, whom she met on the sidelines of an Asean summit overnight. A spokesperson for the US embassy in neighbouring Papua New Guinea said there were concerns about the expansion of China\u2019s \u201cinternal security and surveillance apparatus beyond its own borders\u201d. The US this week said it was planning a massive increase in diplomatic personnel and spending for facilities at new US embassies in the Pacific islands. In a notice sent to Congress, the state department said it envisioned hiring up to 40 staffers over the next five years for each of four recently opened or soon-to-be-opened embassies in the Pacific. Those include an embassy in Honiara, Solomon Islands, that opened in January; an embassy in Nuku\u2019alofa, Tonga, that opened in May and planned embassies in Port Vila, Vanuatu, and in Tarawa, Kiribati. Currently there are only two temporary American staffers each in Honiara and Nuku\u2019alofa. Sogavare, who has repeatedly stressed his country is \u201cfriends to all\u201d, raised eyebrows when he arrived in Beijing earlier this week and told Chinese officials \u201cI am back home\u201d. Solomon Islands, one of the poorest countries in the Pacific, sits at the centre of an escalating tug-of-war as China vies for regional influence with Australia and the United States. Australia\u2019s own longstanding security pact with the Solomons was recently put under review, stoking fears the island nation was drifting closer to China\u2019s orbit.

She will start in that role on 18 September when she succeeds Philip Lowe. But who is she, and what are her previous roles? Here\u2019s what you need to know. Who is Michele Bullock? Bullock will become the first woman to head the central bank, the nation\u2019s most important financial institution. She comes to the role after just 15 months as the deputy governor, a position that has often been the springboard for the top job. An RBA \u201clifer\u201d, Bullock joined the bank in 1985 and has held a number of positions. Bullock gained her BA in economics at the University of New England in 1984 and then master\u2019s at the London School of Economics in 1989. As with Glenn Stevens, Lowe\u2019s predecessor as governor, Bullock did not complete a doctorate in economics. Still, her LSE masters was under Charles Goodhart, one of the world\u2019s leading monetary policy experts, according to John Hawkins, a former senior RBA official now at the University of Canberra. Goodhart \u201cwas most impressed by her\u201d, Hawkins said. What were her past RBA roles? Bullock headed a string of increasingly important roles at the bank \u2013 including being made an assistant governor from 2010 \u2013 before becoming deputy RBA governor in April last year. Jonathan Kearns, a senior RBA executive before he left the bank to join Challenger in January, said Bullock was \u201cvery well credentialed and she is across every aspect of the RBA\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Kearns was head of the RBA\u2019s financial stability department for five years, reporting directly to Bullock when she was assistant governor for financial systems. He says Bullock was \u201ca good listener who takes on board the views of all those around her\u201d and capable of quickly getting to the crux of matters that were not familiar to her, skills that came in handy when the Covid pandemic threw up unexpected challenges. What\u2019s been the reaction to her appointment? Lowe, who had sought an extension to his term, said the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had \u201cmade a first-rate appointment\u201d. \u201cThe Reserve Bank is in very good hands as it deals with the current inflation challenge and implementing the recommendations of the Review of the RBA,\u201d Lowe said in a statement. \u201cI wish Michele all the best.\u201d Warwick McKibbin, a monetary policy professor at the Australian National University and former RBA board member, described Bullock\u2019s elevation as \u201ca great appointment\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s a very well-trained economist\u201d who will be \u201ctough and gentle\u201d in how she serves in her role, he said. With Steven Kennedy heading Treasury and Jenny Wilkinson leading the finance department, Australia had the \u201ctop three appointments in the top three positions\u201d, McKibbin said. Warren Hogan, the chief economist at Judo Bank, described Bullock as \u201cexperienced and battle-hardened [who] knows exactly what it takes to make good monetary policy\u201d. What will be key, though, is \u201chaving the courage to take difficult decisions that can have negative short-term consequences for a much bigger long-term reward\u201d, Hogan said, adding that Bullock will also be tested on how effectively she engages \u201cbeyond the big end of town\u201d. What will be Bullock\u2019s priorities? By the time Bullock takes over, the RBA board will have met twice more on interest rates. As a board member, she will have a voice in shaping those decisions. The central bank paused at this month\u2019s meeting for only the second time since it started hoisting the official interest rate in May 2022. The ANZ on Friday \u2013 formerly among the more hawkish of the commercial banks \u2013 predicted the RBA will pause again next month. Either way, short of a surprise uptick in inflation, most pundits predict the central bank is near the end of its rate-rising cycle. Indeed, it is possible Bullock\u2019s first change in the cash rate after her 18 September appointment will be a rate cut \u2013 although such a move is unlikely until well into 2024 unless there is some global economic calamity. Bullock\u2019s attention will also be absorbed in part by the need to implement a range of the recommendations resulting from the once-in-a-generation review of the RBA. Lowe already outlined the key changes that are within the RBA\u2019s remit earlier this week in what turned out to be his final speech before learning his services were no longer required. Kearns said the RBA governor\u2019s role was already \u201ca mammoth task\u201d \u2013 ranging from overseeing the currency to managing the payments between banks \u2013 before adding the review\u2019s revamp. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that those recommendations are implemented not just in the letter but in their spirit,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b4a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/14/fran-drescher-speech-actors-strike-writers-strike-sag-aftra-hollywood-ceos", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fran Drescher\u2019s fiery speech against Hollywood studios goes viral as actors strike", "lead": "The Nanny star turned Sag-Aftra union president wins praise for her passion as performers join writers in action expected to halt majority of US film and TV production", "author": "Sian Cain", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 02:27:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098112", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2390595b52716d441ce26c9beff29c72c27edbf6/0_410_4847_2908/500.jpg", "body": "Fran Drescher has blasted Hollywood studios in a fiery speech after talks between the actors\u2019 union and studios failed to avert a strike, calling them \u201cdisgusting\u201d for claiming \u201cthey\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs\u201d.

The unions are fighting for better terms with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, an entity that represents major studios and streamers, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros Discovery. Drescher, who became union president in 2021, has long expressed concerns about corporate greed, captioning photos with slogans like \u201cSTOP CAPITALIST GREED NOW\u201d and tweeting sentiments including: \u201cCapitalism has become another word for Ruling Class Elite!\u201d In 2017 New York Magazine ran the headline: \u201cYour New Favorite Anti-Capitalist Icon Is Fran Drescher.\u201d Drescher also described herself as \u201canti-capitalist\u201d in an interview with Vulture that year, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not anti-making-money, don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t think making money is a bad thing, per se. But it has to be calibrated within the spectrum of what\u2019s a true value. \u201cWhat I really tell people is, \u2018you might be the first ones at a global-warming rally, but meanwhile, do you know what\u2019s in your investment portfolio?\u2019 We need to not be supporting these companies at all.\u201d Drescher\u2019s speech on Thursday was off-the-cuff, with the 65-year-old actor shaking her fists and sometimes blinking away tears. \u201cWake up and smell the coffee,\u201d she told the studios. \u201cWe demand respect!

Deloitte declined to comment when contacted by Guardian Australia about the misuse of government information, but told the Senate inquiry it takes its obligations seriously. \u201cAny matters in relation to the misuse of confidential government information would be investigated in line with our normal processes,\u201d said Deloitte\u2019s response to questions from the committee. \u201cConsequences would vary depending on the findings of our internal investigations and, as with any misconduct, these consequences include disciplinary actions in accordance with our policies, which apply to both partners and employees.\u201d Greens senator Barbara Pocock said the disclosure confirmed the \u201cmisuse of government information by consultants goes beyond the PwC tax scandal\u201d. \u201cIt has always been a central concern of mine that what we are seeing is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d Dr Andy Schmulow, an associate professor of law at the University of Wollongong, said the disclosures highlighted industry-wide structural issues needed to be addressed. \u201cI have absolutely no doubt that this is not contained to PwC,\u201d Schmulow said. \u201cWhat this demonstrates is that the system itself is so dysfunctional \u2026 that it is no longer possible, even in theory, to uphold the public good.\u201d Deloitte also confirmed the misuse of confidential or proprietary information on nine additional occasions last financial year, down from 18 a year earlier. Details of these instances were not provided to the Senate and may lead to further investigations. Deloitte did provide details on two conflict of interest breaches involving government contracts. Last year, Deloitte was contracted by the ANAO to audit a government agency\u2019s environment, social and governance data. At the same time, Deloitte was engaged by that same agency to audit its financial statements. \u201cIt was identified in August 2022 that Deloitte had not sought pre-approval from the ANAO to provide the service, as required under their independence and conflicts management policies,\u201d Deloitte\u2019s response to the Senate said. Deloitte also referred to the Home Affairs department terminating a contract after an investigation found \u201can organisational conflict of interest that was not disclosed to the department when it was engaged\u201d. According to an ANAO report published last month, Deloitte was advising the department on IT procurement. At the same time, a Deloitte partner was seconded to a company bidding for work with the department. \u201cAt the time of its engagement \u2026 Deloitte had an actual conflict of interest and the failure to declare this interest was a breach of the probity plan,\u201d the ANAO report said.

I have been sexually unavailable to him because I was pregnant back-to-back with two kids after our marriage. He used to watch pornography frequently to cope with his desires. But recently I have seen that he has started paying escorts for live video sessions. When I asked him about it, he said \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between paid private video session and unpaid porn videos?\u201d He says there\u2019s no difference as he is not having any physical relationship with escorts. I personally feel that he has made himself available to the escorts or vice versa and that\u2019s very different from watching porn on websites. I am not comfortable with the paid video sessions and I feel betrayed. What should I do? Let it go? Is he cheating or is he not? I am confused. Eleanor says: The answer about what counts as infidelity is less important here than how this makes you feel. Plotting the exact edges of monogamy is a tricky piece of cartography. All kinds of things can feel like a betrayal inside a marriage, even though there\u2019s no physical sexual relationship. Video sessions like this, meeting in secret, holding hands \u2013 which of these is cheating? What\u2019s just inappropriate? People\u2019s attitudes differ. How to classify what he\u2019s doing is less important than your emotional clarity: you feel betrayed. Shouldn\u2019t that matter to him more than whether this meets the definition of cheating? All kinds of things are bad partnering, whether or not they\u2019re Objectively Wrong. Being systematically unavailable; making big decisions without consultation; just not caring very much how your partner feels \u2013 these things may not be instant violations in the obligation-flouting, \u201cyou promised A but now you\u2019re doing B\u201d way that infidelity is, but that doesn\u2019t make them any more pleasant to live with. If you say you feel betrayed and your partner responds with \u201cWhat am I technically doing wrong?\u201d it doesn\u2019t exactly erase the feeling. That\u2019s because being a good partner involves doing more than you\u2019re obliged to, strictly speaking. So yes, perhaps he\u2019s not obliged by your marriage contract not to pay for these video sessions. But nobody thinks the way we should treat our spouses is to do what we\u2019re obliged to and nothing more. Not continuing to hurt you in this specific area seems like a straightforward way to be nicer to you. I wonder, too, whether there might be room for some conversations about relating to his sexuality in the long term. If you each treat his libido as something that he has a right to pursue \u2013 even in ways that upset you \u2013 that might make it harder to come back to a physical relationship that you enjoy, too. If you do envisage a return to sex with him, you\u2019ll want to feel treasured, exciting. But it can be difficult to be aroused by someone who\u2019s shown you they are more interested in their pleasure than in you feeling loved. You don\u2019t want to get stuck in a cycle where his libido seems threatening to you, so sex starts to feels like a neglected necessity to him and a tolerated ordeal to you. Your body deserves more fun and celebration than that! It might be helpful to start thinking about ways to relate to his sex drive that help you both feel safe and attractive. You could start small, with just reading and thinking about what you might eventually like your physical connection to be. If you\u2019re financially able to, and only when your body and mind feel ready, you could eventually enlist the help of a therapist who specialises in sexual connection. These are very difficult conversations to have. They require immense frankness about things we usually work hard to keep private. But just like the rest of marriage, a physical connection will go best when you are both working together, for each other\u2019s sake.

Currently, S-ketamine nasal spray is sometimes prescribed in Australia for treatment-resistant depression, but it costs approximately $800 per dose, and combined with the consultation cost, patients can pay around $1,150 for treatment. Researchers led by Prof Colleen Loo from the University of New South Wales Sydney and the Black Dog Institute trialled a lower-cost, generic version of ketamine delivered via a small injection administered under the skin. It is the largest study in the world comparing generic ketamine, known as racemic ketamine, with a placebo in treating severe depression. The researchers recruited 179 people with treatment-resistant depression who were given either an injection of racemic ketamine \u2013 already widely available as a drug for anaesthesia and sedation \u2013 or a placebo. The placebo was a drug known as Midazolam, chosen because it also causes sedation, making it less likely participants would know which drug they were given. Researchers were also unaware which drug the patients received, known as a double-blind trial, to reduce the risk of bias. Participants received two injections a week in a clinic where they were monitored for around two hours. The treatment ran for one month. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup One fifth of those given racemic ketamine reported that they no longer had clinical depression in the four days following their final dose, compared with 2% in the placebo group. Participants in the racemic ketamine study also had higher rates of treatment-resistant depression before treatment compared with participants in similar studies involving S-ketamine. Almost one quarter of the participants in the racemic study had failed to respond to previous treatments including antidepressants, talk therapy and/or electroconvulsive therapy. The results, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry on Friday, are similar to the remission rates found in studies of those given S-ketamine nasal spray for depression. But racemic ketamine costs as little as $5 per injection, though patients receiving the drug outside of clinical trials pay around $350 on top of this for the consult and monitoring. \u201cI\u2019m now leading an application to Medicare, supported by the Black Dog Institute and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, for a Medicare item number to fund the treatment costs for ketamine treatments for depression,\u201d Loo said. This would include all methods of delivery and forms of the drug, including the nasal spray and lower-cost injections. \u201cKetamine is a tremendous treatment for people with treatment-resistant depression, but the main barrier now to access is people can\u2019t afford the costs, which is why we have made this application,\u201d Loo said. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that within one or two years, treatment will be Medicare-funded.\u201d Loo said further research is needed to understand whether the treatment effects are long-lasting. She urged people with depression not to ask their GP for ketamine treatments, saying if people believe they have depression, they should explore alternative treatment options with their GP first such as lifestyle changes and treatment from a psychologist, before being referred to a psychiatrist to explore alternatives if symptoms persist. Psychiatrists administering ketamine should ideally receive additional training, including on how to dose and monitor patients safely, Loo said. Prof Susan Rossell, a cognitive neuropsychologist with Swinburne\u2019s Centre for Mental Health who specialises in treatment-resistance, said Loo\u2019s study had been conducted \u201cwith the highest scientific standards and rigour\u201d. \u201cThe results are of critical importance when it comes to treatment-resistant depression, where, as we know, these people have tried everything and are desperate,\u201d Rossell said. \u201cThis treatment offers hope to those who are very unwell.

It\u2019s rhythmic and urgent and hard like a racing heartbeat, a thumping fist. AJ (Anthony Yangoyan), barely 18, is supposed to drive the getaway car of a simple house robbery. A quick job for a couple of older, scarier guys and he\u2019ll be able to go on a team soccer trip that could be the beginning of his professional career. Suddenly, though, everything goes wrong. Suddenly he\u2019s beckoned inside. Suddenly an alarm goes off. Suddenly he\u2019s a criminal, the only easy ID from the scene, and everything changes. So goes the tense introduction to Jailbaby, the highly anticipated new play from lawyer-turned-Olivier-winning playwright Suzie Miller, which is making its debut at Griffin Theatre Co\u2019s tiny SBW Stables Theatre: Sydney\u2019s home for new Australian writing. Miller is the writer of Prima Facie, another play preoccupied with legal inequities, which won its star Jodie Comer another Olivier on the West End and a Tony award on Broadway. An impassioned one-hander about the failures of the legal system to protect women who have been sexually assaulted (originally directed by Lee Lewis and starring Sheridan Harbridge), it premiered at Griffin in 2019 \u2013 and then became a true international phenomenon. Miller\u2019s work has always had a social conscience. Her previous Griffin plays were 2015\u2019s Caress/Ache, which considered the cruel weight of the death penalty; and 2017\u2019s Sunset Strip, which grappled with community and social responsibility. 2022\u2019s RBG: Of Many, One, for Sydney Theatre Company, examined the life and legacy of late US supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Jailbaby is billed as the spiritual successor to Prima Facie, and much like its famous predecessor is aimed directly at the underbelly of so-called justice, hissing and ready to strike. We follow AJ as he moves through a system he barely understands, and it\u2019s heartbreaking. When his lawyer Olivia (Lucia Mastrantone) tries to explain he has been charged with serious crimes despite his relative lack of agency and culpability, he repeatedly asks if he\u2019ll be out in time for soccer training, if he can make the big scouting trip. We all know he\u2019s not going home. Olivia clocks AJ\u2019s boyish vulnerabilities early on, and sends a formerly incarcerated man (Anthony Taufa) to give him tips he can\u2019t bear to hear for surviving sexual violence from fellow inmates. This, we know, is foreshadowing. Jailbaby is a gut-twisting, heart-thumping, heavy-handed play. AJ recounts the mechanical, emotional and physical details of the rape and abuse he suffers while behind bars in lengthy direct-address monologues that are difficult to watch. Director Andrea James keeps a strong pulse (bolstered to great effect by Phil Downing\u2019s relentless composition and sound design), with a clear-eyed approach that resists Miller\u2019s turns towards sentimentality, favouring frankness over flourish. This is a relief, because Miller\u2019s script veers between searing and simple, challenging and indulgent. When Miller writes in the heightened theatrical language of monologue or soliloquy, she\u2019s at her strongest. When she relies on conversational dialogue, as she does for much of this play, it\u2019s limp and forced \u2013 it\u2019s hard to move or make impact with stilted talk, even in this company of three fine actors (Mastrantone and Taufa play multiple roles). Miller parallels AJ\u2019s journey with that of the far more privileged Seth (also Yangoyan), a boy his age who lived comfortably in the house AJ robbed and whose own brushes with crime are treated with much gentler hands. It\u2019s a promising device, allowing us to see discrepancies in how lives are valued by the state. But the character of Seth is shakily, inconsistently drawn, and when their stories converge and collide, the play veers into soapy cliche and turns leaden. It\u2019s an ending that cheapens the story. There are powerful, impassioned ideas at the heart of the play. It offers a heart-first illumination of the failings of the prison system on victims and those who commit crimes. But when Jailbaby veers into melodrama, it loses some of its sociopolitical power. It resists the anger and level of legal detail that fuelled Prima Facie and led to real global change in the legal world, and without it, Jailbaby feels earnest but toothless. Still, there\u2019s value in emotionally intense stories: they can leave people feeling frustrated and helpless, urging us to reconsider unfair, unjust systems. Let Jailbaby be the beginning of a journey engaging with these ideas, as provocative plays are often designed to be \u2013 no matter how easy the neat bow of the play\u2019s end might make it to turn away.

Slick is played by Foxx, and is always complaining about the ungrateful, unreliable women he\u2019s exploiting and indignantly announcing things like: \u201cAt the 1995 Players\u2019 Ball I was Pimp of the Year!\u201d His main earner is the wisecracking Yo-Yo, played with whipsmart presence by Parris. After Tyrone is fatally gunned down outside the motel that Charles habitually uses as his HQ, he is astonished to see Tyrone alive and well the next day, apparently unaware of the shooting incident. Charles, Yo-Yo and this new Tyrone team up to solve the mystery and discover the existence of something very strange underground, which has something to do with Tyrone being cloned. Until the discovery, the movie is tough and intimidatingly violent, and callous in its realism. Then it becomes a wacky adventure. Yo-Yo turns out to be a huge fan of Nancy Drew mysteries and gleefully gets involved in the detective work because that\u2019s what her heroine Nancy would have wanted. She even manages to open the back door of a van, just as Nancy would do it. I\u2019m not sure if Juel really intended to make Yo-Yo a Nancy Drew fan, or that he simply realised at some rewrite stage that the trio\u2019s adventures looked like Nancy Drew and he needed to pre-empt that. But it\u2019s amusing just the same. As for the high concept, it is very weird: especially as it is, frankly, not very obvious why the evil controllers particularly need to clone anyone, as this clone-replacement leads so easily to the denouement. But it all bounces along amiably enough, due to the high-octane work of Boyega, Foxx and Parris. Perhaps they deserve to be in a more serious film or in a comedy that was skewed more to grownups. Well, it\u2019s a film with its own peculiarly unexpected innocence and charm. \u2022 They Cloned Tyrone is released on 21 July on Netflix"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b50", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/14/michele-bullock-new-rba-governor-named-appointed-reserve-bank-of-australia", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Michele Bullock named as new governor of the RBA and first woman to lead central bank", "lead": "Bullock replaces current Reserve Bank of Australia chief Philip Lowe, whose term expires in September", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 00:52:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098243", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b13c97b92888e9bda50eca57cc365ef9d0c80c4a/0_1480_5504_3302/500.jpg", "body": "Michele Bullock has been named as the new governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, replacing Philip Lowe. She is the first woman to lead the central bank. Prime minister Anthony Albanese said Bullock, who has been the RBA deputy governor since April 2022, was an \u201coutstanding economist and leader with a deep understanding of the RBA\u2019s role and operations, built up over her long and distinguished career with the central bank. \u201cHer appointment strikes the optimal balance between providing exceptional experience and expertise and offering a fresh leadership perspective,\u201d Albanese said at a press conference on Friday morning. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Albanese, appearing alongside treasurer Jim Chalmers, said that after four decades of service, including most recently as deputy governor, Bullock will become \u201cthe first female governor since the independent RBA was founded in 1959\u201d. Albanese thanked Lowe, who he said had helped the Australian economy navigate \u201cunprecedented challenges\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic and economic downturn. Lowe\u2019s seven-year term as chief of the RBA expires on 17 September and he was widely expected to be replaced. Guardian Australia confirmed on Friday that Lowe\u2019s term would not be extended and that the announcement of his successor was imminent. Bullock\u2019s appointment will take effect from 18 September. Despite the success of Reserve Bank interventions at blunting and rebounding from the Covid-19 downturn, Lowe has been widely criticised for guidance that interest rate rises were unlikely until 2024 and the slow start to monetary policy tightening in early 2022. Chalmers told reporters in Canberra the decision not to reappoint Lowe was \u201cthe right call\u201d but \u201cnot an easy call\u201d. \u201cHe goes with our gratitude and he goes with dignity.\u201d Chalmers said that of eight RBA governors only five had been reappointed so \u201cextending a governor\u2019s term has been in historical terms the exception rather than the rule\u201d. Chalmers said the decision was \u201cnot about any one decision taken by the Reserve Bank board or any one outcome\u201d. \u201cThis is genuinely about who is best placed to take the Reserve Bank forward in the future.\u201d Chalmers said he knew from conversations with Bullock that she was \u201ccommitted\u201d to implementing recommendations of the review of the Reserve Bank. This will see a new statement of the conduct of monetary policy this year and legislation to reform the bank, including setting up a separate board within the RBA for setting the cash rate. Lowe said Chalmers had made a \u201cfirst-rate appointment\u201d and congratulated Bullock. \u201cThe Reserve Bank is in very good hands as it deals with the current inflation challenge and implementing the recommendations of the review of the RBA,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI wish Michele all the best.\u201d In June Bullock drew flak for comments that if \u201cunemployment remains too low for too long, inflation expectations will rise, which will make it that much harder for the monetary authorities to bring inflation back down\u201d. However, Bullock did qualify that this did not mean \u201cother part of our mandate \u2013 maintaining full employment \u2013 has become any less important\u201d. In recent days the Coalition has pressured the government not to punish Lowe for tough but necessary interest rate rises, while Peter Dutton publicly warned his replacement should not be a senior public servant. On Friday Albanese said that statement had \u201cless than zero\u201d impact on the government\u2019s decision, and accused Dutton of a \u201ccompletely reprehensible\u201d politicisation of the public service. He noted that both candidates targeted by that remark \u2013 treasury secretary Steven Kennedy and finance department secretary Jenny Wilkinson \u2013 had received senior appointments under the Coalition. Chalmers said that Bullock will be \u201ccompletely independent\u201d of the government, citing the fact she is \u201ctremendously accomplished\u201d and because the government \u201ccherishes the Reserve Bank\u2019s independence\u201d. The chief executive of the Grattan Institute, economist Danielle Wood, said it was \u201cchallenging\u201d for Lowe to be reappointed due to the perception he \u201cwasn\u2019t necessarily enthusiastic\u201d about the breadth of changes recommended by the review. \u201cIt would be very unfortunate if it [were] in any way a reflection of the very difficult decisions the bank has had to make over the past year and we certainly don\u2019t want to be in a world where Reserve Bank governors are not getting reappointed because they\u2019ve had to make hard decisions,\u201d Wood told ABC TV. In the lead-up to Friday\u2019s cabinet decision Lowe has softened his stance on further interest rate rises, suggesting that it is \u201cpossible that some further tightening will be required\u201d in contrast to earlier comments that further rises are likely necessary."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b51", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/la-sheriff-office-deputy-punches-mother-baby", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "LA sheriff\u2019s office under scrutiny after deputy punches mother holding baby", "lead": "Officer is seen hitting woman twice in face as she holds her baby in video released by LA county sheriff Robert Luna", "author": "Sam Levin and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 00:23:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098261", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a370da7c73b1bc65920177c02778d43413a294fc/26_0_1577_947/500.jpg", "body": "For the second time in a week, the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department is facing scrutiny over a brutal force incident, this time after a deputy was caught on camera punching a mother twice in the face as she held her newborn baby. The LA county sheriff, Robert Luna, on Wednesday released footage of the July 2022 incident in Palmdale, north-east of the city of Los Angeles. The encounter started when deputies stopped a car being driven without headlights at night, Luna said. The officers said they smelled alcohol, according to the sheriff, and saw there were three women in the car who were holding their babies and didn\u2019t have children\u2019s car seats. The footage begins with one mother seated on the ground holding her baby, surrounded by deputies demanding she hand the child to them. As she pleads for them to let her go, noting she has a car seat at home, one deputy says: \u201cDo you want me to grab the baby or are you going to hand the baby over nicely? \u2026 I don\u2019t want to have to snatch her and have my partner grab your arms. We\u2019re going to take the baby one way or another.\u201d \u201cNo, no, please let me hold on to her, please,\u201d she cries, asking if the officers could drive her home. \u201cWhy are you taking my baby?\u201d she says. Eventually, the officers forcibly grab the child from her as she weeps. The footage later captures officers surrounding and grabbing another woman\u2019s baby. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to shoot me dead before you take my baby,\u201d she can be heard crying, adding that the officers are going to hurt the infant. The video captures an officer twice punching one of the mothers during the chaotic arrest, before the woman is grabbed by officers and handcuffed. Police said the male driver was arrested on suspicion of driving on a suspended license, driving under the influence of alcohol and child endangerment. Four women in the car were held on suspicion of child endangerment. A spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s department said prosecutors declined to file charges against the women. It\u2019s not clear how long the families had been separated. Luna, the LA sheriff, said on Wednesday that the punching was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and that he would alert the FBI and had directed his staff to send the case to LA county prosecutors to consider criminal charges. A spokesperson for the district attorney\u2019s office said Thursday that the sheriff\u2019s department had not yet presented a case to prosecutors. Luna said he believed the punching was \u201can isolated incident committed by an individual who will be held accountable\u201d. He added the deputy was no longer on field duty, but that he was barred by law from disclosing further details about disciplinary actions the officer may have faced. It is unclear if any of the other officers have faced any disciplinary action. Karen Bass, the mayor of LA, said the video was \u201cenraging and disturbing\u201d in a statement on Wednesday night, adding: \u201cThe idea that you would assault a mother with a child in her arms and then subject that child to the child welfare system just because the child didn\u2019t have a car seat is an abuse of power. When a child goes into the child welfare system, it can take months for that child to be returned. That process can result in lifelong trauma for both the mother and the child.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s announcement was the second in a week relating to a brutal force incident. On 5 July, Luna said two deputies had been pulled from field duty after video surfaced of a deputy in neighboring Lancaster violently tackling a woman while she filmed a man being handcuffed, then pepper-spraying her in the face on 24 June. The LA sheriff\u2019s department has long been plagued by scandals and Luna was elected last year on promises of reform. The agency, the largest county sheriff\u2019s office in the US, faces continued scrutiny over horrific jail conditions and repeated incidents of brutal force captured on film. Federal monitors continue to oversee reforms that the department agreed to for the Lancaster and Palmdale stations, which are among the busiest in the county. In 2015, the sheriff\u2019s department settled federal allegations that deputies in those stations had engaged in excessive use of force and racially biased policing that included disproportionately stopping or searching Black and Latino people."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b52", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/13/us-severe-weather-warning-record-heat-wildfire-tornado-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vermont governor seeks major disaster declaration from White House as state braces for more storms \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Latest storm warning comes just days after areas of Vermont and New York were hit with flash flooding, raising concerns over more damage", "author": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong (now) and Fran Lawther (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 23:08:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098280", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3f0bc12c8edb12f560a51af7f83b62ead4e684e0/0_78_1328_797/500.jpg", "body": "Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Authorities in Vermont have confirmed that one person was killed during this week\u2019s flooding. Stephen Davoll, 63, from Barre City, died on Wednesday as a result of a drowning accident in his home, the Vermont department of health said. Davoll is the first confirmed fatality in the state related to this week\u2019s storms and flooding. Vermont\u2019s governor, Phil Scott, said he is seeking an additional major disaster declaration from the White House. If approved, the declaration could open up the state to receive additional federal disaster relief funds. Strong thunderstorms were expected to move into parts of the state by Thursday night, which could cause more flash flooding. Extreme tropical downpours and severe thunderstorms will return to the US north-east from late this week into early next week, according to meteorologists. There will be a potential for life-threatening and highly disruptive flooding in areas recently affected by flooding, as well as in areas that have not seen flooding yet, AccuWeather meteorologists warned. A heat dome over California is expected to bring triple-digit temperatures and heightened fire danger. All but California\u2019s coastal regions will be facing extreme temperatures. In the agricultural Central Valley, the towns of Bakersfield, Fresno and Merced could see temperatures of up to 109F (43C) on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures for some parts of the valley could reach up to 117F. Florida will see more sunshine than ever as it experiences record-breaking temperatures as the marine heatwave persists. South Florida will be most affected by the hot weather. The National Weather Service issued alerts for parts of the area into late Thursday. The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch for parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It also said isolated severe thunderstorms are expected to develop in parts of Oklahoma, with a risk for very large hail and damaging wind gusts. A tornado watch has been issued for parts of Colorado and Kansas, the National Weather Service said. Last month was the hottest June globally on record on both land and sea, scientists have said. The average global surface (land and ocean) temperature in June was 1.89F above average, 0.23F warmer than the previous record set in June 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its monthly global climate report. Mild El Ni\u00f1o climatic conditions brewing in the Pacific Ocean will strengthen throughout the year, with an outside chance of a record-breaking event that will further turbocharge already sweltering temperatures around the globe, scientists have forecast. Swaths of the US are baking under record-breaking heat, yet some lawmakers are still attempting to block any spending to fight the climate crisis, advocates say. Authorities in Vermont have confirmed that one person was killed during this week\u2019s flooding. Stephen Davoll, 63, from Barre City, died on Wednesday as a result of a drowning accident in his home, the Vermont department of health said. The state\u2019s office of the chief medical examiner and the Barre police department investigated the death, the agency said. Davoll is the first confirmed fatality in the state related to this week\u2019s storms and flooding. More than 200 rescues and 100 evacuations have taken place this week as a result of the extreme weather. A tornado watch has been issued for parts of Colorado and Kansas, the National Weather Service said. Environment Canada has confirmed that a tornado touched down in the Montreal area on Thursday as heavy storms persist throughout southern Quebec. The weather agency said the tornado was spotted in Mirabel, Quebec, but no injuries or damage have been reported. The initial tornado warning covered several areas, including Lachute, Vaudreuil-Dorion, Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and the region of Rawdon-Joliette. Tornado warnings for Montreal and surrounding areas were lifted, although tornado watches and severe thunderstorm warnings are still in effect for those areas. Extreme tropical downpours and severe thunderstorms will return to the US north-east from late this week into early next week, according to meteorologists. There will be a potential for life-threatening and highly disruptive flooding in areas recently affected by flooding, as well as in areas that have not seen flooding yet, AccuWeather meteorologists warned. Rainfall rates of up to three inches per hour could result in significant flash flooding and urban flooding, AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jon Porter said. Whenever rain falls at a rate of 2-3 inches per hour, rain is falling too fast and too furious, and flash flooding will ensue \u2013 especially if that cloudburst occurs in an area with already saturated ground from previous heavy rain. Ocean water temperatures are several degrees above average this summer, which could once again contribute to the dangerous flooding risks in the north-east. Here are some of the latest images from the newswires showing the aftermath of the catastrophic flooding in Vermont. Days after devastating rainfall deluged Vermont and with more severe storms on the way, Phil Scott, the state\u2019s governor, said he is seeking an additional major disaster declaration from the White House. If approved, the declaration could open up the state to receive additional federal disaster relief funds. \u201cVermonters have faced incredible loss as a result of this historic and catastrophic flooding event,\u201d said Scott in a statement. While we\u2019re still focused primarily on the immediate response, as we transition to the recovery phase, federal assistance will be critical to support families, businesses and infrastructure. With support from Washington, and the inspiring resiliency of Vermonters, we will be able to rebuild and recover. Strong thunderstorms were expected to move into parts of the state by Thursday night, which could cause more flash flooding, Scott said at a news conference. Conditions could spawn a tornado, he said. Things are quite literally heating up in the already hot state of Florida. The state known for sunshine will see more of it than ever as it experiences record-breaking temperatures as the marine heatwave persists. But the temperature can be deceiving. Because of the ongoing humidity in the region, the \u201cfeels-like\u201d temperatures are hotter. In some parts of the state, it can feel as hot as 105F, the Weather Channel said. South Florida will be most affected by the hot weather. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued alerts for parts of the area into late Thursday. The NWS warns that those most vulnerable to the heat are pregnant people, newborns, children, the elderly and those living with chronic illnesses. The National Weather Service (NWS) said isolated severe thunderstorms are expected to develop in parts of Oklahoma, with a risk for very large hail and damaging wind gusts. Damaging winds will become a more prominent severe weather hazard as storms increase in coverage this evening, the NWS said. There is a possibility of a tornado or two. Delivery drivers struggle in 110F heat in Phoenix, Arizona In the throes of Amazon Prime Day \u2013 the retail giant\u2019s mega sales event that ended on Wednesday \u2013 millions are awaiting packages delivered on a dime. In Phoenix, Arizona, where temperatures have remained above 110F all week, delivery drivers are still rushing to get boxes to doorsteps in the sweltering heat. \u201cThis last week was the hottest week on record \u2013 it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Gabe Castle said, as he helped shuttle armfuls of packages to another truck that rumbled nearby before taking his allotted 15-minute break. The other driver had been given a raffle ticket for a $500 drawing in order to pick up some of his load, an initiative by their employer to ensure no one falls too far behind schedule. Castle is accustomed to working in heat. A former handyman with a construction background, he left his business after suffering some health issues and back problems. He appreciates the health coverage he gets as a driver, even if it means 10-hour shifts during the hottest parts of the day. He comes prepared. In his van he\u2019s packed a cooler with 15 ready-to-drink water bottles, six frozen water bottles and five Gatorades. He fills every other bottle with a packet of electrolyte mix. He stashes one of two small towels on ice \u2013 and switches them out between deliveries to drape over his head and neck. \u201cThis is my AC,\u201d he said, gesturing to the moistened material around his shoulders as sweat and runoff darken his blue shirt. \u201cIt can be rough,\u201d he admits. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t doing everything you can to mitigate it you\u2019re going to have a problem.\u201d In California, steps are being taken to protect children from the extreme heat. Today, governor Gavin Newsom announced a new $47m initiative funded by CAL FIRE to replace asphalt on school grounds with more greenery, making outdoor spaces cooler for children who are disproportionately impacted by extreme heat. The move is part of Newsom\u2019s Extreme Heat Action Plan announced in 2022. In a press release, Newsom said: California is heading into a hotter, drier future and extreme heat will only become more dangerous. We\u2019re taking action to protect our kids \u2013 especially in underserved communities \u2013 from hotter temperatures with our best defense: nature. We\u2019re helping schools tear out asphalt that can reach 140 degrees on hot days \u2013 planting trees for shade and adding other plants to provide kids with safer, cooler spaces at school. California is battling a major heatwave that will bring triple-digit temperatures. Temperatures as high as 125 -130 degrees are expected in California\u2019s Death Valley this weekend. Fish are not the only type of wildlife that get displaced. Eldridge\u2019s wife noticed a number of displaced skunks in Montpelier in the immediate aftermath of this week\u2019s flood. They had likely been nesting in the banks of the Winooski River and its tributary streams before they were flooded. Muskrats and weasels, too, were likely displaced. One of the most distressing sights around Montpelier in recent days have been the bodies of beavers hit by cars on the roads. Tyler Brown, a wildlife specialist with the department who specializes in beavers and runs the beaver baffle project, which helps to protect beaver-created habitats and studies how their dams can help slow flooding, says the Vermont floods this week will have displaced the beaver population \u2013 but only temporarily. When we get this amount rainfall in so short a time it is likely that beavers will have been displaced from their dams because it\u2019s not likely that a beaver dam could withstand that amount of water,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWhen it comes to normal thunderstorm-type flooding, beaver dams hold and add capacity for capturing water, and allow water to spill over into wetland areas and release it slowly.\u201d But in a catastrophic flood like on Monday, he says, \u201cit depends on where the dams are in the watershed.\u201d While it is possible some beavers may have died in the flooding \u2013 there were reports of beavers swimming around during the high-water period of the storm \u2013 Brown predicts the overall population will be just fine. \u201cLike humans, beavers are pretty resilient, so they\u2019re likely already rebuilding to re-create their habitats,\u201d he said. We will just leave them be and let them figure it out. They know their habitat pretty well, so they\u2019re going to move back to suitable sites in their wetland habitats where there are a lot of young trees \u2013 willows, alders, maples \u2013 to eat the phloem, or inner layer of bark. Overall, wildlife populations tend to bounce back after flooding events while populations of bears, dear and turkey tend to move temporarily to higher ground. \u201cOur wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable,\u201d Brown emphasized, \u201cso they\u2019ll be able to rebound.\u201d The toll to wildlife from climate crisis-related weather events is an area that often gets overlooked in their immediate aftermath. But after the flooding in Vermont this week, previous weather calamities \u2013 including Tropical Storm Irene, in 2011 \u2013 can offer some clues. Fish in Vermont\u2019s rivers, primarily species of trout \u2013 brook, rainbow and brown \u2013 have been found to move upriver during increased water flow to less turbulent areas, including tributaries or flooded fields, or find refuge behind fallen trees or rocks. \u201cThis is definitely unprecedented, but studies of smaller floods show that often fish are not displaced and are in the same pools before and after a flood,\u201d said Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont\u2019s fish and wildlife department. \u201cThey can often survive in place by finding some refuge behind a structure or ride the edges of the flow up into the flood plain.\u201d After Hurricane Irene, though, some fish populations fell by 50%, Eldridge says. But the silver lining is that fish populations do recover pretty quickly, and they can do that because there is less impact in the headwaters and smaller streams, or they can migrate and recolonize areas that have been impacted,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we work hard to protect those headwaters and also provide connectivity between streams and systems. With the National Weather Service forecasting triple-digit temperatures for the coming days, officials in Sacramento, California, are activating cooling centers to offer relief from the heat. Some spaces are opening specifically as weather respite centers, while others are offering extended hours in public lobbies or are available for this use during regular business hours. Public libraries and city community centers are open during their regular business hours for people to use these air-conditioned buildings as places to cool off. The city also is activating the outreach and engagement center as a weather respite location, offering space for pets and belongings in addition to water, snacks and device recharging. The severe thunderstorm watch issued until this evening for large swaths of the east coast and parts of the midwest will also affect already hard-hit Vermont. New worries come amid the clean up efforts in the state, which is recovering from this week\u2019s historic heavy floods that destroyed homes and businesses and left debris in their wake. \u201cThis is not expected to be a repeat of Monday and Tuesday, but it will be dangerous in the areas that experience flash flooding,\u201d Vermont Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison said Thursday. Morrison confirmed there were no deaths reported from earlier floods. Governor Phil Scott issued a warning to \u201cremain vigilant and have a plan.\u201d A heat dome over California is expected to bring triple-digit temperatures and heightened fire danger. All but California\u2019s coastal regions will be facing extreme temperatures. In the agricultural Central Valley, the towns of Bakersfield, Fresno and Merced could see temperatures of up to 109F (43C) on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. Predictions for some parts of the valley could reach up to 117F. \u201cDangerous heat will result in a major to extreme risk for heat-related illnesses for much of the population, especially those who are heat sensitive and those without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration,\u201d warned the National Weather Service. In Death Valley, temperatures could break the 2021 record of 130F. The dry heat will desiccate brush, creating the ideal conditions for wildfire. Though strong winds are not expected though most of inland California, gusty conditions along the state\u2019s Interstate 5 could exacerbate risks of a runaway blaze. The NWS is warning residents to stay indoors, in cooled environments. Here are the latest images from the newswires showing the damage wreaked by a possible tornado in Colon, Michigan. The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm watch for parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Emergency crews in Ottawa, Canada, are responding to reports of a possible tornado in a suburb in the city\u2019s south end. Ottawa fire services said it had reports of a tornado in Barrhaven, and photos and videos posted to social media reportedly showed a funnel ground touching down in the area. Environment Canada issued a tornado warning for Ottawa earlier today, warning of a \u201cdangerous and potentially life-threatening situation\u201d and urged residents to take cover immediately if threatening weather approaches. In a statement, the weather agency said: Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a severe thunderstorm that is possibly producing a tornado. Damaging winds, large hail and locally intense rainfall are also possible. The developing Ni\u00f1o has been closely watched by scientists as it is compounding the excess heat spurred by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. Last week was, preliminary data suggests, the hottest week ever reliably recorded, following a June that was the hottest ever documented globally. The developing Ni\u00f1o is likely to push the world towards even more record-breaking temperatures, scientists warn, as the tangible impacts of the climate crisis continue to unfold. Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, said: We have a major El Ni\u00f1o event on our hands, it will certainly continue to develop, and it will almost certainly contribute to 2023 being the hottest year on record. The combination of human-caused warming and this emerging event is already wreaking havoc across the northern hemisphere this summer in the form of record heat, drought, wildfires and floods. Mild El Ni\u00f1o climatic conditions brewing in the Pacific Ocean will strengthen throughout the year, with an outside chance of a record-breaking event that will further turbocharge already sweltering temperatures around the globe, scientists have forecast. Last month saw a \u201cweak\u201d El Ni\u00f1o form, a periodic climatic event where the circulation of the equatorial Pacific Ocean shifts and its temperature rises, causing knock-on heat around the world, according to an update from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). This Ni\u00f1o, which has replaced a three-year period of its reverse condition, La Ni\u00f1a, which typically cools the globe, will almost certainly strengthen throughout the year, with an 81% chance it will peak with a \u201cmoderate to strong intensity\u201d between November and January, Noaa said. There is a one-in-five chance that this event will be of \u201chistoric\u201d strength, rivaling the major one experienced in 1997, Noaa said. Even if the record is not threatened, however, \u201cEl Ni\u00f1os tend to elevate global mean temperatures, so I would not expect this event to be an exception,\u201d said Michelle L\u2019Heureux, a Noaa meteorologist. Severe thunderstorms are likely today across eastern New York and western Vermont, extending into parts of the Ohio Valley, the National Weather Service\u2019s storm prediction center said. Damaging winds, large hail, and perhaps a couple of tornadoes are possible in these areas, it said. It also said that additional severe thunderstorms are likely today across portions of the southern and central Plains. Large hail and damaging winds will be the primary hazards with these storms, along with a tornado or two possible. The National Weather Service in Jackson has issued a flash flood emergency for Louisville with catastrophic damage possible. Torrential rains from slow-moving thunderstorms have prompted urgent water rescues, with the NWS confirming reports of multiple cars and structures flooded. The worst rain on Thursday morning was reported in Louisville, where more than 6-12 inches had already fallen with 3-5 more inches of rain still on the way, falling at rates of 2-3 inches per hour, according to the NWS. Winston County Sheriff Jason Pugh told Fox: We\u2019ve had several vehicles go head first into deep water. In two locations, we have two vehicles that are under water completely. Many of the surface streets and highways in Louisville were under water, he added. The water is getting steadily deeper at this point, and it is making it hard to respond to people in homes and residences. We\u2019re urging people that if they need us, we will get to them, and for them to try to stay safe until we can get there and get them saved. From WCBI News\u2019 meteorologist, Dylan Hudler: Kate Williams, a Vermont environmental campaigner who serves as CEO of 1% for the Planet, a charity that advises individuals and corporations, including Patagonia, on how to support environmental solutions, says the flooding in the state \u201chighlights the intimacy of devastation\u201d. She says: What we experienced here hit one community and not the next -- and that is exactly what\u2019s happening in communities all over the world The localized and often seemingly random nature of climate-change related events highlights, Williams says, the importance of knowing local non-profit organizations so that support can be targeted accurately. Environmental events, Williams acknowledges, can feel extremely personal. \u201cBut they also really point out how we are all connected.\u201d In 2011, her town of Waitsfield, 20 minutes from Montpelier, was \u201chammered\u201d, while Montpelier was not as badly affected. This week, the situation was reversed. Whether it my community or your community, it\u2019s all of us on one planet. Williams advises her clients to make a choice -- to help locally to prevent or mitigate the effects of climate-change, or to act in terms of larger policy changes. Either way, she says, it has to align with something you care about. For people in Vermont, if they\u2019re feeling crushed by what they\u2019re seeing, they can make a local contribution. Others may be more systems orientated and want to give to give toward changing climate policy that\u2019s affecting their local environment. \u201cGiving is on one level a most human act but it can also be hard,\u201d Williams says. It\u2019s good to take the time, without getting stuck and paralyzed, to think through what\u2019s meaningful to you. Last month was the hottest June globally on record on both land and sea, scientists have said. Ocean temperatures reached record-breaking highs for the month of June, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its monthly global climate report. The average global surface (land and ocean) temperature in June was 1.89 F above average, 0.23F warmer than the previous record set in June 2020, it said. Last month also marked the 47th-consecutive June and the 532nd-consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th-century average, it added. For the third consecutive month, the global ocean surface temperature hit a record high as weak El Ni\u00f1o conditions that emerged in May continued to strengthen in June. June 2023 also saw the lowest sea ice coverage for any June on record, according to the NOAA. Earth\u2019s global sea ice extent in June 2023 was 330,000 square miles less than the previous record low from June 2019. It should come as no surprise that Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who has accepted massive donations from oil and gas companies, is defending the fossil fuel industry\u2019s interests, said Allie Rosenbluth, US program co-manager at environmental advocacy and research non-profit Oil Change International. She said: What is really devastating for communities who are experiencing extreme heat, wildfires, flooding and drought across the US is that because of these bought-out politicians, they are not getting the support that they need to be resilient to the face of climate impacts at the federal level. House Republicans are fighting climate spending, too. To avoid a government shutdown, lawmakers must pass a slew of spending bills before current funding expires on 30 September. But Republican members of the GOP-controlled House appropriations committee are slipping in anti-climate provisions, which aim to block renewable energy funding and imperil federal efforts to tackle the climate crisis, into their spending bill drafts. Last week, the Clean Budget Coalition \u2013 a group of non-profits such as the League of Conservation Voters, Environmental Defense Fund and Public Citizen \u2013 identified at least 17 of these \u201cclimate poison pills\u201d in appropriation bill drafts. Among them are amendments that would prevent the federal government from purchasing electric vehicles or building EV charging stations; block funding for the Green Climate Fund, which helps developing countries meet their climate goals under the Paris agreement; and prohibit funding for a Department of Energy initiative aiming to send 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to flow to disadvantaged communities. Elizabeth Gore, senior vice-president for political affairs at Environmental Defense Fund, said these proposals will impede lawmakers\u2019 chance to reach a budget deal before their fall deadline. She said in a release: This is not a starting point for any reasonable negotiations. Swaths of the US are baking under record-breaking heat, yet some lawmakers are still attempting to block any spending to fight the climate crisis, advocates say. Nearly 90 million Americans are facing heat alerts this week, including in Las Vegas, Nevada, which may break its all-time hottest temperature record; Phoenix, Arizona, which will likely break its streak of consecutive days of temperatures over 110F; and parts of Florida, where a marine heatwave has pushed up water temperatures off the coast to levels normally found in hot tubs. Stifling heat is also blanketing parts of Texas, which for weeks earlier this summer sweltered under a record-shattering heat dome which one analysis found was made five times more likely by the climate crisis. Despite this, the state\u2019s Republican Senator Ted Cruz is rallying his fellow GOP members of the Senate commerce committee to circulate a memo attacking climate measures in Biden\u2019s proposed 2024 budget, Fox News reported on Wednesday. The memo specifically calls on Republican members of the Senate appropriations commerce, justice, science subcommittee to reject spending provisions focused on climate resilience and environmental justice efforts for scientific agencies. In one example, the memo objects to a Nasa request to fund its Sustainable Flight National Partnership, which seeks to help zero out planet-warming pollution from aviation. The memo says: If the goal is to make imperceptible changes in CO2 emissions as part of the administration\u2019s zealous effort to micromanage global temperatures, then NASA should abandon such wasted mental energy. NASA should not become a plaything for anti-fossil fuel environmentalists. National Weather Service teams are surveying the damage after severe storms spawned multiple tornadoes across the Chicago area and northeast Illinois, ripping roofs from buildings, knocking down trees and disrupting hundreds of flights. There were at least five reported tornadoes in Illinois on Wednesday \u2013 two in Cook county and one each in DuPage, Kane and McHenry counties. The weather service warned on Wednesday evening that a confirmed tornado was on the ground near Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare international airport. The twister reportedly damaged warehouses on the west side of the airport, but there were no reports of injuries. More than 170 flights departing O\u2019Hare airport were canceled and more than 500 delayed, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware. The storm moved into Michigan before passing through the state and into Canada early this morning, AP reported. What are some signs of heat stress? \u201cHeat stress is a spectrum,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Washington. Symptoms can range from small, reddish blisters on one\u2019s hands to fainting. In extreme cases, if the body temperature rises above 103F (39C), it can result in a heatstroke, which can cause the brain and other internal organs to swell, and can be fatal. Who is most affected by heat stress? Children, the elderly and pregnant people are among the most vulnerable to heat stress. \u201cAthletes and outdoor workers can be at much higher risk for heat stress,\u201d Ebi said, as the more people move or work, the more heat their bodies have to get rid of. These circumstances are more fraught for people like farm workers, who need to be protected against physical or chemical hazards, such as pesticides. They must wear protective clothing, which can interfere with their bodies\u2019 ability to evaporate sweat. There is more news on the excessive heat warning in Texas: It comes after Houston officials said they may open cooling centers to allow people to shelter from the sweltering temperatures. In California, employers were reminded to adhere to regulations that require outdoor workers are given water, shade and regular breaks to cool off. The state will be performing spot checks at work sites to make sure the rules are being followed, said Jeff Killip, from the Division of Occupational Safety &amp; Health. The AP reports: Forecasters said the long-duration heat wave is extremely dangerous, especially for elderly people, homeless residents and other vulnerable populations. The heat could persist into next week as a high pressure dome moves west from Texas. In Arizona, temperatures have hit 110 degrees (43.3 C) for more than a dozen consecutive days. Horse racing events were canceled at the California State Fair near the state capital over concerns for animal safety. Meanwhile, California\u2019s wildfire season was ramping up amid the hot, dry conditions with a series of blazes erupting across the state this week, said Secretary Wade Crowfoot of the Natural Resources Agency. \u201cAs we get deeper into the summer and vegetation that grew up during the wet spring dries out, we are seeing an uptick in wildfire activity,\u201d Crowfoot said Wednesday during a state media briefing. Crowfoot said global climate change was \u201csupercharging\u201d heat waves. California has instituted a $400 million extreme heat action plan to protect workers, help vulnerable communities and assist local communities in opening cooling centers. Officials said the state\u2019s power system, which was strained to the point of widespread blackouts in recent years, has been fortified and should be able to withstand the latest heat wave. The California Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid, said battery storage capacity reached 5,600 megawatts on July 1 \u2014 enough to power more than 3.8 million homes for up to four hours before recharging. \u201cThe batteries being added to the grid are charged during the day, when solar power is abundant, and dispatched primarily in the evening hours when demand is still high and the sun is setting and solar capacity diminishing,\u201d Cal ISO said in a statement. Meterologist Ben Frechette from NBC5 reported that a tornado risk is going up slightly in north-eastern NewYork state: As some parts of the US are sweltering, Vermont was bracing for more rain on Thursday. Ed Helmore writes: Water levels throughout the state were dropping on Thursday after last weekend\u2019s surprise deluge that devastated state capital Montpelier. But the state was bracing for more rain as the clean-up started. At a press conference on Wednesday, Gov. Phil Scott urged Vermonters to remain vigilant as weather forecasters warned of 1-2 more inches of rain could fall on saturated ground. \u201cThis may not be over,\u201d Scott said. Vermont public safety commissioner Jennifer Morrison said that flooding concerns remain for the Winooski River, which broke its banks to flood Montpelier, as well as other rivers in the hard-hit region. Boil water notices were posted for 12 districts. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said that he thought Vermonters \u201call understand that we are now living through the worst natural disaster to impact the state since 1927.\u201d The clean-up was well underway in Montpelier. \u201dEveryone has stepped up to make sure that the community is in good shape,\u201d said Marek Zajac, 30, a volunteer at an AmeriCorps tent at the top of Main Street. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same people come back over and over. After they\u2019ve finished helping at one place, they come back to ask for the next place. They\u2019re covered in mud, and just willing and happy to go out again.\u201d The National Weather Service in Phoenix has urged residents not to underestimate the hot temperatures over the weekend. They\u2019ve tweeted a map showing temperatures forecast to reach up to 120F in some areas: Heat stress occurs when the body experiences a buildup of heat, at a level that is more than what it can release. \u201cThe human body has this fantastic ability to cool through sweat evaporation,\u201d said Uwe Reischl, professor in the school of public and population health at Boise State University. But even when the body is producing sweat, the evaporation can be limited due to humidity in the air. Another factor that causes body temperature to increase is when a person wears clothing that prevents sweat from being released from skin. And when the body doesn\u2019t have enough water, it becomes dehydrated to the point that it isn\u2019t able to produce sweat any more. \u201cHeat stress is a spectrum,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Washington. Symptoms can range from small, reddish blisters on one\u2019s hands to fainting. In extreme cases, if the body temperature rises above 103F (39C), it can result in a heatstroke, which can cause the brain and other internal organs to swell, and can be fatal. Children, the elderly and pregnant people are among the most vulnerable to heat stress. \u201cAthletes and outdoor workers can be at much higher risk for heat stress,\u201d Ebi said, as the more people move or work, the more heat their bodies have to get rid of. These circumstances are more fraught for people like farm workers, who need to be protected against physical or chemical hazards, such as pesticides. They must wear protective clothing, which can interfere with their bodies\u2019 ability to evaporate sweat. Here\u2019s more from my colleague Edward Helmore in Montpelier. He spoke to Mike Foster, who rents a now-devastated vinyl records store. Like many in the town, he had no flood insurance on his properties because the premiums were too steep. Foster said: This was a perfect storm. It\u2019s been a wet summer so the ground was saturated. Something has definitely changed. The winters start later and end earlier than when I was a kid.\u201d But as the mud begins to turn to dust, kicking up choking clouds behind emergency vehicles, many said they were too busy straightening Montpelier to begin to digest what had hit them. Psychotherapist Kelli O\u2019Neill said: People are in shock and trying to figure out what to do. I\u2019m sure a lot of us will get flooded with calls in a few days when it really hits people.\u201d O\u2019Neill said it struck her as sad that Vermont, and Montpelier in particular, had been hit so hard. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of climate-conscious people here. Just people living and working. There are no corporations here, it\u2019s all small businesses.\u201d Here are the latest images from the newswires showing the damage wreaked by the tornadoes sweeping across Illinois: Montpelier, the state capital of Vermont, began to clean up after the flooding. Here\u2019s the latest from my colleague Edward Helmore on the ground: As stacks of sodden furniture piled up in heaps on the sidewalk and the post-disaster din of pumps and generators filled the air, some began to reflect on the unsparing nature of extreme weather made more frequent, intense, and unpredictable by climate change. The town is a liberal enclave in Vermont, and dotted with health food shops, book and clothes stores, Subarus, bicycles, many of its residents bearing the hallmarks of what some parts of America would term an alternative, climate-conscious life. \u201dIt\u2019s pretty typical,\u201d said regenerative farmer Yay Margison. \u201cThe smoke we get here isn\u2019t from our fires and the weird climate stuff comes here but not from here. It\u2019s ironic is what it is.\u201d If Montpelier has a message for the world, Margison added, it is \u201cthis is what your toxic lifestyle is doing to other people. Your wastefulness is affecting everybody. This is the effect of the people in power making money. This is capitalism.\u201d There were no immediate reports of injuries but the storms forced authorities to ground all departures of commercial flights into O\u2019Hare and Midway airports, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. More than 300 flights in and out of O\u2019Hare and another 32 in and out of Midway were canceled, according to FlightAware, while hundreds of people sought shelter at O\u2019Hare. Lynn Becker, a longtime Chicago resident, posted video to Twitter with the sirens sounding out across the city\u2019s skyline. \u201cI\u2019m in a 60-story apartment building so my options are somewhat limited,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to, I assume, go into the core of the building. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain panic when you\u2019re watching a TV screen and everything is in red \u2026 but the hope is that the damage is minimal,\u201d he said. You can read our full report here: The National Weather Service has tweeted a map this morning showing where its experts suspect tornadoes may have touched down on Wednesday evening. The map shows between 5pm and 7pm local time, multiple tornadoes tracked across parts of northeast Illinois \u2013 with some happening close to each other. In the tweet, the NWS added: \u201cOur team will be out surveying damage today to determine exactly where these tornadoes tracked.\u201d The US south-west is bracing for another day of triple-digit temperatures and an increased risk of wildfires on Thursday after days of record heat and dry conditions. Across the US, more than 111 million people were under extreme heat advisories, watches and warnings, mostly in the south-west. Blistering conditions will build on Friday and throughout the weekend in the central and southern parts of California, where many residents should prepare for the hottest weather of the year, the National Weather Service warned. Midday highs were mostly expected to be above 100F (37.7 C), and desert areas could reach 120F (48.8 C), forecasters said. Night time brings little relief with temperatures in the 80s (above 26.6C). An excessive heat watch was in effect through Sunday for interior Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. \u201cPlease plan accordingly, this is not the time to be hiking or be outside for long durations,\u201d the weather service\u2019s LA office said on Twitter. \u201cIf you need to work outside, shift hours to the early morning, take frequent breaks and hydrate!\u201d Meanwhile, tornadoes and thunderstorms battered the Chicago area on Wednesday, forcing airports to halt air traffic and prompting officials to advise residents to seek shelter as tornado sirens echoed through the third largest US city. The National Weather Service reported that a tornado touched down near Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare international airport on Wednesday evening \u2013 one of at least eight tornadoes to hit north-eastern Illinois, including four in Cook county. \u201cThis tornado has been touching the ground intermittently so far and is moving east. There are additional circulations along the line south of O\u2019Hare. Seek shelter if in the warned area,\u201d it said, before reporting less than an hour later that the area was tornado free.

People are being urged to help researchers understand the impact of extreme weather on British butterflies by counting the number and species they see this summer as part of the world\u2019s largest insect survey. The Big Butterfly Count runs for three weeks from Friday. Members of the public are asked to spend 15 minutes in a local park, garden or green space recording the butterflies they see. So far this year, numbers of common butterflies including small tortoiseshells and peacocks whose caterpillars were feeding on nettles late last summer are significantly lower than normal. Dr Zo\u00eb Randle, a senior surveys officer at Butterfly Conservation, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re really concerned about is the survival rates of caterpillars from last summer. Small tortoiseshells have had a dreadful year so far, as have peacock butterflies, and the whites are doing quite poorly as well. \u201cWe want people to take part in the count to generate really important data so we can get a handle on how last summer\u2019s drought affected butterfly species.\u201d There are fears that grass-feeding species have been struck particularly severely by last summer\u2019s heatwave, which turned the grass brown in meadows, fields and parks. Many experts are reporting lower numbers of ringlets than usual, but apparently good numbers of meadow browns and marbled whites have emerged earlier than normal. The Big Butterfly Count will help establish whether or not these species are bouncing back. Randle said that after the 1976 drought it took many of these widespread butterfly species a decade to recover their numbers. With many butterfly species in Britain at the northern edge of their European range, a warming climate should boost their numbers, but data shows that 80% of Britain\u2019s 59 species are declining in either abundance or distribution, with butterflies vanishing from half the places where they once flew since 1976. Last year\u2019s Big Butterfly Count produced the lowest abundance of butterflies in the 13 years of the popular survey. Conservationists attribute these declines to a combination of habitat loss, industrial farming and climatic changes. As temperatures rise, many butterflies cannot move north across inhospitable farmland to find suitable new sites, although a few more mobile species such as the purple emperor and the comma are managing to do this. The impact of last year\u2019s record-breaking temperatures and drought may not be the same everywhere, with a north-south divide emerging in the Big Butterfly Count in recent decades. Once ubiquitous garden species such as the small tortoiseshell \u2013 whose caterpillars feed on nettles \u2013 have become relatively scarce in southern Britain but the butterfly has been much more widely recorded in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Last year there were almost 100,000 15-minute counts, with participants spending a combined total of 2.5 years looking for butterflies. The count, which is run by Butterfly Conservation, is supported by Sir David Attenborough, King Charles and Chris Packham, who launches it this year, and the information gathered helps inform conservation projects as well as the government\u2019s conservation priorities."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b54", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/14/more-than-quarter-of-adults-have-used-generative-ai-artifical-intelligence-survey-suggests", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "More than a quarter of UK adults have used generative AI, survey suggests", "lead": "Adoption rate of latest AI systems exceeds that of voice-assisted smart speakers, with one in 10 using them at least once a day", "author": "Dan Milmo Global technology editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 23:01:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098320", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0b5321d2fc84b18a5b63e9990c08535d998472/0_77_6240_3744/500.jpg", "body": "More than a quarter of UK adults have used generative artificial intelligence such as chatbots, according to survey showing that 4 million people have also used it for work. Generative AI, which refers to AI tools that produce convincing text or images in response to human prompts, has gripped the public imagination since the launch of ChatGPT in November. The rate of adoption of the latest generation of AI systems exceeds that of voice-assisted speakers such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa, according to accounting group Deloitte, which published the survey. Deloitte said 26% of 16- to 75-year-olds have used a generative AI tool, representing about 13 million people, with one in 10 of those respondents using it at least once a day. \u201cIt took five years for voice-assisted speakers to achieve the same adoption levels. It is incredibly rare for any emerging technology to achieve these levels of adoption and frequency of usage so rapidly,\u201d said Paul Lee, a Deloitte partner. The Deloitte survey of 4,150 UK adults found that just over half of the population had heard of generative AI, with around one in 10 respondents \u2013 the equivalent of approximately four million people \u2013 using it for work. ChatGPT became a sensation due to its ability to generate human-seeming responses to a range of queries in different styles, producing articles, essays, jokes, poetry and job applications in response to text prompts. It has been followed by Microsoft\u2019s Bing chatbot, which is based on the same system as ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Bard chatbot and, this week, Claude 2 from US firm Anthropic. Image generators have also taken off, exemplified by a realistic-looking picture of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket, produced by US startup Midjourney. However the ability of such systems to mass produce convincing text, image and even voice at scale has led to warnings that they could become tools for creating large-scale disinformation campaigns. The Deloitte survey found that of those who had used generative AI, more than four out of 10 believe it always produces factually correct answers. One of the biggest flaws in generative AI systems so far is that they are prone to producing glaring factual errors. \u201cGenerative AI technology is, however, still relatively nascent, with user interfaces, regulatory environment, legal status and accuracy still a work in progress,\u201d said Lee."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b55", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/donald-trump-trial-delay-prosecutors-object", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Justice department says \u2018no basis\u2019 to delay Trump\u2019s classified documents trial", "lead": "Prosecutors urged judge to reject Trump\u2019s request to postpone the trial and set December date", "author": "Hugo Lowell", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 23:01:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098340", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/45595b1c7d1fcf3308386eb47ad8fc685e225f05/1945_537_3262_1956/500.jpg", "body": "Federal prosecutors asked the judge presiding over the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case on Thursday to reject Donald Trump\u2019s request that any trial should not take place until after the 2024 presidential election and reset the trial date for December. \u201cThere is no basis in law or fact for proceeding in such an indeterminate and open-ended fashion, and the defendants provide none,\u201d the prosecutors wrote in an 11-page court filing that sharply attacked Trump\u2019s arguments. The dueling requests from Trump and the justice department present an early test for the US district court judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who is under heightened scrutiny for previously issuing favorable rulings to the former president during the criminal investigation. The delay Trump is seeking would be hugely consequential. If the case is not adjudicated until after the 2024 presidential election and Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, is re-elected, he could try to pardon himself or direct the attorney general to have the matter dismissed. Trump was charged last month with the retention of national defense information, including US nuclear secrets and US plans for retaliation in the event of a military attack, which means his case will be subject to the Classified Information Procedures Act, or Cipa. In their court filing submitted on Thursday, prosecutors in the office of special counsel Jack Smith took aim at several of Trump\u2019s arguments for an indefinite delay, rejecting the claims that the charges touched on novel legal issues or that the discovery process was uniquely complex. The filing said that the Presidential Records Act, as claimed by Trump\u2019s lawyers, was not a criminal statute and an argument to suggest that it could be used to dismiss charges of retaining national defense information was close to being frivolous. \u201cThe defendants are, of course, free to make whatever arguments they like for dismissal,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. \u201cBut they should not be permitted to gesture at a baseless legal argument, call it \u2018novel,\u2019 and then claim the court will require an indefinite continuance.\u201d The filing noted that the justice department was prepared to start discovery of the classified documents it expected to use at trial and turn them over to Trump\u2019s lawyers as soon as this week, but the Cipa process was delayed because Trump\u2019s lawyers had not submitted the required forms. Cipa provides a mechanism for the government to charge cases involving classified documents without risking the \u201cgraymail\u201d problem, where the defense threatens to reveal classified information at trial, but the steps that have to be followed mean it takes longer to get to trial. The process includes the government turning over all of the classified information they want to use to the defense in discovery, like any other criminal case, in addition to the non-classified discovery that is done in a separate process. Prosecutors also asked the judge to reject the Trump legal team\u2019s arguments that a December trial date did not reflect precedent, arguing that in the case of the former NSA analyst Reality Winner, a trial date was initially set just months after her arrest and only delayed much later. The filing took particular issue with the Trump lawyers\u2019 suggestion that any trial should be delayed until after the 2024 election because of the supposed difficulty in selecting an impartial jury. \u201cTo be sure, the government readily acknowledges that jury selection here may merit additional protocols (such as a questionnaire) that may be more time-consuming than in other cases, but those are reasons to start the process sooner rather than later,\u201d prosecutors wrote."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b56", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/indigenous-renaissance-maori-hope-matariki-holiday-will-help-cement-status-of-local-knowledge", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Indigenous renaissance: M\u0101ori hope Matariki holiday will help cement status of local knowledge", "lead": "The ancient knowledge systems which underpin the new year holiday in New Zealand can explain everything from the weather to the movement of fish", "author": "Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 22:56:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098369", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa48ab03ecb0cf5d2bd9c2cea2f2e3b3c31657b/0_63_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "In the hours before dawn on Friday\u2019s crisp winter morning, thousands of New Zealanders rose in the dark, donned woollen hats and scarves and ventured outdoors to scan the eastern horizon for the appearance of a cluster of stars. For many, it marked only the first or second time they had participated in the observance of Matariki \u2013 an annual celebration with a long history for the country\u2019s M\u0101ori people, but a relatively brief one for most others in Aotearoa. Often referred to as the M\u0101ori lunar new year, the festival of Matariki marks the mid-winter rising period of its namesake constellation \u2013 commonly known as the Pleiades \u2013 and signifies a time of beginnings and endings, coming together, remembrance of the dead, and traditionally, the planning of crops and planting. So far, the public face of the holiday has been preoccupied with star-gazing. But as Matariki comes to prominence in New Zealand society \u2013 bolstered by its status, since 2022, as a legally enshrined public holiday \u2013 M\u0101ori leaders say they are hopeful the country can learn more of the celebration\u2019s ancient roots, in which the positions of the moon and stars are the foundation for understanding almost every aspect of the natural world. \u201cThis knowledge system explains weather patterns, understanding environments, planting patterns, and understanding nature and the movements of fish and eels,\u201d says Rereata Makiha, who is a specialist in m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori (Indigenous knowledge), and served on the government\u2019s Matariki advisory group. A quiet resurgence of M\u0101ori custom The establishment of the national holiday comes at a time when Indigenous sciences, astronomy, and environmentalism are experiencing a renaissance in New Zealand, reversing decades of dismissal and scorn of the subjects as rooted in myth. Since the 1970s, a slow and quiet resurgence of the customs among M\u0101ori \u2013 who are 15% of New Zealand\u2019s population \u2013 prompted a call to formally recognise Matariki. After an attempt to enshrine the celebration in New Zealand law failed in 2009, the elevation of Matariki to a government-endorsed festival a year ago has provoked questions for New Zealanders about how to celebrate it \u2013 and for M\u0101ori analysts about how its true meaning can be preserved. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging, because you\u2019re up against the northern hemisphere traditions that were brought down here many, many years ago,\u201d says Makiha. But the counter-cultural force of m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori has outlasted attempts to destroy it before, he adds. When the British colonised Aotearoa, \u201cheaps\u201d of the astronomical and scientific knowledge that brought his Polynesian ancestors to New Zealand by celestial navigation was lost, Makiha says. \u201cOur books and teachings only survived because our old people were stubborn enough to move them around to different places so they couldn\u2019t be tracked or found.\u201d Now, many New Zealanders are hungry to know more about the M\u0101ori understanding of the country\u2019s land, skies, and seas, research suggests. A poll of 1,000 New Zealanders conducted in 2022 for the national museum, Te Papa, showed 50% of people took action to mark the holiday in its first official year \u2013 most commonly star-gazing or attendance at community and family events. Ancestral way of thinking gives \u2018permission to disconnect\u2019 In New Zealand\u2019s largest city, Auckland, this year an extensive programme of activities for Matariki this month included a series of workshops about arts, Indigenous healing, space, and time \u2013 all using principles of m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori. \u201cSo many Indigenous cultures across the world follow a lunar and star system, and the sun is only one of those elements,\u201d says Mihi Tibble, who led workshops and is a specialist in maramataka, the M\u0101ori environmental calendar. \u201cIt\u2019s place-based,\u201d she adds. \u201cA lot of our ancestral knowledge comes from understanding your relationship with the environment around you.\u201d The ancestral way of thinking about time and space has been liberating for Tibble, she says, and she hopes to help other New Zealanders access it. \u201cNo flower blooms 24/7, but these days we have 24/7 access to the internet,\u201d she says. \u201cIn teaching maramataka we give ourselves permission to disconnect and we ask, what are the natural rhythms of our time now?\u201d Such teachings could easily become watered-down, meaningless platitudes \u2013 reminiscent of western \u201cwellness\u201d culture \u2013 if Matariki becomes commercialised in the same way as New Zealand\u2019s other holidays have, Makiha and Tibble acknowledge. But after the fight to establish the holiday nationwide, Makiha says iwi (tribes) throughout the country are eager to preserve its unique customs and traditions \u2013 which vary by region \u2013 and prevent the \u201cstandardisation\u201d that he says government involvement threatens. In Hokianga, near the top of the North Island, where Makiha lives, the Matariki constellation is not visible in June and M\u0101ori search instead for the appearance of the star Takarua (Sirius) in the sky, before gathering for a spirited ceremony to \u201cget rid of the rubbish\u201d in their lives and making plans for the new. The system of m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori is so local that even the number and length of the seasons varies by region. In New Zealand, an island nation that experiences wildly varying weather, Makiha says an understanding of the Indigenous calendar has helped his iwi to better explain and predict an increasingly volatile climate, and led to innovation in crops and fisheries. The fledgling recognition of M\u0101ori sciences has not been universally embraced. This month some teachers criticised the inclusion of m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori in a leaked draft of New Zealand\u2019s proposed new science curriculum for schools. Meanwhile, detractors of te reo M\u0101ori \u2013 an official language of New Zealand \u2013 have in recent weeks criticised proposals to make the country\u2019s road signs bilingual. Both policies have also drawn support. Often fraught debates on such matters play out on social media, where Sonny Ngatai \u2013 an advocate for te reo who runs a M\u0101ori promotion and production company \u2013 is attempting to raise awareness of and participation in Matariki among \u201cevery day\u201d New Zealanders in a culturally sensitive and accurate way. He believes it\u2019s possible \u2013 in the face of a sometimes uncivil public discourse. This year, he has partnered with New Zealand\u2019s M\u0101ori Language Commission to encourage other social media users in learning a kaik\u014dhau, or expression of \u201chope and good vibes\u201d \u2013 the perfect fusion of traditional and modern, he says. His message, he says, is that Matariki is \u201cfor everyone to reclaim\u201d \u2013 not only M\u0101ori. \u201cMy dream would be that 20 years from now, New Zealand has made the bold decision to change our time and our seasons to the June of Matariki,\u201d Ngatai adds. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll say happy new year not on 1 January, but when Matariki rises.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b57", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/14/philip-lowe-to-be-replaced-as-rba-governor-with-cabinet-meeting-to-decide-successor", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Philip Lowe to be replaced as RBA governor with successor named after cabinet meeting", "lead": "Anthony Albanese says when it comes to the next leader of the Reserve Bank \u2018we will make that decision as a cabinet\u2019", "author": "Paul Karp and Peter Hannam", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 22:54:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098387", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d9dcd15a720d28592c02ffa61c318f7d8d107b27/0_231_6606_3963/500.jpg", "body": "Philip Lowe will be replaced as the Reserve Bank governor, with cabinet meeting to decide his successor.

The strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra), which will begin on Friday, will mark the first time in 63 years that Hollywood writers and actors are striking simultaneously. Hollywood writers went on strike in early May. Now the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) will be joined by some of Sag-Aftra\u2019s 160,000 members. \u201cAt some point you have to say no: we are not going to take this any more,\u201d Fran Drescher, the Sag-Aftra president, said in a press conference. \u201cYou cannot change the business model as much as it has changed and not change the contract too. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we are all in trouble,\u201d she said. The simultaneous strikes are expected to halt the majority of Hollywood\u2019s film and TV production, and have major effects on the broader Los Angeles economy. With some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars on strike, press junkets for summer and fall movie premieres will be cancelled, and the Emmy awards will probably be postponed. Workers across LA are gearing up to survive for weeks or months without wages. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the trade association that represents studios, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed that Sag-Aftra has decided to walk away from negotiations\u201d. \u201cRather than continuing to negotiate, Sag-Aftra has put us on a course that will deepen the financial hardship for thousands who depend on the industry for their livelihoods,\u201d the AMPTP said. Members of Sag-Aftra and the WGA voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if needed. Members are asking for increases in base pay and residuals as film and TV shows have increasingly moved to online streaming platforms, and assurances that their work will not be replaced by artificial intelligence or their digital image will not be used without their permission. Major movie stars in recent days spoke out about how the transition to streaming has affected less famous union members. \u201cYou have to make $26,000 a year to qualify for your health insurance and there are a lot of people who get across that threshold through their residual payments,\u201d Matt Damon said at a promotional event held for the film Oppenheimer on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s money being made and it needs to be allocated in a way that takes care of people who are on the margins.\u201d AMPTP said it had offered the highest percentage increases in minimum pay levels in 35 years, \u201csubstantial increases\u201d in pension and healthcare contribution caps, a 76% increase in foreign residuals paid from big-budget streaming shows and \u201ca groundbreaking AI proposal\u201d. In recent weeks, Hollywood\u2019s top acting talent had made it clear they were willing to strike. In late June, a letter from Hollywood A-listers, including Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence, urged their union leaders not to settle for a mediocre deal in what they saw as a historically important contract negotiation. Sag-Aftra and the studios had been negotiating for weeks, but failed to reach an agreement by the deadline of midnight on Wednesday. In a statement on Thursday, the actors\u2019 union said its negotiating committee had voted unanimously to recommend a strike, and that its national board would decide on the matter on Thursday morning. It said: \u201cAfter more than four weeks of bargaining, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) \u2013 the entity that represents major studios and streamers, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros Discovery \u2013 remains unwilling to offer a fair deal on the key issues that are essential to Sag-Aftra members.\u201d Drescher, Sag-Aftra\u2019s president, said: \u201cThe companies have refused to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us.\u201d Her message to studio executives, Drescher said at Thursday\u2019s press conference, was, \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on the wrong side of history. Shame on you. \u201cYou know what? Eventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles. And then it\u2019s over. We\u2019re at that moment right now,\u201d Drescher said. The strike is not only expected to shut down US based productions, but will also hamper many overseas shoots involving members. Some production work not involving Sag-Aftra performers can proceed. A strike is also expected to have an immediate impact on publicity efforts for the summer\u2019s top films; the Thursday evening premiere of Oppenheimer in London was moved to start an hour earlier so the cast could attend regardless of the outcome, but the actors left before the screening, Deadline reported. Other major commercial films including Barbie and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One have already hosted their world premieres, though their stars will be restricted from participating in further promotional events. The strike might also delay the Emmy awards until late autumn, or even next year, industry publications reported. Disney has announced that a 15 July premiere of its movie Haunted Mansion will still take place at Disneyland regardless of the strikes, though the film\u2019s actors \u2013 including LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, and Jamie Lee Curtis \u2013 will not be present. San Diego Comic-Con, scheduled to begin on 20 July, will be affected as well. Hollywood writers have been on strike since 2 May. The beginning of that strike was marked by strong solidarity from Hollywood\u2019s other unionised workforces, including the powerful Teamsters\u2019 union, and Sag-Aftra members showed up in solidarity at Writers Guild of America picket lines, even before their own strike was called. Anonymous industry sources told Deadline this week that studio executives did not plan to resume negotiations with the striking writers until late October. \u201cThe endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses,\u201d an industry source was quoted as saying, with another saying the goal was to \u201cbreak the WGA\u201d. A spokesperson for the studios denied those anonymous claims, telling Deadline in a statement that the companies \u201care committed to reaching a deal\u201d. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union\u2019s chief negotiator, said Sag-Aftra\u2019s 1960 strike had won its members a health plan and television residuals. \u201cThis is the same kind of strike \u2013 a strike that makes sure our members\u2019 livelihoods are not taken away by artificial intelligence,\u201d he said.

As well as defeat to the French side in an enthralling contest, Paul Wellens\u2019s team were left to rue a bruising evening on the field after their talismanic captain, James Roby, and the centre Mark Percival were ruled out of next week\u2019s Challenge Cup semi-final against Leigh, with both failing head-injury assessments. Roby and Percival will now be subject to mandatory 11-day stand-downs. If Saints do not make the final in their absence then Roby, the club\u2019s all-time record appearance holder who will retire at the end of the season, will have played his final Challenge Cup game. Consequently, this was a night with far greater ramifications than a defeat that left St Helens\u2019 own playoff hopes in the balance. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to take but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d Wellens said. \u201cIt was frustrating but the players were fantastic. I\u2019m really proud of them.\u201d His side played their part in an entertaining clash between two teams few would begrudge meeting again in the playoffs. Two points split them at half-time, with Tom Johnstone\u2019s long-range try cancelled out by Percival\u2019s effort for St Helens. An early penalty from Adam Keighran ultimately gave Catalans an 8-6 lead at the break. But the second half did not go as planned for St Helens. They fell further behind courtesy of Matt Ikuvalu\u2019s try before Roby and Percival succumbed to head injuries. News then filtered through that both had failed their assessments, ruling them out of this contest and next weekend\u2019s game against Leigh. \u201cIt could have gone either way, but it was a very semi-final-style game,\u201d the Catalans coach, Steve McNamara, reflected after an absorbing contest. St Helens narrowed the gap to two points in the dying moments courtesy of a Lewis Dodd try and a Joey Lussick goal, and they even had chances to snatch it in the final seconds.

Republicans criticized Khan \u2013 an outspoken critic of big tech \u2013 for \u201cmismanagement\u201d and for \u201cpoliticizing\u201d legal action against large companies such as Twitter and Google as head of the powerful antitrust agency. In his opening statement, the committee chair, Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, said Khan had given herself and the FTC \u201cunchecked power\u201d by taking aggressive steps to regulate practices at big tech companies such as Twitter. He said Khan carried out \u201ctargeted harassment against Twitter\u201d by asking for all communications related to Elon Musk, including conversations with journalists, following Musk\u2019s acquisition because she does not share his political views. Khan, a former journalist, said the company had \u201ca history of lax security and privacy policies\u201d that did not begin with Musk. Other Democrats agreed. \u201cProtecting user privacy is not political,\u201d said Congressman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat of New York, in response to Jordan\u2019s remarks. Republicans also condemned Khan for allegedly wasting government money by pursuing more legal action to prevent mergers than her predecessors \u2013 but losing. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled against the FTC\u2019s attempt to delay Microsoft from acquiring the video game company Activision Blizzard, saying the agency failed to prove it would decrease competition and harm consumers. The FTC is appealing against that ruling. \u201cShe has pushed investigations to burden parties with vague and costly demands without any substantive follow-through, or, frankly, logic, for the requests themselves,\u201d said Jordan. Another Republican member, Darrell Issa, of California, called Khan a \u201cbully\u201d for trying to prevent mergers. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve taken the idea that companies should have to be less competitive in order to merge, [and] that every merger has to be somehow bad for the company and good for the consumer \u2013 a standard that cannot be met,\u201d Issa said. Khan earlier came under scrutiny from Republicans for participating in an FTC case reviewing Meta\u2019s attempt to acquire a virtual reality company despite a recommendation from an ethics official to recuse herself. She defended her decision to remain on the case on Thursday, saying she consulted with the ethics official. Khan testified she had \u201cnot a penny\u201d in the company\u2019s financial stock and thus did not violate ethics laws. But enforcing antitrust laws for big tech companies such as Twitter has traditionally been a bipartisan issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a little strange that you have this real antipathy among the Republicans of Lina Khan, who in many ways is doing exactly what the Republicans say needs to be done, which is bringing a lot more antitrust scrutiny of big tech,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a professor on antitrust law and enforcement at the University of Michigan Law School. \u201cThere\u2019s a broad consensus that we need to do more, but that\u2019s kind of where the agreement ends,\u201d he said. Republicans distrust big tech companies over issues of censorship, political bias and cultural influence, whereas Democrats come from a traditional scrutiny of corporations and concentration of economic power, said Crane. \u201cI don\u2019t fundamentally think she\u2019s doing something other than what she was put in office to do,\u201d he said. Congress has not yet passed a major antitrust statute that would be favorable to the FTC in these court battles and does not seem to be pursuing one any time soon, said Crane. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to lose a lot of cases, and that\u2019s foreseen.\u201d The FTC\u2019s list of battles with big tech companies is growing. Hours earlier on Thursday, Twitter \u2013 which now legally goes by X Corp \u2013 asked a federal court to terminate a 2011 settlement with the FTC that placed restrictions on its user data and privacy practices. Khan noted Twitter voluntarily entered into that agreement. Also on Thursday, the Washington Post reported the FTC opened an investigation into OpenAI on whether its chatbot, ChatGPT, is harmful to consumers. A spokesperson for the FTC would not comment on the OpenAI investigation but Khan said during the hearing that \u201cit has been publicly reported\u201d.

Many of those, according to results we are about to receive courtesy of the three volunteers in Celebrity Save Our Sperm, are not swimming too merrily either. At the moment, one in every six couples has trouble conceiving and if sperm counts continue on their current trajectory we will be looking at infertility as the norm within a very few decades. Can matters be \u2013 uh \u2013 taken into one\u2019s own hand and improved on an individual basis, asks this surprisingly sober, but not sombre, celebrity-fronted documentary? And, because deadlines make better telly, can it be done in 10 weeks? Radio 1 DJ and television presenter Melvin Odoom (42, no children, his mum rings him weekly about this oversight), comedian Russell Kane (47, one child) and Made in Chelsea\u2019s Ollie Locke (married to Gareth and on their third round of IVF with a surrogate mother who has so far had two miscarriages) provide a cupful of the necessary to be analysed by a fertility clinic. Melvin\u2019s mother, it turns out, has nothing to worry about on the physical score. Ollie discovers that only a third, instead of the average two thirds, of his sperm have healthy DNA. And Russell, much to his shock, discovers that he is functionally infertile. \u201cI\u2019m feeling something irrational after that,\u201d he says. It is a foretaste of the deeper questioning that begins as the show goes on. Initially, there are the standard semi-pointless japes. Testicles hang below the body because sperm do best at cooler temperatures, you say? Into a plunge pool with you all! A diet full of fresh meat, fish and vegetables is good for them? Let\u2019s look inside Melvin\u2019s sweetie cupboard, point out Russell\u2019s daily 14-espressos habit and throw in \u201cone study\u201d that shows that as little as one sugary drink a day can lower sperm count by a third! Soon, though, more interesting phenomena \u2013 both practical and psychological \u2013 emerge (though I would not like to go unmentioned the expressions on the three men\u2019s faces as they watch a demonstration of a ball-massage technique under the unsmiling guidance of body work and intimacy coach Libby Shepherd. It improves blood flow, she tells them, as her associate, Lazlo, drags on his scrotum and kneads his testes. \u201cThen verily, let my genitals necrotise\u201d seems to be the unspoken consensus of the audience. Poor lads). Amid the light relief, though, Russell gradually unpicks his reaction to the news about his fertility. His family, he feels, is complete \u2013 so it\u2019s his pride, his masculinity, that has been attacked. \u201cUntil you realise that men\u2019s brains are capable of divorcing child creation from sperm count,\u201d he notes, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to solve the stigma.\u201d There are frightening slides from Professor Richard Lee, head of research in reproductive biology at Nottingham University, showing the stilling and sticky clumping of sperm under the influence of common plastic pollutants. That comes soon after an unverified claim (not by him) that some experts estimate that each of us eats \u201ca credit card\u2019s worth\u201d of plastic every week, so thoroughly infused has the food chain become with various sorts. I would very much like to hear more on this. What emerges most strongly is the state of ignorance about their own bodies and reproductive health in which the three volunteers seem to exist. We cannot tell what exactly is truth and what is (ball) massaged for the camera but everything seems to come as some sort of a surprise to at least one of the men. Locke knows, presumably, that smoking is bad in every way but hadn\u2019t given it up as he, his partner and their surrogate embarked on IVF. And, if he didn\u2019t know already, did no doctor even mention to him that his hot tub habit probably wasn\u2019t helping mini-Ollie matters? Melvin notes that he considers his friendship group to be very close \u2013 talking about their feelings, noticing and helping when one seems down or depressed, for example \u2013 but have never talked about fertility or the surrounding issues. The results after 10 weeks of gentle lifestyle changes are gratifying. Everyone is pleased, although Melvin worries that his mother will know now that there is no excuse (we all worry for Melvin. Mrs Odoom WANTS those grandchildren). More pleasing still is the unglib, uncynical tone of the show \u2013 helped greatly by the presenter, Dr Anand Patel, who manages to acknowledge embarrassment without giving into it and mixes the medical with the sociological in a way that enhances both. They all pulled it off nicely.

Full Story Newsroom edition: the division driving the no campaign As the voice to parliament no campaign cranks up its negative, polarising messaging, Gabrielle Jackson speaks to Guardian Australia\u2019s editor, Lenore Taylor, and head of news, Mike Ticher, about if this politics of division will work, and what the yes campaign can do to combat it.

The lobby group Advance, one of the lead organisations in the no camp, runs one Facebook page highlighting conservative criticism, another highlighting progressive complaints, and a third portraying itself as a neutral news source. The main Facebook pages of Advance and its offshoot, Fair Australia, are strongly critical of the Labor government and the voice, regularly mocking politicians and campaigners supporting the referendum, and claiming the voice would be \u201cradical\u201d, \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201ca big deal\u201d and \u201ccompletely changes the way our democratic parliamentary system functions\u201d. But Advance is also running two other, vastly different, referendum Facebook pages. One is titled \u201cNot Enough\u201d, which is pushing quotes from prominent Indigenous people including Lidia Thorpe and Celeste Liddle that \u201cwe deserve better than just a voice\u201d and notes that the concept of constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u201ccame from the conservative side of politics\u201d. Not Enough highlights so-called \u201cprogressive no\u201d arguments against the voice, including that the voice should be much stronger, and that the current model is too weak to change outcomes for Aboriginal people. The other page is Referendum News, which portrays itself as a neutral news source about the vote, but only posts news articles highlighting criticism of or scepticism about the voice. In essence, it means Advance is simultaneously highlighting conservative and progressive arguments, as well as running a page that on first glance could appear to be a neutral information source. In an email to supporters last week, the Advance director, Matthew Sheahan, wrote: \u201cOur strategic digital advertising has been inundating Aussies who are on the fence.\u201d Thorpe and Liddle are among those to have complained about their quotes being used in Not Enough\u2019s posts. Thorpe said she did not want to be associated with the Advance campaign; Liddle said her words were taken out of context, and Not Enough\u2019s post featuring her quote now carries an RMIT FactLab fact check warning that the post is \u201cmissing context and could mislead people\u201d. Guardian Australia analysis shows Not Enough has spent between $29,900 and $40,000 on boosting its Facebook advertisements into people\u2019s feeds; Referendum News has spent between $20,000 and $39,840 (Facebook\u2019s ad library does not give an exact amount of advertising spend, but instead a broad lower and upper limit). Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Beyond a legally required authorisation message, there is no information on either Not Enough or Referendum News that would immediately connect it to the no campaign. Analysis of Facebook ad data from the main no campaign pages suggests each page is being used to target different demographics with their specific types of content. Not Enough, the page highlighting \u201cprogressive no\u201d viewpoints, is exclusively targeting younger people, with all its ads being shown to people aged under 34. Referendum News is focused on middle-aged voters, with all ads shown to users aged between 35 and 64, with a greater skew towards a female audience. Fair Australia\u2019s page, which contains the most partisan messaging, is mostly targeting middle-aged and older audiences, with about 33% of ad impressions going to those over 65. Analysis of state targeting data shows that all of the no campaign pages are essentially ignoring New South Wales and Victoria, two states that polling consistently suggests are likely to vote majority yes. Of the three pages, only Not Enough is targeting voters in the largest two states, but all of the pages are primarily targeting audiences in Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. Not Enough has placed its major focus on SA, then Tasmania and WA; Queensland, which is federally a conservative stronghold and expected to be the state with the strongest no vote, is some way behind. The analysis suggests Advance is most heavily targeting conservative voters in Queensland, but hedging its bets by pushing more progressive or centrist ads in SA and Tasmania. SA and Tasmania are expected to be key battlegrounds for both campaigns; the yes campaign chose SA to launch its field operation, while the campaign and federal government have regularly highlighted the support of Tasmanian Liberals in federal MP Bridget Archer and the state\u2019s premier, Jeremy Rockliff. In contrast, the parliamentary \u201cLiberals for No\u201d campaign is led by the Tasmanian senator Jonathon Duniam and SA\u2019s Kerrynne Liddle. The Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who is the spokesperson for Fair Australia, has also spent about $46,000 on Facebook ads in the last 90 days. That compares to $10,500 for the prime minister, Anthony Albanese \u2013 on all ads, not necessarily relating to the voice \u2013 and $6,500 for the opposition leader, Peter Dutton. The senator\u2019s ads, which all focused on the referendum, are being served up in major numbers to Queensland and WA \u2013 on a raw number, not weighted for population, 35.86% of her impressions were recorded in Queensland and 34.64% in WA. Ed Coper, a global expert on misinformation and director of marketing agency Populares, who has advised the yes campaign and the government\u2019s referendum working group on misinformation, said the no campaign was using tactics seen in the US by having \u201cone group coordinating several pages making it seem like they\u2019re all different\u201d. \u201cThey are transparently running several social media accounts for different purposes \u2013 one to have an appearance of a neutral news site, another to appeal to the so-called \u2018progressive no\u2019 on the referendum. \u201cThe reason you set up a \u2018Referendum News\u2019 page is to dupe people into the mistaken belief they are seeing neutral info. Of course that\u2019s not what they\u2019re seeing, they\u2019re seeing no campaign messages masquerading as news,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s straight out of the Republican playbook in the US in the last several years. It\u2019s very effective.\u201d A Spokesperson for Advance defended the campaign\u2019s social media strategy. \u201cWe absolutely reject the incorrect assertion that these social media campaigns are in any way misleading,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is not misleading to present arguments against the voice using the words of those who oppose or question it, even if they come from diverse ideological backgrounds. \u201cReferendum News does nothing more than present news content that shows there is more than one side to the voice story.\u201d The spokesperson said Advance\u2019s Facebook pages and advertising were \u201ctransparently authorised\u201d and complied with AEC and Meta\u2019s requirements. Axel Bruns, a professor at Queensland University of Technology\u2019s digital media research centre, said QUT\u2019s early analysis of referendum data had shown the no side was more active on social media. \u201cIt has an easier case to make. It has to sow doubt, make people uncertain about whether it\u2019s the right way forward, whether the voice is meaningful and whether Indigenous people are actually behind it,\u201d Bruns said. \u201cWe know most Indigenous people are behind the voice, but that\u2019s not getting as much visibility as the criticism. They\u2019ve been effective in sowing that level of doubt, making themselves visible in mainstream and social media.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b5e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/13/what-happens-if-theres-a-hollywood-actors-strike", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hollywood actors are going on strike.

The decision means that actors will be joining writers on the picket lines, marking the first time in over six decades that both unions have taken simultaneous strike action. Considerable though the effect of the writers\u2019 strike has been on film and TV production, as well as related activities such as awards shows and publicity events, an actors\u2019 strike is likely to be seismic. Not least because Sag-Aftra\u2019s reach is global: any film or show featuring a Hollywood actor is likely to have to shut down, or at least be massively rescheduled, when the strike begins at midnight on Thursday. The writers\u2019 strike has already seen the shutdown of the vast majority of scripted TV shows in the US, as picket lines have been largely successful at ensuring production activities have ceased. Series including The Last of Us, Blade Runner 2099 and The Mandalorian have already been delayed, while future projects \u2013 such as the sequel to Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Disney\u2019s Blade remake \u2013 have also stalled, as scripts are not being completed. Others, including Thunderbolts and Captain America: Brave New World, are in production, but have had their release dates put back. However, the withdrawal of US actors\u2019 participation means that even productions with finished scripts can now no longer go ahead, whether in the US itself, Europe or elsewhere. According to Deadline, TV shows likely to be affected include House of the Dragon, Andor and Industry, while the second season of Sharon Horgan\u2019s Bad Sisters will probably be unable to start shooting. Doctor Who, which is now being produced in partnership with the streaming service Disney+, is also likely to be affected by strike action. Studio film productions, which run on even longer and more elaborate schedules, will suffer longer-term damage if they have not completed filming in time. The highest-profile films still shooting include the Ridley Scott-directed Gladiator 2, starring Paul Mescal, which was scheduled to shoot in Malta, Morocco and the UK between June and October, and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two, the sequel to Tom Cruise\u2019s hit blockbuster, which was due to finish shooting this summer after promotional duties on Part One were over. Other studio productions, including the fourth Bad Boys film, Beetlejuice 2 and the untitled Ghostbusters: Afterlife sequel have reportedly finished shooting, as has the second season of Amazon\u2019s TV series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The situation is more complex for low-budget and independent films, which may be able to apply for waivers from Sag-Aftra to allow them to go ahead. However, the uncertainty over who can work, and who can and can\u2019t cross picket lines, has led to considerable financial instability in an already precarious sector. Even with a waiver, and an already completed script, productions cannot rely on the participation of crucial crew, as the transportation union the Teamsters, and technicians\u2019 union Iatse, are mostly refusing to cross writers\u2019 union picket lines. Outside film-making activities, other high-profile events are likely to be altered or cancelled now that the actors\u2019 union has called a strike. The London premiere of Christopher Nolan\u2019s atom-bomb drama Oppenheimer has been moved forward by an hour tonight to ensure its cast can attend. And the popular Comic-Con event in San Diego \u2013 due to take place 20-23 July, and normally attended by large numbers of stars to promote their films to adoring fans \u2013 looks likely to be badly hit. Late summer releases such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Haunted Mansion and Blue Beetle are also expected to have to curtail promotional activities. Major international film festivals \u2013 including Venice and Toronto, which take place nearly simultaneously in late August and early September \u2013 should be able to screen available films, but red carpet activity and actor appearances are now in doubt. Televised awards shows are also facing problems. The writers\u2019 strike already forced the postponement of the Daytime Emmy awards, due to take place in June, and although it is not scheduled to take place until 18 September, the Primetime Emmy awards, which are given to high-profile TV shows, look to be next in line, with the ceremony likely to be delayed at least until November. With the next Academy Awards not scheduled to take place until March 2024, the Oscars should remain unaffected unless the strike is a prolonged one."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b5f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/13/russia-accused-of-cynical-brinkmanship-over-delays-to-grain-deal-renewal", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia accused of \u2018cynical brinkmanship\u2019 over delays to grain deal renewal", "lead": "Fears over food price rises if Moscow fails to meet deadline for Black Sea export agreement", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 20:03:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098534", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1a69145f8857f77505bff8660340d34432e97905/0_256_4962_2977/500.jpg", "body": "Russia is stonewalling in talks about the renewal of a deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, the UK envoy to the UN has warned. Barbara Woodward accused Moscow of \u201ccynical brinkmanship\u201d that makes it increasingly unlikely that the deal will be renewed before Tuesday\u2019s deadline. She said failure to renew the deal would cause global food prices to rise, as the deal had allowed more than 32m tonnes of grain and food exports to leave Ukraine over the past year \u2013 with two-thirds going to low to middle-income countries, and some going to countries on the brink of starvation such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia. The Black Sea grain initiative, a rolling four-month agreement that has been renewed three times so far, allows Ukrainian grain ships to leave Ukrainian ports subject to joint inspections by Russia and the UN. There are assurances that Russia grain and fertiliser would be allowed to reach world markets, but Russia says western promises have not been kept. Speaking on state TV on Thursday, Vladimir Putin said: \u201cWe can suspend our participation in the deal, and if everyone once again says that all the promises made to us will be fulfilled, then let them fulfil this promise. We will immediately rejoin this deal.\u201d The Kremlin said his remarks did not mean Russia had definitively decided to quit the programme. By getting Ukrainian grain on to the market, the deal has helped bring prices down: the global price of wheat has fallen from highs of $450 a tonne in mid-May 2022 to around $250 a tonne in recent months. But British officials are deeply concerned that with the renewal deadline only days away, Russia is showing little sign of engagement. In a desperate attempt to kickstart talks on renewal Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, wrote to Moscow proposing that a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s agriculture bank could be switched back into the Swift banking transfer system. So far there has been no official Russian response, and diplomats fear the diplomatic climate is now so poisonous at the UN in New York that Putin may be prepared to end the deal, and not even engage in the brinkmanship that has marked previous moments of renewal. The downside for him is that he might lose allies in Africa if the consensus was that he had been unreasonable. The fate of the deal, western diplomats believe, may depend on the ability of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish president, to engage with Putin. Erdo\u011fan brokered the original deal last July. But Putin may feel he owes Erdo\u011fan no favours after the latter\u2019s surprise repatriation of former commanders of Ukraine\u2019s garrison in Mariupol. Andrew Clark of the UK Foreign Office was equally pessimistic. \u201cThe UN and Turkey have been working incredibly hard to draw up agreements that all parties can agree to, in order to secure the renewal. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve seen Russia stalling these discussions and indicating in their public messaging that they will not agree to any renewal\u201d. Russian claims that its own grain export volumes are being damaged were not matched by statistics showing exports were now above prewar levels, while Ukrainian grain exports were down by more than a fifth. Woodward also accused Russia of dragging its feet in the existing agreement by taking longer than necessary to inspect commercial ships leaving Ukraine. Ships can be inspected at a rate of more than 40 a day, she said, but Russia was slowing that number down to 10 a day, and sometimes as few as two. Since 28 June, no new ships have been allowed to enter the process. As a result only 1.3m tonnes of grain left Ukraine in May. Without any deal, Ukraine\u2019s role as the breadbasket of the world can only be protected by exports westward through Poland by road, rail and river, but the volumes would be much reduced. If Turkey was to respond to a breakdown by seeking to protect Ukrainian grain ships, Russia might regard the Turkish navy as legitimate targets, a decision that could bring the Nato member close to conflict with Russia."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b60", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/live/2023/jul/13/supreme-court-clarence-thomas-trump-biden-finland-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "law", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Donald Trump: Arizona attorney general investigating attempts to overturn 2020 vote, reports say \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Kris Mayes reportedly moving forward with investigation into election tampering", "author": "Chris Stein US politics live blogger", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 20:00:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098559", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/abef64077998ca8c3cf7a6199f5b9957e2b4ff4f/0_150_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "The Secret Service announced it closed the investigation into the cocaine discovered at the White House earlier this month without naming any suspects, but Republicans seem to want to keep the matter alive. Several lawmakers, including House speaker Kevin McCarthy, expressed skepticism at the agency\u2019s conclusion, part of a pattern of attacks on federal law enforcement by the GOP\u2019s right wing. Meanwhile, the Democratic leader of the Senate judiciary committee Dick Durbin outlined plans to continue pressing the supreme court to tighten its ethics, after a series of reports found questionable ties between the justices and parties with interests in its decisions. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Arizona\u2019s attorney general is moving forward with an investigation of Donald Trump and his attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s election victory in the state three years ago, the Washington Post reported. Florida governor Ron DeSantis remains far below Trump in support among Republicans, but NBC News obtained a memo outlining his campaign\u2019s strategy for success in the presidential primaries. Mitch McConnell, the Senate\u2019s top Republican, accused Democrats of seeking to retaliate against conservative supreme court justices. Durbin left open the possibility of his committee investigating liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor after a report emerged of her staff asking institutions to buy her book. Far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was among lawmakers who raised their eyebrows at the Secret Service\u2019s decision to close the investigation into the White House cocaine. A spat has broken out between Republican former president Mike Pence and a prominent progressive Democrat over Israeli president Isaac Herzog\u2019s plans to address Congress next week during his visit to Washington DC. Ilhan Omar, a progressive Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, announced she would not attend Herzog\u2019s speech, citing a 2019 episode in which Israel said fellow progressive Democrat Rashida Tlaib, who is of Palestinian origin, could visit family in the West Bank, but only if she avoided promoting the boycott campaign against the country: This afternoon, Pence, who is seeking the GOP\u2019s nomination for president, took direct aim at Omar, one of only three Muslims currently serving in Congress and the only Somali-American: Back at the Capitol, Republicans continue to complain about the Secret Service\u2019s conclusion that it can\u2019t identify who left cocaine at the White House. Here\u2019s Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett\u2019s take, as captured by CNN: Ron DeSantis may be considered frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s biggest challenger for the Republican presidential nomination, but polls have consistently shown that it\u2019s not a particularly close race. Take this one from Morning Consult released on Tuesday. It shows Trump with 56% support among potential GOP primary voters, and DeSantis in second with a measly 17%. If there\u2019s any news there, it\u2019s that entrepreneur and first-time candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is in third place with 8%, ahead of more experienced Republicans like former vice-president Mike Pence and senator Tim Scott. NBC News has obtained a confidential memo from the DeSantis campaign laying out their strategy in the GOP\u2019s primary process. The Florida governor plans to aim for success in the first states that vote, particularly New Hampshire, and focus less on \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d, when 14 states will hold primaries on 5 March. Here\u2019s more from their story: Ron DeSantis is trying to reassure donors and activists that his campaign only looks stalled. A confidential campaign memo obtained by NBC News lays out what the Florida governor\u2019s presidential campaign sees as its path forward: focusing on the early states, refusing to give up on New Hampshire, not yet investing in \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d battlegrounds, zeroing in on DeSantis\u2019 biography and sowing doubts about his competitors \u2014 particularly Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. \u201cWhile Super Tuesday is critically important, we will not dedicate resources to Super Tuesday that slow our momentum in New Hampshire,\u201d the memo states. \u201cWe expect to revisit this investment in the Fall.\u201d The document, dated July 6, is labeled a \u201cconfidential friends and family update\u201d and makes clear that it\u2019s \u201cnot for distribution.\u201d Its details about the campaign\u2019s strategy are far more in-depth than what has been shared publicly. As DeSantis\u2019 ability to surpass Donald Trump as leader of the Republican Party is now an open question among the GOP faithful, the memo is an effort by the governor\u2019s top aides to reach out to donors to provide more clarity on their path forward. Across the DeSantis political universe there is a heightened awareness of the importance of the early states and the reality that DeSantis will burn out without strong performances there. It means that even as the group has a plan in place now, the strategy is subject to change. \u201cFrom my understanding, if we don\u2019t see a bump in the polls, we are basically going to shut down the idea of a national operation,\u201d a DeSantis-aligned operative told NBC News. Donald Trump\u2019s top opponent for the Republican presidential nomination is governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, which used to be considered a swing state, but lately has trended towards the GOP. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine and Andrew Witherspoon report that the DeSantis administration is carrying out a crackdown against groups that are trying to encourage people to vote: Florida Republicans have hit dozens of voter registration groups with thousands of dollars of fines, the latest salvo in an alarming crackdown on voting in the state led by Governor Ron DeSantis. At least 26 groups have cumulatively racked up more than $100,000 in fines since September of last year, according to a list that was provided by Florida officials to the Guardian. The groups include both for-profit and nonprofit organizations as well as political parties, including the statewide Republican and Democratic parties of Florida. The fines, which range from $50 to tens of thousands of dollars, were levied by the state\u2019s office of election crimes and security, a first-of-its-kind agency created at the behest of DeSantis in 2022 to investigate voter fraud. Voter fraud is extremely rare, and the office has already come under scrutiny for bringing criminal charges against people who appeared to be confused about their voting eligibility. Donald Trump\u2019s legal trouble is both criminal, and civil. As the Associated Press reports, the former president yesterday suffered a setback in his attempt to defend himself against a potent defamation lawsuit: Donald Trump lashed out on social media against the US justice department on Wednesday after it stopped supporting his claim that the presidency shields him from liability against a defamation lawsuit brought by a woman who says he sexually attacked her in the mid-1990s. The former president said in a post on his social media platform that the department\u2019s reversal a day earlier in the lawsuit brought by advice columnist E. Jean Carroll was part of the \u201cpolitical Witch Hunt\u201d he faces while campaigning for the presidency as a Republican. The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Arizona\u2019s Democratic attorney general Kris Mayes is moving forward with an investigation into efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory in the crucial swing state, the Washington Post reports. Mayes\u2019s inquiry is the second known attempt by a state to hold the former president accountable for the effort to disrupt Biden\u2019s win. Fani Willis, a Democratic prosecutor in Fulton county, Georgia, is reportedly close to obtaining indictments in her investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign to overturn Biden\u2019s win in that state. Separately, justice department special counsel Jack Smith is still investigating the former president over the January 6 insurrection, and the broader campaign to prevent Biden from entering the White House. Here\u2019s more from the Post\u2019s report: Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) assigned a team of prosecutors to the case in May, and investigators have contacted many of the pro-Trump electors and their lawyers, according to the two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the probe. Investigators have requested records and other information from local officials who administered the 2020 election, the two people said, and a prosecutor has inquired about evidence collected by the Justice Department and an Atlanta-area prosecutor for similar probes. It is unclear if the investigation will broaden into other attempts to undermine President Biden\u2019s victory in the state, including a pressure campaign by Trump and his allies to thwart the will of voters and remain in office. Dan Barr, Mayes\u2019s chief deputy, said the investigation is in the \u201cfact-gathering\u201d phase. He declined to say whether subpoenas have been issued and which state statutes the team thinks might have been broken. \u201cThis is something we\u2019re not going to go into thinking, \u2018Maybe we\u2019ll get a conviction,\u2019 or \u2018Maybe we have a pretty good chance,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be ironclad shut.\u201d Joe Biden will meet the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, at the White House next week, his spokeswoman has confirmed. Herzog will be in Washington on 18 and 19 July and will deliver a joint address to Congress. The Israeli president\u2019s US visit comes amid protests in Israel at a government push to advance legislation that would weaken the supreme court\u2019s independence. Israel\u2019s parliament recently voted for a bill that would scrap a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard that allows the supreme court to overrule government decisions. Biden and Herzog are due to discuss deepening Israel\u2019s regional integration, a more peaceful Middle East and Russia\u2019s relationship with Iran. The White House statement on the visit said: President Biden will stress the importance of our shared democratic values, and discuss ways to advance equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and security for Palestinians and Israelis.\u201d The Secret Service announced it had closed its investigation of the cocaine discovered at the White House earlier this month without naming any suspects, but Republicans seem to want to keep the matter alive. Several lawmakers, including House speaker Kevin McCarthy, expressed skepticism at the agency\u2019s conclusion, part of a pattern of attacks on federal law enforcement by the GOP\u2019s right wing. Meanwhile, the Democratic leader of the Senate judiciary committee Dick Durbin outlined plans to continue pressing the supreme court to tighten its ethics, after a series of reports found questionable ties between the justices and parties with interests in its decisions. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Mitch McConnell, the Senate\u2019s top Republican, accused Democrats of seeking to retaliate against conservative justices. Durbin left open the possibility of his committee investigating liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor after a report emerged of her staff asking institutions to buy her book. Far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was among lawmakers who raised their eyebrows at the Secret Service\u2019s decision to close the investigation into the White House cocaine. In the latest indication that this is not the last we have heard about the White House cocaine saga, Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy is calling on the Secret Service to continue searching for whomever left the powder at the executive mansion, Fox News reports: Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Jenna Amatulli on the cocaine found at the White House, and apparent failure of the Secret Service to discover who brought it there: The investigation into the bag of cocaine found at the White House has concluded, with no suspects identified. In a statement from the Secret Service, the organization emphasized that it implemented safety closures after discovering the cocaine and that it then \u201cfield tested and preliminarily determined\u201d the drug \u201cto not be a hazardous compound\u201d. They said the US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center later analyzed the cocaine for any biothreats and those tests came back negative. On how the item came to be inside the White House, the Secret Service said it conducted a \u201cmethodical review of security systems and protocols\u201d that spanned \u201cseveral days prior to the discovery of the substance\u201d. They \u201cdeveloped an index of several hundred individuals who may have accessed the area where the substance was found\u201d before ultimately concluding there was \u201cinsufficient DNA was present for investigative comparisons\u201d. If House Republicans decide to hold hearings or otherwise investigate the Secret Service over the White House cocaine, it will be just the latest instance of the party tangling with federal law enforcement. Yesterday, the House judiciary committee grilled the FBI director for about six hours, leading to plenty of partisan fireworks but not much new information, as the Guardian\u2019s Joan E Greve reports: House Republicans grilled the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher Wray, at a frequently contentious committee hearing on Wednesday. While Republicans accused the FBI of political bias in its handling of investigations into Donald Trump and Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, Democrats derided the attacks on the bureau as a smokescreen driven by conspiracy theories. The Republican chair of the House judiciary committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, kicked off the hearing with a litany of complaints about the FBI\u2019s alleged targeting of rightwing leaders and activists, lamenting the supposed \u201cdouble standard that exists now in our justice system\u201d. Jordan suggested that the allegedly misguided leadership of Wray, a Trump appointee, could jeopardize government funding for the FBI\u2019s planned new headquarters. Far-right Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was among those criticizing the Secret Service for failing to solve who brought cocaine into the White House: Add North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis to the ranks of Republican senators who want to know more about the White House cocaine. From Fox News: That said, with Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic allies in charge of the Senate, if Congress decides to hold hearings into the cocaine, they will probably happen in the House, which Republicans control. Here\u2019s right-wing congressman Chip Roy\u2019s thoughts on the matter: The Secret Service has released a lengthy recounting of its investigation into the White House cocaine, which gives further details of why it was not able to find a suspect for the powder discovered near an entrance to the executive mansion. After recounting how the substance was found and confirmed to be cocaine, it says: While awaiting the FBl\u2019s results, the Secret Service investigation into how this item entered the White House continued. The investigation included a methodical review of security systems and protocols. This review included a backwards examination that spanned several days prior to the discovery of the substance and developed an index of several hundred individuals who may have accessed the area where the substance was found. The focal point of these actions developed a pool of known persons for comparison of forensic evidence gleaned from the FBI\u2019s analysis of the substance\u2019s packaging. On July 12, the Secret Service received the FBI\u2019s laboratory results, which did not develop latent fingerprints and insufficient DNA was present for investigative comparisons. Therefore, the Secret Service is not able to compare evidence against the known pool of individuals. The FBl\u2019s evaluation of the substance also confirmed that it was cocaine. There was no surveillance video footage found that provided investigative leads or any other means for investigators to identify who may have deposited the found substance in this area. Without physical evidence, the investigation will not be able to single out a person of interest from the hundreds of individuals who passed through the vestibule where the cocaine was discovered. At this time, the Secret Service\u2019s investigation is closed due to a lack of physical evidence. The Secret Service investigation into the White House cocaine may be over, but at least one lawmaker still has questions. Here\u2019s what Republican senator John Cornyn had to say about the investigation\u2019s inconclusive end, from Fox News: The Secret Service has concluded its investigation of the cocaine found at the White House without identifying any suspects, CNN reports, citing two sources familiar with the investigation. Here\u2019s more from their story: Secret Service officials combed through visitor logs and surveillance footage of hundreds of individuals who entered the West Wing in the days preceding the discovery and were unable to identify a suspect, one of the sources said. Investigators were also unable to identify the particular moment or day when the baggie was left inside the West Wing cubby near the lower level entrance where it was discovered. The second source said that the leading theory remains that it was left by one of the hundreds of visitors who entered the West Wing that weekend for tours and were asked to leave their phones inside those cubbies. The White House and Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN previously reported that cocaine was found in a cubby near the ground floor entrance to the West Wing where staff-led tours of the White House pass through on their way into the building. Visitors entering the West Wing for tours are asked to leave their phones in those cubbies, which can also be used by staff who cannot bring their phones into a SCIF, or sensitive compartmented information facility, where classified materials are handled. The cubbies are located near the Situation Room, which has not been used for months due to ongoing renovations. The top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell has done more than arguably anybody to craft the supreme court\u2019s current conservative majority, and in an interview today with broadcaster Hugh Hewitt, he accused Democrats of running a punitive campaign against justices they didn\u2019t like: His comments are a good indication that there will be little GOP support for Dick Durbin and other Democratic senators\u2019 attempts to get the supreme court to tighten its ethics \u2013 potentially imperiling the effort. As Senate majority leader in 2016, McConnell blocked Barack Obama from filling a vacancy on the court then worked with Donald Trump to appoint three conservative justices to the bench, creating the majority that, in the most recent term, struck down affirmative action and Joe Biden\u2019s student debt relief plan. Democratic Senate judiciary committee chair Dick Durbin also commented on an Associated Press report from earlier this week that found aides to Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal supreme court justice, repeatedly asked institutions where she made public appearances to buy her book. \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudge it until the facts are known in complete form. But, I will tell you, the rules and proposals we\u2019re making for a code of ethics and disclosure will apply to every single supreme court justice, whether they were appointed by a Democratic president or a Republican President, makes no difference when it comes to ethics,\u201d Durbin said. Sotomayor was appointed by Democrat Barack Obama. Asked whether he would use his committee\u2019s power to send inquiries to Sotomayor about the book purchases \u2013 as he has done following similar reports about the entanglements of conservative justices with parties interested in the court\u2019s decision \u2013 Durbin was noncommittal. \u201cEverything is on the table, regardless of the justice,\u201d Durbin said. The failure to adopt a code of ethics imperils the reputation of chief justice John Robert and the supreme court itself, and is a sign that Congress must act, the Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee said. \u201cHe has the authority today, tomorrow or any day he chooses to solve this problem, to establish a code of ethics that is responsible and reflects what other branches of government follow, and to establish standards of disclosure so that every single justice knows they will have to answer for their conduct in public,\u201d Dick Durbin said in an interview with the Washington Post. Durbin has announced that on 20 July, his committee will vote on the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency (SCERT) Act, which would require that the high court adopt a code of conduct, create a mechanism for investigating violations of it, and mandate that justices publicly explain their decisions to recuse themselves from cases. Referring to recent media reports of ties between the court\u2019s justices and parties with interests in its decisions, Durbin said, \u201cIt is hard for me to understand \u2026 how chief justice Roberts can rationalize the disclosures that have come up before the public.\u201d Good mornings, US politics blog readers. The supreme court is a quiet place currently, as the nine justices are on recess after a term in which the conservative majority once again handed down decisions with major implications for Americans life \u2013 including striking a death blow to Joe Biden\u2019s student loan relief plan and deciding that race-conscious university admissions are illegal. But Democrats in the Senate remain incensed by reports of ties between the justices and parties with interest\u2019s in the courts outcome. Yesterday, the Guardian reported that a top aide to conservative justice Clarence Thomas received payments over Venmo from lawyers who have had business before the court, which appeared to be in connection with a Christmas party. Dick Durbin, the chair of the chamber\u2019s judiciary committee, has vowed to hold a vote on legislation that would, among other things, require the court to adopt a code of ethics. This morning at 9am eastern time, he will appear at a Washington Post event to elaborate on his campaign. Keep in mind that while Democrats control the Senate, their majority is slim, and Republicans in the chamber as well as the House have shown no willingness at this point to back Durbin and his Democratic counterparts\u2019 efforts. There\u2019s a good reason for this: six of the nine supreme court justices were appointed by GOP presidents and often band together to issue decisions that align with conservative policy goals. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: The House will continue haggling over amendments to the defense funding bill Congress passes every year, and Punchbowl News reports speaker Kevin McCarthy gave into the GOP\u2019s right wing and will allow them to propose \u201cculture war\u201d provisions dealing with everything from abortion to critical race theory. Biden is wrapping up a visit to Finland and will return today to Washington DC, after traveling to Europe for a Nato summit held in Lithuania. America is once again dealing with another day of severe weather, including scorching heat in the southwest and a tornado in the Chicago area.

Fighting back tears as she reflected on her efforts over the past two weeks, the 28-year-old was bitterly disappointed after losing 6-3, 6-3 to Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic, costing her a place in a first grand slam final. \u201cFor sure, [I had] massive support,\u201d Svitolina said. \u201cI got a lot of messages from different people. It\u2019s unbelievable that they have been there with me all the way. Hopefully they continue. It\u2019s a big motivation, but \u2026 it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, a lot of tension. \u201cI try to balance it as much as I can. Sometimes it gets maybe too much but I don\u2019t want to take it as an excuse that I lost today. I try to take it as a motivation. I just hope that Ukrainian people continue supporting me. It was really amazing. And [I] just hope that I\u2019m going to get another chance.\u201d Svitolina had beaten the world No 1, Iga Swiatek, in the previous round but found Vondrousova, full of drop shots, angles and changes of pace, too much to handle. \u201cI had to deal with the situation maybe a bit better but I wouldn\u2019t say I was too nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just I should have found a better way to deal with Marketa\u2019s game-style. She\u2019s a very tricky opponent. She gets lots of balls back. I\u2019m just not very happy the way that I dealt with the situations, with some points at the beginning, as well. She played really well, dealt with my game better today.\u201d Trailing 6-3, 4-0, 40-0, Svitolina gave herself hope when she got herself back on serve at 4-3, only to play a loose game to be broken again as Vondrousova went on to claim victory. \u201cI tried to fight back, but I guess I rushed [a] little bit myself and didn\u2019t serve well on that game when it was 4-3,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a lot of people, a semi-final, so you don\u2019t have time to just let it go. I tried to fight. Got a few games back. I tried to give everything out there even though I didn\u2019t play my best. Didn\u2019t happen. She played great. She was really patient, was playing really great points until the very end.\u201d Svitolina said she was proud of the way she never gave up and how she dealt with her nerves. \u201cOf course, not today,\u201d she said. \u201cToday I wish I played a bit better. I wish that some games I play better. But I think the matches that I played before, they were quite good.\u201d Svitolina, who had her first child nine months ago, will move inside the world\u2019s top 30 when the rankings are updated on Monday. Now she needs a rest. \u201cI will need a couple of days to really switch off myself first from everything and then think about what happened, what did I do right, and what did I do wrong as well.\u201d Svitolina\u2019s compatriot Lyudmyla Kichenok won the mixed doubles title later in the day alongside her Croatian partner, Mate Pavic. The 30-year-old and Pavic defeated the Belgian Joran Vliegen and Xu Yifan of China 6-4, 6-7 (9), 6-3. \u201cI try to encourage the people in Ukraine with my performance,\u201d said Kichenok. \u201cI hope it\u2019s going to help them a little bit because they are fighting for their freedom.\u201d Like Svitolina, Ons Jabeur has acquired a legion of fans around the world, especially in Tunisia, and she has embraced the responsibility of leading the way for a country, or in her case a continent. Her fans call her the Minister of Happiness for Tunisia because of how she makes them feel. \u201cThe good thing about those people, they always tell me, win or lose, we love you,\u201d said Jabeur, who reached the final with a 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-3 win over Aryna Sabalenka. \u201cThat\u2019s great words to hear. I always try to remember that, even though I know everybody wants me to win. \u201cThey\u2019re funny, because a few fans are texting my mental coach, giving her advice on how to coach me. For me there is one goal: I\u2019m going for it. I will prepare 100%. Hopefully I can make history not just for Tunisia, but for Africa.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b62", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/13/county-cricket-surrey-v-nottinghamshire-essex-v-lancashire-and-more-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "County cricket: Essex beat Lancashire after wicket halts record run chase \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Rolling report:</strong> Essex finally prised out Rob Jones with only 10 balls remaining, snatching victory by 46 runs, while there was also a thrilling draw", "author": "Tanya Aldred at Blackpool", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 19:44:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098598", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1001c96c9cfb735503dd8de0ddbacb89e6dc61c1/666_597_1823_1094/500.jpg", "body": "In a late afternoon and early evening of high-wire jitters in the Championship, three games tottered and flailed.

He had been well supported by a restrained 41 from Phil Salt and half-centuries by Luke Wells and Josh Bohannon who, in a partnership of muscular hitting \u2013 one six from Bohannon cannoning into the hospitality tent \u2013 had kept the crowd on their toes. But the efficient Essex attack kept chipping away, with three wickets each for Bracewell and Matt Critchley \u2013 though a muted Simon Harmer finished with uncharacteristic figures of none for 103. When Jones, a fan of sea-swimming and bird-watching, was finally out, to leaping Essex delight, he was applauded off by all. At another outground, Merchant Taylors\u2019, another thriller. With three needed for victory off the last ball of the match, Sam Robson could scramble only two to level the scores, finishing 126 not out and Middlesex\u2019s only centurion of the year. Northants had set Middlesex 323 to chase after losing their last three wickets in the first 11 balls of the morning, but scoring proved tricky, the ball keeping low unpredictably. Robson was supported by 75 from John Simpson and a rollicking 34 from Toby Roland-Jones. Derbyshire\u2019s captain, Leus du Plooy, having the summer of his life, chivvied 128 as his side attempted to chase down 380 at Hove. But with 54 needed from 41 balls, and Du Plooy 21 short of 1,000 runs, he was caught; and after a flurry of wickets, Derbyshire held tight for a draw. Sussex\u2019s James Coles had been finally out for a career-best 180 \u2013 in a what has been a cracking round for 19 year olds. Elsewhere, a four-hour block-and-prod from Nick Gubbins, brilliantly supported by Liam Dawson, saved the day for Hampshire against Somerset; the game at the Oval drifted to a draw despite five wickets for Nottinghamshire\u2019s Brett Hutton against Surrey. Tanya\u2019s report from today will be along shortly. Great games, great fun. See you all back here next Wednesday. Good night!

Back to du Hove, where du Plooy is OUT! A third wicket for Shipley. You\u2019d have thought that might be it, but they plough on. 44 needed from six overs, four wickets left. Essex 20 points; Lancashire 3 Jones gets a huge round of applause from the Essex players and the Blackpool faithful. And with ten balls left, Rob Jones\u2019s long innings comes to an end, caught by last night\u2019s wrecker of dreams \u2013 DAn Lawrence. Williams plays out Harmer like he\u2019s Joe Root \u2013 two overs left. 36 needed from 30 at Merchant Taylor\u2019s. TRJ out and de Caires replaces him. Robson 111 not out. 23 balls left at Blackpool\u2026 Well blocked Nick Gubbins and Liam Dawson! Gubbins 50 off 241 balls, Dawson 68 off 141. Taunton: Somerset 500 v Hampshire 330 and 215-7 What a season for du Plooy. A third century, keeping Derbyshire in with a crazy chance: 75 needed to beat Sussex. Had to run to the ladies after crossing my legs for far too long (sorry) but seem to have missed just Rob Jones taking a single off the first ball of the over and leaving Williams to face the other five. Apparently a drink \u2013 and a telling off \u2013 was served up. Williams ducked into a ball from Bracewell and is now having a concussion check. A drop for the ages by Walter as Bailey smashes the ball into the stratosphere and Walter lets it fall through is fingers. But Harmer takes a much better one two balls later! Sprinting, diving, and holding on. LAncs 376-9. 88th over: Lancs 373-8 (Jones 102, Bailey 7) Bailey takes a wild swipe at Cook and misses, before picking up a sensible single next ball. Right \u2013 Scott is back on comms so I\u2019m going to have to leave this OBO-ing to think about writing up and find some power \u2013 apols! Lancashire need 57 from 48 balls. 87th over: Lancs 370-8 (Jones 100, Bailey 6) Bailey keeps out a grubber from Porter, and Jones gets the single he needs for his hundred, warmly applauded by the Essex fielders and the spectators. Seagulls also swarm in celebration.Bailey lofts FOUR! Porter responds with a bouncer. Lancashire need 60 from 54 balls. 86th over: Lancs 364-8 (Jones 99, Bailey 1) A breathless hush by the sea as Jones takes a couple off a reinvigorated Cook. He and Westley chew the fat at the top of his mark. Bailey nicks the strike for Porter\u2019s over. Lancashire need 66 from 60 balls. 85th over: Lancs 360-7 (Jones 96, Bailey 0) Porter from the South End, Blatherwick plays him back watchfully. Until suddenly he doesn\u2019t any more. Lancashire send Bailey in, which presumably means they\u2019ll have a go? Lancashire need 70 off 66 balls. After carefully prodding away five balls, Blatherwick taps back an easy catch. I have slight power issues but I will try to OBO from Blackool for a while as requested BTL WICKET! A grateful round of applause greets Hartley, caught behind for 17 off Cook: Lancs 359-7. Enter Blatherwick. 72 off 68 balls needed, but. Jones has his eye in now and tbh the new ball not looking super dangerous. Jones 96 not out\u2026 The Oval Surrey 355 and 340 v Notts 399 and 118-1. New Road: Worcs 242 and 142-2 v Yorkshire 407 Rain does for a result at New Road. Libby walks off 61 not out. And the generator blows again at Blackpool as Jones slices Cook to the rope. Lancs 352-6. As Essex take the new ball \u2013 the old one thrown back to the boundary in disgust \u2013 Lancashire need 89 runs off the last 16, four wickets in hand. Easy. (hee hee hee) Harmer\u2019s demeanor matches his bowling figures: 23 overs, 0-102. After Jones cracked back to back fours, he slumps across the pitch as he\u2019s directed from fielding position to fielding position. Without trying too hard, this chase is still doable. New ball due in one over. The good ship du Plooy sails on \u2013 Derby 181-4, need 199. Libby and Roderick keeping Worcestershire safe at New Road: Worcs 127-2, 38 behind Yorks. Can Harmer get a wicket before Essex take the new ball? [eight to go} Searching for wickets too at Taunton where Gubbins\u2019s steadfast 37 off 190 balls is soon to be sold as wallpaper paste. Excellent adhesiveness also from Dawson -47 off 90 -too. But after an over of Andy Umeed \u2013 time for the new ball. HAmpshire 172-7. And the runs tick on at Blackpool, one ball from Critchley misses everything to run down to the rope, the next is thrashed for six by Jones. Lancs 315-6. Surprise move by ICC! Now let\u2019s see them make some positive moves, or indeed any moves at all, on ways in which they can help cricket in a climate crisis \u2013 emergency fund for worst affected countries etc etc. de Grandhomme trudges off after swinging, not hard enough, and being well caught by Porter on the long leg boundary. Lancs 294-6. Cracking effort from Jones, who in his spare time goes to Islay, swims in the sea, drinks whisky and watches birds. His first fifty since he made one a year ago against Kent. First ball, second over after tea, Salt top edges Critchley into the safe hands of Cook (S). Enter de Grandhomme, whose batting this year has been less Grand than Lancs hoped. Lancs 281-5. If Lancashire pull this run chase off, it will be the highest fourth-innings run chase in their history (thank you Scott Read).

Stopped raining at New Road: Out the 22 go. Yorks need eight wickets, Worcestershire to still be there in 36 overs\u2019 time. Jones carefully plays the ball back on the brink of tea. Time for a brew and some calculations up in the Lancashire dressing-room. A cheeky roar from the Blackpool crowd as a bouncer from Bracewell passes over both Jones\u2019s head and the keeper\u2019s head for four. We reckon Essex will get 16 overs with the new ball later. Stuck for now with the soft old Kookaburra. Still rain at New Road \u2013 Yorkshire going to be done by the weather again. Derbyshire have just lost a third (77-30) two for Shipley, one for Karvelas. Madsen and Mr run-accumulator du Plooy at the crease. And sudden activity in the skies above Blackpool, as a helicopter temporarily scares the seagulls away. Lancs 258-4, haven\u2019t put the foot right down yet. Excitement trickling away at The Oval: Notts 39-0 off 10 overs, needing 258 more if they were to push for victory. A masterclass of patience\u2019s virtue from Nick Gubbins: 29 from 127 balls. Just another session and 30 minutes to go\u2026. Hampshire 124-7 For Rob Keogh fans everywhere. Middlesex, 128-3, need 195 with seven wickets in hand. Robson closing in on a half century. Out ground boundaries. Lots of dust out there in the middle in Blackpool, but nothing really happening for Harmer. A gettable total gets more gettable \u2013 just 186 needed. Jones and Salt\u2019s fifty partnership comes and goes to a ripple of applause. Amazed to hear that DIG used to be shy. There\u2019s hope for all of us in the diffident gang! Just in case it had passed anyone else by, Saqib Mahmood is out for the season with a recurrence of his lumbar stress fracture. The match may be dead, but the milestones aren\u2019t. A fourth hundred of the. year for young Rishi. Twelve balls fours, 153 balls. Another to file as a promising musketeers alongside Rew and Bean and Haines and Coles and others to be filled in BTL. After a partnership of 57 between Gubbins and Brown, a double breakthrough from Casey Aldridge: BRown for 35 and Fuller for a two-ball duck. Hants 115-7, still 55 behind. Here at Blackpool, more calculations from Ken \u2013 half the runs, in the half the allotted overs. Five wickets for Brett Hutton as Jacks (60) and Lawes (55), plus some shimmying from the tail, take Surrey to a decent target. Love to see Has get a win under his belt in his first game as captain. Just a 90mph thunderbolt in a cloth cap. Bohannon, Ken Grime announces to the tent, has just made 700 runs for the season at an average of fifty. Next ball he top edges into the hands of Porter as a Walter bowling change brings immediate dividends. Bohannon gone for 68; Lancs 194-4. Coles finally caught, for a bonzer career-best 180. Sussex declare and Derbyshire, hold your hats, are about to bat. Decided to watch a little bit from side on, saw Wells galloping onto the pitch and little Bohannon skipping behind. Seven off the first over after lunch, eight off the second. Bohannon lofted six onto the hospitality tent. Wells drove violently for four. Then disaster in one Critchley over: Wells caught for 75; Vilas, whose season should be wrapped in brown paper and put in the cupboard under the stairs, bowled for o. Lancs 180-3. I\u2019m off to find coffee, back soon.

Black arm bands, btw, are for the Essex CEO\u2019s father. I\u2019m not that keen on this cricket lark when Wells is facing, the poor little unprotected press tent is directly in his crosshairs. Also, I\u2019m in the front row. And that\u2019s lunch: Lancs on target 140-1; Wells 69, Bohannon 32. Gosh, Hampshire. Two more wickets have fallen, but they\u2019re big ones. Middleton for an 80-ball 29 and Vince for a four-ball duck, caught off 19-year old off-spinner Bashir. Three for Bashir, and Bess wheeling in again on home territory. Hants 77-5. They\u2019ve taken lunch at New Road. Worcestershire will be hoping for leisurely linen cloths and five courses after losing two wickets this morning, still lingering 116 behind Yorkshire\u2019s first innings 407. More rain at Cardiff in this weather-soaked game. Mr 176 not out, Michael Neser, took the one wicket to fall. Budinger for five. A(nother) fifty for Patel; while Hill unbeaten on 45. Leics 118-1. Survived being dropped by twice, once on 2 once on 44, to keep Lancs solid. Magpies peck the outfield as we move towards lunch. You spotted him BTL first! Sussex whizzing along down on the south coast, James Coles still there on 138, Jack Carson having fun, five fours in his 25 not out. Sussex 299-7, the lead 294. As, at Blackpool, Lancashire bring their hundred up off 23 overs. Sweet acceleration here. Maybe this could be more than survival. Lancs 101-1 A few technical difficulties here with the generator, which might be affecting those of you tuned into Scott Read and Dickie. Turned my back for a minute, Jennings was out, Bohannon in and promptly swept Harmer for six. Lancs 77-1. And Wells turns Cook out of the dust and to the rope. Lancs 81-1. Forgive me, Eskinazi has retired with an injured hand, so Stoneman and Robson come together. Middx 18-0 Northants lost their remaining three wickets in eleven balls this morning, good to get it out of the way I suppose, to set Middlesex 323. I can\u2019t see this being a goer \u2013 but they\u2019re currently 12-0 and ticking over nicely. An intriguing day set up at The Oval too. Surrey have added 25 to the overnight score, relatively sedately for Jacks and Laws. The lead over Notts has inched up to 182. Foakes didn\u2019t managed to do a pick-me dance with quite the style Dan LAwrence did \u2013 out for 25. Or, they could be saved by the rain \u2013 which is currently falling on the south west. Eyes to Taunton where its been a humdinger every day. Somerset flexed their nascent muscle yesterday and enforced the follow-on, whereupon Vince sent back in his No. 10 Kyle Abbott, stranded on 89 in the first innings, alongside Fletcha Middleton. Abbott was out before the close, as was Weatherley, and Felix Organ has followed suit this morning. Hampshire 45-3. They\u2019ll need another Vince masterclass to last till the evening. Sorry, just realised I omitted a perhaps crucial piece of information \u2013 Essex declared overnight to \u201cset\u201d Lancashire 430 to win. Jennings has just driven Porter beautifully for four. Lancs 13-0. Porter from the South End and Cook from the North End opening proceedings at Stanley Park. It\u2019s warm today \u2013 shirt sleeves on the tiered steps of the old ground.

Exquisitely timed too, with England in need of a No 3 and the Old Trafford Test coming up fast on the inside, just a week away. A salty seadog in the queue by the coffee van sniffed a force seven gale and at times it felt like that, as the wind skated up the coast and over the ground. But it did not put Lawrence off his stride, squatting his considerable frame into a Z before cracking the ball with huge power. He hit nine sixes: three of them lost over the wall into Stanley Park, one pancaked straight back past Will Williams over the press tent; one to reach his third hundred of the summer over wide long-on. Lawrence hit even more freely and monstrously after reaching three figures, finally out for 135 off 125 balls in the last over of the day. Earlier. Lancashire had lost seven wickets in the morning session, and two more soon afterwards, just avoiding the follow-on, with four wickets to Sam Cook and three to Paul Walter. Essex then had a disastrous start to their second innings, as both Nick Browne and Alastair Cook were out for nought, before Lawrence came in and turned the game upside down. In 100 first-class matches at Blackpool, the highest run-chase is 301; with the Essex lead now 429, Lancashire have their work cut out tomorrow. Hello! It is beautiful in Blackpool this morning, wind turbines whirring far out to sea and the hazy outline of north Wales hovering on the horizon. And I met a big, beautiful collie on my morning walk. Could be a cracking day at Stanley Park today after Dan Lawrence\u2019s fireworks \u2013 Lancs bolting the door and hunkering down against Cook, Walter, Harmer et al.

Lukaku spent last season on loan at Inter and has rejected overtures from Saudi Arabia in the hope of continuing his career in Europe. Inter\u2019s coach, Simone Inzaghi, spoke this week about his desire to bring back Lukaku, who scored 14 goals in 37 club appearances last season. Lukaku joined Chelsea from Inter for \u20ac115m in August 2021 before returning on loan after an underwhelming season and Chelsea must decide how much of a loss they are willing to make. On Thursday Christian Pulisic completed his move to Milan for a fraction of the fee Chelsea paid to buy him from Borussia Dortmund in 2019. Lukaku is due to report for pre-season on Monday at Chelsea, who believe two more clubs are willing to enter the race for the 30-year-old. Manchester United have submitted their final proposal for Inter\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Onana, with the clubs close to agreeing a deal worth an initial \u20ac50m, with \u20ac5m in add-ons. After tense negotiations, it now seems likely a deal will be done, with only the structure of the payments yet to be decided. Should the deal be confirmed, the goalkeeper will link up again with manager Erik ten Hag, who coached him at Ajax. United want to make Onana their No 1 after allowing David de Gea to depart at the end of his contract. Everton are in discussions with United over a deal to buy the forward Anthony Elanga. A number of clubs are interested in the Sweden international but Everton are favourites to sign Elanga, who played no part in United\u2019s friendly win over Leeds in Oslo on Wednesday. Everton have completed the free signing of Ashley Young on a one-year deal after his release by Aston Villa. The 38-year-old said: \u201cI\u2019ve always said age is just a number for me. I feel as fit as I ever have done \u2013 even than when I was younger.

The agency announced its intent to intervene in a lawsuit filed by the NAACP against the state, arguing that the law, signed by the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, in April, took voting authority away from Black residents in Jackson and Hinds county, which are both Democrat-run and majority-Black. \u201cThis thinly veiled state takeover is intended to strip power, voice and resources away from Hinds county\u2019s predominantly-Black electorate, singling out the majority-Black Hinds county for adverse treatment imposed on no other voters in the state of Mississippi,\u201d Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general of the justice department\u2019s civil rights division, said in a statement. The 32-page federal complaint argues that the state created a \u201ctwo-tiered system of justice\u201d by crafting a new court system in the part of Jackson called the Capitol Complex Improvement District and doubled the area\u2019s size through incorporating Jackson\u2019s predominantly white neighborhoods in a majority-Black city. That means state capitol police and state appointed judges and prosecutors would oversee the city\u2019s predominantly white areas and insulate \u201cresidents within its boundaries from judges accountable to the Black voters of Jackson and Hinds county\u201d, the complaint notes. Republicans in the majority-white Mississippi legislature who supported the bill\u2019s passage argued that the law, which included an expansion of capitol police, was aimed at curtailing crime and improving public safety. Federal prosecutors questioned why the state could not address crime rates by \u201ccreating new elected offices, rather than singling out Hinds county residents by imposing a surfeit of largely unaccountable state-appointed officials\u201d. Unlike the NAACP case, which also challenges the law\u2019s expansion of state capitol police as engaging in \u201cseparate and unequal policing\u201d, the justice department\u2019s intervention focuses on the state\u2019s appointment of judges and prosecutors within the newly created court system. \u201cWhen our state leaders fail those they are supposed to serve, it is only right that the federal government steps in to ensure that justice is delivered,\u201d the NAACP president, Derrick Johnson, who lives in Jackson, said in a statement. The federal complaint also argued that the state\u2019s appointment powers meant that Jackson voters would be unable to hold new officials accountable because the state would appoint them, unusual in a state where most judges are elected. The state law also came after the Mississippi legislature \u201cshortchanged\u201d the Hinds county criminal justice system for decades by failing to \u201cprovide the county with the resources, funding and personnel that it needs\u201d. That made it difficult for local police, prosecutors and judges to combat crime. The Mississippi supreme court recently heard arguments in a separate case challenging the law. In June, a federal judge temporarily blocked the law from going into effect. The same judge will now determine whether the federal government can join the case."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b65", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/vermont-wildlife-historic-flooding", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Definitely unprecedented\u2019: Vermont wildlife also affected by historic flooding", "lead": "Fish, beavers and skunks all suffered from the deluge this week.

Fish in Vermont\u2019s rivers, primarily species of trout \u2013 brook, rainbow and brown \u2013 have been found to move upriver during increased water flow to less turbulent areas, including tributaries or flooded fields, or find refuge behind fallen trees or rocks. \u201cThis is definitely unprecedented, but studies of smaller floods show that often fish are not displaced and are in the same pools before and after a flood,\u201d said Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont\u2019s fish and wildlife department. \u201cThey can often survive in place by finding some refuge behind a structure or ride the edges of the flow up into the flood plain.\u201d After Hurricane Irene, though, some fish populations fell by 50%, Eldridge says. \u201cBut the silver lining is that fish populations do recover pretty quickly, and they can do that because there is less impact in the headwaters and smaller streams, or they can migrate and recolonize areas that have been impacted,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we work hard to protect those headwaters and also provide connectivity between streams and systems.\u201d Fish are not the only type of wildlife that get displaced. Eldridge\u2019s wife noticed a number of displaced skunks in Montpelier in the immediate aftermath of this week\u2019s flood. They had probably been nesting in the banks of the Winooski River and its tributary streams before they were flooded. Muskrats and weasels, too, were probably displaced. One of the most distressing sights around Montpelier in recent days have been the bodies of beavers hit by cars on the roads. Tyler Brown, a wildlife specialist with the department who specializes in beavers and runs the beaver baffle project, which helps to protect beaver-created habitats and studies how their dams can help slow flooding, says the Vermont floods this week will have displaced the beaver population \u2013 but only temporarily. \u201cWhen we get this amount rainfall in so short a time it is likely that beavers will have been displaced from their dams because it\u2019s not likely that a beaver dam could withstand that amount of water,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWhen it comes to normal thunderstorm-type flooding, beaver dams hold and add capacity for capturing water, and allow water to spill over into wetland areas and release it slowly.\u201d But in a catastrophic flood like on Monday, he says, \u201cit depends on where the dams are in the watershed.\u201d While it is possible some beavers may have died in the flooding \u2013 there were reports of beavers swimming around during the high-water period of the storm \u2013 Brown predicts the overall population will be just fine. \u201cLike humans, beavers are pretty resilient, so they\u2019re likely already rebuilding to re-create their habitats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will just leave them be and let them figure it out. They know their habitat pretty well, so they\u2019re going to move back to suitable sites in their wetland habitats where there are a lot of young trees \u2013 willows, alders, maples \u2013 to eat the phloem, or inner layer of bark.\u201d Overall, wildlife populations tend to bounce back after flooding events while populations of bears, dear and turkey tend to move temporarily to higher ground. \u201cOur wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable,\u201d Brown emphasized, \u201cso they\u2019ll be able to rebound.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b66", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/13/use-of-kingspan-insulation-on-towers-near-grenfell-angers-residents", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Use of Kingspan insulation on towers near Grenfell angers residents", "lead": "Council orders contractor to immediately remove material made by firm implicated in 2017 disaster", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:58:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098672", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/45c244003d2d441f02d2203a61d15a9494903c46/0_63_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Materials made by a company implicated in the Grenfell Tower disaster have been installed on a pair of nearby council tower blocks during fire safety works, in a move met with outrage in the west London community. Insulation made by Kingspan, the firm that provided some of the combustible foam on the tower, which went up in flames on 14 June 2017 killing 72 people, was discovered last week on the Adair and Hazelwood towers, a few hundred metres from Grenfell. Residents of the council-owned towers have been enduring a \u00a37m recladding project to install non-combustible panels after fire risk assessments in 2018 identified \u201cpotential concerns with the cladding system\u201d and round-the-clock fire wardens were deployed. In 2021, after local anger that Kingspan materials were found being installed in a primary school in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), the council announced a ban on use of the firm\u2019s products in borough projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d said Sue Duggins, the chair of the Goldborne residents\u2019 association, which represents people in the two towers. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be hearing the word Kingspan in this community. Nobody in this area wants to be in a home wrapped in Kingspan. Practically everyone here knows someone at Grenfell.\u201d The public inquiry into the Grenfell disaster heard that Kingspan sold a combustible foam insulation that burned like a \u201craging inferno\u201d based, it was alleged, on out-of-date tests on an earlier product with a different chemical composition. Lawyers for the victims told the inquiry in 2020 that Kingspan, alongside Arconic, which made the cladding panels, and Celotex, which made 95% of the insulation used, were \u201clittle more than crooks and killers\u201d. Kingspan has denied wrongdoing and stressed it made only 5% of the insulation used on the tower and that its material was \u201cmisused\u201d in an \u201cunsafe and non-compliant system\u201d without its knowledge. It has said it has since conducted 15 fire tests of its K15-brand insulation in cladding systems that showed it was safe for use in those systems. The inquiry is yet to draw its conclusions but has already said the principal reason for the spread of fire was the ACM cladding manufactured by Arconic. There is no suggestion Kingspan sold the latest product directly to the Adair tower project or knew of its destination. Last week, council workers found the firm\u2019s insulation had been fitted to 16 balconies at the tower blocks and ordered the contractor, Lawtech, to immediately remove and replace it. The product was not combustible, the council said. \u201cLawtech\u2019s use of Kingspan is an absolute breach of our instruction and trust,\u201d said Kim Taylor-Smith, the lead council member for Grenfell housing, housing and social investment. \u201cI am deeply disappointed and have asked for a full explanation of how this has happened. I expect Lawtech to make an apology to our residents. \u201cWe made a public commitment in 2021 that the council would no longer contract with Kingspan, nor would we allow our contractors to subcontract with them or allow its use by any subcontractors on any projects in the borough. We stand by this commitment.\u201d The ban was a local political decision and does not apply elsewhere. The council said it would carry out spot checks \u201cto reassure our residents\u201d, and the cost of the material\u2019s removal would be paid for by the contractor, not the council or residents. Grenfell United, which represents bereaved families and survivors, said: \u201cWe are disgusted that once again contractors such as Lawtech have shown complete disregard and allowed Kingspan\u2019s product back into the homes of social housing tenants in Kensington and Chelsea. The lack of oversight that allowed this to happen is extremely concerning.\u201d Duggins said the discovery of the material further undermined trust between the council and residents. \u201cI think RBKC is rotten to the core and has to go,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be put in special measures.\u201d Lawtech said it was an \u201cisolated error\u201d and \u201cposed no risk whatsoever to any resident\u201d but accepted it breached the RBKC ban. \u201cLawtech have a very strict company policy of only installing non-flammable product on any of our projects,\u201d it said."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b67", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/13/rishi-sunak-changes-declaration-again-over-private-jet-travel-expenses", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rishi Sunak changes declaration again over private jet travel expenses ", "lead": "Questions continue to be raised about \u00a338,500 for travel to Tory events, now declared to be from millionaire Akhil Tripathi", "author": "Ben Quinn", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:56:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098690", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e2fcf4b4db32f8de8ab81473b6e7e2c227530eab/0_511_8100_4860/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has changed his expenses declaration over the funding of private jet travel to Tory events after questions were raised about why they were recorded as coming from a small company linked to a multimillionaire businessman. Sunak\u2019s latest declaration now names the donor of \u00a338,500 to pay for air travel by the prime minister and staff as Akhil Tripathi, a British-Indian medical tech entrepreneur who made a fortune from an anti-snoring device. Tripathi had previously donated to the Conservatives in 2021 and 2022. The declaration lists his address as \u201cprivate\u201d. The change is the third time that the declaration has been updated by the prime minister and comes after Labour wrote to two standards watchdogs to ask if any rules had been broken over declarations of more than \u00a388,000 over the past eight months for air travel by the prime minister and direct funding to the Tory party. Sunak had previously declared that the air travel \u2013 for him and eight staff to attend Conservative events in Scotland and Wales in April \u2013 was funded by Balderton Medical Consultants, a one-man business whose address on the donations register was given as a west London property. However, Land Registry records show that the property in Belgravia is owned by a firm based in the British Virgin Islands and Jersey. This firm\u2019s beneficial owner is Akhilesh Shailendra Tripathi. When the Guardian visited the property, a person who answered the door said it was not the address of Balderton Medical or of its sole director. Asked if the property was the house of Akhil Tripathi, the person said: \u201cYes.\u201d Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, said on Thursday that Sunak \u201cmade a deliberate decision\u201d in early June to change his declaration regarding the donation for the air travel, \u201cand he only changed it back again a month later after people started raising questions\u201d. \u201cOn the face of it, that first change now looks like a conscious breach of the rules on political donations, and it requires an immediate and credible explanation from the man who made it,\u201d she added. Labour has also been calling for scrutiny of a \u00a350,000 donation from Balderton which was declared by Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) to the Electoral Commission in November 2022. It used an address in the Leicestershire market town of Lutterworth, which is the firm\u2019s Companies House address. However, in the wake of the Sunak update on the funding of his air travel, Thornberry questioned whether the Tories still maintained that Balderton was the true source of the \u00a350,000, \u201cor whether that is a third declaration from the company that will require both correction and explanation\u201d. The Conservative party has been approached for comment. When it was approached by the Guardian earlier this month with questions about Sunak\u2019s earlier declarations for his air travel, a spokesperson for the party said: \u201cThis donation in kind was processed by the Conservative party, and the information then provided to the prime minister\u2019s office. \u201cCCHQ will now review the information provided. If necessary, any administrative errors will be corrected.\u201d A spokesperson for Tripathi\u2019s company, Signifier Medical Technologies, has previously said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any comments or information to offer regarding this situation.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b68", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/13/doctors-strike-nhs-rishi-sunak-pay-uk-politics-live", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "BMA rejects public sector pay rise and says government is making choices that leave people \u2018sicker and poorer\u2019\u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Doctors\u2019 union rejects offer while all four teaching unions urge their members to accept", "author": "Nadeem Badshah (now); Tom Ambrose and Kevin Rawlinson (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:34:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098708", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e67240bbac584134790cf8667e128cfb58b5ab/0_39_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "The chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s UK council said Rishi Sunak\u2019s pay increase offer \u201cfails to address\u201d years of below-inflation pay deals. Prof Phil Banfield said the government\u2019s offer \u201cis exactly why so many doctors are feeling they have no option but to take industrial action\u201d. Earlier, Sunak issued a warning to trade unions and workers still involved in strikes and industrial action, telling a Downing Street press conference the new pay offer is \u201cfinal\u201d. All four teaching unions recommended accepting a pay offer. In a joint statement with Sunak, they said: \u201cA 6.5% increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s WhatsApp messages are yet to be received by the Covid inquiry because he is said to have forgotten the passcode for his old phone. The former prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said Johnson still wanted to cooperate with the inquiry and did not deny being unable to recall the code. The Department for Education is to raid its existing budgets for \u00a31.4bn to help fund the 6.5% pay rise offered to teachers in England, as part of the deal announced between the government and the teaching and school leader unions. The government will help fund public sector pay increases by \u201csignificantly\u201d raising fees for migrants\u2019 applications for visas and their access to the NHS, Rishi Sunak said. Junior doctors began a five-day strike in England today, described as the longest walkout of its kind in the NHS\u2019s history. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there is \u201cno fat on the bone\u201d to fund staff pay rises out of existing hospital budgets. He told Channel 4 News: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look to us at first glance as though what has been identified by the prime minister and the chancellor as the money that will be available to pay for the gap between this offer and what is in the budget will be adequate.\u201d Millions of public sector workers ranging from teachers to prison offers are in line for pay rises of between 5% and 7% as part of a government offer that could head off some strikes. Prior to the announcement, ministers had stressed the need for \u201cdiscipline\u201d at a time of rising inflation. Rishi Sunak warned that pay increases could not \u201cfuel the fire\u201d of inflation, which is at 8.7%. While some of the offers are generous enough to be accepted by union leaders, the government will be hoping that the impact on future inflation will be limited as additional borrowing has been avoided and no more money is being pumped into the economy. Teachers A 6.5% pay rise is being offered to teachers in England in what appears to be a package that also avoids problems as to how increases would be funded. The general secretaries of four education unions have said they will recommend that their members accept the offer and call off industrial action. While unions have been insisting that pay increases come with extra resources from the government rather than being met from school budgets, the government is funding almost half of the pay rise by \u201creprioritising\u201d within its budgets. A former Tory MP who \u201csaw the light\u201d and switched to Labour in a high-profile defection has bid farewell to Westminster after nearly four decades. Making his valedictory retirement speech in parliament, Quentin Davies paid tribute to the NHS staff who saved his life after a near-fatal car crash. The former defence minister also praised the government\u2019s support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Davies was first elected to parliament in 1987, representing Stamford and Spalding and then the new seat of Grantham and Stamford until 2010, when he became a Labour peer in the House of Lords. The education secretary insists there will be no cuts to frontline education services despite teachers being offered a 6.5% pay rise by the government. Gillian Keegan said a reprioritising of the Department for Education\u2019s budget would be enough to cover the cost of the wage increase, announced by the Government on Thursday. The new deal, approved by the Government after a recommendation from the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body, is supported by the four teacher unions, the ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU. It is hoped that it will be enough to end the dispute over pay, with the unions balloting members with a recommendation to accept the pay offer. The news comes a day after members of the NASUWT voted in favour of industrial action, which, if the new deal is rejected, would see teachers stage continuous action short of strike action starting in September. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the ballot has \u201cunlocked months of prevarication\u201d and members \u201ccan now expect more money in their pockets\u201d as a result of previous action. If there is one constant in the UK\u2019s policy towards China over the past three decades it has been its short-termism and inconsistency, the scathing intelligence and security committee report on China rightly finds, comparing Britain\u2019s endless course corrections with Beijing\u2019s capacity to think strategically about how to advance the global interests of the Chinese Communist party. If Downing Street thinks in terms of the next news bulletin, China has a planning cycle that in some of its documents takes it to 2049, as the ISC was told by one of its intelligence agency witnesses. Moreover, China brings a whole-of-government response, while in the UK too much strategy is conceived in the Cabinet Office, as its implementation rests with individual Whitehall policy departments, many with no security remit or expertise. Funding pay deals will be a \u201cvery big challenge\u201d for many already squeezed public sector bodies, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee has said. Dame Meg Hillier told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know where it\u2019s going to come from in already overstretched situations. And my committee of course looks a lot at hospitals, schools and other bits of the public sector and we know that they\u2019re already very squeezed. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be some very painful choices for frontline leaders about how they\u2019re actually going to fund this.\u201d Hillier added it is \u201ca bit robbing Peter to pay Paul\u201d. The government has a \u201cpolitical imperative to try and deal with the strikes, but then they\u2019re storing up other challenges\u201d for the future, she said. The Unite union general secretary, Sharon Graham, has said she believes the public sector pay offers from the government will trigger more strikes. She told the BBC the government \u201care paying for some of it and then they\u2019re saying for the rest, which is about \u00a32bn, that that\u2019s going to come out of cut services and cut areas in departments. So all that\u2019s going to do is to stress workers out, make them have to work harder, more people will leave. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be seeing a new wave of industrial action.\u201d The health and social care secretary, Steve Barclay, said the government\u2019s acceptance of recommendations from pay review bodies and subsequent pay offer to health workers was \u201can opportunity for the NHS to move forward\u201d. Junior doctors, who began their longest walkout yet in England on Thursday, will receive 6% rises and an additional consolidated \u00a31,250 increase, while senior doctors, who are due to strike in England next week, will also receive a 6% rise. Barclay said: \u201cToday\u2019s offer, 10.3% for some doctors in training, some consultants getting pay rise of over \u00a37,000, is a fair offer, a fair settlement. \u201cIt reflects the hugely important work that doctors do, and it\u2019s an opportunity now for the NHS to move forward.\u201d Barclay denied the government would be making department cutbacks to fund the increases and said the proposed immigration surcharge increase \u201cbetter reflects the increased costs of providing NHS cover to those who come to the UK\u201d and was a \u201cfair and reasonable approach\u201d. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, has welcomed a decision to allow ministers to take a legal battle over its contentious Rwanda deportation policy to the supreme court. She said: \u201cI welcome this decision to grant permission to appeal. We need innovative solutions, like our migration partnership, to stop the boats, break the business model of the people-smuggling gangs and prevent further loss of life in the Channel.\u201d It comes after an order published by the court of appeal said it found there were \u201csubstantial grounds for believing that the removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda exposed them to a real risk of ill-treatment\u201d by being transferred to countries where they were at risk and violated the European convention on human rights. It confirmed that any removals under the deal remain unlawful unless the ruling is overturned, but added: \u201cPermission is granted to the [home secretary] to appeal to the supreme court.\u201d The Prison Officers Association (POA) said it will \u201cnot back down\u201d in the wake of pay rises offered by the government. The national chair of the union, Mark Fairhurst, said: \u201cThose members who received between 7% and 10% will not be fooled by yet another below-inflation award that will fail to convince them to stay in the service and will not improve their standard of living. \u201cYears of pay freezes and austerity now need to be addressed in future pay awards. \u201cWe will now consider our options in relation to the failure to award a non-consolidated cost of living payment in line with other civil servants.\u201d The government\u2019s independent review of teachers\u2019 pay paints a bleak picture for recruitment and retention, despite the government accepting its call for a 6.5% pay rise. The report of the School Teachers Review Body (STRB) said data on pay across the graduate labour market \u201cshow that some professions are offering significantly higher starting salaries than teaching\u201d, with \u201csystemic\u201d shortages in almost all subjects. The report lays out the case for the 6.5% pay rise, and states: \u201cThe STRB is deeply concerned about the overall level of recruitment, the general trend emerging and what appears to be a firmly established and persistent problem of under-recruitment in certain subjects. \u201cPersistent recruitment problems can result in a vicious circle where a shortage of teachers in a subject results in a deterioration in teaching quality. \u201cThe shortages we see in some subjects do not appear to be simply temporary but are systemic and require focused remediation with a long-term plan.\u201d The STRB cited excessive workload as one of the primary reasons teachers leave the profession. England\u2019s teaching and school leadership unions are balloting their members with a recommendation to accept the government\u2019s pay offer \u2013 but say they will continue with strike ballots if the offer is rejected. The National Education Union, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and the National Association of Head Teachers are currently balloting members over strike action, with voting until the end of the month. Geoff Barton, the ASCL\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOur executive committee has unanimously agreed to recommend the government offer to members. We will be asking them directly whether or not they accept the offer, and if their answer is \u2018yes\u2019 we will then halt our industrial action ballot and proceed no further.\u201d Downing Street reiterated that there would be \u201cno more talks on pay\u201d, after the BMA hit out at the pay offer for junior doctors announced on Thursday, PA reported. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: I don\u2019t think the prime minister could have been clearer today. There will be no more talks on pay. On the BMA\u2019s own figures for a pay increase, he said: That is simply not fair to taxpayers. From the deal, independently set by the PRBs (pay review bodies), junior doctors will see around a 9% uplift to pay. Anyone \u2026 would think that is a significant increase. Certainly we do and we will not countenance borrowing more money or increasing taxation to go beyond what the independent pay review bodies have recommended. A leading expert on migration policy has said the government\u2019s proposed changes will force many people trying to establish a new life in the UK into \u201csubstantial debt\u201d. Dr Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: Costs will fall unevenly on different groups of migrants. For some skilled workers, employers will absorb the cost \u2013 the UK is already one of the most expensive countries in the world and employers will not like it, but depending on the amount, they may well pay it anyway. The implications are more serious for the majority of migrants who pay the fees themselves. For example, a person joining their British partner in the UK already pays more than \u00a38,000 in government fees in the five years they spend in temporary status. There is already evidence that some migrants acquire substantial debt in order to pay fees, so a \u2018significant\u2019 fee rise could greatly increase the financial burden on new migrants in the UK as they try to establish themselves here. Boris Johnson\u2019s WhatsApp messages are yet to be received by the Covid inquiry because he is said to have forgotten the passcode for his old phone. The former prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said Johnson still wanted to cooperate with the inquiry and did not deny being unable to recall the code. Johnson stopped using the device in May 2021, after receiving security advice once it had emerged his phone number had been accessible online for at least 15 years. Bereaved families and technical experts have rubbished Johnson\u2019s excuse for not being able to send the messages to the inquiry, with experts noting the former prime minister would still be able to access his messages as long as his WhatsApp is backed up. Johnson used the Apple iPhone in question during the coronavirus pandemic. It is likely to contain messages relating to the announcement of lockdowns in 2020. The government handed over the rest of Johnson\u2019s unredacted notebooks, WhatsApp messages and diaries from his time in Downing Street to the inquiry after efforts to prevent their release failed. Steve Hartshorn, National Chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said of the 7% rise: That is a step in the right direction, but we must not lose sight of the fact that this uplift still fails to take account of the real term cut of 17% officers have suffered since 2000. It is important that government also provides new money for the pay award so that chief officers do not have to cut essential services to the public to fund it. Hearing today\u2019s news, I have no doubt that police officers will have mixed feelings \u2013 on the one hand, they will be pleased that the pay award was not as bad as some media outlets had speculated, but also disappointed that it doesn\u2019t fully take account of inflation, as they and their families struggle with increased utility, mortgage and food costs. We will continue to push for fair pay awards that take full account of inflation and recognise and reward the unique status of police officers; including the introduction of a fair, independent mechanism and negotiation process, so that we can properly sit down with government and employers to negotiate pay settlements that fully consider the risks and restrictions placed on police officers\u2019 private and professional lives. The focus going forward needs to be on pay restoration. The British Medical Association\u2019s chair of council says Rishi Sunak\u2019s pay increase offer \u201cfails to address\u201d years of below-inflation pay deals. Prof Phil Banfield said the government\u2019s offer \u201cis exactly why so many doctors are feeling they have no option but to take industrial action\u201d. He said: Today\u2019s announcement represents yet another pay cut in real terms and serves only to increase the losses faced by doctors after more than a decade\u2019s worth of sub-inflation pay awards. It completely ignores the BMA\u2019s calls to value doctors for their expertise by full pay restoration to 2008/2009 levels. With an NHS in crisis, seven and a half million patients on waiting lists, chronic underfunding and doctors being directly targeted with offers of work in Australia, this government should not be supporting pay uplifts which don\u2019t reverse years of sub inflation pay awards. He added: The political choices this government is making continue to make ordinary people sicker and poorer; that is an unconscionable position for a \u2018civilised\u2019 society to be in. The government has been accused of treating people born outside the UK as \u201ccash cows\u201d after Rishi Sunak said public sector pay increases would be funded by raising fees for migrants\u2019 visa applications and NHS access. Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, said raising \u201calready eye-wateringly high\u201d visa fees risked seeing people fall \u201cdeeper into poverty and insecurity\u201d. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz, the organisation\u2019s policy and public affairs manager, said migrants in the UK paid some of the highest costs in Europe, PA reported. She said: The people we see at Praxis already pay thousands of pounds each time they need to renew their visa, and are struggling to afford these fees, especially as the cost of living crisis drags on. More than half of the people we spoke to in research carried out last year were struggling to afford bills and food as a result of these visa fees. Hiking fees still further risks pushing thousands deeper into poverty and insecurity. And these are people who, in many cases, have already been living in our communities, working and paying taxes for many years. Instead of treating people who were born outside the UK as cash cows to be tapped when the need arises, the government should be doing everything it can to get control of the cost of living crisis and ensure that every household has the support they need. China\u2019s state institutions are aggressively targeting the UK, putting the country on course for a nightmare scenario that represents not just a commercial challenge but an existential threat to liberal democratic systems, parliament\u2019s influential all-party intelligence and security committee has found. The inquiry \u2013 launched in 2019 and subject to various delays was completed in May \u2013 is scathing about the failure of the UK to wake up to the scale of the systemic challenge posed by the Chinese government\u2019s \u201cwhole of state\u201d assault on the British economy, politics, civil infrastructure and academia. Saying that until recently the UK government was willing to accept Chinese money with few questions asked, it claimed \u201cas a consequence the UK is now playing catch-up and the whole of government has its work cut out to understand and counter the threat from China\u201d. The failure to respond to the economic threat posed by China, and to put in place a way of protecting UK assets \u201cis a serious failure and one that the UK may feel the consequences of for years to come\u201d, the parliamentarians found. The committee said: \u201cThere is no evidence that Whitehall policy departments have the necessary resources, expertise or knowledge of the threat to counter China\u2019s approach.\u201d The government\u2019s focus, the report said, was still dominated by short-term or acute threats. \u201cIt has consistently failed to think long term unlike China, which historically has been able to take advantage of this.\u201d In a scathing assessment of British academia\u2019s willingness to accept Chinese research grants, the report said, that \u201cwhile some have expressed concern others seem willing to turn a blind eye, happy simply to take the money\u201d. Catastrophic winter pressure on the NHS prompted junior doctors to ballot for strike action, the co-chair of the British Medical Association junior doctors committee said as members began a five-day walkout. Rob Laurenson told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the doctors had chosen to ballot after last winter \u201cbecause year on year we\u2019ve been saying that winters are catastrophic and that there are dangers\u201d. Junior doctors began a five-day strike in England on Thursday, in what is being called the longest walkout of its kind in NHS history. It comes amid continuing protests over pay in the health service. Laurenson added: \u201cAnd now, what we\u2019ve realised is that people are compartmentalising this sense of crisis in the NHS to winters alone. It is true that there will at least be one hospital in the country that is severely understaffed any single day of the year, and its the government\u2019s responsibility to be able to facilitate the environment for healthcare to be delivered at high standards to the people of this country.\u201d The government has been challenged in the Commons over plans to close railway ticket offices, including by the speaker, who told the rail minister that he was being misinformed by train operators. Labour described the consultation over the proposals to close most ticket offices in England as a \u201csham\u201d and Conservative MPs also raised concerns, as unions staged demonstrations around the country. The rail minister, Huw Merriman, sought to reassure MPs over what he said were industry-led proposals to cut costs, with revenue falling after the pandemic. Merriman said he believed that staff were better deployed on station concourses rather than \u201cbehind a glass screen\u201d, adding: \u201cI give the commitment again from the train operators that no currently staffed station will become unstaffed as a result of these changes.\u201d The comment prompted an unusual intervention from the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who highlighted issues in his Chorley constituency. Sir Lindsay Hoyle told Merriman that at Chorley \u201cthe proposal is only to have someone available nine until four, which is half the time the ticket office was [open] \u2026 What you are being told isn\u2019t the case.\u201d The Department for Education is to raid its existing budgets for \u00a31.4bn to help fund the 6.5% pay rise offered to teachers in England, as part of the deal announced between the government and the teaching and school leader unions. How pay rises would be funded was a major sticking point, with the unions insisting that pay increases come with extra resources from the government rather than being met from school budgets, as has happened in the past. Today\u2019s joint announcement from No 10, the DfE and the unions stated: \u201cImportantly, the government\u2019s offer is properly funded for schools. The government has committed that all schools will receive additional funding above what was proposed in March, building on the additional \u00a32bn given to schools in the autumn statement.\u201d The government had argued that its previous offer \u2013 amounting to an average rise of 4.3% \u2013 could be afforded out of the \u00a32bn increase last year, a position supported by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But the \u201cadditional funding\u201d being promised to pay for the higher increase announced today will come from the DfE, with an extra \u00a3500m in the 2023-24 financial year and \u00a3900m in 2024-25. The DfE said it will \u201creprioritise\u201d its existing budgets \u201cwhile protecting core budgets\u201d. The DfE said it would also provide a hardship fund of up to \u00a340m \u201cto support those schools facing the greatest financial challenges\u201d. The president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association Dr Naru Narayanan has said it is unlikely the prime minister\u2019s announcement will bring an end to industrial action: Instead of serious negotiation on doctors\u2019 pay we\u2019ve had a grandstanding PR stunt which remains scant on detail. The government has known the pay review body recommendations since May, but is still sitting on its detailed findings. This underlines why we are calling for root-and-branch reform of the system. What we do know is that this is in an imposed outcome with funding apparently coming from NHS cost-cutting. Slicing into health budgets is no way to resolve industrial action centred on staffing and retention, and overall a concern for patient care. Imposing it in this like-it-or-lump-it way is also a total misreading of the mood on the ground. The petulant refusal to negotiate we\u2019ve heard from the prime minister today won\u2019t help at all and betrays a level of immaturity at the heart of government. There is a way to resolve industrial action by doctors, but that\u2019s going to require serious discussion and acknowledgement of the central issue, which is over a decade of real-terms pay cuts. Without this it\u2019s highly doubtful we\u2019ll see an end to strikes. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents staff at organisations such as the Met Office, Health and Safety Executive and Natural England, has said: For a prime minister and chancellor who came into office promising economic stability, the chaotic handling of this process will inspire little confidence in workers worried about their futures during the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The fact that they are taking a knife to public services to pay for these pay rises signals that they have learned nothing from the austerity years. More than a decade of underfunding left us unprepared for the pandemic with public services across the board at breaking point. In particular, freezing civil service recruitment in the Ministry of Defence is a disastrous error that risks putting our nation\u2019s security at risk. The department already has thousands of vacancies, and many of these civil servants work directly supporting the effort to win the war in Ukraine. It\u2019s time the government recognised the value of its public services and allocated the money required to maintain them properly. Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, is giving testimony to the Covid inquiry. During the pandemic, Gove served as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and Cabinet Office minister. You can follow his testimony here: It is perhaps notable that Sunak tries to head off criticism that it has taken a great deal of time \u2013 and not a small amount of strife, including the cancelled appointments and lengthening NHS waiting lists he explicitly cites \u2013 for his government to come up with this offer. The prime minister says he has agreed to honour the independent bodies\u2019 recommendations. But that came after nearly three weeks of ministers talking up the idea that he might not. Moreover, public sector pay negotiations in general have been dragging on for many months, with several rounds of strikes causing significant disruption. Critics will ask why, if the prime minister think this is such a reasonable offer, it could not have been made earlier. It is also worth noting that the offer still constitutes real-terms pay cuts for millions of workers, coming on top of what unions say have been many years of the same. They are also nowhere near, in percentage-point terms, the 12.4% nominal increases junior doctors have been offered in Scotland. And that is not to mention the 26% the BMA has said would be needed to return the realterms pay of junior doctors\u2019 in England to pre-Tory government levels. Downing Street has released a full transcript of Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech announcing the new pay offer. When making decisions on pay, as your prime minister, I have a responsibility to be fair. Fair to public sector workers who do so much in the service of our country, but also fair to taxpayers who ultimately fund our public services. And the best way we\u2019ve found of making fair decisions about public sector pay are the independent pay review bodies. They were called for by the unions themselves. And, for over four decades, they have been the independent arbiters of what is fair and responsible. Those bodies have considered a range of evidence about where to set this year\u2019s pay. And their recommendations to government are for public sector pay rises to go up by a significant amount. Now, clearly, this will cost all of you as taxpayers more than we had budgeted for. That\u2019s why the decision has been difficult and why it has taken time to decide the right course of action. I can confirm that, today, we\u2019re accepting the headline recommendations of the pay review bodies in full. But we will not fund them by borrowing more or increasing your taxes. It would not be right to increase taxes on everyone to pay some people more; particularly when household budgets are so tight. Neither would it be right to pay for them by higher borrowing, because higher borrowing simply makes inflation worse. Instead, because we only have a fixed pot of money to spend from that means government departments have had to find savings and efficiencies elsewhere in order to prioritise paying public sector workers more. Now there is a clear message here. There are always choices, budgets are not infinite. When some ask for higher pay, that will always create pressures elsewhere costs which must ultimately be borne by the taxpayer \u2013 or spending less on our other priorities. So that\u2019s our decision. And having honoured the independent pay review process, I urge all union leaders to accept these pay offers and call off their strikes. Already, earlier this year, the NHS staff council representing over half a dozen unions, and over a million NHS workers made a significant decision and voted to accept our pay offer and suspend strikes. I\u2019m grateful to them and their members. And, today, in response to the news of our decision, I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019ve had another major breakthrough. All teaching unions have just announced that they\u2019re suspending all planned strikes immediately. Teachers will return to the classroom. Disruption to our children\u2019s education will end. And the unions have themselves confirmed that this pay offer is properly funded. And so, they\u2019re recommending to their members an end to the entire dispute. So it is now clear: Momentum across our public services is shifting. The vast majority, who just want to get on with their life\u2019s calling of serving others, are now returning to work. And, in that spirit, I want to address those yet to do so. Now that we\u2019ve honoured the independent pay recommendations, I implore you: Do the right thing, and know when to say yes. In particular, for doctors and consultants, I would say this: We have a national mission for all of us to make the NHS strong again. The government has not only made today\u2019s decision on pay, we\u2019ve backed the NHS with record funding, delivered the first ever fully funded longterm workforce plan and met the BMA\u2019s number one ask of government, with a pensions tax cut worth \u00a31bn. So, we should all ask ourselves, whether union leaders \u2013 or, indeed, political leaders \u2013 how can it be right to continue disruptive industrial action? Not least because these strikes lead to tens of thousands of appointments being cancelled every single day, and waiting lists going up, not down. So, today\u2019s offer is final. There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year\u2019s settlements. And no amount of strikes will change our decision. Instead, the settlement we\u2019ve reached today gives us a fair way to end the strikes. A fair deal for workers. And a fair deal for the British taxpayer. Thank you. Rishi Sunak said \u201cit\u2019s not about cuts\u201d but about departments reprioritising resources. The prime minister said: We are reprioritising. So we are asking departments to reprioritise to support public sector workers and that will mean in other areas \u2013 it\u2019s not about cuts, it\u2019s just about focusing on public sector workers\u2019 pay rather than other things. And I\u2019m really pleased that the teaching unions specifically have said that this pay offer is properly funded. He said \u201cno cuts will need to be made\u201d in schools. The government will help fund public sector pay increases by \u201csignificantly\u201d raising fees for migrants\u2019 visa applications and NHS access, Rishi Sunak said. The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference: \u201cWhat we have done are two things to find this money. \u201cThe first is we\u2019re going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas. \u201cAnd indeed, something called the immigration health surcharge, which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS. \u201cSo all of those fees are going to go up and that will raise over a billion pounds.\u201d Rishi Sunak offered a warning to trade unions and workers still involved in strikes and industrial action. He told a Downing Street press conference that the new pay offer is \u201cfinal\u201d. \u201cNow there\u2019s a clear message here. There are always choices. Budgets are not infinite. When some ask for higher pay, that will always create pressures elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is now clear momentum across our public services is shifting. The vast majority who just want to get on with their life\u2019s calling of serving others are now returning to work. \u201cToday\u2019s offer is final. There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year\u2019s settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.\u201d He said the accepted recommendations were a \u201cfair deal for the British taxpayer\u201d. Rishi Sunak has confirmed the public sector pay rises will not be funded by more government borrowing. He told a press conference in Downing Street: Those [pay review] bodies have considered a range of evidence about where to set this year\u2019s pay. And their recommendations to government are for public sector pay rises to go up by a significant amount. Now clearly, this will cost all of you as taxpayers more than we had budgeted for. That\u2019s why the decision has been difficult, and why it has taken time to decide the right course of action. I can confirm today that we are accepting the headline recommendations of the pay review bodies in full, but we will not fund them by borrowing more or increasing your taxes. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, have issued a joint statement on pay alongside the general secretaries of the four education unions \u2013 Mary Bousted, Kevin Courtney, Geoff Barton, Paul Whiteman and Patrick Roach \u2013 as well as the general secretary-elect of the NEU, Daniel Kebede. \u201cThis is the largest ever recommendation from the school teachers\u2019 review body (STRB),\u201d it said. \u201cA 6.5% increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession. The government has accepted the STRB\u2019s recommendation and has agreed to bring forward wider reforms to reduce teacher and leader workload in partnership with all four unions. \u201cImportantly, the government\u2019s offer is properly funded for schools. The government has committed that all schools will receive additional funding above what was proposed in March, building on the additional \u00a32bn given to schools in the autumn statement. \u201cThe government will also provide a hardship fund of up to \u00a340m to support those schools facing the greatest financial challenges. \u201cASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU will now put this deal to members, with a recommendation to accept the STRB recommendation. This deal will allow teachers and school leaders to call off strike action and resume normal relations with government.\u201d The prime minister is holding a press conference following the news that he has agreed to give millions of public sector workers a pay rise of at least 6%. You can follow the stream below. We will bring you the latest from it shortly. Millions of public sector workers will be given a pay rise of at least 6%, but government departments have been told to fund the rise from within existing budgets. Police officers, junior doctors and teachers in England are among those who would benefit after the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, accepted all the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies. Senior government figures are understood to have been concerned about the effects of the pay boost on stubbornly high inflation. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, ruled out providing any extra money funded through borrowing. The move will leave departments facing difficult decisions about how to reallocate spending, with potential knock-on effects for frontline services cuts. The Treasury had budgeted for pay rises of about 3.5%, meaning between \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn will need to be found across Whitehall to make up the shortfall. Rishi Sunak\u2019s report back from the Nato summit in the Commons earlier passed by with barely a mention of the defence secretary\u2019s comments that Ukraine should show \u201ca bit of gratitude\u201d for the military aid it has received from the west. The PM appeared keen to draw a line under the row and when Ben Wallace was praised by the Conservative backbencher Mark Francois for his support to Ukraine, he was not name-checked by Sunak in his reply. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, did, however, ask the prime minister \u201cto correct the record\u201d after an overnight tweet from Sunak which said: \u201cLabour didn\u2019t want me to attend Nato this week.\u201d The opposition leader told MPs that \u201con the contrary, we were delighted that he was there, because in an ever more dangerous world, we must be united\u201d and emphasised his party\u2019s commitment to Nato dating back to its foundation under the postwar Attlee government. Last week the veteran Labour backbencher Chris Bryant had criticised Sunak for his lack of attendance at prime minister\u2019s questions, to which Sunak had responded by saying the clash with the Nato summit was unavoidable. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit rich for you to attack me for missing prime minister\u2019s question time,\u201d Sunak said during tense exchanges in which the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, increasingly interrupted to control the noise in the chamber. The Times\u2019s political editor, Steven Swinford, is reporting that Rishi Sunak has accepted the recommendations of \u201call public sector pay review bodies\u201d. It means that millions of public sector workers, including teachers, doctors and police officers, could get pay rises of 6% or more \u2013 but it will be funded from existing budgets. He outlines the projected increases in the tweet below. Labour said the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s fiscal risks report demonstrated the government would \u201cnever match the ambition\u201d of the UK public. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: This report shows just how far we are falling behind our peers, how exposed our economy is, and again highlights that the government is failing to take action in areas like energy security to help get bills down. It tells you all you need to know that the cost of government borrowing has risen faster in the UK than elsewhere in the G7 and faster than at any time in the last 40 years. There are serious decisions to be made by this Tory government to restore some security in our economy, to get a grip on inflation, and to stop people\u2019s bills rising. Instead, this new evidence and falling growth figures today show they will never match the ambition of the British people. It\u2019s time for them to step aside and let Labour restore our national economic and financial security, driven by our mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the government would take \u201cdifficult but responsible\u201d decisions on public sector pay, ahead of the announcement of settlements for millions of workers. He told MPs that \u201cit is important to deliver on the prime minister\u2019s priority to get debt falling and to control borrowing to avoid adding inflationary pressures and risk prolonging higher inflation\u201d, PA reported. \u201cThat means taking difficult but responsible decisions on the public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary,\u201d Hunt said. His comments came in a written statement responding to the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s fiscal risks and sustainability report. The budget watchdog\u2019s report warned that the public finances are in a \u201cvery risky\u201d period after a series of shocks left them in a \u201cvulnerable position\u201d on tackling challenges such as an ageing population. The Home Office will offer \u201cno more concessions\u201d, a government source has told the Guardian, after peers made numerous changes to plans designed to tackle the small boats issue. The House of Lords voted to reinstate provisions to the illegal migration bill that were removed by MPs earlier in the week. In a series of votes that went on until the early hours of Thursday, peers inflicted nine defeats on the government \u2013 triggering \u201cping pong\u201d, meaning the draft legislation will go back to the Commons next week. Ministers hope the bill will be passed before the summer recess, which starts next Friday. BBC chief Tim Davie will be questioned in parliament about the corporation\u2019s leadership following the Huw Edwards scandal. The BBC director general, acting chairwoman Dame Elan Closs Stephens and policy director Clare Sumner have been called to appear before the Lords Communications Committee on Tuesday. The peers will raise a range of issues, including \u201cin light of recent events, what concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the BBC\u2019s governance arrangements and how it is addressing these\u201d. Labour would make it \u201cimpossible\u201d for the prime minister not to take action where appropriate in cases of suspected misconduct by bringing the ministerial standards process further into the public domain, Angela Rayner said. The party\u2019s deputy leader said it is currently \u201cat the prime minister\u2019s whim whether they open an investigation\u201d into accusations, PA Media reported. Labour would create an independent ethics and integrity commission with stronger powers than the current system and force it to report to parliament annually, Rayner said. \u201cThe prime minister would find it impossible then to not carry out those functions and do what is required, because that transparency is there,\u201d she said. Junior doctors and members of the British Medical Association (BMA) on the picket line outside Leeds General Infirmary at the start a five-day strike amid the continuing dispute over pay, the longest walkout of its kind in the history of the NHS. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner claimed Boris Johnson is not \u201cjust one bad apple\u201d as she made the case for an overhaul of the public standards system. Speaking to the Institute for Government, she said: Take Boris Johnson as just a random example \u2013 a very effective confidence trickster. He certainly sounded like the typical good chap but I don\u2019t think there are many serious people who would call him that now. From unlawfully proroguing parliament to breeding a culture of rule-breaking at the heart of Downing Street during a global pandemic, then lying about it. She said \u201cthis isn\u2019t all about him\u201d and that Conservative MPs, including the current prime minster Rishi Sunak, \u201cenabled him and propped him up\u201d. Rayner added: I\u2019m afraid Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t just one bad apple. Over the last decade, standards in public life have been relentlessly eroded by Tory sleaze and scandal, from serious breaches of the ministerial code to the revolving door between ministerial office and lobbying. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has hit a new record. An estimated 7.47 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of May, up from 7.42 million in March, NHS England said. It is the highest number since records began in August 2007. Prime minister Rishi Sunak has made cutting waiting lists one of his priorities for 2023, pledging in January that \u201clists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly\u201d. A junior doctor on the picket line outside the University College Hospital in London said she is \u201cworried\u201d for the NHS\u2019s future. Rebecca Lissmann, 29, told the PA news agency: I feel worried because people sometimes compare medicine to the aviation industry but if they\u2019re short-staffed a flight gets cancelled, if we\u2019re short-staffed an operation might be cancelled. I was on a long weekend on call the other week and I was essentially doing the job of two people. If something went wrong these patients are my responsibility. We want to deliver care that we\u2019re proud of and what we would want our family to receive but that\u2019s not possible at the moment. I look at my rota and there\u2019s gaps where they need people to fill shifts; these shifts are getting advertised in WhatsApp groups. Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are finalising decisions on pay for millions of public sector workers against a backdrop of a doctors\u2019 strike, a weak economy and persistent high inflation. The prime minister and chancellor are meeting on Thursday to decide whether to accept the recommendations of pay bodies which are thought to be suggesting rises of around 6-6.5% for a variety of professions from medics to teachers, PA Media reported. A failure to accept the reports would provoke further rows with the unions, a problem underlined as junior doctors embarked on their longest walkout yet in England on Thursday. The Treasury has ruled out increasing borrowing to pay for wage rises, meaning any extra cash for workers may have to come from raiding existing departmental budges, potentially meaning cuts to services. The current level of CPI inflation is running at 8.7% and Sunak \u2013 who has promised to cut it to about 5.3% by the end of the year \u2013 wants to avoid pay increases which could fuel a wage-price spiral. The wider economic challenge facing the Chancellor and prime minister was illustrated by official figures showing the UK economy contracted in May. Written statements listed on Thursday\u2019s order paper show ministers are due to give updates on the NHS, police, teachers, the armed forces, civil service and the justice system. Disruption to thousands of planned appointments is expected as junior doctors in England on Thursday started their longest walkout yet in protest over pay. The strike started at 7am and ends at the same time on Tuesday. A junior doctor on the picket lane outside University College Hospital in central London said many medics are considering moving abroad to work. Arjan Sing, 27, who works in the capital, told the PA news agency: Medicine is one of those careers you have to start planning for from about the age of 14 so people spend their lives planning their career. Those people are now thinking of leaving and they\u2019re now making concrete plans to leave. There are all these countries that care about their doctors and our government is not respecting us. People have seen this coming and doctors have realised they work in a global market, they\u2019re not restricted to this country. NHS Providers has urged both sides to resume talks in a bid to head off more industrial action. Deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: The impact of these disputes is fraying the fabric of the NHS, held together by a unique sense of commitment and shared endeavour across the workforce that has served it so well over so many years. We lose that at our peril. The disruption for many thousands of patients and the potential harm of delaying their treatment is a huge and growing risk for the NHS to manage. Trusts will hardly have time to draw breath after a five-day walkout by junior doctors before consultants strike for two days, followed by a two-day strike by radiographers. The domino effect of repeated waves of industrial action is eroding the fundamental relationship between trust leaders and their staff. Trust leaders understand the strength of feeling among striking staff, who they value and work with for patients every day, and why they are taking action. Trusts will continue to do everything they can to limit disruption and keep patients safe but that\u2019s getting harder and more expensive with every strike as the cost of hiring cover grows, and with staff dissatisfaction increasing as disputes remain unresolved. Eight consecutive months of industrial action across the NHS are taking their toll not just on patients, with more than 651,000 routine procedures and appointments forced to be rescheduled, but on already overstretched services - hampering efforts to cut waiting lists. Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to cut NHS waiting times will be impossible to meet if strikes are still disrupting care beyond the summer, health service chiefs have privately warned ministers. The prime minister promised in January that \u201cNHS waiting lists will fall\u201d when he outlined five pledges, reflecting \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d, by which voters should judge his performance, he said. However, NHS England has told ministers that hospitals will not be able to ensure that Sunak fulfils his pledge because of the disruption caused by junior doctors\u2019 ongoing strikes. Services, including surgery and outpatient appointments, will be hit again from Thursday when tens of thousands of junior doctors in England take part in a five-day walkout \u2013 the longest stoppage in NHS history. It will be their fourth bout of industrial action since March. Good morning. Junior doctors are beginning a five-day strike in England today. It is being described as the longest walkout of its kind in the NHS\u2019s history amid ongoing protests over pay in the health service. The strikes are being held amid speculation the government will say if it is going to accept recommendations from pay review bodies affecting public sector workers including teachers, civil servants and NHS workers. There is speculation that the bodies have recommended rises of between 6% and 6.5%. BMA leaders urged the Government to return to the negotiating table in a bid to resolve the long-running row, which has already led to a series of strikes and thousands of cancelled operations and consultations. BMA leaders Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said: Today marks the start of the longest single walkout by doctors in the NHS\u2019s history, but this is still not a record that needs to go into the history books. We can call this strike off today if the UK Government will simply follow the example of the government in Scotland and drop their nonsensical precondition of not talking whilst strikes are announced and produce an offer which is credible to the doctors they are speaking with. The pay offer on the table to junior doctors in Scotland and how it was reached throws into sharp relief the obstinate approach being taken by the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay. The Health Secretary has said there can be no talks while strikes are planned - Scotland has proved him wrong. He said above 5% wasn\u2019t realistic - Scotland proved him wrong. He refused to even acknowledge the concept of pay restoration - Scotland proved this is not only possible but essential. The BMA leaders said talks have to be resumed, adding: The government\u2019s refusal to talk with junior doctors in England who have strikes planned is out of keeping with all norms of industrial action. Doctors have a right to expect that as in Scotland, and as in many other recent industrial disputes, talks will continue right up to the last minute to try and reach a deal without the need to strike. The complete inflexibility we see from the UK government today is baffling, frustrating and ultimately destructive for everyone who wants waiting lists to go down and NHS staffing numbers to go up. The government has missed chance after chance to provide a credible offer and potentially bring to an end the industrial action by junior doctors in England and whilst there are differences between junior doctors and governments in England and Scotland, the UK government has far more financial freedom to give doctors what they deserve. We\u2019ll bring you the latest updates on this and other political stories throughout the day."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b69", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jul/13/dele-alli-was-always-synonymous-with-bravery-he-has-upped-the-ante", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dele Alli was always synonymous with bravery.

He does this a lot. It is one of his defence mechanisms, a way of pushing back at all the hurt. He knows that now. Gary Neville is interviewing him for The Overlap and has just asked about his childhood. \u201cI think there were a few incidents that can give you a kind of brief understanding,\u201d Dele says, and there is a pause, an internal struggle \u2013 of the type he has wrestled with throughout his life. And then Dele kicks open the window to his soul. \u201cSo, at six, I was molested by my mum\u2019s friend, who was at the house a lot \u2026 so my mum was an alcoholic, and then \u2026\u201d The lump in Dele\u2019s throat has tightened, his voice cracks. He bows his head and fights back the tears. So does Neville. \u201cSorry,\u201d Dele says. Why do the victims always say that? Dele goes on to talk about how he was sent to live with his absentee father in Africa for a year to \u201clearn discipline\u201d, although he was returned after six months. \u201cHorrible,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be there at all.\u201d Growing up was impossibly tough for Dele on his estate in Milton Keynes. His mother had no money and there were no boundaries, no rules. Dele had a house key and he came and went as he pleased. He was smoking at seven, running drugs on his push-bike at eight. At 11 he was, in his words, \u201chung off a bridge by a guy from the next estate, a man\u201d. Dele tells Neville that \u201cthere were always 10 guys around the house \u2026 it was definitely the drugs part\u201d. He was regularly in trouble with the police and it was only when he was adopted at 12 by the parents of his best friend, Harry Hickford, that he felt some stability. Even then, and despite how heaven-sent the Hickfords were, Dele struggled to open up to them. He was worried that they might have got rid of him. Dele has long been a closed book, not allowing people in, believing that to do so would mean getting hurt. Until now. Until he took the decision to sit down with Neville. And now we know. We can understand him and his troubles more clearly. If a million people woke up on Thursday with opinions about Dele\u2019s on-field slump, which has broadly followed the 2018 World Cup when he was a part of the England team that reached the semi-finals, then how many of them have been radically altered? Dele has not been himself for a number of years and it has been possible to feel that he was no longer able to make the sacrifices needed to remain at the top level. It was also easy to link that to the impression he was drinking and partying too much. Which is not to say that these sentences read poorly and are untrue. Just that there is another, previously untold dimension \u2013 Dele\u2019s mental health nightmare, which has its roots in childhood trauma. It is an uncomfortable moment in the Neville interview when Dele says he would rather have waited a little longer before being so candid; he only finished a six-week stint in a US mental health rehabilitation facility in the middle of June, where he came to terms with, among many other things, his addiction to sleeping pills. He was taking them not to sleep but to \u201cescape from reality\u201d. Dele says his team had received calls about where he was from the media. They knew and it was possibly only a matter of time before they ran the story. Consequently, he felt he had to act, to own the narrative. Yet how he does so. Dele has always been synonymous with bravery, certainly on his way up from MK Dons to Tottenham and the summit of the game; how he would risk the ball and try all his moves \u2013 no matter how outrageous. This is him upping the ante significantly because, to repeat, he is not a person that shares easily. It is a problem in football, where the pressure to perform is matched by that to conform to particular ideals of behaviour; show no weakness being one. What stands out in Dele\u2019s account is how unforgiving and isolating the professional game can be, how the dream can unravel, the size of the gap between perception and reality. Imagine wanting to retire at 24. Dele did, after being dropped by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Spurs, although he stresses that he does not want to blame his former manager for his troubles. He does say it was tough for him when Mauricio Pochettino left Tottenham in 2019 \u2013 \u201cMauricio cared about me as a person before the football, which is what I needed\u201d \u2013 but none of this is anyone\u2019s fault, rather the outcome of a specific set of circumstances. Dele eventually realised he needed help when he was told that he had to undergo hip surgery in mid-April, ending his loan at Besiktas from Everton; he could feel the grip of darkness, the start of a familiar cycle and he simply could not bear it any longer. Dele knows that he cannot bottle it all up any more and he wants to show it is OK not to be OK, to help himself and hopefully others who feel trapped. It is unclear whether Dele\u2019s future lies at Everton, where he is contracted for another 12 months; they would have to pay Spurs \u00a310m if he made a further seven appearances for them. But no matter what, Everton have shown their class by supporting him in his rehabilitation, for which he is enormously grateful. Dele says he feels rejuvenated, that he has the same passion and determination to prove himself as he had when he arrived at Spurs in 2015. It is lovely to hear and so are the messages of goodwill from all over the game. Dele has always been easy to love but never more so than now.

The British Medical Association said the government was \u201cdriving doctors away\u201d from the health service and had missed an opportunity to put a credible pay offer on the table to end strikes when it accepted all the recommendations of the pay review bodies. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN), whose members were offered 5% under separate NHS negotiations, accused ministers of taking a \u201ccavalier\u201d approach to pay when 100,000 nurses had voted to continue strike action in the latest ballot. \u201cToday\u2019s news will only add to that number,\u201d it said. The government has been contending with the most widespread public sector strikes in decades as workers demand higher pay to make up for previous below-inflation rises or freezes, and to help them through the cost of living crisis. Health services, including surgery and outpatient appointments, have all been hit by the unprecedented five-day junior doctors\u2019 strike that began on Thursday. Consultants are due to take industrial action next week. Millions of public sector workers in England including teachers, police officers and prison officers were offered a pay rise of between 5% and 7% on Thursday, but, as the Guardian revealed on Tuesday, Whitehall departments have been told to fund the rise from existing budgets. In a boost for Sunak, however, education unions said they were recommending teachers accept their 6.5% offer, which came with a guarantee that it would not be funded from the existing schools budget but from elsewhere in the department. At a Downing Street press conference, Sunak confirmed that public sector pay rises in 2023-24, which would cost \u00a32bn extra this year, would be funded from \u201csavings and efficiencies\u201d in existing departmental budgets and not from more government borrowing, which might have fuelled inflation. Imploring striking public sector workers to end their industrial action, he said: \u201cToday\u2019s offer is final. There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year\u2019s settlements. And no amount of strikes will change our decision.\u201d As the longest strike in NHS history got under way, the prime minister claimed the pay offers could be funded without hitting frontline services, and told doctors to \u201cdo the right thing and know when to say yes\u201d. The highest pay rise, 7%, will go to police officers, funded partly by the Home Office increasing the cost of work and study visas for immigrants. A reduction in hiring civil servants in the Ministry of Defence until 2025 will be used to meet a 5% pay rise for armed forces personnel. The immigration health surcharge, a fee for foreigners to access the NHS, will be increased from \u00a3624 to \u00a31,000 to cover the extra 6% pay for junior doctors. Prison officers will get a 7% increase, while senior civil servants will get 5.5%. The visa fees and NHS surcharge will raise around half the extra \u00a32bn needed to fund the pay rises, with the rest coming from departmental \u201cunderspend\u201d and \u201creprioritising\u201d other spending. The education department, for example, is scaling back skills bootcamps and traineeships for officials. The government\u2019s proposed 6% pay rise for junior doctors, plus a \u00a31,250 payment, falls substantially short of the 35% wage increase demanded by the BMA to reverse what it claims is 15 years of wage erosion. The chair of the BMA\u2019s UK council, Prof Phil Banfield, said that though doctors remained \u201cwilling to talk\u201d, the pay offer meant they were likely to continue with industrial action. It was also \u201chighly likely\u201d that GPs and speciality doctors \u201cwill consider their next steps\u201d. \u201cThis government is driving doctors away from the NHS and this country; it needs to wake up and realise the true cost of keeping the expertise of doctors,\u201d Banfield said. \u201cIt missed a huge opportunity to put a credible proposal on the table to end strikes. \u201cThis uplift still fails tens of thousands of frontline staff and is unlikely to do much to help retain a beleaguered, burnt out, undervalued workforce.\u201d More than 1 million NHS staff, including nurses, porters and ambulance staff, have already been offered a 5% increase by the government for 2023-24, along with a one-off payment for last year, under the NHS\u2019s agenda for change contract. The RCN, which is considering whether to ballot members again after failing to meet the turnout threshold last month, although a majority of those who did vote supported further action, criticised the government for failing to offer them more. Pat Cullen, the RCN\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe prime minister will have to explain to over a million outraged NHS workers why they are getting the lowest pay rise in the public sector. \u201cRecord numbers of jobs in the NHS are unfilled and the government cannot expect to turn that around when it appears not to value them. Patients are paying the price. \u201cInflation is not coming down in the way ministers told NHS staff and others it would. For nursing staff, the pay rise they actually rejected is worth increasingly little and being eclipsed now by announcements for other professions. It is unfair and inadequate. \u201cThis seems a highly cavalier approach by government when it knows over 100,000 nursing staff across the country voted to continue strike action only days ago. Today\u2019s news will only add to that number.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b6b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/13/ion-izagirre-stage-12-jonas-vingegaard-tour-de-france-cycling", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vingegaard insists he is unfazed by Pogacar as Grand Colombier looms", "lead": "The rivalry between Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar is set to reach boiling point on Friday, after a stage won by Ion Izagirre when little changed in the GC", "author": "Jeremy Whittle in Belleville-en-Beaujolais", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:08:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098768", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/394ecede1426e9e659e2deb4753074333a681142/1246_606_4486_2692/500.jpg", "body": "The rivalry between the defending Tour de France champion, Jonas Vingegaard, and his closest rival, Tadej Pogacar, is set to reach boiling point on the steep slopes of the Grand Colombier, overlooking the Rhone, on Friday. After another stage characterised by some early sparring between the two race favourites and their teams, eventually won by the Basque rider Ion Izagirre, there remains nothing to choose between the pair. On the eve of the Tour\u2019s third mountain-top finish, the race for the maillot jaune is finely balanced. On a climb as severe as the \u201cbeyond category\u201d Grand Colombier, with a 17km ascent at an average gradient of 7%, Vingegaard\u2019s 17sec lead on Pogacar is wafer thin. Vingegaard, of the Jumbo-Visma team, and the UAE Emirates team leader, Pogacar, both insist they are feeling \u201cbetter and better\u201d as the race goes on, but there is growing tension in their duel. Pogacar famously humiliated the Dane\u2019s Jumbo-Visma team in the dramatic denouement of the 2020 Tour, unseating Vingegaard\u2019s teammate Primoz Roglic in the penultimate time trial stage to take his first yellow jersey in Paris. Vingegaard continues to maintain his composure but, as the gap between them narrows, the pressure to prevent the unpredictable Slovenian from pulling off another coup is growing. Speaking after the stage to Belleville, the defending champion again kept his cards close to his chest. Asked if he thought the Grand Colombier was better suited to him or Pogacar, he was noncommittal. \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard climb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also super-long. It\u2019s always hard to say before. It depends on who\u2019s feeling good and who\u2019s not. If you feel great, you try \u2013 if not, you wait.\u201d While it seems almost inevitable that Pogacar will seek to maintain his momentum and to narrow the gap on the race leader even further, the Dane seemed untroubled. \u201cI\u2019m just happy where I am at the moment,\u201d Vingegaard said. \u201cI don\u2019t think about who has the momentum, I just think about myself. You can have a plan to be attacking, but if you don\u2019t have the legs it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Izagirre, riding for Cofidis, won stage 12 after a solo attack in the final 30km. It was his team\u2019s second success in this year\u2019s Tour, after the French rider Victor Lafay\u2019s win in San Sebasti\u00e1n on stage two. After another frantic opening to the stage, in which multiple riders fought to escape the peloton, the race eventually settled down, but only after almost 80km of attacking, with two main groups battling for control of the situation. The leading group of 15 riders, including Izagirre, entered the triptych of hills, the cols of the Casse Froide, Croix Montmain and Croix Rosier, leading to the finish in Belleville, with a three-and-a-half-minute lead on a second group of 39 that included Vingegaard, Pogacar and their main rivals. In the front group of 15, the French favourites Thibaut Pinot of Groupama FDJ, and Julian Alaphilippe, riding for Soudal Quickstep, were aware they would need to drop the fast finishers Mads Pedersen, of Lidl-Trek, and Jasper Philipsen\u2019s Alpecin Deceuninck teammate Mathieu van der Poel to have any hope of a stage win. But Izagirre\u2019s stealth and cunning went under the radar and, as the numbers in the lead group dwindled, the 34-year-old broke clear on the final climb, the Col de la Croix Rosier, to take the second Tour stage win of his career. The group containing Vingegaard and Pogacar came in a little over four minutes later, with no significant changes to the top places in the general classification. Of the peloton\u2019s big names, the main beneficiary of the day was the climbing specialist Pinot, who leapfrogged five positions in the GC to 10th, six minutes behind the defending champion, with the Jura and the Alps coming into view. Racing in his last Tour, Pinot may yet prove an influential figure."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b6c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/pentagon-chief-republian-senator-tommy-tuberville", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Biden attacks \u2018ridiculous\u2019 Republican senator for blocking military picks", "lead": "President says Tommy Tuberville is jeopardising national security with protest against defense department\u2019s abortion policy", "author": "Martin Pengelly in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:05:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098787", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/12976ae13964e17e7c3c8ab84d75a3cb0280dd8c/0_294_5799_3479/500.jpg", "body": "The Alabama Republican senator Tommy Tuberville is jeopardising US national security by blocking military leadership confirmations in protest of Pentagon policy on abortion, Joe Biden and the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters in Finland, where he attended meetings after the Nato summit in Lithuania, Biden said he would talk to Tuberville if he thought there was any prospect he would change his \u201cridiculous\u201d position. \u201cHe\u2019s jeopardising US security by what he\u2019s doing,\u201d the president said. \u201cI expect the Republican party to stand up \u2013 stand up \u2013 and do something about it. It\u2019s in their power to do that \u2026 they\u2019ve got to stand up and be counted. That\u2019s how it ends.\u201d The conservative-dominated US supreme court removed the federal right to abortion last year. Tuberville, a former football coach now a supporter of Donald Trump on the far right of the Republican party, mounted his obstruction effort earlier this year. He is seeking the end of Department of Defense policy that provides paid time off and covers travel costs for servicewomen and dependents in need of abortion services. The effect of Tuberville\u2019s block became strikingly evident this week, when the US Marine Corps found itself without a permanent commander for the first time in 164 years, since before the civil war. The Pentagon has said more than 650 leadership positions could be vacant by the end of the year. Biden\u2019s secretary of defense, the retired army general Lloyd Austin, told CNN: \u201cThis is a national security issue. It\u2019s a readiness issue. And we shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves, I think any member of the Senate armed services committee knows that.\u201d Austin added: \u201cI don\u2019t have an abortion policy, I have an access to non-covered reproductive healthcare policy \u2026 and I think that\u2019s an important policy. \u201cOne in five of my troops \u2026 is a woman and our women provide tremendous value to this force, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.\u201d Earlier this week, Gen Charles Brown Jr, Joe Biden\u2019s nominee for chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told a congressional committee: \u201cWe will lose talent because of these challenges.\u201d Brown\u2019s own confirmation could be held up. The current chair of the joint chiefs, Gen Mark Milley, is due to step down in October. In Finland, Biden said: \u201cThe idea that we don\u2019t have a chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the idea that we have all these promotions that are in abeyance right now \u2026 the idea that we\u2019re injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what is in fact a debate on social policy issues, is bizarre \u2026 it\u2019s totally irresponsible, in my view.\u201d Tuberville is also under fire for having shown reluctance to denounce white nationalism, a position which this week prompted the author Steven King to say the senator \u201cgives new meaning to the word idiot\u201d. Like Austin, Gen Brown is African American. Austin told CNN Brown was \u201cselected by the president not solely because he is African American. He is a really, really good officer and a great fighter pilot \u2026 I think he\u2019s the right guy at the right time for this job.\u201d Tuberville has told Politico his objection to the Pentagon policy is \u201cnot just about abortion\u201d but \u201cabout dictating from the White House. Being a dictator, we don\u2019t need dictators. You can\u2019t dictate a law, it\u2019s supposed to go through us.\u201d According to Politico, Biden sees Tuberville as a profitable campaign-trail target, calling Tuberville \u201cthe former football coach from Alabama, who was a better coach than he\u2019s a senator\u201d. Tuberville told Politico Biden \u201cwas a better senator than a president\u201d. John Wahl, chair of the Alabama Republican party, told the same site Tuberville\u2019s Pentagon protest \u201cdoes not hurt him at all\u201d politically and is \u201cgood representation for the people of Alabama and it\u2019s the right policy for any senator\u201d. The Democratic Virginia congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA case officer, told MSNBC, Tuberville\u2019s protest was \u201cirresponsible\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous and it needs to stop,\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cIt is dangerous to our nation, and to our readiness.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b6d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-strike-drone-missile-strike-kyiv-zelenskiy-nato-summit", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Biden says \u2018no real prospect\u2019 of Putin using nuclear weapons \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "US president plays down worries during Finland visit when asked about whether Russian president could escalate action in Ukraine", "author": "Sammy Gecsoyler (now); Martin Belam and Helen Sullivan (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:05:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098807", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2c03226504d9b1fb9e24ead979c522aebbad63bd/543_167_4353_2612/500.jpg", "body": "This blog is now closing.

Speaking to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Austin said: \u201cI have no doubt that will happen, and we heard just about every country in the room say as much.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s top security official has dismissed criticism of Kyiv from the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, suggesting Wallace misspoke due to a surfeit of emotion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to what he said,\u201d Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s security council, told the Guardian in Kyiv on Thursday. \u201cEveryone can say something when they are emotional and then regret it \u2026 I know for sure this isn\u2019t his actual position.\u201d Ukraine claims its air defences during the night shot down all 20 Shahed drones and two Kalibr missiles launched by Russia. At least four people in Kyiv were injured by falling debris, and Ukraine\u2019s governor of Donetsk reported eight civilian injuries in the last 24 hours. A Russian general said he had been fired as a commander after telling the military leadership \u201cthe truth\u201d about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine, as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of Wagner\u2019s short-lived mutiny. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms Army, which is fighting on the front in Ukraine near Zaporizhzhia, said in a voice message that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has welcomed a \u201cgood result\u201d from the Nato summit. His remark came after Britain\u2019s defence secretary and the US national security adviser suggested Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west, in response to Zelenskiy\u2019s complaints that his country has not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. In regular remarks made on Thursday night, Zelenskiy struck a positive note: \u201cFor the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.\u201d A senior Russian official has described Sergei Surovikin, the general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine and hasn\u2019t been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, as \u201cresting\u201d and \u201cnot available\u201d. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard any new proposals on the Black Sea grain export deal, which is due to expire on Monday. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, reported sustained instances of cross-border shelling from Ukraine, but stated that no injuries were incurred, and there was only minor damage. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has suggested that Russian forces have been using improvised car bombs in Donetsk region, possibly instigated due to the experience of the Chechen forces deployed there. Reuters reports that the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on Thursday urged Vladimir Putin to prolong a deal allowing the Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain, saying the consequence of not doing so would be global food insecurity. The ball was now in Russia\u2019s court with the whole world watching, Von der Leyen told a press conference. Ukraine\u2019s top security official has dismissed criticism of Kyiv from the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, suggesting Wallace misspoke due to a surfeit of emotion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to what he said,\u201d Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s security council, told the Guardian in Kyiv on Thursday. \u201cEveryone can say something when they are emotional and then regret it \u2026 I know for sure this isn\u2019t his actual position.\u201d Wallace criticised Ukraine on Wednesday for treating western allies \u201clike Amazon\u201d, providing lists of weapons it required and for not being thankful enough for western military aid. \u201cWhether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,\u201d said Wallace. The remarks caused surprise and confusion in Kyiv, as they appeared to jar with most British government statements offering unequivocal support for Ukraine, and Wallace had widely been seen as one of Kyiv\u2019s biggest champions among western politicians. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that supplies of new weapons to Ukraine would change nothing on the battlefield but would only further escalate the conflict there, Reuters reports. Putin, speaking on state television, said tanks provided by western powers to Ukraine would be a \u201cpriority target\u201d for Russian forces fighting there. He reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining Nato, saying this would threaten Russia\u2019s security. Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia could withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal until other sides fulfil their promises, Reuters reports. The deal, which allows for the safe export of Ukrainian grain and fertiliser from Black Sea ports, is due to expire on Monday. Moscow has repeatedly threatened to block its extension over aspects of its implementation affecting Russian exports. Putin, speaking on state television, said Russia was in contact with the UN on the matter but said he had not seen a message addressed to him from the UN secretary general suggesting a compromise to salvage the deal. A man in his 40s has been killed by shelling in Orikhiv in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, governor Yuriy Malashko has said. A 60-year-old resident of the village of Popivka in the northern region of Sumy has also been killed by Russian shelling, the prosecutor general\u2019s office said. Earlier on Thursday, an 85-year-old woman was killed after Russian shelling in the village of Mykilske in Kherson, the region\u2019s governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Telegram. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Twitter that the country would receive \u20ac1.5bn in military aid from packages pledged by western allies. He says they will receive long-range Scalp missiles, Leopard tanks, additional Patriots and F-16 pilot training. Danielle Gershkovich, the sister of Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, who is currently being detained in a Moscow jail, is due to speak in Washington DC shortly. We will bring you the top lines. Biden says there is \u201cno real prospect of Putin using nuclear weapons\u201d when asked about whether the Russian president could escalate actions in Ukraine after the disarray caused by the failed Wagner mutiny. Biden says he is \u201cserious about prisoner exchange\u201d when asked about Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in a Moscow prison for over 100 days. Biden says: \u201cI\u2019m serious about doing all we can to free Americans being illegally held in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. That process is under way.\u201d Biden is asked what actions he will take to assure Finland that the US will remain a reliable Nato partner for decades to come considering a bipartisan group of senators in Washington attempted to pass a law that would prevent future US presidents from withdrawing from Nato without the Senate\u2019s approval. Biden says: \u201cThere is no question there\u2019s overwhelming support from the American people. There\u2019s overwhelming support from the members of Congress, the House and the Senate. In both parties, notwithstanding the fact of some extreme elements of one party, we will stand together.\u201d Biden says: \u201cWe will defend every inch of Nato territory, including Finland.\u201d This is Biden\u2019s first visit to Finland since it became a Nato member. The US president, Joe Biden, is holding a press conference with Finnish president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 in Helsinki following the US-Nordic leaders\u2019 summit. You can watch live at the top of the page. The White House has released a statement after a meeting between the US president, Joe Biden, and Nordic leaders which said they \u201cwelcomed\u201d Turkey\u2019s stated intention to ratify Sweden\u2019s ascension into Nato. Biden travelled to Helsinki after the Nato summit ended to meet Nordic leaders, including the prime ministers of Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden and Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6. Reuters reports that the European Commission is helping the UN and Turkey in their efforts to extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain and is open to \u201cexplore all solutions that contribute\u201d to ensuring that continues, an EU spokesperson in Brussels said. Luke Harding has been in Dnipro for the Guardian, speaking to two volunteers fighting for Ukraine: Standing on a steep grassy hill, a figure in uniform took aim with a rifle. Several shots pinged into a pile of tyres. Nearby, policemen took turns firing from a DShK heavy machine gun, mounted on a green-painted military vehicle. The rounds echoed around a rustic shooting range, scattering swallows. Down a track was a farmstead with cows. The sniper was not a Ukrainian soldier but a 58-year-old British former marine called Alan, from Plymouth in south-west England. He is one of a small group of foreign volunteers currently fighting in Ukraine, more than 16 months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Alan declined to give his second name. He arrived last September. Soon he will go back to the frontline. \u201cYou have to keep practising,\u201d he said, gesturing at a row of targets, all of which he hit. \u201cThe Russians are not on the whole very good soldiers but they are not stupid. It would be foolhardy to assume there are no decent units or motivated troops. They are potent, very dangerous, and good at artillery and electronic warfare.\u201d Read more here: \u2018It was like in world war one\u2019: the foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine Here are some more images today from Kyiv after a building was damaged by drone debris overnight. Elina Svitolina, the Ukrainian tennis player who could become the first wild card to make it into the final of the ladies\u2019 singles competition at Wimbledon, is playing now. Wild cards are players whose world ranking is not high enough to qualify automatically for the competition but who are accepted into it at the discretion of Wimbledon\u2019s committee. On Tuesday, Svitolina pulled off one of the performances of her career in defeating the top seed, Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2 to return to the Wimbledon semi-finals, which she last reached in 2019 when she lost to Simona Halep. Afterwards, she spoke about her hope of bringing \u201ca little happiness\u201d to the people of Ukraine. \u201cI know that lots of people back in Ukraine are watching,\u201d she said. \u201cIt definitely means a lot.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Alexandra Topping has more on Svitolina below: Russia\u2019s nuclear chief on Thursday pushed back against Ukrainian assertions that Moscow had plotted to blow up a nuclear power station it controls, saying no evidence supported the claim and that only \u201ca complete idiot\u201d would do such a reckless thing, Reuters reports. Kyiv has repeatedly said that Russian forces planned to blow up the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russian forces had mined the roof of several reactors at the plant, Europe\u2019s largest, which they seized shortly after launching their full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday it had not seen any mines or explosives during an inspection of the plant, though it said it was waiting for access to the rooftops of reactors No 3 and No 4. \u201cThose who wanted to arrange some sort of provocation there have been exposed,\u201d Alexei Likhachev, the general director of Russia\u2019s state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, told state television, citing the IAEA observations. He said the Ukrainian claims about Russia\u2019s supposed intentions at the plant were part of an information war against Moscow. \u201cYou would have to be a complete idiot to blow up a nuclear power station where three and a half thousand people work, including a very significant number of people from all over Russia,\u201d Likhachev said. Likhachev said Russian intelligence and information from captured Ukrainian prisoners indicated that Ukraine had in fact had plans to strike the nuclear power station while repeatedly blaming Russia for the attack. Reuters was unable to verify the claims of either side. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of threatening the safety of the plant. The IAEA has repeatedly said the plant should not be used for storage or as a base for heavy weaponry. It has also said the plant has enough water \u2013 used to cool down reactors and spent nuclear fuel \u2013 for some months despite the destruction of the nearby Nova Kakhovka dam. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, told CNN on Thursday he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Ukraine would become part of Nato after Russia\u2019s war against the country ends. Speaking to CNN host Wolf Blitzer, Austin said \u201cI have no doubt that will happen, and we heard just about every country in the room say as much,\u201d When asked how close Ukraine was to meeting Nato standards, Austin said there was still work to be done. He added that others things like \u201cjudicial reform\u201d should happen in Ukraine to \u201cmake sure that the democracy is in good shape\u201d. The Ukrainian parliament has passed the first reading of bill that would legalise medical cannabis, with the draft law saying one of its uses could be to treat war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, the Kyiv Independent reports. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke in support of the draft law last month when speaking to parliament. The draft law also proposes to license the economic activity of cultivating hemp for medical, industrial, and scientific purposes. It also aims to help people with cancer and other serious illnesses. The bill was supported by 268 out of 405 deputies. An 85-year-old woman has been killed after Russian shelling in the village of Mykilske in Kherson, the region\u2019s governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Telegram on Thursday. Prokudin said: \u201cThe Russian army killed an 85-year-old resident of the village of Mykilske. At around 12pm [9am GMT], the occupiers launched an artillery attack on the settlement. One of the shells hit the yard of an elderly woman.\u201d Reuters reports that the state-owned Ukrainian Railways has set up a new freight operator to operate in Europe to improve trade and logistical connections, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Thursday. Kubrakov said the new operator, \u201cUkrainian Railways Cargo Poland\u201d, would provide services for transporting freight, coordinate with European rail operators, freight owners and border crossings, and control Ukrainian rolling stock abroad. \u201cToday, the European direction of rail transportation for Ukraine is a matter of fast logistics and support for the Ukrainian economy,\u201d Kubrakov said on Facebook. \u201cCreation of a European operator will enable significant improvement in managing cargo transportation in the European direction. At the same time, we are modernising border infrastructure, increasing its capacity.\u201d Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, notes that the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, failed to namecheck Ben Wallace when responding to a praiseworthy statement about the UK defence secretary from a fellow MP. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has welcomed a \u201cgood result\u201d from the Nato summit. His remark came after Britain\u2019s defence secretary and the US national security adviser suggested Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west, in response to Zelenskiy\u2019s complaints that his country has not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. In regular remarks made on Thursday night, Zelenskiy struck a positive note, saying: \u201cFor the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.\u201d The US president, Joe Biden, concluded a Nato summit on Wednesday denouncing Vladimir Putin as \u201ccraven\u201d and promising Zelenskiy full support even without membership in the military alliance. Biden, who has made unifying Nato countries a foreign policy priority, said Putin had badly underestimated their resolve. Ukraine claims its air defences during the night shot down all 20 \u201cShahed\u201d drones and two Kalibr missiles launched by Russia. At least four people in Kyiv were injured by falling debris, and Ukraine\u2019s governor of Donetsk reported eight civilian injuries in the last 24 hours. A Russian general said he had been fired as a commander after telling the military leadership \u201cthe truth\u201d about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine, as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of Wagner\u2019s short-lived mutiny.

A senior Russian official has described Sergei Surovikin, the general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine and hasn\u2019t been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, as \u201cresting\u201d and \u201cnot available\u201d. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard any new proposals on the Black Sea grain export deal, which is due to expire on Monday. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, reported sustained instances of cross-border shelling from Ukraine, but stated that no injuries were incurred, and there was only minor damage. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has suggested that Russian forces have been using improvised car bombs in Donetsk region, possibly instigated due to the experience of the Chechen forces deployed there. Rishi Sunak\u2019s statement in the Commons had a lengthy section detailing what he claimed were several \u201cfirsts\u201d by the UK \u2013 notable for coming a day after his defence secretary, Ben Wallace, suggested that Ukraine could have showed more gratitude, in comments which have created a diplomatic ripple. He said: There is no better example of our ability to bring all these elements together and lead on the world stage than our response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Our diplomats have led the unprecedented effort to coordinate sanctions against Russia\u2019s economy. Last month we hosted the Ukraine recovery conference, raising over $16bn to help rebuild Ukraine\u2019s economy and bringing in the private sector to help unlock their economic potential. And as the house knows, we have backed Ukraine\u2019s fight for their freedom and sovereignty since the start. As the first country in the world to train Ukrainian troops. First in Europe to provide lethal weapons. First to commit tanks. First to provide long range missiles. And now we\u2019re at the forefront of a coalition to equip the Ukrainian air force, with Ukrainian pilots starting their training here in just a few weeks time. We do all of this because it\u2019s right. Because it protects our values and our interests. Because it keeps our people and our allies safe. And because quite simply, it is who we are as a country. We were there at the start of the Nato alliance. And this week, we\u2019ve shown once again that we remain at its heart, leading it into the future. Replying to the statement, the leader of the opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer, said that even if there was a change of government in the UK \u2013 an election is expected next year \u2013 nothing would change the country\u2019s resolve to support Ukraine. Sunak has praised the resilience of the Ukrainian people, and also stated that the British people should be proud that the UK is at the heart of Nato. With the additional of a couple of more detailed paragraphs for the domestic audience and his own party\u2019s MPs in parliament, the speech is fundamentally the same as this statement from yesterday. Rishi Sunak is making an almost indentical statement to the one that he gave in Vilnius yesterday. He has praised Nato as the most successful alliance in history, and said it is more united than ever before. The UK prime minister Rishi Sunak is about to make a post-Nato summit statement in the House of Commons in London. You should be able to watch it live in the blog. You may have to refresh the page for the play button to appear. We will bring you the key lines that emerge. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has used his Telegram channel to report sustained instances of cross-border shelling from Ukraine, but states that no injuries were incurred, and there was only minor damage. The claims have not been independently verified. A Russian general said he had been fired as a commander after telling the military leadership \u201cthe truth\u201d about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine, as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of Wagner\u2019s short-lived mutiny. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms Army which is fighting on the front in Ukraine near Zaporizhzhia, said in a voice message that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield, including the lack of counter-battery fire as well as deaths and injuries the army is suffering from Ukrainian attacks. Popov\u2019s emotional address was published late Wednesday by Andrei Gurulyov, a retired Russian colonel general and Duma deputy. Without naming them, Popov appeared to attack army head Valery Gerasimov and defence minister Sergei Shoigu, two of the country\u2019s most powerful military men, accusing them of stabbing the country in the back. The open criticism of the military leadership by a senior Russian commander is rare and will dent the sense of unity that the Kremlin has been eager to project following Yevgeney Prigozhin\u2019s aboard rebellion. Deborah Haynes, the Sky News security and defence editor, offers this analysis this morning on the diplomatic impact of the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace\u2019s words yesterday about whether Ukraine had shown enough gratitude for being armed. She writes: Wallace was not being critical about a lack of gratitude specifically to the UK for its support. Instead, he had been attempting to make a wider point about the wisdom of persuasion when dealing with certain politicians in Washington and other Nato capitals who would rather spend taxpayers\u2019 money on domestic issues than a war in a distant part of Europe. Countries that do not feel in existential peril cannot be guaranteed to maintain their support for Ukraine for as long as the war rages on. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Kyiv, showing the impact of drone debris on a high-rise building. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has reported that the person killed earlier in Kyiv died as a result of a domestic fire, and not as a result of action by the Russian Federation. Mayor Vitali Klitschko had earlier said the body of one resident was recovered when emergency services put out a fire in the capital\u2019s historic Podil district, and it had been assumed that the fire had been started by falling drone debris, but according to the state emergency services this is not the case. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has this morning published its latest intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation on the ground in Ukraine, and it suggests that Russian forces have been using improvised car bombs in Donetsk region, possibly instigated due to the experience of the Chechen forces deployed there. It writes: In June 2023, there have been several reports of Russian forces using antiquated armoured vehicles packed with several tonnes of explosives as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The crew likely bail out of the vehicle after setting it on its course. Most Russian VBIED cases have been reported around Marinka, near Donetsk city, and started days after Chechen units reinforced the area: there is a realistic possibility that Chechen forces are pioneering the tactic. There is a heritage of Chechen fighters being skilled in IED use, dating back to the Chechen Wars from the 1990s. Chechens fighting for Ukraine were also reported to have made similar VBIEDs in January 2023. Most of Russia\u2019s VBIEDs have almost certainly detonated before they reached their target through a combination of anti-tank mines and direct fire, bringing into question the viability of the capability. However, these VBIEDs cause extremely large explosions, which are still likely to have a psychological effect on defending forces. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters has a quick snap that on Thursday the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard any new proposals on the Black Sea grain export deal, which is due to expire on Monday. Russia has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the deal, citing western sanctions limiting its own agricultural exports. The country also claims to have recorded record grain exports over the last year. The overnight news summary from Suspilne has just been published on its Telegram channel. It reports: Air defence during the night shot down all 20 \u201cShahed\u201d drones and two Kalibr missiles. The consequences of the launch of the Iskander-M ballistic missile are being clarified. In Kyiv, debris from downed drones damaged houses \u2013 four people were injured. At night, the Russian army attacked Antonivka and Kherson. Over the past day, three people were killed and two were injured in the Kherson region. Eight people were injured in Donetsk region, one in Kharkiv region. The number of people injured due to the fall of an explosive object in Zaporizhzhia on 12 July increased to 21 people, including eight children. The claims have not been independently verified. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Donetsk, has posted an operational update listing a number of settlements that suffered bombardment and \u201cmassive artillery shelling\u201d damaging houses and residential buildings. He stated that \u201cIn total, the Russians wounded 8 residents of Donetsk region in one day.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk is one of the partially occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has an update on the damage in Kyiv after yet another night where Russia has struck at Ukraine\u2019s capital \u2013 the third night in a row. It reports: In the Darnytskyi district of Kyiv, during a night attack, a fragment of a downed drone hit the 25th floor of a building, destroying one of the apartments. The man whose apartment was hit was at home \u2013 he was wounded by shrapnel, he was given help, now he is in a stable condition, reports our correspondent, who managed to talk to him. According to the police officer on the spot, a girl in a neighbouring house was also injured and was hospitalised. The claims have not been independently verified. If the Nato summit was marked by what could be considered some frustrated and undiplomatic words by Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday, then the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, also appeared to make some candid and forthright assertions \u2013 that Ukrainians could show a bit more gratitude and that the west was not an \u201cAmazon\u201d for weapon supplies. As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reported yesterday: Wallace said that \u201cwhether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude\u201d, when asked about Zelenskiy\u2019s frustration at not being presented with a formal invitation to join Nato, and he advised Ukraine that it might help if it took a different approach. Wallace said it was not the first time he had spoken to Kyiv about this. \u201cI told them that last year, when I drove 11 hours to be given a list, that I\u2019m not like Amazon,\u201d he said, and he observed that Ukraine had a habit of, once it had obtained one type of weapon, immediately starting to lobby for another. You could have anticipated some response to this in Kyiv and beyond in Ukraine, and this morning the Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko is one who has struck a conciliatory tone on the remarks on social media. He posted: I want to say that we are really grateful to Ben Wallace for everything he has done for Ukraine. The United Kingdom has always supported us, they are one of our most important allies. They helped us with weapons (a lot of weapons) and provided humanitarian aid. Unfortunately, such words were said yesterday. But Ben Wallace did a lot for our country. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Ukrainian authorities have released more details about the overnight attack by Russia, saying defence forces downed 20 Russian attack drones and two cruise missiles in the attack that killed one and wounded at least four in Ukraine\u2019s capital. \u201cWe have a successful air defense operation,\u201d the air force spokesperson Yuriy Ignat told national television. \u201cTwenty Shaheds were destroyed \u2013 all those flying were downed.\u201d The 20 Iran-made Shahed attack drones were destroyed \u201cmainly in the Kyiv region\u201d, Ukraine\u2019s air force said in a separate statement on Telegram. The drones had \u201centered the capital from different directions\u201d, Kyiv\u2019s military administration said on Telegram earlier, adding air defences had destroyed \u201cabout a dozen\u201d in the city\u2019s airspace. The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has proposed to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that he extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine in return for connecting a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s agricultural bank to the Swift international payment system, sources have told Reuters. Russia has threatened to ditch the grain deal, which expires on Monday, because several demands to dispatch its own grain and fertiliser abroad have not been met. The last two ships traveling under the Black Sea agreement are currently loading cargoes at the Ukrainian port of Odesa ahead of the deadline. A key demand by Moscow is the reconnection of the Russian agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank to the Swift international payment network. It was cut off by the European Union in June 2022 over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. An EU spokesperson said in May the EU was not considering reinstating Russian banks. However, the EU is considering connecting to Swift a subsidiary of Rosselkhozbank to allow specifically for grain and fertiliser transactions, three sources familiar with discussions told Reuters on Wednesday. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was, by the standards of international summits, an undiplomatic intervention. A clearly frustrated Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted that Nato allies were showing Ukraine disrespect, that they were discussing his country\u2019s hopes of joining the military alliance without him. \u201cIt seems there is no readiness neither to invite Ukraine to Nato nor to make it a member of the alliance,\u201d he wrote. The outburst was certainly last minute, coming less than an hour before Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and Nato other\u2019s 29 leaders were due to sign off a final summit declaration on the topic. It turned out to be a communique that did not spell out a timeline by which Ukraine could join, nor a list of conditions it would have to meet, nor even extend an invitation to join at an unspecified future date once the war with Russia is over. In truth, the public lobbying was always going to be far too late: A senior Russian official has described Sergei Surovikin, the general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine and hasn\u2019t been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, as \u201cresting\u201d and \u201cnot available\u201d. Asked by Russian media outlet Shot if he had communicated with Surovikin, Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who heads the defence affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, said, \u201cNo. He is resting now. Not available.\u201d Surovikin reportedly has close ties to Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. Last month, US intelligence reportedly claimed that Surovikin had prior knowledge of the armed uprising led by Prigozhin, during which Wagner mercenaries captured the city of Rostov and moved on Moscow before cutting an amnesty deal. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has welcomed a \u201cgood result\u201d from the Nato summit. His remark came after Britain\u2019s defence secretary and the US national security adviser suggested Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west, in response to Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s complaints that his country has not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. In regular remarks made on Thursday night, Zelenskiy struck a positive note, saying, \u201cfor the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.\u201d \u201cVery importantly, during these two days of the Summit, we have put to rest any doubts and ambiguities about whether Ukraine will be in Nato. It will!\u201d He added that he was \u201cgrateful to all those who have worked for unity in Vilnius\u201d. A Russian drone strike on Kyiv killed one person and wounded at least four others, authorities said on Thursday, with AFP reporting that explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital in the third night of attacks. \u201cTonight, a massive attack by Iranian drones took place,\u201d Kyiv\u2019s military administration said on Telegram. Iran-made Shahed explosive drones had \u201centered the capital from different directions,\u201d it said, adding \u201cabout a dozen\u201d had been downed in the city\u2019s airspace. Falling debris was reported in five districts, it said, adding that a 19-year-old woman and 23-year-old man had been hospitalised with shrapnel wounds. Two people were wounded in Darnytsky district \u201cas a result of falling debris,\u201d Sergiy Popko, head of Kyiv\u2019s military administration, wrote on Telegram. Mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on Telegram, said the body of one resident was recovered when emergency services put out a fire in the capital\u2019s historic Podil district. State emergency services later clarified that this was due to a domestic fire, and not the actions of the Russian Federation. This block and the live blog headline were edited to clarify that Ukraine\u2019s state emergency services later stated the death in Kyiv had been caused by a domestic fire, and not as a result of enemy action. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: a Russian drone strike on Kyiv killed one person and wounded at least four others, authorities said on Thursday, with explosions heard across the Ukrainian capital in the third night of attacks. The attack came hours after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed renewed commitments from Nato and G7 leaders, saying, \u201cWe are returning home with a good result for our country\u201d and that, \u201cfor the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.\u201d Other recent developments include: The US president, Joe Biden, concluded a Nato summit on Wednesday denouncing Russian president Vladimir Putin as \u201ccraven\u201d and promising Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy full support even without membership in the military alliance. Biden, who has made unifying Nato countries a foreign policy priority, said Putin had badly underestimated their resolve. Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary said \u201cpeople want to see a bit of gratitude\u201d and Ukraine needed to put more emphasis on saying thank you for western help when he was asked about president Zelenskiy\u2019s complaints on Tuesday that the country had not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. Wallace said Ukrainians\u2019 haste to get all the help they could meant they did not always say they were grateful for the help received. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, distanced himself from Wallace\u2019s comments, saying Zelenskiy has expressed gratitude for UK support. He highlighted that president Zelenskiy had expressed gratitude on multiple occasions, including his address to parliament earlier this year. \u201cI know he and his people are grateful to the UK,\u201d said Sunak. Zelenskiy said he \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d Wallace\u2019s comments. He also said \u201cwe could express our words of gratitude personally to the minister\u201d. The G7 signed a declaration outlining support for Ukraine and help towards governance reforms needed for \u201cEuro-Atlantic aspirations\u201d. The member nations said they would provide security and economic support, including modern military equipment, across land, air, and sea, intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces in exchange for Ukraine committing to reforms \u201cto underscore its commitments to democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and media freedoms\u201d, \u201cput its economy on a sustainable path\u201d and strengthen \u201cdemocratic civilian control of the military\u201d. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said Sweden\u2019s Nato accession will not be put to Turkish parliament until autumn when it reopens. Speaking at a news conference after the Nato summit in Vilnius, Erdogan said that Sweden would provide a roadmap for Turkey regarding the steps to take against purported terrorism before the ratification. UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has proposed to Russian president Vladimir Putin that he extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine in return for connecting a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s agricultural bank to the SWIFT international payment system, sources told Reuters. The last two ships traveling under the Black Sea agreement are currently loading cargoes at the Ukrainian port of Odesa ahead of the deadline. An 81-year-old man was killed after shelling in Kherson.

As she and her husband, Karim, watched the episode of Netflix\u2019s Break Point that chronicled her run, they both cried. The wounds were still fresh, the pain still with her; she would have to return this year to win it all. True to her word, Jabeur has found her way back to the Wimbledon final with an immense showing of grit and self-belief. After trailing the best player in the world this year by a set and 2-4, the Tunisian again dug into the depths of her spirit and found the strength to recover. Jabeur, the sixth seed, returned to the final with an incredible 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-3 win over the world No 2, Aryna Sabalenka. A year after becoming the first Arab player and the first African woman in the open era to reach a grand slam singles final, at Wimbledon, she will again play for her first major title as she faces Marketa Vondrousova in Saturday\u2019s final. After also reaching last year\u2019s US Open final, it will be the 28-year-old\u2019s third grand slam final in the last five events. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of myself because maybe old me would have lost the match and went back home already. I\u2019m glad that I kept digging very deep and finding the strength,\u201d said Jabeur. Sabalenka, meanwhile, had arrived on Centre Court a win away from usurping Iga Swiatek to become the new world No 1. Instead she suffered a second grand slam semi-final collapse in two months after her brutal loss to Karolina Muchova at the French Open. \u201cI\u2019ll just keep working, keep pushing myself. Hopefully next time mentally I\u2019ll be tougher in the semi-finals,\u201d said Sabalenka. While last year\u2019s Wimbledon had presented a great opportunity for Jabeur, with her defeating no top 30 opponents en route to the final, she returned to the All England Club having been handed perhaps the toughest draw possible with three title fancies in her way. After edging past Bianca Andreescu in three sets, Jabeur demolished an in-form Petra Kvitova, the two-time Wimbledon champion, in round four. Against Elena Rybakina, a quarter-final rematch of last year\u2019s final, she played perhaps the best match of her life. Her reward for such a tough run was a fourth grand slam champion and the toughest of them all. Still, Jabeur picked up where she left off, striking the ball smoothly while taking every opportunity to attack one of the biggest hitters in the world. She made Sabalenka so uncomfortable throughout the first set, steering her around the court with her forehand while constantly forcing the tall Belarusian to bend low and move forward in order to cope with her excellent slice. Each time Sabalenka was under pressure in the first set, she responded. She found enormous serves at key moments, and hit herself out of trouble. After taking the tie\u2011break from 2-4 down, Sabalenka held a 4-2 lead in the second set. As she tried to retrieve the break, Jabeur\u2019s desperation became increasingly clear. She continued to impose herself with her forehand, she found a groove on her return of serve and, under pressure, Sabalenka errors began to flow. From 2-4 down, Jabeur breezed through the final four games to force a third set. \u201cIt was very difficult for me to return her serve,\u201d said Jabeur. \u201cEspecially if she was mixing a lot. Even the speed was difficult. I was like: \u2018Honestly, I\u2019m not going to give a shit, I\u2019m just going to go in and hit my return.\u2019\u201d The momentum carried into the final set, with Jabeur serving brilliantly and playing clear-minded attacking tennis as she held comfortably before taking the decisive break after a long, tense game at 3-2. With the finish line suddenly in sight, Jabeur served out the match to clinch the biggest win of her career. After starting the year with hopes of consolidating a breakout 2022 season in which she reached No 2, this had been a tough season for Jabeur with numerous injuries, including knee surgery, halting her progress. But still, even though she has been unable to perform at her top level at times, this season has followed the story of her career: her success has been a product of gradual, consistent growth for more than a decade. \u201cMaybe the injuries did slow me down and teach me to be patient and accept what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. Despite her two grand slam finals in the past 53 weeks, Jabeur has never played as well as she has over the past 11 days. The mental strength and fighting spirit she has shown in these intense, suffocating tussles against the best players in the world seems even greater than last year and those qualities have taken her transcendent talents to new levels. She will be the favourite to win her first grand slam title. \u201cI want to make my path worth it, winning [against] all these grand slam champions to be in the final,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going full in, and hopefully this time it will work.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b6f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/13/tennis-wimbledon-semi-final-carlos-alcaraz-daniil-medvedev-novak-djokovic-jannik-sinner", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Alcaraz and Medvedev come full circle but Djokovic still looks immovable", "lead": "The Young Spaniard and the Russian will renew their rivalry knowing that the defending champion should be waiting for them in the Wimbledon final", "author": "Tumaini Carayol", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098847", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b5a0e18a4414aad61da34fbaa6dad2263ce28836/0_0_2978_1786/500.jpg", "body": "It has been two years since Carlos Alcaraz took his first timid steps on the lawns of the All England Club as a professional. He was 18 then and, although he was not quite able to enter the tournament directly with his ranking, the promise he had demonstrated in his first trips to the Australian and French Opens had yielded a wildcard into the Wimbledon main draw. In his first professional match on grass he barely survived a lucky loser, Yasutaka Uchiyama. Two days later Alcaraz faced Daniil Medvedev. \u201cHe was much less mature and younger, which is normal,\u201d the Russian said on Wednesday. \u201cHe was missing. Everyone saw that he\u2019s amazing, but everyone was wondering is he going to find the way to miss less [while] producing the same power. And he did quite fast. That\u2019s what\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d Their contest ended in an easy 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 win for the Russian. Friday\u2019s semi-finals will mark a full-circle moment. Having flitted up the rankings, establishing himself as a grand slam champion and the current world No 1, Alcaraz will compete for his first Wimbledon final against Medvedev, the third seed. The self-belief that drives Alcaraz on and off the court since his emergence has been clear. He has achieved so much success so quickly, breaking age records and leaving his rivals in the dust, and his goals have subsequently changed. He once aimed to win grand slam titles and reach world No 1; now he aims to become one of the greatest in the history of his sport. Still, this run and its swiftness, from winning Queen\u2019s to breezing through five matches in a row at Wimbledon, has surprised even the 20-year-old. The speed of his adaptation further underlines his ability and his possession of a game so varied that it can adapt to all surfaces. He has shown that the hype that follows him, deafening as it is, does so for very good reason. The pair have played only once since that initial meeting, this year in the final of Indian Wells. That match featured one of Alcaraz\u2019s most remarkable performances so far as he dismantled his opponent, who was bursting with confidence on a 19-match winning streak, 6-3 6-2. Medvedev insists the grass will provide a completely different match-up. \u201cI think Indian Wells is not going to count a lot here,\u201d said Medvedev. \u201cSo slow, Indian Wells. I mean, it\u2019s not going to be the same. Wimbledon, the ball bounces lower. The serve is more important. There, I felt like I couldn\u2019t get free points with the serve.\u201d The surface will certainly allow Medvedev to extract more out of his serve, and he has served exceptionally well during periods this week. His own improvement on grass, as on clay, has been deeply impressive. But in Indian Wells Alcaraz picked apart Medvedev\u2019s typical deep-return stance and court positioning with a frenzy of serve and volley attempts, net rushes, drop shots and relentless aggression. Such an approach is only more lethal on grass. The pair will do battle knowing that they could potentially be playing for a spot against Novak Djokovic, the second seed. After 11 days of tennis, nothing has changed. The defending champion and seven-time winner remains the heavy favourite even among the most difficult group of challengers he could face in the later rounds. Despite his lack of experience on grass, Jannik Sinner \u2013 who will face Djokovic in the semi-finals \u2013 has grown on the surface, reaching the quarter-finals for the first time last year. His destructive, clean and beautifully timed ground strokes, his relentless aggression and love of pace are naturally rewarded on grass. In that quarter-final last year Sinner played some of the best tennis of his life to lead by two sets, only for Djokovic to flip the match around and win in five. The Italian has the weapons to hit through Djokovic and make him uncomfortable, but the ease of the 36-year-old\u2019s recovery was in some ways even more dispiriting than a straight-sets defeat. Despite finally reaching a long-awaited first grand slam semi-final this week, Sinner has done so with a startlingly easy draw. He has not faced a top 50 player yet; his highest-ranked opponent was the No 79, Quentin Halys, in the third round, who snatched a set from him. Now the 21-year-old must step up against the best player in the world on a court he has not lost on for a decade."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b70", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/13/chris-froome-tour-de-france-cycling-sylvan-adams", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chris Froome not \u2018value for money\u2019, claims Israel-Premier Tech team owner", "lead": "Sylvan Adams, the Israel-Premier Tech team owner, said Chris Froome had \u2018absolutely not\u2019 been value for money since signing in late 2020", "author": "Jeremy Whittle in Belleville-en-Beaujolais", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098865", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0465105ec449d2aafed7939c62f481909be35bb6/0_0_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "Chris Froome\u2019s relationship with his current sponsor, the Israel-Premier Tech team, appears to be deteriorating, after the team owner, Sylvan Adams, said the four-time Tour de France winner had \u201cabsolutely not\u201d been value for money since signing in late 2020. \u201cHow could we say we had value for money?\u201d Adams told cyclingweekly.com. \u201cWe signed Chris to be the leader of our Tour de France team and he\u2019s not even here, so that cannot be considered value for money \u2026 Chris isn\u2019t a symbol.

One night, when she was seven years old, the phone rang at Irene Guerrero\u2019s house. It was 11.30pm, there was school the next morning and she was ready for bed but her dad was on the line. Out with friends in Seville\u2019s Los Carteros neighbourhood, Jes\u00fas had come across someone he wanted her to meet. Twenty-six years old now, the scene still makes her smile: \u201cHe said: \u2018Bichito, my little bug, come down to the bar.\u2019 It was late but my mum said: \u2018Go on, there will be a good reason,\u2019 so I changed out of my pyjamas and went.\u201d A good reason turned out to be the best. Down in the bar was Rafa Gordillo, a close friend of the owner and probably the best player Real Betis had ever had, spending 12 seasons in two spells at the club between 1976 and 1995, socks down around his ankles, but this wasn\u2019t about him; it was about her. \u201cI was a big Betis fan, like my dad, but I was only seven, he was from a different era, I didn\u2019t know him,\u201d Guerrero says. \u201cI remember he said: \u2018Good evening, I\u2019m Rafa Gordillo.\u2019 And I shook his hand and said: \u2018Good evening, I\u2019m Irene Guerrero.\u2019 And everyone started laughing. \u201cHe said: \u2018They tell me you play football, that you\u2019re really good.\u2019 Someone in the bar had been talking about Jes\u00fas\u2019s daughter, the footballer. When I was little, I would take a ball everywhere. I would go with my brother to training and games, and kick about on the pitch alongside. \u201cEveryone knew me in the neighbourhood, but I didn\u2019t have a team. There wasn\u2019t one. There weren\u2019t the opportunities for girls there are now. And that night Gordillo said: \u2018Look, I have a football school. Come along tomorrow. I\u2019d like to invite you.\u2019\u201d \u201cSeeing how excited I was, my mum had no choice but to take me. I was so nervous, I could hardly get out the car: seeing all those kids, not knowing how I would fit in, how I would play.\u201d The answer was: seriously well. Something special was starting. Guerrero recalls asking a teacher not to tell her mum she was playing football until one day that teacher instead told her this girl was so enthusiastic, so talented, that she had to play football, and down in the bar they weren\u2019t wrong. At Gordillo\u2019s football school, they saw. \u201cThe way they took me in was wonderful,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so happy. It was two lovely years. But there\u2019s a point where you can\u2019t play official games. Rafael said: \u2018We\u2019re going to have to find a girls\u2019 team so you can compete.\u2019\u201d First there was Club Deportivo H\u00edspalis, then Azahar, then Sevilla. \u201cBetis didn\u2019t have a team,\u201d Guerrero says. As soon as they set one up, she joined. As she puts it: although Sevilla meant the chance to play in the first division, how could she not? \u201cSevilla were very good about it. It was not as professionalised then, they understood and I was honest with them, grateful.\u201d She spent eight years at Betis, taking them up, two at Levante and is now at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. An international since 2019, analytical, determined, warm, two decades after that night in the bar she is Spain\u2019s World Cup captain. If Gordillo was an idol, Joaqu\u00edn was more Guerrero\u2019s generation and she talks about learning lessons from the basketball player Kobe Bryant, but the greatest inspiration was at home. Both wheelchair users, her father and her mother, Ana, handed her responsibility young, a culture and mindset too. They supported her unfailingly, attending every game, Guerrero describing a single word from them, just a look from the side of the pitch, as sufficient to lift a weight from her. \u201cWhat I am today is thanks to them,\u201d she says. \u201cSport as a way of life was a philosophy for them.\u201d Her parents swam and played basketball competitively. Jes\u00fas, who contracted polio at the age of two, was national champion in the 50m backstroke, won silver in breaststroke and bronze in freestyle, then represented Spain in basketball at the 1980 Paralympics in Arnhem, the Netherlands. In November 2019, he died aged 63 due to cancer. Guerrero was with the Spain team at Las Rozas preparing to travel to Poland when she was called to the hospital; Jes\u00fas had wanted her to stay, to chase her dream. \u201cThe way my mum and dad lived their lives every day was an example,\u201d she says. \u201cThey lived with limits but always said that the limits are the ones we impose on ourselves: they are in our minds. Our bodies break through those limits, those barriers. The way they took on life marks me. On the pitch too: if you work, if you fight daily, those values will be expressed there. We\u2019re all special, all different, all have innate qualities. \u201cLiving what I have lived doesn\u2019t make me better or worse, but it is who I am: it formed me day to day and I\u2019m so grateful to my parents. I wouldn\u2019t change the slightest thing, wouldn\u2019t swap what I lived for anything lived by anyone else.\u201d Those lessons are always there, so, too, the loss and this has not been an easy year: a new club, a new city, a new role for Atl\u00e9tico and a crisis in the national team. Last September, 15 players made themselves unavailable for selection unless changes were made, bringing a furious response from the federation, insisting they would not return unless they backed down and apologised. When the squad was named in June, only three had returned, the impact inevitable, even beyond the missing talent of the absentees. \u201cThat\u2019s football, life. Not everything happens in the perfect way; sometimes the context is different, not the way you would have wanted it, but it\u2019s all something to learn from,\u201d Guerrero says. \u201cAt Atl\u00e9tico, the target was a Champions League place and we didn\u2019t manage that. We went through different phases, but we came together and were eventually able to give the fans the Copa de la Reina.\u201d And how. With two minutes remaining in the final, Atl\u00e9tico were 2-0 down to Real Madrid, but goals in the 88th minute and five minutes into added time took them to extra time after which they won on penalties. Guerrero scored their third spot kick to put them on the verge of victory, the way it played out saying something about her. \u201cI still can\u2019t describe it,\u201d she says. \u201cAt 0-2 it feels like it\u2019s done but that refusal to give in comes out, that faith. And when we got to the shootout we believed. In those difficult moments, I try to clear my mind. There\u2019s a word I say to myself: Mamba.\u201d \u201cI was reading about Kobe Bryant,\u201d she explains. \u201cAbout how he would tell himself: \u2018This is it. Cut off everything that happened until now. It\u2019s this moment, nothing else. Focus. You don\u2019t need to do anything other than what you have been practising for months. Don\u2019t let luck in. You decide. You have that power. You get into your mind: I\u2019ve done this. Every day, every session.\u2019 \u201cFor me, the mental side of the game is vital, on and off the pitch. You have to find that balance. If the mind isn\u2019t right the rest won\u2019t follow. Some manage that internally, some externalise it more. In my case, I seek refuge at home, in my partner who is always there, always on the phone whatever time it is, if I need a word of support or something to make me see things differently. \u201cI like to think that, ultimately, changes are positive; they help you to grow, take you out of your comfort zone. At the end of the season you think: was this your best you? What\u2019s the next target, the next challenge?\u201d For Spain, it is the greatest of all. Asked about the impact upon the group, how the walkout affects everything, she says: \u201cYou can imagine. It\u2019s not easy at all but we have to live with that; the key is not to take it as something personal. Knowing how to separate the sporting side from the life off the pitch. Being able to perform, to go to our workplace and not have that on your mind. Be clear what your objectives are, the goals we have set. We have something there which unites us all: the World Cup, Spain. \u201cWe have a thorn in our side after what happened with England [in the quarter-final] at the Euros last year but we have taken lessons from that and have been working hard all year. I like to think that the only limits are the ones we put in place ourselves. We know we have to go step by step, without getting ahead of ourselves. We want to be in that final. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true to be going to the World Cup: not just for me, but for my family and above all my dad, with whom all this started. He\u2019s the reason I get up every morning and play football, chase my dreams. Because I know that everything I do, everything I achieve, every moment, reaches him somehow. And that\u2019s my way of having him close to me every day.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b72", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/13/who-has-been-offered-what-public-sector-pay-deal", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who has been offered what?

Before the announcement, ministers had stressed the need for \u201cdiscipline\u201d at a time of rising inflation. Rishi Sunak said pay increases could not \u201cfuel the fire\u201d of inflation running at 8.7%. While some of the offers are generous enough to be accepted by union leaders, the government will hope that the impact on future inflation will be limited as additional borrowing has been avoided and no more money is being pumped into the economy. Teachers A 6.5% pay rise is being offered to teachers in England in what appears to be a package that also avoids problems regarding how increases would be funded. The general secretaries of four education unions have said they will recommend that their members accept the offer and call off industrial action. Although unions have been insisting that pay increases come with extra resources from the government rather than being met from school budgets, the government is funding almost half of the pay rise by \u201creprioritising\u201d within its budgets. Doctors and consultants Junior doctors in England are being offered a 6% increase, along with a consolidated rise of \u00a31,250, while hospital consultants are also being offered 6%. However, the offer falls well below the 35% rise that the British Medical Association \u2013 the union for doctors \u2013 says is needed to make up for years of real-terms pay cuts and the 12.4% offered to junior doctors in Scotland. What Sunak described as a \u201cfinal\u201d offer was made as junior doctors began a five-day strike in England, which is being described as the longest walkout of its kind in NHS history. While the government has said the bulk of money for pay rises will come from \u201csavings and efficiencies\u201d in existing budgets, some money will be raised by increasing the migrant health surcharge to \u00a31,035 and putting up the cost of some visas. Police Police officers, who cannot strike, are to receive a pay rise of 7% \u2013 the biggest award by sector along with that for prison officers. The increase was described by the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d. Borrowing has been ruled out to fund the recommendations of the police remuneration review body. The police pay rise is to be partly covered by increasing the cost of visas for workers, students and others by up to 20%. Prison officers Prison officers in the operational bands will receive an increase of 7%, with larger rises for support grades, and 5% for managers and governors. However, the below-inflation pay rise has been criticised by the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, which said members were suffering the effects of the cost of living crisis and would also have to wait until September to receive backdated pay due in April. Prison officers have threatened to strike at a time when the Ministry of Justice is struggling to recruit enough qualified people to fill vacancies. The government said the pay rise would come from \u201creprioritising\u201d spending within existing budgets and finding \u201cefficiencies\u201d. Armed forces Most armed forces personnel are to receive a 5% rise, along with a consolidated \u00a31,000 increase. There are 5.5% pay awards for the most senior officers. They are also unable to strike but received the lowest percentage pay rise band. The government is to fund the increase by cutting back on civil service recruitment in the Ministry of Defence (MoD) until March 2025. Ministers rejected a recommendation from the armed forces\u2019 pay review body that service family accommodation charges for those in band A should go up by 4.5% this year. Instead, these charges are to be frozen at 2022 levels. Civil servants Senior civil servants will receive an increase of 5.5% in line with the recommendation of the senior salaries review body. Amy Leversidge, an assistant general secretary at the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said the review body\u2019s recommendations had been in line with the rest of the civil service and public sector, and \u201care both fair and reasonable\u201d. But a major civil service union criticised the freezing of recruitment relating to defence. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, said the MoD had made \u201ca disastrous error that risks putting our nation\u2019s security at risk\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b73", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/13/the-guardian-view-on-public-sector-pay-higher-taxes-on-the-rich-are-needed-to-fix-broke-britannia", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on public sector pay: higher taxes on the rich are needed to fix broke Britannia | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial: </strong>Whoever wins the next election will have to spend money to repair the damage done after 13 years of Conservative party rule", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:52:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098918", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4603aabcab60e3c7f213ad03e8cb33658c3f311c/0_122_3648_2189/500.jpg", "body": "It is unlikely that champagne corks will be popping in government offices, school classrooms and NHS hospitals. But they probably are in the City. While the public sector is offered a below inflation pay hike of 6%, wage growth in finance and business services is running at 9%. The private sector can raise its prices to pay for higher salaries or just to make more money. The public sector cannot. Instead Rishi Sunak argues that the state\u2019s wage bill must be paid for by cuts to the services that workers deliver. Mr Sunak\u2019s decision means that pupils will have fewer books and patients are left sicker because teachers and doctors need extra pay. Rising interest rates mean austerity for public services and pain for mortgage-holders, but they make for good business in the Square Mile as UK gilt yields become more attractive to investors. \u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\u201d begins Charles Dickens\u2019s A Tale of Two Cities, a cautionary story about widening divisions in the run up to the French Revolution. Britain is, thankfully, in a far less feverish moment. The economist Olivier Blanchard has noted that inflation is \u201cfundamentally the outcome of the distributional conflict, between firms, workers, and taxpayers\u201d. Some unions have rightly fought and won an acceptable deal. But wider tensions are not being adequately managed to allow for broader, sensible negotiations in which the pain is shared. Instead Mr Sunak, and the Bank of England, tilt the scales in favour of private business interests and a recession by relying solely on interest rates. Ongoing strikes are a symptom of such a strategy. The government\u2019s case is that higher taxes and more borrowing would be ruinous. This idea is unfortunately reinforced by a questionable forecast made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which predicts the national debt of the UK tripling by 2070. In truth it is the government that decides how far the interest paid on its debt should be determined by demand in the money markets. Mr Sunak believes that demand should be primary and has woven a fiscal straitjacket, through the Treasury\u2019s design of the asset purchase facility and by selling inflation-linked bonds: the more the state struggles, the tighter the binding becomes. Balanced-budget ideas, depressingly, have found supremacy in British politics. Yet few things matter more than life and death. If life expectancy and \u201chealthy life expectancy\u201d \u2013 a measure of the years people live in decent health \u2013 are more important measures of how a country is doing, the OBR has some sobering news. The UK has the lowest healthy life expectancy at birth of any major developed economy bar the US, and is falling behind Italy, Japan, France and Canada in terms of life expectancy. Whoever wins the next election will have to spend money to repair the damage done by chronic state underfunding by the Conservatives on top of Brexit, the pandemic, and the Ukraine war \u2013 as well as rewire the economy to deal with an ageing population and net zero. But without careful design this spending will be inflationary: post-Covid Britain saw how quickly supply disruption translated into rising prices; how labour shortages could send wages shooting up; and how there was little restraint on companies hiking prices. Government expenditure, it seems, can only increase in a non-inflationary way if fiscal space has been created by reducing private disposable income, ideally through higher taxes on the wealthiest."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b74", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-huw-edwards-saga-no-ones-finest-hour", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on the Huw Edwards saga: no one\u2019s finest hour | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Individuals have been damaged in the handling of the BBC presenter row.

In the wider world, the past few days have in reality been dominated by terrifying global climate crisis incidents, a crunch wartime summit on Ukraine, an international row about cluster munitions, and a host of bad domestic British economic news. Yet throughout that period, most British newspapers, and almost every BBC news bulletin, have been focused on following the Sun\u2019s 8 July front page story alleging payments by a star BBC presenter to a teen for sexual photos. In an echo of the furore over the ITV presenter Phillip Schofield in May, the BBC story has all but obliterated the normal news values of many outlets. On Wednesday, the pursuit culminated with the naming, by his wife, of Huw Edwards, the BBC\u2019s senior news presenter. As a result, a lot of air has already quickly gone out of what is suddenly a much less prominent news story. Yet the serious consequences remain. Few people or institutions in this story will emerge undamaged. Mr Edwards is now in hospital with mental health problems. His national standing has taken a lasting battering. The person whose family made the allegations is said to be feeding a serious drug habit and may soon be named and in the spotlight. Both families, those of accuser and accused, have been pummelled by a whirlwind. For them, this story is far from over. On every side, lives have been upended. This has not been British journalism\u2019s finest hour. The BBC, the Sun, the press pack and social media all have questions to answer, in some cases fundamental ones. The BBC is accused of being slow to respond to the family\u2019s initial claims and to investigate their allegations, leading them to take their story to the Sun. The decision not to name Mr Edwards may have been in line with privacy law guidelines but raises questions about the exercise of the BBC\u2019s duty of care to other presenters. The concerns of more junior staff should still be investigated. Meanwhile BBC news has given immense prominence to investigating the story, feeding suspicions that the corporation may be less concerned with news values than with protecting itself against a hostile government. The Sun is now squarely in the line of fire too. Its initial claim that the presenter had paid a 17-year-old for explicit images was not well sourced. Through lawyers, the young person has dismissed the story as rubbish, and has alleged that the Sun knew of the denial before launching its 8 July splash. The police, too, have concluded that there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The paper\u2019s decision to run the story without naming the presenter triggered a torrent of uninformed speculation on social media. The Sun has said it will cooperate with the now resumed BBC investigation, but such decisions raise important standards issues for the press generally. It is a sorry tale all round, which speaks to a lack of individual and corporate self-awareness. This is not to claim that there can be no public interest in a story of this kind. Clearly there can. But the Edwards coverage proved flawed and controversial in ways that are too substantial to brush aside. British journalism should be very concerned that it does not come well out of the way the story was handled by the Sun. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The verdict, five years after the devastating mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue, now means the court will sentence Robert Bowers either to life imprisonment or death by capital punishment. Federal prosecutors argued that Bowers, who had spent months planning the attack and has since said he regretted not killing more people, met the standard that he had an intent to kill. In 2018, Bowers, who espoused antisemitic views online ahead of the shooting, sprayed bullets from an AR-15 rifle and other weapons into the synagogue just as Sabbath worship began, killing members of three congregations and marking what would become the deadliest antisemitic attack in US history. In recent years, researchers have found that antisemitic attacks have been on the rise across the United States, with such hate crimes rising in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Attorneys representing Bowers argued that prosecutors could not firmly determine he had an intent to kill because Bowers suffered from mental illness, stating that Bowers, who expressed anti-Jewish hate on social media before the attack, held a delusional belief that he could stop a genocide of white people by killing Jews who help immigrants. During the penalty phase, which began in June, mental health experts for both sides disagreed on whether Bowers suffered from schizophrenia, delusions or brain disorders that played a role in the rampage. That month, Bowers was convicted on 63 criminal counts, including hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of the free exercise of religion resulting in death. Federal prosecutors refused to accept a guilty plea Bowers\u2019 attorneys offered in exchange for a life sentence. Prosecutors must now share traumatic testimony from the families of those killed and injured by Bowers in the shooting that will influence whether the jury unanimously agrees on the death penalty. The jury will also hear evidence indicating other aggravating factors such as how religious hate influenced Bowers\u2019 actions. At the scene in 2018, Bowers told police that \u201call these Jews need to die\u201d. Bowers\u2019 defense attorneys will also share testimony from relatives and other mitigating factors that show why the jury should not sentence him to death. Jurors will have to agree unanimously that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating ones. If they do not, Bowers will receive a life sentence without parole. If the jury sides with federal prosecutors and puts Bowers on death row, he would be the first person to receive the death penalty under President Joe Biden. During his presidential campaign in 2020, Biden pledged to abolish use of the death penalty at the federal level and to work with states to end the practice. Yet his administration has taken no action to do that and instead has fought to uphold death sentences."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b76", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/florida-fines-voter-registration-groups", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Revealed: Florida Republicans target voter registration groups with thousands in fines", "lead": "Fines on list given to the Guardian were levied by agency created at Ron DeSantis\u2019s behest to investigate voter fraud, which is rare", "author": "Sam Levine and Andrew Witherspoon in New York", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:44:49", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.098975", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/897dd3ae928b974c45181a55711b0f286c95de60/0_195_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "Florida Republicans have hit dozens of voter registration groups with thousands of dollars of fines, the latest salvo in an alarming crackdown on voting in the state led by Governor Ron DeSantis. At least 26 groups have cumulatively racked up more than $100,000 in fines since September of last year, according to a list that was provided by Florida officials to the Guardian. The groups include both for-profit and nonprofit organizations as well as political parties, including the statewide Republican and Democratic parties of Florida. The fines, which range from $50 to tens of thousands of dollars, were levied by the state\u2019s office of election crimes and security, a first-of-its-kind agency created at the behest of DeSantis in 2022 to investigate voter fraud. Voter fraud is extremely rare, and the office has already come under scrutiny for bringing criminal charges against people who appeared to be confused about their voting eligibility. Election watchdogs worry the new policies could have a chilling effect on engaging voters. There has already been a drop in voter registrations this year compared with 2019 \u2013 the last full year leading into a presidential election, according to Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida. Through 1 June of this year, 2,430 new registrations had come from third-party voter registration organizations, he said. That\u2019s on pace to be a sharp decrease from the 63,212 new voter registrations third-party groups submitted by the end of 2019. A crackdown on third-party voter registration groups is also likely to disproportionately affect Floridians of color, who are about five times more likely to register with third-party groups than white voters are. \u201cThe message is clear, [third-party voter registration organizations] are an endangered species in Florida. And it affects this population disparately,\u201d said Smith, who has been retained by the plaintiffs challenging the voter registration restrictions in federal court. \u201cWhen you start to ratchet down the ability for groups and their first amendment rights to petition \u2026 government by getting people registered to vote, you are going to affect that overall population of registered voters.\u201d A \u2018gross misapplication\u2019 of the law In mid-May, the non-profit Hispanic Federation received a letter from the office of election crimes and security notifying it that it was being fined $7,500. Fifteen of the applications it collected were submitted to the wrong county \u2013 Polk county, in central Florida, when the voters lived elsewhere. Those 15 applications represented a tiny sliver of the more than 16,500 voter registration applications the group collected in 2022 but still resulted in a fine. Through a public records request, the Guardian reviewed several of the applications the Hispanic Federation submitted that were flagged for fines. In nearly all of them, the voter incorrectly wrote on their own applications that they lived in Polk county. In many cases, the address they listed was just over the county line in Osceola county. One voter lived just 300ft from the county line, which cut through his neighborhood. Another lived just 660ft from the county line. At least 10 voters lived within three miles of the county boundary, according to a Guardian analysis. The Hispanic Federation agreed to pay the fine, but wrote a letter to the state saying it \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with the penalty and called it a \u201cgross misapplication\u201d of the law. The amount of $7,500 could pay the salary of about a dozen canvassers for a week, who could probably register between 350 and 400 people, the group said. The fine essentially meant that mistakes on 15 applications would make it harder to register hundreds of new voters. \u201cDespite our good faith efforts, professionalism, and due diligence, we cannot eliminate some applications from being processed with errors as we have not been given access to an official mechanism to verify the information of each applicant \u2013 which is, in any case, not our role,\u201d the group wrote in June. \u201cThere is no claim that we intentionally misrepresented, nor is there a claim that we diverted, such registrations from the correct county or that we held on to the registrations beyond the required period in which they were to be delivered.\u201d The Florida department of state, which oversees the office of election crimes and security, did not return a request for comment. Frederick V\u00e9lez III Burgos, the Hispanic Federation\u2019s national director of civic engagement, said in an interview that until the recent change in the law, the group would not have been fined. In 2021, the GOP-controlled legislature tweaked state law to require groups to turn in voter registration forms to the county where the prospective voter lived (they previously could turn them in anywhere). The lawmakers imposed steep fines for non-compliance \u2013 $500 for each form that was turned in at the wrong place. The change came after election officials complained that voter registration groups were bombarding them with applications for people outside their counties. Though the election officials could register voters regardless of where they lived, it created extra work around elections. \u201cWhat would happen is [the groups] would kind of bomb different counties with a whole bunch of them. So the workload wasn\u2019t fairly distributed,\u201d said Lori Edwards, who serves as the supervisor of elections in Polk county. While that could cause a headache for election officials, Edwards said, \u201cit is not among the worst offenses that third-party voter registration organizations can do.\u201d Far worse, she said, is when groups wait too long to turn in voter registration applications until after the registration deadline, thus disfranchising the voters. In 2022, the state legislature raised the maximum amount a group could be fined from $1,000 to $50,000. Earlier this year, it raised the cap again, to $250,000, and shortened the amount of time groups have to turn in the forms after they are filled out from 14 days to 10. Each late application carries a $50 fine. Republicans also banned non-citizens from collecting applications and barred voter registration groups from collecting contact information from people who they register, making it harder to follow up with them later (a federal judge blocked both of these provisions this month). Two groups have accounted for more than $70,000 of the fines. Hard Knocks Strategies LLC \u2013 a for-profit election canvassing organization \u2013 has been fined $47,600 since last year for turning in forms late and to the wrong county. And Poder Latinx was fined $26,000 for turning in 52 voter registration applications to the wrong county. \u201cWe\u2019re a small voter registration organization with a long history of playing by all the rules. We had to pay the penalties in Florida to avoid even costlier litigation, but paid them without admission of wrongdoing,\u201d Hard Knocks Strategies said in a statement. \u201cAre voter registration organizations on the right being targeted as aggressively and frequently in Florida as those seeking to register voters of color and other underrepresented communities? Given Governor DeSantis\u2019 track record, that question may be rhetorical.\u201d \u2018I would be allowing the system to win\u2019 After getting fined, activists in Florida say they are determined not to let the penalties deter them from continuing to sign up voters. Rosemary McCoy, who runs a small non-profit called Harriet Tubman Freedom Fighters, was fined $600 for turning in a dozen applications late. She said her group does quality control on the applications it collects, reviewing the forms to make sure that they are complete and don\u2019t have errors. If there\u2019s a problem it can take a while to track down the applicant. McCoy said she plans to pay the fine, but it\u2019s money that would have otherwise gone to provide stipends or a gas subsidy for volunteers. \u201cThat\u2019s a hefty fine,\u201d she said. \u201cThe purpose of these fines is to stop us, stop us from registering people \u2026 Someone has to get out there and register people and that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Regina Jackson, a Jacksonville pastor, received a notice in May that she was being fined $50 for turning in a voter registration form late. And while she wasn\u2019t fined for it, the letter also said that the application didn\u2019t have a mark noting the group that had collected it and the date printed in triplicate. Jackson said she had inquired about the specific form before she turned it in with the election office and had been advised it was acceptable.

Trials have been under way as part of a government move to phase out natural gas boilers by 2035 amid a broader effort to decarbonise domestic heating, which accounts for about 17% of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. But the plans have in some cases been described as unsafe and have met with opposition in areas that have been earmarked for pilot schemes. Shapps said: \u201cThere was a time when people thought \u2026 you will have something that just looks like a gas boiler and we will feed hydrogen into it.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we won\u2019t do trials. We will. But I think hydrogen will be used for storing energy. You won\u2019t have to switch off windfarms when you don\u2019t need the power because you can turn it into hydrogen and use it later.\u201d Despite being more combustible and leakier than natural gas, energy firms have insisted that hydrogen can be made safe and have engaged in concerted lobbying of both the government and Labour to convince them of its merits. But the assurances have failed to convince people asked to take part in large-scale trials of the technology. Whitby, near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, was to host the first village-wide trial of hydrogen home heating but the government ditched the plan this month in the face of local opposition. Shapps said: \u201cIt is fundamentally unpopular in that area and I don\u2019t believe in telling people we will be coming in to rip up out your boiler to replace it with this other thing that you don\u2019t want, when they are other areas of the country that actually do want to go ahead with a trial.\u201d Hydrogen is derived either from splitting fossil fuel gas at extreme temperatures (known as blue hydrogen) or by splitting water using electricity from renewables, with minimal emissions \u2013 known as green hydrogen. Critics argue that creating green hydrogen for home heating is six times less energy efficient than using heat pumps powered by electricity, and say that switching from gas boilers to heat pumps could save money as well as cut emissions. Shapps also cited logistical concerns, such as the need to replace piping and the length of time it would take produce large volumes of low-emission green hydrogen. Energy analysts have also warned that hydrogen could be up to 70% more expensive than gas for homeowners who make the switch."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b78", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/13/elina-svitolina-ukraine-wimbledon-semi-final-wildcard", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ukraine still \u2018very proud\u2019 despite end of Wimbledon run for Svitolina", "lead": "Wildcard who had a baby in October has become a firm favourite on and off court at SW19", "author": "Alexandra Topping", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:41:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099010", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6ea6198b5e4ec080c8f9557307dfb6732d113236/0_9_3214_1929/500.jpg", "body": "Ukrainians said they \u201ccould not be more proud\u201d of their star player Elina Svitolina, who has been stopped in her extraordinary run at Wimbledon by the Czech Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 became the first unseeded women\u2019s Wimbledon finalist since Billie Jean King in 1963, holding off a second-set fight back by Svitolina in the semi-finals. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 made a triumphant return to her second career grand slam final with a 6-3, 6-3 victory. Speaking after the match, Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 said: \u201cI can\u2019t really believe [it].\u201d There have been a number of surprise grand slam finalists in the women\u2019s singles in recent years, but Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, who is ranked 42nd in the world, admitted before the semi-final she \u201cnever thought\u201d she could do well on grass. The Czech, who had never played on Centre Court before, added: \u201cI\u2019m just so happy. Elina is such a fighter and also a great person. It was such a tough match.\u201d Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 will face Ons Jabeur, who is aiming to become the first African and Arab female tennis player to win a grand slam in the women\u2019s singles final on Saturday. In a gripping three-set semi-final against Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka, in which she went a set down, Jabeur fed off the adoration of Centre Court to win the match 6-7, 6-4, 6-3. The Ukrainian ambassador Vadym Prystaiko and his wife, Inna, were in the royal box for Svitolina\u2019s semi-final defeat, but by the time the Belarusian No 1\u2019s clash with Jabeur had started, their front row seats had been vacated. In a post match press conference a clearly emotional Svitolina, who said her family and \u201ca lot\u201d of people in Ukraine had been watching the match, admitted that she had felt the pressure, but said she didn\u2019t want to use it as \u201can excuse\u201d. \u201cI try to take it as a motivation,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope that Ukrainian people continue supporting me. It was really amazing. And [I] just hope that I\u2019m going to get another chance.\u201d But Ukrainians still hailed Svitolina\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d run at SW19, which came less than nine months after giving birth to her daughter and against the backdrop of war in her homeland. Earlier in the week Svitolina pulled off one of the performances of her career in defeating the top seed, Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2 to return to the Wimbledon semi-finals, which she last reached in 2019 when she lost to Simona Halep. Anja Kachetzhiyiva, who was born in Kharkiv but is now based in London, said that Svitolina had been an inspiration, both for the people in Ukraine and the diaspora. \u201cWe are already very proud. She\u2019s already exceeded expectations on all fronts. She will continue to be the mum, the Ukrainian raising money for charity, and just being an all round, nice person,\u201d she said. Kachetzhiyiva, a trustee of the charity Opora, which supports Ukrainians in the UK, said that as a new mother herself she had loved seeing Svitolina progress to the later stages of the competition. Svitolina returned to the WTA tour only three months ago and reached the quarter-finals of the French Open last month in her first grand slam appearance since giving birth. She had a daughter, Ska\u00ef, in October with her husband and fellow tennis player, Ga\u00ebl Monfils. \u201cAs a recent mum myself, it is such an inspiration to see a mum, eight months after giving birth smashing it, literally smashing it on the court,\u201d said Kachetzhiyiva. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t wish for a better figure representing us on a sports stage.\u201d Maria Granovska, a Ukrainian who has family in and around Kyiv, watched Svitolina play from the hill at Wimbledon. \u201cI think it is one of the only times where you can feel so optimistic about the future and proud,\u201d she said. Svitolina\u2019s progression to the semi-final had given \u201ceveryone so much hope and empowerment seeing someone Ukrainian succeed at such a level\u201d. There are potential headaches for organisers as Wimbledon enters its final stages, with the Russian Daniil Medvedev through to the men\u2019s semis after a scintillating five-set win against the American Chris Eubanks. Russian and Belarusian players were banned from Wimbledon last year but have been allowed to compete this year under a neutral flag."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b79", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/13/russians-neutrals-wimbledon-belarusians-tennis", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russians emerge as Wimbledon winners after charm offensive as \u2018neutrals\u2019", "lead": "Russians such as Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva have made an unlikely impact on and off court after last year\u2019s ban", "author": "Paul MacInnes at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:30:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099028", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9d65cf61aebba598faaafc7a22904fb45f1f8d92/0_102_3589_2154/500.jpg", "body": "It has been a bounce-back tournament for Wimbledon: the crowds have returned and there\u2019s a buzz around the grounds. The tennis has been engaging too, with the emergence of Carlos Alcaraz as a genuine contender and a series of upsets in the women\u2019s draw. Among all the successes of the 2023 championships there is another, less welcome, winner, however, and that\u2019s Russia. Russian players, alongside those from Belarus, were banned from participating in last year\u2019s tournament after the invasion of Ukraine. This year, after Wimbledon found itself alone and under political and financial pressure, that position was reversed. Players could return as long as they did not compete under a flag and had signed a \u201cpersonal declaration of neutrality\u201d as part of their terms of entry. By the time the first round started, 18 Russians and Belarusians were in competition. These neutral athletes have gone on to perform well. Four of them reached the quarter-finals of the singles (plus the Moscow-born Elena Rybakina, the defending women\u2019s champion, who represents Kazakhstan). Two, Daniil Medvedev in the men\u2019s and Aryna Sabalenka in the women\u2019s, progressed to the semi-finals. There remains the prospect that Medvedev, who only 12 months ago was ostracised from SW19, could yet be photographed shaking hands with the Princess of Wales on the way to picking up a trophy. On-court success extended beyond representation in the later stages. Medvedev has surpassed all his previous efforts on grass but so too did Andrey Rublev, who also served up perhaps the shot of the tournament when he found a winner while practically supine behind the baseline against Alexander Bublik. Roman Safiullin, Ekaterina Alexandrova and Daria Kasatkina, lesser-known Russians, all recorded personal best performances at the home of tennis. Finally, the cherry on top: Mirra Andreeva, the 16-year-old qualifier who became a 48-hour sensation after knocking out two seeds en route to the fourth round. Success was extensive on court, then, but not limited to it. In engagements with fans and the media at Wimbledon this year, Russian stars have been charm personified. Medvedev, whose reputation is that of a hothead, has been winningly goofy, transparently trying to endear himself to the No 1 Court crowd who followed him from first round to quarter-final (\u201cFor different reasons it could be possible that the reception would not be as great as it was,\u201d was how he put it). Rublev, meanwhile, was courteous in his remarks and conscientious in signing autographs for fans. Andreeva blushed when asked about an apparent admiration for Andy Murray. It is possible to debate whether this charm offensive was a happy accident and, if not, what motivated it; was it individuals trying to detoxify the reputation of their country, or just athletes happy to be back at a prestigious tournament? Whatever the reason, the conclusion anyone watching would draw is that there was a bunch of bouncing, smiling individuals who just happened to be from Russia or Belarus, pretty much every time they turned on the television. The one openly political moment came at the end of the fourth round match between Elina Svitolina and Victoria Azarenka. Azarenka, the Belarusian, was beaten by the Ukrainian and then appeared to be booed by the crowd for failing to come to the net to shake Svitolina\u2019s hand. It seems, however, that Azarenka was jeered for a failure of protocol, not her nationality. She subsequently argued she had only not come to the net because she knew Svitolina would not shake her hand anyway. She then claimed the crowd had booed because they were drunk. Sabalenka, in turn, called on Wimbledon authorities to make clear that Ukrainian players were boycotting handshakes and to do something to protect Russian and Belarusian players from \u201cso much hate\u201d when they left the court. Again, it is not clear that either Azarenka or Sabalenka has been playing politics. Being booed by thousands of people would create strongly-felt responses in anyone. But it is true that Azarenka has rejected calls of extra support for Ukrainian players on the women\u2019s tour this year, while Sabalenka says she does not support the war but has also refused to condemn it and has shut down questioning on the topic during her Wimbledon run. If the players were keen to portray themselves as victims, not aggressors, and perhaps symbolic of a greater geopolitical misunderstanding, this might be how they would do it. When announcing the ban last year, Wimbledon said the decision had been taken in order to \u201climit Russia\u2019s global influence\u201d through the strongest means possible. \u201cIn the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression,\u201d the All England Club said, \u201cit would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with the championships.\u201d In an information war, the truth is difficult to discern and motivation hard to gauge. A year after that statement, however, and with banned players successfully restored to competition, it feels distinctly like the benefits Wimbledon hoped to deny have ultimately been accrued."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b7a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/biden-prisoner-swap-russia-evan-gershkovich", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Biden \u2018serious\u2019 on prisoner swap for US reporter Evan Gershkovich", "lead": "Biden says process \u2018under way\u2019 to free Wall Street Journal reporter held in Russia and accused without evidence of spying", "author": "Pjotr Sauer", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:22:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099045", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ea1b74c4de5f3845a3d5ae0e5cb2aba4222fa9b4/0_143_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "Joe Biden has said he is serious about pursuing a prisoner exchange for the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in Russia for more than 100 days, and claimed the process was \u201cunder way\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m serious on a prisoner exchange,\u201d Biden told reporters on Thursday when asked about Gershkovich\u2019s continued detention in Russia. \u201cAnd I\u2019m serious about doing all we can to free Americans being illegally held in Russia, or anywhere else for that matter, and that process is under way,\u201d Biden, who was completing a four-day visit to Europe during which he visited the UK, Lithuania and Finland, added. The Kremlin last week suggested it could be open to a possible prisoner exchange involving Gershkovich, but reaffirmed that such talks must be held away from the public eye. \u201cWe have said that there have been certain contacts on the subject, but we don\u2019t want them to be discussed in public,\u201d Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said. \u201cThey must be carried out and continue in complete silence.\u201d Gershkovich, 31, is the first western journalist arrested and accused of espionage by Moscow since the Soviet era, amid a sharp deterioration of relations over the Ukraine war. The US, the Wall Street Journal and Gershkovich strongly deny the spying claim. Russian authorities have not provided any evidence to support the charge against Gershkovich. Shortly after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated by the US state department as wrongfully detained. He is being held at Moscow\u2019s Lefortovo prison, known for its grim conditions, and could face a sentence of up to 20 years if found guilty. A Moscow court recently upheld a ruling to keep him in custody until 30 August. In an interview this week with ACB News, Ella Milman and Mikhail Gershkovich, the parents of Gershkovich, said Biden personally promised \u201cto do whatever it takes\u201d to bring Gershkovich home. While both sides have now shown their willingness to engage in a prisoner exchange, Russia has previously suggested that it would only trade Gershkovich after a court delivers its verdict in the espionage case against him. In Russia, legal proceedings, including pre-trial detention and the actual trial, can sometimes stretch for more than a year. The Journal earlier this week reported that Putin held direct oversight over the detention of Gershkovich, receiving video briefings before and after his arrest by the FSB\u2019s counter-intelligence service Last December, Russia freed the US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was arrested on drug charges, in return for the release of Viktor Bout, imprisoned in the US for weapons smuggling. Another American, the Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan, has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have called baseless."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b7b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/13/i-lost-everything-over-sexual-abuse-claims-kevin-spacey-tells-court", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I lost everything\u2019 over sexual abuse claims, Kevin Spacey tells UK court ", "lead": "Tearful actor says \u2018there was a rush to judgment\u2019 in Hollywood after allegations were made against him in 2017", "author": "Emine Sinmaz", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:18:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099065", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b405f61a9eb5133c6f5156887317be260f5da038/0_0_3260_1957/500.jpg", "body": "Kevin Spacey broke down in tears on Thursday as he said his \u201cworld exploded\u201d when sexual abuse allegations against him first emerged in 2017, saying: \u201cI lost everything.\u201d The two-time Oscar winner tried to compose himself as he told jurors his acting work dried up and his fortune dwindled in the face of mounting legal bills. Wiping away tears, the Hollywood star told Southwark crown court: \u201cThere was a rush to judgment, and before the first question was asked or answered I lost my job, I lost my reputation, I lost everything in a matter of days.\u201d Spacey, 63, denies charges including sexual assault and indecent assault against four men in their 20s and 30s, between 2001 and 2013. Wearing a charcoal grey suit and a blue tie, he appeared in the witness box on Thursday as he gave evidence in his month-long trial. His barrister, Patrick Gibbs KC, asked him about an October 2017 BuzzFeed article that featured an allegation by the American actor Anthony Rapp, who accused Spacey of an unwanted sexual advance. The allegation was found not proven in a civil court in October last year. Spacey told the packed courtroom: \u201cMy world exploded.\u201d He said there were further rumours in the wake of the article and that his sponsorship deals and contracts were \u201cabandoned\u201d. \u201cWith a few exceptions over the last five, six years, I have not been able to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had no money coming in and I\u2019ve had a lot of legal bills and things to fight against, and I haven\u2019t paid it all off so I still owe money.\u201d Spacey also addressed the public statement he made in the wake of the allegation in which he came out as gay. \u201cMembers of the LGTBQ+ community were upset because I came out while I was responding to an accusation \u2026 now I understand why it was read that way, but I hadn\u2019t put those two things together,\u201d he said. Spacey began his testimony by detailing his career and how he had gone to acting school with Val Kilmer. He recounted showbiz anecdotes including buying Dame Judi Dench a ping-pong table and purchasing \u201cthe most expensive Mini Cooper ever\u201d at a charity auction hosted by Elton John. But he appeared emotional as he described feeling \u201ccrushed\u201d when he found out that a man he had been \u201cintimate\u201d with had accused him of assaulting him in the early 2000s. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has claimed that on one occasion he was driving the House of Cards star to a party hosted by Elton John when Spacey grabbed his penis with such force that he almost crashed. Spacey denied assaulting the man on the way to the singer\u2019s white tie and tiara ball, saying: \u201cNo, I was not on a suicide mission in any of those years.\u201d Responding to the allegations made by the complainant, Spacey told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m a flirt, I\u2019m a big flirt.\u201d He described the man as \u201ccharming and funny\u201d before adding: \u201cSlowly over time [the relationship] became somewhat sexual but we never had sex together because he made it clear he didn\u2019t want to go any further, and that happens at times, and you respect how far someone wants to go or not go. \u201cIt did not happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way. It was gentle and it was touching and in my mind romantic.\u201d Gibbs asked Spacey how he had felt when he found out about the man\u2019s allegations. \u201cI was crushed. I never thought that [the man] I knew would 20 years later stab me in the back,\u201d he said. Spacey said claims made by a second man who he allegedly met in a West End theatre in the mid-2000s were \u201cmadness\u201d. The man has accused Spacey of grabbing his crotch \u201clike a cobra\u201d after making a \u201cbarrage of vile comments\u201d. Spacey denied the attack, saying: \u201cI never said any of the things that he claims I said to him, and wouldn\u2019t, and never have to anyone in my life.\u201d He also denied claims by an aspiring actor who accused Spacey of being a \u201cvile sexual predator\u201d who drugged him before performing a sex act on him while he was asleep in 2008. Spacey said the pair had shared \u201can intimate\u201d moment before the man became \u201csuddenly awkward and fumbling\u201d. \u201cI believe I performed oral sex on him,\u201d Spacey said. \u201cI remember the end of the evening and that was what stuck in my mind because we had a consensual and, I believe, a very nice and lovely evening.\u201d Addressing sexual grab claims made by a fourth complainant he had met in a pub near Oxford in the early 2010s, Spacey said he had \u201cprimarily\u201d no issue with the man\u2019s testimony. \u201cI made a pass and I\u2019m only happy that he testified that the moment he told me he was not interested, I stopped,\u201d he said. Spacey denies 12 charges, which include seven of sexual assault, three of indecent assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.

Doreen\u2019s sketchbook chronicled her lifelong adventures, but her vocation was for teaching. She was born in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire to Eileen (nee Royle), who operated a knitting machine in a factory, and Frank Harrison, the chief engineer for Odhams press. At Watford grammar school she stood out as a gifted linguist, and at 19 was able to speak German with fellow fruit pickers at a camp in Kent. A lederhosen-clad young man was a serious contender for her hand, and continued to telephone her on her birthday until she was 84. As a bored 17-year-old she wrote to several French mayors, requesting that they find her a summer job. Three months later she was in a chalet in Montgen\u00e8vre staying with a GP and his family of seven children. Doreen\u2019s English puddings were raved about; the plimsolls she brought scarcely survived. Mountains put a spell on Doreen, and as head of art at Beaconsfield high school in Buckinghamshire she regularly went skiing with \u201cher girls\u201d. At the age of 76 she completed La Sarenne in Alpe d\u2019Huez, the longest black run in Europe. Doreen\u2019s teaching career started at Westonbirt school in Gloucestershire. Then a posting to the Queen\u2019s school in Rheindahlen, Germany, resulted in a romance with her boss, Peter Wilcockson, the head of art. They married in 1963 and my sister Laura and I were born in Germany, before we returned to the UK in 1965 for Peter\u2019s new job at Newlands Park teacher training in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. In 1966 Doreen was a founder member of the staff at Beaconsfield, and she taught there until retiring in 1998. She then created a new village sign for Chalfont St Giles in 2001, and a new life in Woodchurch, Kent, where she often designed the cover of the parish magazine, and cared for Peter, who died in 2013.

Families shattered, lives ruined and a thin, greasy feeling of shame descending over all who got caught up in the heat of the moment. The worst-kept secret of the week is out, for whatever that is worth. We all know now that the anonymous BBC presenter accused by the Sun of paying for sexually explicit images was Huw Edwards, the corporation\u2019s weighty anchor, in every sense of the word: the reassuring face and voice of every great state occasion, from election night to the death of a monarch. Shortly after the police declared there was no evidence that he had actually done anything illegal \u2013 raising serious questions about how that story ever came to be published \u2013 Edwards\u2019s wife, Vicky Flind, took the courageous decision to name him, disclosing that he had been hospitalised with a serious resurgence of the mental health problems from which he had previously suffered, and appealing for the hounds to be called off. The couple have five grown-up children, whose distress can only be imagined \u2013 as can that of other broadcasters wrongly dragged through the mud in the reckless social media guessing game that inevitably followed the Sun\u2019s original, anonymised story. But there is another vulnerable family here, too, who say they approached the paper in a desperate attempt to stop their 20-year-old child funding a crack habit by selling explicit images online; who had, they claim, already tried and failed to raise the alarm at the BBC. The young person disputes this account. But whoever is telling the truth, an obviously sad and sensitive family situation is rarely best served by pitching everyone into the middle of a war between the rightwing press and the BBC. Not for the first time, the trail of broken people leads directly to my own industry\u2019s door. But awkwardly for those now calling on the ghouls to just leave Edwards alone, it doesn\u2019t quite end there. At least three current and former BBC employees have now complained of receiving what they considered inappropriate private messages from Edwards that left them feeling uncomfortable, but which they felt unable to report. One was a comment on their looks that prompted a \u201ccold shudder\u201d, according to Newsnight\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire. Another had never met Edwards but got a late-night message complete with kisses. There is talk of a newsroom culture where juniors were afraid that complaining would damage their careers, something that goes well beyond one individual case. There may have been no crime, but that does not necessarily mean the BBC\u2019s internal investigation will find no victims. Did so many lives have to be smashed, however, to reach this point? The Sun surely has the most immediate questions to answer. Backpedalling furiously, the paper now insists that it never alleged criminality in the Edwards case, despite initially accusing him paying a 17-year-old for sexual images (potentially a criminal offence). But what were readers meant to make of headlines suggesting he could face \u201cyears in prison\u201d? After the Metropolitan police knocked that idea down, what\u2019s left looks like a clumsy midlife blunder through contemporary dating app culture, where it\u2019s far from clear who, if anyone, was exploiting whom. Embarrassing, but hardly damning. Lucy Frazer, the new culture secretary, can expect some tough questions about regulation of both the established press and social media platforms that failed to stop their users recklessly libelling various household names once the story broke. But don\u2019t hold your breath, this close to a general election, for anything to come of that. Next to apologise should surely be the Conservative party deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, who branded the BBC a \u201csafe haven for perverts\u201d days after his own colleague Chris Pincher was formally recommended for suspension over groping allegations. Since 2019, two former Tory MPs have been convicted of sexual assault and another remains under investigation for rape. Pots would be well advised to reflect on their own appearance before attacking kettles. Which is why, of course, the BBC has devoted quite such a maddening amount of airtime this week to investigating itself. Tortuous as it is to turn on the news and hear the BBC earnestly interrogating the BBC, rather than the Nato summit or Boris Johnson\u2019s mysterious failure to produce evidence requested by the Covid-19 inquiry, there\u2019s still a kind of mad nobility to it. What other organisation under intense commercial and political pressure would respond to a crisis not by seeking a superinjunction, but letting staff challenge their bosses\u2019 version of events in full view of the customers? You\u2019re unlikely to see the Sun turning over its pages to a rueful postmortem. And when outraged Tory women complained in a private meeting of a male MP openly watching porn on his phone in parliament, the response was a lecture on the dangers of attacking your own side. Some may think the BBC naive, prone to falling feebly into its opponents\u2019 traps. But are we really going to attack it for failing to organise a proper cover-up? The BBC cannot credibly cover failings in any other walk of life if it isn\u2019t prepared to acknowledge its own. The caveat, however, if its staff are to endure this level of public scrutiny, is that the corporation must be crystal clear in advance about what\u2019s expected of them. In theory, it shouldn\u2019t matter what the onscreen talent gets up to outside work, if it\u2019s consensual and legal. This isn\u2019t the 1980s, when the BBC sacked Frank Bough for allegedly taking cocaine and partying with prostitutes. A chaotic private life, an extramarital fling or a midlife decision to come out of the closet, as Phillip Schofield did in 2020, shouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker now. But new sins have replaced old ones, and chief among them is the perceived abuse of power. Creeping into the DMs of young women desperate to break into your industry, for example, rings alarm bells now. So does the kind of bombastic office manner that a generation ago would not have been called bullying. Anyone senior enough to have worked their way to the top may have trained in a different world, and needs to understand that the goalposts have well and truly moved. This has been a hard week for everyone who cherishes a national broadcaster operating without fear or favour, and hardest of all on the BBC itself. It\u2019s tough to be held to standards others are not, and more distressing still to witness the human costs of that. But the BBC can emerge from this stronger, not weaker, if it makes a virtue of transparency. There is no future, in the end, for a news organisation incapable of facing the truth.

Senior officials in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have previously told the investigation that as scores of civil servants were switched to planning for the UK to crash out of the EU, work to update and develop pandemic plans was sidelined. But Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities and a lead figure in the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, said: \u201cPreparation for the EU exit was some of the best preparation we could have undergone for any future crisis.\u201d No-deal Brexit planning had a \u201cdaily battle rhythm\u201d and \u201cmade government more match fit for the terrible events that this inquiry has been set up to address\u201d, he said. Six pandemic preparation projects were \u201cstopped\u201d or reduced as a result of the Operation Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit work. Roger Hargreaves, director of the government\u2019s Cobra crisis management hub, gave evidence that the government\u2019s crisis response system had been \u201cpulled out of shape\u201d by crises including planning for Brexit. Projects dropped included a \u201cpandemic influenza strategy refresh\u201d \u2013 which was supposed to examine how countries in Asia, such as South Korea, had dealt with previous coronavirus pandemics \u2013 planning for a \u201chealthcare surge\u201d and benchmarking the NHS\u2019s preparedness internationally. But Gove insisted: \u201cI haven\u2019t yet seen any activity that has been identified that would have enabled us to significantly better deal with the Covid-19 pandemic that did not occur as a direct result of EU exit.\u201d Pandemic planning related to flu rather than a coronavirus and when it was put to Gove that some of that planning would have nevertheless helped, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that can be proven.\u201d Earlier pandemic planning exercises had recommended revisiting plans for social care, where more than 40,000 people died with Covid, including workforce capacity and infrastructure but this was hampered by no-deal Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is that would have been different in the approach that was taken towards adult social care that could have been anticipated beforehand,\u201d he said. Meanwhile it emerged that key official bodies set up to tackle race, gender and other inequalities had no involvement in pandemic planning before Covid hit, government insiders have told the UK Covid-19 public inquiry. There was \u201cinadequate consideration\u201d of the risk of different groups heading into a health crisis not on a level footing, and the government\u2019s race disparity and disability units \u201chad no involvement in pre-pandemic preparedness within government\u201d, the opening module investigating the UK\u2019s preparedness heard. Amid evidence that the virus took a greater toll on black and minority ethnic communities and disabled and elderly people, Marcus Bell, the director of the equality hub in the Cabinet Office, was asked if pandemic preparedness was on his radar, and replied: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d Melanie Field, the chief strategy and policy officer at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, a statutory body, told the inquiry: \u201cThere was an inadequate consideration both of the existing health and other inequalities that might mean that people going into an emergency situation would not be on a level footing and \u2026 that they might need different responses in order to come out to have equal outcomes.\u201d On Thursday, Field said the EHRC had no contact from the government to provide assistance in terms of pandemic planning and emergency preparedness. \u201cI am surprised,\u201d Field said. \u201cThe issue was not on the commission\u2019s radar either \u2026 our strategic priorities did not include a focus on health and social care.\u201d Dr Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of the Lancet, told the inquiry: \u201cThis was not an equal-opportunity virus.\u201d He said: \u201cIn the specific realm of pandemic prevention, we should be giving greater attention to those who are living with chronic disease and to those who are living in more deprived communities.\u201d Horton, who has written a book called The Covid-19 Catastrophe, addressed the conundrum of why ministers and officials had felt the UK was well prepared for a pandemic. The Global Health Security Index by Johns Hopkins University and the World Heath Organization rated UK preparedness highly. But Horton said those assessments did not account for \u201chow our political leaders or health leaders frame the threat, how we assess the threat and how we respond\u201d.

Thanks all for your company \u2013 and join me again tomorrow for: Jannik Sinner [8] v Novak Djokovic [2] and Carlos Alcaraz [1] v Daniil Medvedev [3] But until then, peace out. Also going on: potentially one of the great run-chases. Oh man, we\u2019re being shown Svitolina\u2019s press conference and, on the verge of tears, she says she hopes she can build on this, though is disappointed not to have played better today. That\u2019s what\u2019s on her mind now, so she\u2019ll need a couple of days to reflect on everything that\u2019s happened \u2013 she was trying to be really focused even after beating Swiatek, and after those two days will think about what she did right and wrong. She tries to balance responsibility with tension but sometimes it gets too much, though she doesn\u2019t want to use that as an excuse for losing today. She\u2019s had so many messages from so many people and she hopes they stick with her; I\u2019m certain they will. She\u2019s done a phenomenal job of bringing joy to her people. We also mustn\u2019t forget that in both quarter and semi, Jabeur came back after losing the first set. This is a woman on a mission. And that was the big difference in this match, I think; for all Jabeur\u2019s wizardy and speed about the court, the discipline and quality on the return was what got her into points and games, facilitating the rest of her game. And we see her now, walking up the stairs to be clapped by the members \u2013 she looks touched \u2013 and imagine the scenes if she takes this. Jabeur will be a big favourite for the final, but faces an entirely different challenge to the power-games of Kvitova, Rybakina and Saba. It might be that she\u2019s just a better version of Vondrousova, understanding her use of angles, spins and speeds better than others, or it may be that the swinging lefty serve into the advantage court takes away her ability to land returns within a foot of the line. Ons, of course, is still on court, signing autographs and posing for photos with kids. What an inspiration she is. \u201cYou\u2019d better keep speaking because I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d says Ons, explaining how hard it was dealing with Saba\u2019s serves. She\u2019s been working a lot with her mental coach on keeping calm and sticking to the plan \u2013 she might be writing a book on that \u2013 and is very proud of herself because old her might\u2019ve lost today and gone home already. She\u2019s glad she dug deep and found the strength \u2013 she\u2019s learning to turn good energy into bad, her anger at losing the first set, for example, and not sweating the stuff over which she has no control \u2013 Sabalenka can hit an ace or a winner at any time whatever she does. Finally, she watched the other semi, has lost twice to Marketa this year, and seeking revenge is working well for her so she\u2019ll try for that again, hoping the crowd are with her. I think they might just be. Oh man, Sabalenka looks desolate as she leaves the court, and on the one hand, well she might \u2013 she\u2019ll feel she should\u2019ve won this in two \u2013 but on the other, she\u2019ll know she\u2019s been part of a special match, falling to a special performance from a special player and a special woman. She\u2019ll be back. *Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 6-3 Sabalenka Down 15-0, Sabalenka gets a second serve to go at, but can\u2019t get on top of it and when the next ball is there for her, she can\u2019t punish that either. Jabeur is two points away \u2026 ands she guides a lovely backhand down the line that Sabalenka puts into the net, raising three match points! She\u2019s already missed two, and trying to secure the third, a net cord leaves her kicking a ball that\u2019s already bounced twice, then she sticks a forehand long! The pressure is immense as the crowd go wild; can she see it out? YES SHE CAN! An ace out wide, and Jabeur is into her second straight final, a sensational returning performance the difference in a sensational match. What a pair of absolute warriors! Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 5-3 Sabalenka* It\u2019s almost as though Jabeur had to smell the ill odour of defeat to really get herself going, but now the glorious stench of victory is inspiring her and she makes 0-15 with a backhand winner down the line. Sabalenka, though, isn\u2019t going away even when a luscious controlled backhand return, inside out, makes 15-30; a booming forehand quickly levels up the game. AND SHE\u2019S DONE IT AGAIN! Ons has returned like a demon today, a robot imbued with genius of humanity, and one close to the baseline raises match point \u2026 quickly snuffed out via ace. I am in absolute awe of these two, and another double hands Jabeur a second match point \u2026 but again, Sabalenka finds a monstrous serve, the return drifting wide. From there, Saba closes out, and Jabeur will have to serve for it. I can barely move my fingers and I\u2019ve no dog in this fight, so I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019s going to handle the responsibility. *Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 5-2 Sabalenka Jabeur has been sensational today, she really has. She played well in the first set but couldn\u2019t take the big points; since finding herself on the cusp of defeat, she\u2019s played the best tennis of her life, which is saying something, and a backhand onto the chalk secures a consolidation to 15, taking her to within a game of a second consecutive final! What does Sabalenka have left? Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 4-2 Sabalenka* Another deep return from Jabeur crowds Sabalenka, who nets her riposte for 0-15, and one to the body sees a rushed larrup long; 0-30, and half a chance. Jabeur, though, can\u2019t control her next backhand, and a biog serve then facilitates a clean-up forehand for 30-all. Both players have shown massive mental strength in this match, trusting themselves to keep doping what they do best even if it\u2019s high-risk, and we wind up at deuce following good and bad forehands from Sabalenka. AND HAVE A LOOK! The length of Jabeur\u2019s returns has been excellent since about halfway through set two, and another pearler, taken early, elicits an error that means break point; Sabalenka, though, keeps her nerve, maintaining power even when hitting a second serve to make deuce with a forehand winner. T, BUT WHAT\u2019S THIS! A dreadful backhand, running in to the net, is sent unnecessarily wide \u2026 but again, break point down, Sabalenka stays true to herself, saving the situation with a serve and forehands. This is now the match we hoped it\u2019d be, and when Sabalenka goes long on the backhand, Jabeur has another chance to take a commanding lead. She finds the return she needs too, again not trying to do loads but landing it deep and nasty; it gets her into rally, Sabalenka can\u2019t reverse control, and when she goes long Jabeur is two games from the final! That was not only the longest game of the match but one of the best of the tournament so far, and might it be decisive? Since she trailed 2-4 in set two, Jabeur has won eight games of 10. *Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 3-2 Sabalenka Sabalenka tries to engage in a battle of wits, coming in behind a slice; yeah, good luck with that, old mate. Jabeur slices a winner down the line, an ace makes 40-0 \u2026 but then Sabalenka hits her way back into the game, a disconcerting forehand giving her 40-30. But a serve down the middle is good enough, and Jabeur re-establishes her advantage. Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 2-2 Sabalenka* A terrific return from Jabeur sets her up for a forehand with much of the court open, but lost in the supermarket, she can\u2019t decide what to do with it, so spanks wide. Sabalenka, though, nets a forehand for 15-all \u2026 then punishes a redemptive serve down the T. Jabeur, though, makes 30-all with a backhand down the line and into the corner that Sabalenka can\u2019t get back and as in set one, she\u2019s the better player; can she make it count? She cannot, Sabalenka closing out, and this is beginning to look like a superbreaker situation. *Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 2-1 Sabalenka My daughter returns from school and I\u2019ve to answer the door, so I miss what\u2019s a remarkably quick game even for Jabeur. But it\u2019s another hold to love, and both players are turning up the aggression. Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 1-1 Sabalenka* Old Sabalenka might\u2019ve shrank at this point, but new Sabalenka holds to love and is in the set. *Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 1-0 Sabalenka It must be said, Sabalenka didn\u2019t bottle that; she might\u2019ve got tight on a point or two, but her losing that set took Jabeur flinging some serious heat. And Jabeur maintains her level at the start of set three, holding to 15. I\u2019ve not a scooby who\u2019s going to win this. Jabeur (5)6-7 6-4 Sabalenka* A brilliant return on the stretch allows Jabeur to cream a backhand winner for 15-all, and again, the pressure on Sabalenka increases. So she responds with a majestic second serve out wide, a forehand into the corner completing its work, only to slip backing away from a backhand, netting for 30-all. AND HAVE A LOOK! A gigantic serve down the T looks to have set up the rally, but then she decelerates through a backhand and now, where once she was a point away from 5-3, is now a point away from one set-all! And there it is! Jabeur drags a backhand return down the line, and we\u2019ve got ourselves the decider we deserve! Well done Ons Jabeur! This is going to be special! *Jabeur (5)6-7 5-4 Sabalenka Saba, though, is solid, refusing to sulk after surrendering what looked to be a match-clinching advantage to make 0-30 with a fine backhand winner cross-court. But Ons responds, her phattest serve of the day giving her 30-all, before a leaping backhand volley goes just wide; break point Sabalenka \u2026 who does all the hard work, clambering into the rally with a monstrous forehand, only to go long with another! The crowd are right behind Jabeur here, partly because she\u2019s herself and partly because they\u2019ll want to see another set (of tennis), going wild when she closes out for 5-4! We are cooking now! Jabeur (5)6-7 4-4 Sabalenka* An eighth ace of the match gives Sabalenka 15-0, but a terrific return onto the tootsies levels the game. I can\u2019t lie, I\u2019m Jabeur, at this stage I\u2019m chatting trash to try and distract, but this version of Sabalenka is a different animal, and when Ons nets for 15-30, the look on her kipper suggests she\u2019s struggling to see a way. A backhand down the line, though, elicits a squash shot into the net, and she\u2019s well in the next rally \u2013 the best of the match, both players digging them out and cleansing them back, only for Sabalenka to finish it by running in to caress a dainty pick-up down the line for a winner. More superb play from Ons, though, who\u2019s grown again \u2013 a return onto the line followed by a drop \u2013 makes deuce, and up ratchets the tension. This gives us another stupendous rally \u2013 the kind of tennis we hoped for throughout \u2013 both players showing the full gamut of their touch and power before Jabeur nets a forehand on the run. Sabalenka, though, can\u2019t close out, and soon finds herself down advantage, refusing to subdue her power \u2026 but when she bangs a forehand into the net, Jabeur has her break back! That was a fantastic game, and we might just be at that elusive point where both players are playing their best. *Jabeur (5)6-7 3-4 Sabalenka The crowd try and rouse Jabeur when she improvises a French cricket half-volley and eventually wins the net exchange for 30-0. From there, she serves out for 4-3, but is running out of chances to break and right now, Sabalenka looks impregnable. Jabeur (5)6-7 2-4 Sabalenka* This match hasn\u2019t quite ignited and now it might soon be over, Sabalenka making it seven points on the spin with a terrifying ace down the T. Jabeur then swipes a wild backhand return wide, and she needs something, fast. Sabalenka is more than capable of getting tight with her first Wimbledon final in sight, but at this stage, it doesn\u2019t look likely. *Jabeur (5)6-7 2-3 Sabalenka Sabalenka reads a drop and, with Jabeur expecting line, goes cross with a gentle winner. She\u2019s the one bossing this now, and a netted backhand followed by another \u2013 incited by a fine return onto the baseline \u2013 raises three break points, a tame double meaning only one is required! That might just be the match there! Jabeur (5)6-7 2-2 Sabalenka* Jabeur asks her box for guidance on where to receive as a terrific serve sends her haring out wide to no avail. She might, though, look to do more on the second delivery, which she can attack rather than chip in order to get into the point \u2026 and as I type that she does it, a big backhand making 30-15, then Sabalenka slices into the net and ups the pressure on herself. Jabeur is well in the next rally too, working a chance to go for a winner \u2026 but banging a flat backhand down the line, squeals when it thunks into the net. And from there, a perfect point from Sabalenka, crowned with a lovely disguised drop, gets her back in terms in set two. *Jabeur (5)6-7 2-1 Sabalenka Mac suggests that Jabeur take the ball a little earlier, rushing Sabalenka, and I wonder if she might try and move her about a little more. But as in set one, she\u2019s holding easily enough, and my guess is she keeps things the same because she\u2019s only behind because of a poor couple of points in the breaker. Jabeur (5)6-7 1-1 Sabalenka* In yesterday\u2019s third set, Rybakina was 28% on first serves which, for all Jabeur\u2019s good and more varied play, was probably the aspect which decided the match.Sabalenka, though, won\u2019t do that at this stage \u2013 she might if she gets tight with the line in sight, but not yet \u2013 and she holds easily to 15. *Jabeur (5)6-7 1-0 Sabalenka Jabeur, of course, lost yesterday\u2019s first set 7-6 to Rybakina, and won\u2019t panic to be behind here \u2013 she knows she\u2019s played the better tennis so far. But failure to take chances left her vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a breaker, so she has to start again now, holding to 30. Jabeur (5)6-7 Sabalenka Jabeur saves the first set point with a big serve and clean-up forehand, then on the Sabalenka serve again tries to block back a return to get in the rally, except this time she puts a little too much on it, the ball drops long, and after exactly an hour of absorbing, intense play, that\u2019s the difference between these two giants. *Jabeur 6-6 Sabalenka (4-6) OH MY DAYS! Just when Sabalenka thinks she\u2019s sorted immediate retrieval with an inside-out backhand into the corner, Jabeur coaxes a stunning riposte, down the line and almost off the ground, for the shot of the match so far. But Ons then sends a backhand long, snuffing out her own mini-break, and when she nets a backhand at 4-5, in response to another murderous strike from Sabalenka, she\u2019s two set points down! *Jabeur 6-6 Sabalenka (3-2) Sabalenka wins the first point on serve, then Jabeur sends an ace down the middle and escapes when a weak second delivery is returned into the net. It\u2019s so hard to split these two, Sabalenka creaming a forehand winner for 2-2 \u2026 before ceding the mini-break with a double! *Jabeur 6-6 Sabalenka Up 30-15, Jabeur, finds a lush forehand, backing away to send it cross-court and just inside the sideline. From there, she closes out, and here comes that breaker! Jabeur 5-6 Sabalenka* At 30-15, Sabalenka punishes an ace down the T, and I remember that a friend of mine used to say \u201cPunish it\u201d when he wanted you to finish a drink; yes, he did play rugby. Saba secures a straightforward hold, forcing Jabeur to serve for a breaker. *Jabeur 5-5 Sabalenka Sabalenka howls when she sticks a second-serve return into the net \u2013 she considered that a chance, but it was a crafty slider that was hard to attack with power. It gives Jabeur 15-0, and from there she secures another comfy hold. She\u2019s still playing the better tennis, but this set will now be decided by a point or two here and there, and against as fearsome a hitter as Sabalenka, that\u2019s a problem. Jabeur 4-5 Sabalenka* At 30-15, a forehand slice return gets Jabeur into the rally and prompts Sabalenka to go long \u2026 so she retorts with an ace. We end up at deuce though, and a double on advantage increases the tension \u2026 in my mind at least, because from there, Sabalenka turns up the power to clinch the game and Jabeur must now aerve to stay in the set. *Jabeur 4-4 Sabalenka If feels like we\u2019re settling for a tiebreak now, Jabeur easily taking a net exchange for 40-0. So Sabalenka disburses a pair of vaporising backhands for 40-15, then another for 40-30, while Mac reminds us that in Paris, only Alcaraz and Cerundolo hit bigger forehands than her on average. But with pressure increasing, Jabeur finds a service winner, and the players are cancelling each other out for now. Jabeur 3-4 Sabalenka* Sabalenka could use an easy hold and she gets one, to love. Her first serve is such a weapon, and she\u2019s giving her second plenty too. *Jabeur 3-3 Sabalenka A fine lob from Sabalenka gives her 0-15, but at 30-15 she\u2019s wrongfooted by a glorious backhand cross-court and Jabeur, in charge of this match without anything to show for it, holds to 30. Jabeur 2-3 Sabalenka* Now then. At 15-all, Jabeur plays a gorgeous slice from behind her that draws Sabalenka to the net \u2026 so she can be passed with a whipped forehand cross-court. And when Saba goes long and wide on a backhand down the line, Ons, who\u2019s the better player currently, has two break points. The first is quickly yanked back via gibongous serve and clean-up forehand \u2026 whereas the second needs a further drop to secure confiscation. Sabalenka then makes advantage with an ace, but then Jabeur again chips her return to get into the point, this time taking it with a forehand winner. From there, we go backwards and forwards to and from deuce before, after nine or so minutes, Sabalenka punishes a backhand winner down the line to clinch her hold \u2013 but she\u2019s finding them harder to achieve than Jabeur. *Jabeur 2-2 Sabalenka \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful stroke,\u201d says the man with the greatest hands tennis has ever seen, Mac purring over a gorgeous backhand from Sabalenka that makes 15-all. But Jabeur is playing with suck confidence, taking a forehand out of the air for 30-15 when she might\u2019ve let it bounce and securing the game with a booming serve. Jabeur 1-2 Sabalenka* Ooooh yeah! A gorgeous wrongfooting backhand from Jabeur breaks the sideline for 0-15, but Sabalenka quickly wins two pints and sends down a brutal serve \u2026 only to find herself passed at the net a shot later! Ons is into this now! And when she chips a return to get into the next point, Saba goes wide on the backhand to hand over a first break point, which she saves with one colossal serve and two juddering groundstrokes, one off each flank, racket brandished like nunchucks. From there, it takes a while for her to secure her hold, but eventually she does, a big backhand and serve doing the business. *Jabeur 1-1 Sabalenka At 15-0, Jabeur nets a forehand then offers a chance with a weak second serve, but Sabalenka thwacks a backhand down the line into the tape; in comms, Mac notes the reduced pace too, saying she\u2019ll not want to offer to many looks at that delivery. Jabeur then plays a good forehand to the corner only to net her half-volley, then here comes another second serve \u2026 and Sabalenka sticks her return onto the baseline, Jabeur unable to respond. Mac suggests she take a bit of pace off the first go to make sure she lands it, but break point down, she rustles up a hold, and already this is shaping up, the power and artistry on another level to that on show in our first tussle. Jabeur 0-1 Sabalenka* A nice, confident start from Sabalenka, who holds to love. She\u2019s no longer someone you might catch early doors, and that\u2019s a confidence issue not a skill issue. Right, we\u2019re good to go \u2013 Sabalenka to serve. Our players are with us, knocking up. Something else I love about these two: how much they love competing. Sounds simple because who doesn\u2019t like playing sport, especially if you\u2019re amazing at it, but on court the pressure is such that it can be hard to have fun, and the slog is such that it cab become like any other job. But both Jabeur and Sabalenka radiate passion, which suffuses everything they do, and if both bring it today we\u2019re in for an absolute treat. Jabeur v Sabalenka, then. I can\u2019t lie, I absolutely adore both of these, the fragility of Sabalenka\u2019s power and fire of Jabeur\u2019s desire. The question is not dissimilar to yesterday\u2019s: can Ons get inside the hitting to dictate, or will Saba hit through her? I think Saba has more variety of angle than Rybakina does, but if she\u2019s put under similar pressure, she\u2019ll have to fight herself to deliver it. Vondrousova, though, played a superb match, her variation of speed, spin, angle and trajectory asking questions to which Svitolina had no answers. To miss as much time as she did and come back to do this evidences a serious devotion; as her tatt says, \u201cNo rain, no flowers\u201d. Back to Svitolina, though, what an effort from her. She\u2019s given us everything and remains one of the heroes of 2023, an example to us all of dignity, integrity, principle and skill. She\u2019s a far better player now than before, and given more time, there\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t see her improve even more. Coming up next: Ons Jabeur [6] v Aryna Sabalenka [2]. Vondrousova can\u2019t believe what she\u2019s done and really happy. She praises Svitolina as a great fighter and person then confides that she was \u201ccrazy nervous\u201d the whole match. When she was broken twice in set two, she tried to stay focused, and having missed six months as she did last year, you never know if you\u2019ll be the same when you return \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the mental toll that must take \u2013 so she\u2019s delighted to be back healthy. Last year, she was in plaster watching her best friend play qualies, now she\u2019s got her friends here and she thinks her family may come for the final. Let\u2019s hope so, she\u2019s earnt that. What an effort from Vondrousova, who played a terrific tactical match having barely won a grass-court match in her career before this fortnight. Svitolina departs to an standing ovation and rightly so \u2013 she\u2019s lit up our world this last month \u2013 and I can\u2019t wait to see how she develops from here. Svitolina 3-6 3-6 Vondrousova* Surely Vondrousova isn\u2019t letting this slip a second time?! Well she quickly makes 30-0 \u2026 only to serve up a double, her sixth of the match and at the worst time yet, then nets for 30-all. But an ace raises match point, Svitolina goes long for what feels like the infinitieth time of the match, and Vondrousova is into the Wimbledon final! *Svitolina 3-6 3-5 Vondrousova Yup, Svitolina is at four winners and 13 unforced errors for the set, which is to say she\u2019s not playing especially well, it\u2019s just that Vondrousova\u2019s level has dropped. As such, it\u2019s no great surprise when we reach 15-40, nor when Svitolina rams an inside-out forehand wide. Vondrousova is a hold from the Wimbledon final! Svitolina 3-6 3-4 Vondrousova* Now then! A Svitolina winner, then a netted forehand, and the break-back is two points away! Vondrousova, though, finds a service winner down the middle, then Svitolina goes long on the forehand. But when a volley drifts wide, she has a point for 3-4 \u2026 which Vondrousova saves, only to reach advantage and send down a double, the third time she\u2019s done that with the game on her racket; P-R-E-S-S-U-R-E. Shonuff, two further errors from the Czech cede the break and this is a whole nother match now! Thing is, it\u2019s been Vondrousova losing the rallies more than Svitolina winning them, so though momentum has shifted, for the match to tilt it\u2019ll need something more from the chaser\u2026 \u201cThis is turning into the first meeting of Terry-Thomas and Ian Carmichael in School for Scoundrels,\u201d writes Simon McMahon, \u201cwhich unsurprisingly was No. 1 in the top 15 tennis film scenes on the Guardian website today. Hard cheese for Svitolina I\u2019m afraid. Maybe she\u2019ll get a rematch next year\u2026\u201d *Svitolina 3-6 2-4 Vondrousova Lovely from Svitolina, a swift love hold, clinched with a canny drop, keeping her in the match. She might\u2019ve left it too late, but Vondrousova will be feeling it now, and when that happens, anything can happen. Svitolina 3-6 1-4 Vondrousova* I don\u2019t know if the emotion of the occasion has got to Svitolina because she started well enough; perhaps it crept in as Vondrousova started to play, or perhaps she\u2019s struggling with how to respond to a unique style. It certainly looks like one player has a plan and the other doesn\u2019t, but we see signs of life from Svito here as she forces her way to deuce, though when she finally makes break point she can do nothing as an ace shrieks past her racket. But what\u2019s this?! Svitolina is hitting it better now, going for her shots, and when Vondrousova goes wide on the backhand, she\u2019s clawed back a break! Can she make something of it? *Svitolina 3-6 0-4 Vondrousova It\u2019s six games in a row for Vondrousova now, and Svitolina absolutely must take this one. She gets to 30-0, then her opponent finds a glorious oblique angle on a forehand cross-court for a winner and we wind up at 40-30, Vondrousova punishing a forehand then laying a drop for a simple putaway that raises deuce. She\u2019s absolutely flowing here, and when Svitolina shanks a backhand cross-court going for too much trying to force the issue, she\u2019s a point away from a decisive double break. But Svitolina saves herself \u2026 only to see herself passed from the net before being sent out wide next point \u2026 only to see Vondrousova miss her clean-up with loads of open court at which to aim. If she loses, that\u2019ll be the shot she remembers, reckons Martina \u2013 though, as I type that, she nets her return of a tame serve when up advantage. No matter: Svitolina sticks a forehand wide then a backhand into the net, and this is, I\u2019m afraid, did. Svitolina 3-6 0-3 Vondrousova* Vondousova hauls Svitolina to the net then lobs her \u2013 a classic and classy move from a player who\u2019s absolutely flying \u2013 cementing her break with a love hold. And, for extra aggravation, Svitolina challenges an ace that was indeed out, only for the game to be secured with a second serve service winner. I hate to say it and, having watched Svito\u2019s comebacks baulk at saying it, but this match looks over. Vondrousova is so solid. *Svitolina 3-6 0-2 Vondrousova Svitolina badly needs a hold here, and if I\u2019m Vondrousova I\u2019m making her play as many balls as I can. Shonuff, in a longer rally she again goes long, then at 30-15 Vondrousova tries a drop \u2013 not a particularly good one \u2013 and running in, she nets. A double follows, and on break point, the crowd try lifting Svitolina, who puts away a volley when she looks marooned at the net; Vondrousova went for a lob when a pass looked the better option. No matter, on deuce, Svitolina looks to have put the ball in the corner, only to see it chased down and sent back via squash-shot drop for a clean winner! That\u2019s incredible from Vondrousova, and another error from her opponent means she\u2019s four holds away from the Wimbledon final! Svitolina 3-6 0-1 Vondrousova* Vondrousova is feeling herself, a perfect one-two punch of serve out wide then forehand into the opposite corner delivering the first point of the set. She holds to 15 and Svitolina looks forlorn now, swiping a backhand long and wide on game point; she really needs to up her power and intensity, or this match and opportunity will be gone. *Svitolina 3-6 Vondrousova OH MY DAYS! Down 0-30, Svitolina sends Vondrousova from one corner to t\u2019other, and from the forehand side, she produces the most glorious squash shot you\u2019ll ever see, scything cross-court \u2013 usually they go line \u2013 and dipping over the net for a clean winner. That\u2019s every bit as good a shot as Rublev\u2019s on Sunday, though not on as crucial a point, and it helps Vondrousova reach advantage and set point \u2026 which Svitolina surrenders tamely, a decent serve setting up the point only for her to go long from the net. That\u2019s a third break in a row, and the first set to Vondrousova! Svitolina has work to do, because she\u2019s playing miles off her best. Svitolina 3-5 Vondrousova* Well she\u2019s got new balls to help her and they do, a love hold putting her a game away from the set in a match that hasn\u2019t yet ignited. *Svitolina 3-4 Vondrousova BBC change the channel on which they\u2019re showing the match and in the time it takes me to find it again, Vondrousova has 15-4- having just slipped; she\u2019s fine. And seconds later, she\u2019s better than fine because Svitolina larrups a forehand long, meaning we\u2019ve a third break on the spin. Can she press home the advantage this time\"? Svitolina 3-3 Vondrousova* A backhand into the net gives Svitolina 0-15 and a double puts Vondrousova in a spot of bother. So she delivers an ace then a drop-pass combo move \u2026 then another double! She then saves break-back point with a terrific drop that dips over the net and swerves out of court, but two more errors and we\u2019re back level which is, I\u2019m afraid to say, very poor. She\u2019s handed back the advantage without demanding that her opponent hit a single winner. *Svitolina 2-3 Vondrousova Now then. Vondrousova takes pace off via slice and makes 0-30, then gets a second serve to attack. And when Svitolina goes long with a nondescript forehand \u2013 in fairness, because she didn\u2019t read the shot before \u2013 she\u2019s facing three break points. And Vondrousova only needs one, coaxing a forehand winner down the line! First blood to the Czech! Svitolina 2-2 Vondrousova* Vondrousova, who\u2019s never played on Centre \u2013 \u201cMakes your knees shake a bit,\u201d says Martina \u2013 has a helluva high ball-toss, and not that much pop on her serve. She gets to 40-15, though, then sticks a shot into the corner \u2026 only for Svitolina to power a backhand winner down the line, on the run. But then she nets a return, and the early jousting continues. \u201cThis match could be really dull,\u201d says Calvin Betton, our resident coach. \u201cWill just depend if Svitolina holds her nerve really.\u201d *Svitolina 2-1 Vondrousova A step-in return fro Vondrousova prompts Svitolina to net for 30-15, but she can\u2019t do anything with the foothold. Svitolina is hitting it harder, earlier and from further into court, dictating the play; Vondrousova hasn\u2019t found her rhythm yet. Svitolina 1-1 Vondrousova* Vondrousova serve volleys for 15-0, then slices a slow but perfectly directed ace out wide. She holds to 15. \u201cSvitolina has already beaten four slam champions to reach the semis,\u201d emails Shankar Mony. \u201cVenus, Kenin, Azarenka and Swiatek. If she goes all the way she might have to beat Sabalenka too. What is the most grand slam champions a player has beaten in a draw?\u201d I\u2019d be shocked if it was more than that because there can\u2019t ever have been more winners around than there are now. In my lifetime watching tennis, there\u2019ve mainly been dominant champs winning almost everything \u2013 Martina, Steffi, Monica, Martina, Venus, Serena \u2013 it\u2019s only relatively recently that the bigguns have been snaffled by all sorts. *Svitolina 1-0 Vondrousova (*denotes server) Down 30-0, Vondrousova slices and the ball clambers over the tape to get her into the match. In comms, Samia Mirza notes how effective that shot is for lefties; \u201cWe\u2019re born with it,\u201d adds Martina. But from there, Svitolina closes out, and looks really comfy out there. Right, off we go \u2013 Svitolina to serve. Today\u2019s Cliff rig: They\u2019ve not yet found my mum. Vondousova, meanwhile, has her own story \u2013 of course she does. One of her tattoos reads \u201cNo rain, no flowers\u201d, and she had a terrible time with injury last season. But she\u2019s here now, and if she can find her forehand, she\u2019s a serious threat today. And here come our players! The roof is closed, which is just as well because it\u2019s raining in SW19 \u2013 though of course not in fabulous North London \u2013 and on outside courts, there\u2019s no current action. Sam Smith notes that Svitolina is hitting the ball harder than ever before \u2013 perhaps because she\u2019s had a break \u2013 on the forehand and second serve in particular. And Clijsters points out that she hits a lot with Gael Monfils, her husband, and you\u2019re doing that as a woman, you\u2019ve got to up the pop to stay in rallies. Kim Clijsters didn\u2019t win a major until she was a mother, and explains that having a child, gives you some perspective. She also says the time off allowed her to heal up some old injuries and work on some stuff \u2013 when she came back a couple of years later, she\u2019d never felt fitter. I cannot begin to describe my admiration for what Svitolina is doing. Just an absolutely incredible, powerful, urgent woman. Hello and welcome to Wimbledon 2023 \u2013 day 11! In the 1988 FA Cup, the two semi-finals featured Liverpool v Nottingham Forest and Luton Town v Wimbledon, which is to say that, before the games took place, it appeared certain that the winner would come from the first tie \u2026 except sport isn\u2019t like that. Once the players are out on the grass, stuff happens \u2013 one of the main reasons we love it so much \u2013 and in the entire history of human competition, nothing has ever been less predictable \u2013 and in many ways, more fun \u2013 than women\u2019s tennis is right now. On the face of things, our matches today are just like those ones were: it\u2019s almost inconceivable that either Marketa Vondrousova or Elina Svitolina has the game to see off either Ons Jabeur or Aryna Sabalenka. But first things first: before we consider tomorrow, let\u2019s deal with today. Vondrousova is an excellent all-round player, eliminating a seed in every round bar the first. She\u2019s already made a major final, at Roland-Garros in 2019, and her crafty lefty solidity makes her a difficult opponent on any surface. Svitolina, meanwhile, is already one of the stories of the year, giving birth in October, returning to the tour three months later, and making the last eight in Paris \u2013 all the while contending with the fear, anger and desolation prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of her native Ukraine. To reach this stage, she\u2019s dismissed a serious collection of talent \u2013 Venus Williams, Elise Mertens, Sofia Kenin, Victoria Azarenka and Iga Swiatek \u2013 and is fired by a fervour that is difficult to stop. She\u2019s not the only one. Ons Jabeur isn\u2019t just competing for herself but for an entire constituency of Arab women, underrepresented in tennis, sport and many other fields besides. Her desperation to win a Grand Slam moves us never mind her, and the momentum she\u2019s built in first demolishing Petra Kvitova, then coming back to despatch Elena Rybakina \u2013 who edged her in last year\u2019s final \u2013 assures her that, like Eastenders\u2019 Irene and Troy, her time is now. Problem being, across the net from her will stand Sabalenka who, until January of this year, was consumed by the same heartache. But then she won in Australia, meaning Jabeur\u2019s blend of power and guile must overcome not just her concoction of power and power but her security and equilibrium: she knows she can win a biggie, and even if she never does again, it\u2019s not the end of the world because she already has. If both players turn up we\u2019ll be talking about one of the sporting encounters of the year, and after that, anything can happen \u2013 as the other Wimbledon proved 35 years ago.

The most indefatigable agent of American intelligence, played as always by Tom Cruise, has a formidable new foe in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh installment in the movie series based on the TV series. It\u2019s not a who but a what: a computer virus with a mind of its own, crunching numbers so efficiently that it can anticipate the good guy\u2019s every move. The deck seems stacked against Ethan. But then, doesn\u2019t it always? Beating unbeatable odds is his whole thing. It\u2019s an average Tuesday for him, and the ultimate appeal of this series, whose very title is a challenge Ethan always rises (and climbs, and runs, and sweats, and nearly plummets to his death) to meet. The truly improbable victory in Dead Reckoning belongs not to Hunt, whose skin-of-his-teeth survival is all but guaranteed by the \u201cpart one\u201d in the title, but to the Mission: Impossible franchise itself. More than 25 years after Cruise refashioned a small-screen spy story into a big-screen action vehicle for himself, how are these movies still so good? Dead Reckoning may not be the best Mission: Impossible, but that\u2019s only because the bar has been set as high as the various skyscrapers and aircraft cabins from which Hunt inevitably hangs. It\u2019s the best Hollywood franchise we have. And like its sixtysomething star, it\u2019s showing surprisingly few signs of wear and tear. There are no bad Mission: Impossible movies. No, not even John Woo\u2019s Y2K entry, M:I-2, which hard boils the tricky suspense mechanics of Brian De Palma\u2019s 1996 original into an action thriller of sublimely mounting absurdities, a bullet opera in the key of Notorious. There are those who love Woo\u2019s balletically soapy take on Mission: Impossible best. They\u2019re no more wrong than those who prefer the third movie, with its chilling Philip Seymour Hoffman villain. Or the fourth, with its daisy chain of Pixarian obstacles and world\u2019s-tallest-building ascent. Or any of the three directed by Christopher McQuarrie, which have managed to serialize Hunt\u2019s feats of high-wire espionage without depriving them of their self-contained fun. Every M:I is an ingenious contraption and an antidote to blockbuster bloat, streamlining the world-saving business of your average summer movie into a series of expertly staged set pieces, many of them built around Cruise\u2019s who-needs-a-stunt-double game of chicken with his own mortality. They\u2019re dumb in a smart way, or maybe vice versa: accept their lapses in logic, and they have a way of buzzing your brain with the audacity of their compounding complications. That they scarcely demand investment in the characters, even Cruise\u2019s, is a feature, not a bug. Each courts a more primal investment, the constant present-tense urgency of their races against the clock. Is there any other running franchise that so fully and consistently earns the adjective \u201cHitchcockian\u201d? No surprise that M:I fits the bill, given that its inaugural entry was directed by De Palma, the master of suspense\u2019s most eager disciple. Breaking from the reigning trends in Hollywood action cinema these past three decades, Mission: Impossible is less about killing than a nerve-racking flirtation with death. Hunt may drop a few bodies for his country and his species, but he\u2019s much more likely to put his own at perpetual risk; most of the centerpiece sequences of Mission: Impossible are triumphs of suspense, not violence. They sometimes even revolve around minimizing casualties, as when Hunt has to think of a way to bust his arch-nemesis out of captivity in part six, Fallout, without killing any innocent guards. M:I\u2019s unlikely creative consistency is especially surprising given how much turnover the series has seen across its lifespan. Cruise is the only cast member who appears in every entry; the makeup of his squad of sidekicks has changed constantly over the years, actors coming and going with each sequel. The creative team changes, too \u2013 or it used to, at least, before McQuarrie settled in with 2015\u2019s Rogue Nation. Until then, M:I existed in a state of constant stylistic reinvention, a different film-maker merging his preoccupations with Cruise\u2019s each time. That makes this the rare Hollywood series that\u2019s at once a revolving door of behind-the-camera talent and a dependable source of auteuristic personality \u2013 a director\u2019s franchise as much as a star\u2019s. Of course, the constant is Cruise. His star power, renewed through the lengths he\u2019s willing to go to preserve it, anchors the series. Hunt may not be much of a character by standard definition \u2013 he\u2019s more cipher than complicated man \u2013 but he\u2019s an ideal avatar for Cruise\u2019s commitment to generating thrills through the lunacy of practical stunt work. Conflating his own determination (and blithely disregarded safety) with that of his character, the actor treats each movie like a mad race against the very concept of acting your age. It\u2019s not so much that the stunts get more precarious every time. It\u2019s that Cruise gets older, and the stakes go up accordingly. He can\u2019t stop. Mission: Impossible has never been entirely immune to trends. If the crunch of Limp Bizkit on a soundtrack didn\u2019t prove that already, the Endgame-biting inconclusiveness of Dead Reckoning should. But the movies have held onto their values, their spy-thriller formula, pioneered by De Palma\u2019s original and molded into different shapes with each successive sequel. Their appeal is largely standalone, give or take a loose plot thread: when you watch a Mission: Impossible movie, you\u2019re dangling right there in the breathtaking moment with Cruise, not waiting for a cameo or callback, not hoping for a preview of a coming installment. And when someone, say, hangs from a rising airplane, there\u2019s an extra jolt of shivery anxiety in the knowledge that what you\u2019re seeing wasn\u2019t achieved solely through the click of a mouse. Cruise, in the lead-up to Dead Reckoning\u2019s release, promised that he plans to keep making Mission: Impossible movies well into his 80s. That could be a recipe for tragedy: even the most thetan-purged movie star might eventually reach his limit or the base-jumping point of no return. But if the last seven movies in the series are any indication, it probably won\u2019t be a recipe for diminishing returns. A movie franchise that still delivers five decades on? The odds are in Cruise\u2019s favor, however unbeatable they might seem."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b81", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/13/parents-in-huw-edwards-case-offered-tens-of-thousands-for-talktv-interview", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Parents in Huw Edwards case \u2018offered tens of thousands for TalkTV interview\u2019", "lead": "Interview with couple understood to have been recorded for broadcast on sister TV station of the Sun", "author": "Jim Waterson Media editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:07:18", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099172", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/99ad6415b72e7b69f85d66476d75076c83c6dce5/0_199_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK has offered tens of thousands of pounds to the parents who made allegations about Huw Edwards, in return for a television interview, according to sources at the media company. The Guardian understands that an interview with the couple has been recorded and is being edited for broadcast on TalkTV, the sister station of the Sun. Sources said the parents have been offered a significant sum for this. The parents claimed their 20-year-old child was taken advantage of by Edwards, 61, who they alleged paid the young person \u00a335,000 in return for explicit pictures. The police have concluded Edwards has no criminal case to answer but an internal BBC inquiry is investigating the allegations and separate claims against the News at Ten host. The Sun\u2019s first story on the allegations, which prompted the BBC to suspend Edwards from his \u00a3435,000-a-year job, said the mother and stepfather in question had made \u201cit clear they wanted no payment\u201d in return for bringing the accusations to the tabloid. An editorial in Monday\u2019s print edition of the Sun emphasised that the issue was not about money for the family: \u201cThey did not seek any payment. They just wanted the payments harming their child to stop.\u201d Edwards\u2019 wife, Vicky Flind, confirmed on Wednesday that he was the BBC presenter at the centre of the allegations, following five days of anonymous accusations. She said the presenter was in a hospital with mental health issues. Since then the Sun has pledged to dial back its reporting and said it will not seek to break further stories on the topic. A source at News UK said the Sun had not made any financial payment to the couple but confirmed that TalkTV was speaking to them as part of a planned three-part documentary series. The television channel has a reputation for paying large sums of money to secure interviews. The parents, who have not been publicly identified, could not be reached for comment. The Sun has rowed back on its initial suggestion that illegal underage activity could have taken place and insists its story was always about concerned parents. The 20-year-old at the heart of the story has dismissed their mother and stepfather\u2019s suggestions of illegal behaviour as \u201crubbish\u201d. News of the potential TalkTV interviews comes as BBC News continues to investigate its own star presenter. Sources in the BBC newsroom claimed the Newsnight host Victoria Derbyshire had been \u201ctaking initial soundings\u201d in relation to claims against Edwards in the days before the Sun released its original story. On Wednesday night Derbyshire made the first allegations of potential wrongdoing in the workplace, with a story claiming Edwards had messaged three young BBC employees, including one who is still at the organisation. BBC News journalists are understood to be working on further potential stories on Edwards, even while the BBC\u2019s corporate investigations conducts its own parallel inquiry. The BBC had already published a separate story about Edwards \u2013 who was at that point still anonymous \u2013 allegedly sending abusive and threatening messages to a person he met on a dating app. The person, in their 20s, is said to have hinted they could post publicly about the presenter. The corporation has also received some criticism from friends of Edwards over the coverage of its most prominent presenter. The former BBC journalist Jon Sopel, now a host of the News Agents podcast, said he had \u201cbeen struck by how many of my former BBC colleagues, some very senior, have been in touch to express their anger and dismay at their own coverage of this\u201d. Sopel told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that he had been in touch with Edwards since the story broke and the suspended presenter was \u201cnot overly impressed\u201d with the BBC\u2019s coverage of the incident. The focus of the story is now shifting to the BBC\u2019s internal investigation. A spokesperson for the BBC said its official inquiry into Edwards would concentrate on \u201cfact finding\u201d, with the corporation also likely to consider separate allegations of potential workplace misconduct that are not of a criminal nature. The BBC said the focus would be on ensuring due process and a thorough assessment of the facts while \u201ccontinuing to be mindful of our duty of care to all involved\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b82", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/13/alan-bull-obituary", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Alan Bull obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Renowned microbiologist who chaired an OECD working party on biotechnology and industrial sustainability", "author": "Mike Goodfellow", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:06:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099191", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5d522dee89f7156d36c71c1ec1731ae2dab365ba/0_174_1255_753/500.jpg", "body": "My friend and colleague Alan Bull, who has died aged 87, was an internationally renowned microbiologist and pioneer of biotechnology, developing procedures that opened up new approaches to studying microbial ecology and pathogenicity. Such developments led to Alan chairing an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development working party on the potential of biotechnology for industrial sustainability (1996-98). Collaboration was central to Alan\u2019s work. Together with Ian Swingland, a conservation biology professor at the University of Kent, where Alan spent most of his career, he was a founding trustee in 1989 of the Durrell Trust for Conservation Biology, and in 1992 launched a new journal, Biodiversity and Conservation, which is still going strong. Latterly (1988-2020) he headed an international team that included myself, as well as professors from Chile, Germany and Japan, among others, which discovered many new antibiotics, notably the abbysomicins (natural products that have anti-tubercular and anti-cancer properties and are active against HIV), from actinomycete bacteria found in extreme habitats ranging from deep-sea sediments of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench to extreme hyper-arid soils in the Chilean Central Andes. Alan was honoured to have three microbial species named after him. Born in Bretby, Derbyshire, to working-class parents, Thomas Bull, a picture-framer, and Selena Morgan, a Welshwoman who worked in a grocer\u2019s, Alan had a happy childhood. After Burton-on-Trent boys\u2019 school he studied botany at the University of Nottingham and stayed on to complete a PhD (1961). In 1959 Alan met Jennifer Kaye, a zoology student, on a university expedition to the French Alps. They married in 1963, the year Jenny completed her PhD prior to working as a biology teacher. Alan held academic positions at the University of London, Bedford (1961-64) and Queen Elizabeth (1964-70) Colleges, the University of Kent (1970-76) and University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (1976-81), with a year from 1968 at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, as a Fulbright fellow. In 1982 he returned to Kent as professor and head of the biological laboratory, then as research professor (1998-2003), and emeritus professor of microbial biology. His talents as a teacher and mentor led to many of his PhD students and postdoctoral fellows embarking on highly successful careers across the world. Alan was an enthusiastic polymath, widely read and travelled, with a love of opera, Japanese gardens and hiking. He was as fun-loving as he was erudite. A passionate supporter of the arts, he continued to sing for the university choir after retirement. At heart Alan identified with the cultural and political values of south Welsh communities and was overjoyed to be elected to the Learned Society of Wales in 2017. Alan is survived by Jenny, their daughter, Rachel, son, Adam, and a grandson, Vincent."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b83", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/13/want-a-lazy-girl-job-its-nice-work-if-you-can-get-it", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Want a \u2018lazy girl job\u2019?

Who can blame them?, 9 July), although, as a millennial who hasn\u2019t figured out TikTok yet, I wasn\u2019t aware of the trend. Like quiet quitting last year, I applaud it. I left my corporate career a year ago to go freelance, after 17 years spanning two employers and several promotions. I had no hobbies left, barely did any exercise, and I had no time or energy to cook properly for myself or my family \u2013 things I previously enjoyed. To anyone who can get a \u201clazy girl job\u201d that \u2013 while it may not provide fulfilment \u2013 pays enough, can be done without excessive stress and doesn\u2019t violate their personal values, I would say that is living the dream. Find fulfilment in hobbies, activities, volunteering, family and friends, and just work to live. Perfect. The piece states: \u201cThe posters appear to be unanimously women \u2013 I\u2019ve seen no evidence of a \u2018lazy boy jobs\u2019 hashtag.\u201d I suspect this isn\u2019t a trend for men because many men mastered the art of elegantly doing the bare minimum to serve the life they want a long time ago. My husband and male friends keep that level of deep-dive discussion for sport wherever possible, proving they are comfortable spending their friend time and energy on things they find fulfilling outside work. Helen Wood Stretford, Greater Manchester \u2022 I must admit that I find myself quite torn between a genuine hatred for hustle culture (we run a four-day working week at the marketing agency I co-founded) and a mild distrust of concepts such as quiet quitting and lazy girl jobs. Hustle culture is a straightforward enemy \u2013 it\u2019s a symptom of late-stage capitalism that isn\u2019t healthy for humans, the planet, nor companies looking for a sustainable workforce. But the ethos that undergirds quiet quitting and lazy girl jobs is also somewhat problematic. As someone who employs a young and diverse team, it just doesn\u2019t feel fair to our clients, nor our broader team, if someone is willingly phoning it in. Such behaviour puts more work on to the plates of their colleagues and breaks the promise we make to our clients \u2013 to deliver for them. I suppose my hope is that we can find a good balance between these polarities. Paul David CEO, Literal Humans \u2022 I don\u2019t think they should be called lazy girl jobs but rather \u201cwork/life balance jobs\u201d. After working for more than 40 years in a stressful profession, my advice to anyone would be do whatever makes your life easy so you can really enjoy your friends, family or pursue interests, as you\u2019ll never get that time back. Janet McCormack Great Sankey, Cheshire \u2022 Could Daisy Jones please direct me towards these lazy girl jobs she writes about? Particularly those that involve \u201cmaking a few coffees, gossiping idly and taking home generous tips\u201d. Having worked in the industry myself, from washing dishes to managing hospitality, my experience is of rushing around from dawn to dusk, flopping on the sofa when I get home, and tips are non-existent. As for the pay, on top of my full-time job, I work around another 20 hours a month in a second job to cover the bills. Maybe this sounds chippy, but I can\u2019t help feeling the article reflects an attitude from the middle classes who flirt with such roles while at university.

England are widely considered to be on the easier side of the draw, in the opposite half to France, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa \u2013 the top four sides in the world \u2013 and would avoid those teams until the semi-finals. Last weekend\u2019s opening matches of the Rugby Championship only highlighted the disparity, with New Zealand thumping Argentina, who are in England\u2019s pool, and South Africa thrashing Eddie Jones\u2019s Australia \u2013 potential quarter-final opponents for Steve Borthwick\u2019s side. On Saturday the All Blacks host the Springboks and Australia\u2019s match against Argentina is very much the undercard to the main event in Auckland, despite it being Jones\u2019s homecoming. Sinfield said England\u2019s coaches had watched last weekend\u2019s Rugby Championship matches \u2013 as well as a fixture between a Japan XV and an All Blacks XV in Tokyo last Saturday. But asked about England\u2019s luck with the draw, he said: \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not bothered at all who we play or what the draw is. We\u2019ll get the best out of this team. Whoever we have to face, we have to face, whenever that is. This management team and our players have had nothing to do with the draw. We can only do what we can do and we spend all our time trying to make us better each day. What will be will be. \u201cYou would expect us to be studying. We all watch the games, they were two fantastic games and I would also add that the Japan game against the All Blacks XV was a game we looked at. At the forefront of our minds at the minute are the players we have got here and trying to ensure we prepare them as best we can so they are ready to go. But also whilst there is an opportunity \u2013 there are some good international games taking place with some fantastic players, with some teams that we could face at some stage \u2013 it is important to have a look at them.\u201d South Africa\u2019s 43-12 victory over Australia was all the more impressive because the Springboks were without a host of senior players who were absent with an eye on the New Zealand fixture. \u201cThey\u2019ve got unbelievable depth,\u201d added Sinfield. \u201cBut ultimately it will be 15 v 15, won\u2019t it? They can\u2019t bring any more on if we get to play against them. That\u2019s a long way down the track \u201cI thought the games were really entertaining at the weekend. We learned some bits.

After days of speculation, Edwards was named on Wednesday by his wife, Vicky Flind, as the subject of Sun allegations that an unnamed BBC presenter had paid a 17-year-old for explicit photos. On Wednesday, just before Flind identified her husband, police said Edwards had no criminal case to answer and the Sun has since backtracked, claiming it never intended to allege criminality. Edwards, who Flind said is in hospital with \u201cserious mental health issues\u201d, used his Twitter account to like a tweet suggesting the Sun could now \u201cface the mother of all libel actions\u201d. Another potential action would be for breach of privacy. However, Godwin Busuttil, who acted for Cliff Richard, said his view was that Edwards did not have a strong claim. Busuttil represented Richard in his successful claim for damages for breach of privacy after the BBC revealed he was the subject of a police investigation into alleged historical sexual offences, which were later dismissed as false. The barrister said: \u201cThe big obstacle for any such complaint is going to be number one, [the argument that] we didn\u2019t identify him and no reasonable person could have known who it was and [number two], you\u2019ve identified yourself, or through your wife. \u201cIf you look carefully at her statement, what it says is this: \u2018this statement is issued on behalf of Huw Edwards\u2019. One argument that\u2019s going to be run by the Sun if any complaint \u2026 is made is going to be that insofar as damage has been done to you, it\u2019s been done by you.\u201d Busuttil, a barrister at 5RB chambers, said that even if Edwards were identifiable, the Sun might be able to rely on other defences. While the suggestion of criminal behaviour has been quashed by police, there is protection under section 4 of the Defamation Act for publications believed at the time to be in the public interest, even if they turn out to be untrue. There are caveats and the claim that the young person in question denied the story to the tabloid prior to publication would not help the Sun\u2019s case if true. Much of the basis for the Sun\u2019s reporting remains unknown, as does the chain of events and causation. The claimant must also prove serious harm in defamation cases and to that end it is notable that Sun sources have said that the BBC\u2019s investigation was prompted by the parents rather than its reporting. With respect to privacy, the Richard case and a subsequent supreme court case involving Bloomberg established that media organisations had no right to publish the identity of someone subject to a police investigation before they have been charged with any offence. But Busuttil said there appeared to have been no substantive police investigation in Edwards\u2019 case. The Bloomberg case also referred to investigations by a \u201cstate organ\u201d. Another lawyer the Guardian spoke to said there was a debate to be had as to whether the BBC would fall into this category. While the right to privacy has trumped newspapers\u2019 freedom of information in a series of cases, Busuttil said the Sun could make a public interest argument on the basis of Edwards\u2019 renown and the fact that \u201ceven if he hasn\u2019t done anything criminal, he\u2019s done things which at least so far as are being reported seem pretty questionable\u201d. But he maintained that identification was the main point. David Banks, a media law consultant, concurred. \u201cI can\u2019t recall a case where someone has said: you set the rabbit running that led to my identification [on social media],\u201d said Banks. \u201cThe thing is, watching on social media, people want the Sun to be liable.\u201d But, like Busuttil, he doubted whether Edwards, with his current reported state of health, would have the appetite for a lengthy, costly, and potentially damaging libel claim."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b86", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/13/spotlight-on-reynolds-review-kenwood-house-london", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Spotlight on Reynolds review \u2013 superficial portraits by a well-connected hack", "lead": "One of his paintings recently sold for \u00a350m \u2013 but William Blake was right when he said Reynolds \u2018depressed art\u2019, as this show demonstrates all too well", "author": "Jonathan Jones", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:56:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099301", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f90215a5aa403978e9e0a408e6a298ff2ef3dede/0_132_2943_1765/500.jpg", "body": "The countess stands above you, caressed by rose-tinted lace, putting her foot forward under her pink skirts as if dancing, but her face administers a sharp sting of authority. This painting, which hangs in a stately home on the edge of Hampstead Heath in London, proves that 18th-century British portraits can be truly stunning works of art. The trouble is that Mary, Countess Howe is distracting me from my work, for this is a painting by Thomas Gainsborough and I am supposed to be looking at a display celebrating his contemporary, Sir Joshua Reynolds. Work? Damn right it is. It is hard to look long enough at a painting by Reynolds to form an opinion of it. You stand there trying to seem engaged while your brain is wandering off to think about the light socket on the wall or the best bus route home. It is particularly difficult to pay attention to him in this house where the Iveagh Bequest includes real masterpieces by Rembrandt and Vermeer. And most surgically annihilating to Reynolds, Gainsborough\u2019s Countess. A number of Reynolds\u2019s portraits of women hang with her in the Music Room, but they melt under her contemptuous gaze. Mrs Tollemache As Miranda is a picture of someone who clearly can\u2019t act, attempting a Shakespearean role. She just stands there waving her arms about awkwardly. It isn\u2019t her fault, it\u2019s his. Reynolds has no imagination as a painter. His idea of creating a great work of art is to dress someone in a splendid costume, place some props behind them and flatly record the scene. There is no sense that it\u2019s anything but a professional exercise. The best painting by him at Kenwood House is a self-portrait from which he gazes back at you through spectacles. He looks a saddened, anxious person \u2013 there\u2019s no fire in those myopic eyes. Why, then, is this forgettable painter getting a special English Heritage show for his 300th birthday? By all artistic justice, Reynolds ought to have slipped from our memories long ago. His contemporary William Blake raged: \u201cThis man was hired to depress art.\u201d Reynolds is still at it, still depressing art. This is for very British reasons. He invented the British art establishment and it is still loyal to him. Reynolds was the first president of the institution that protects artistic status in Britain, the Royal Academy, founded in 1768. It still pays him homage. His statue greets you in its courtyard. He is a fitting hero for the RA, which, generation after generation, has been stuffed with Reynoldses \u2013 artists whose works take up space in the Summer Exhibition regardless of quality. But now Reynolds has another institutional boost, the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s purchase, with the Getty Museum, of Reynolds\u2019s Portrait of Omai for \u00a350m. That puts Reynolds in the superstar category, way beyond his contemporaries, and competing with the likes of Damien Hirst and Lucian Freud. It is a vastly inflated value for his work as this display makes obvious. He churned out stuff of the same bland quality as Omai by the wagonload, much like a studio photographer and just as shallow. The trappings of seriousness are everywhere. Lady Diana Beauclerk sits in front of a colossal urn, a symbol of the classical tradition. She puts on a sad face with a hint of early Romanticism. Yet these effects are all on the surface. Reynolds doesn\u2019t have enough empathy with his sitters to expose their souls. He doesn\u2019t look beyond the pose. His addiction to classical decor reflects the neoclassical age when 18th-century Europe was fascinated by the freshly discovered ruins of Pompeii and Robert Adam could do you a Greek style room like the beautiful library at Kenwood. Reynolds championed a grave, ambitious neoclassical conception of art in his Discourses Delivered at the Royal Academy, one of the first British books of art theory. But his portraits are cynical hackwork as he turns his lofty principles into stylish trappings. Sophia Musters, a lover of the Prince Regent, poses as the Greek goddess Hebe, feeding ambrosia to Zeus\u2019s eagle. Who cares? As the show is scattered through the house, you can freely compare his paintings with others in this fine collection. Every other British 18th-century artist has something Reynolds lacks. George Romney\u2019s portrait of Emma Hart As \u201cthe Spinstress\u201d is one of this artist\u2019s obsessive paintings of the woman who became Lady Hamilton, and Nelson\u2019s lover: Romney obviously wishes she was his lover and she smoulders at him from under her hood. A painting by Joseph Wright of Derby depicts two girls playing, perhaps cruelly, with a cat they hold up in the sharp light of a candle, surrounded by darkness: it is a typically gripping work by this artist who, unlike the establishment London success Reynolds, was looked down on for living and working in the Midlands. Wright, Gainsborough, even Romney, have originality and personality. Their art has survived on its merits. Reynolds has endured for other reasons. Like the aristocracy, he just won\u2019t go away. As Blake recognised, something in the bones of British culture is committed to the respectability of this minor talent. \u2022 Spotlight on Reynolds is at Kenwood House, London, until 19 November."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b87", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/13/guatemala-prosecutor-suspends-party-of-anti-corruption-election-candidate", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Guatemala prosecutor suspends party of anti-corruption election candidate ", "lead": "Prosecutor suspends Movimiento Semilla after Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo unexpectedly reached second round", "author": "Tom Phillips", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:55:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099319", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/708f362f4c40189ee9729e6d972f6c001c87236f/0_189_3691_2216/500.jpg", "body": "Guatemala\u2019s presidential election has been thrown into confusion after the country\u2019s top prosecutor moved to suspend the party of a centre-left anti-corruption candidate who unexpectedly made it to the second round and officials from the attorney general\u2019s office raided the headquarters of the electoral authority. Observers had voiced fears that the Central American country\u2019s political establishment might try to force Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo from August\u2019s runoff after he unexpectedly came second in last month\u2019s vote. On Wednesday night those fears appeared to be confirmed when the prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche \u2013 who has been accused of corruption by the US \u2013 announced that Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s Movimiento Semilla (Seed Movement) was having its legal status suspended as a result of an investigation into supposed irregularities in the collection of signatures allowing the party\u2019s formation. \u201cThere are indications that more than 5,000 citizens were illegally signed up to the Seed Movement by having their writing and signatures forged,\u201d Curruchiche said. Hours later, on Thursday morning, officials from the attorney general\u2019s office raided the offices of the supreme electoral court, causing further alarm over the future of the election. The decision and Thursday\u2019s raid caused outrage in Guatemala and overseas. Dozens of Ar\u00e9valo supporters gathered outside the electoral court in Guatemala City to protest against what they called an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Ar\u00e9valo told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that his party, which was founded in 2018 amid growing public anger at political corruption, rejected the \u201cspurious and illegal decision\u201d. \u201cGuatemala will not allow a small group of corrupt and powerful people to silence its voice,\u201d the 64-year-old added on Twitter. \u201cWe are in the second round [and] on 20 August we will change our future.\u201d Brian Nichols, the US\u2019s assistant secretary for western hemisphere affairs, tweeted: \u201cWe are deeply concerned by new \u2026 threats to Guatemala\u2019s electoral democracy from Guatemala\u2019s public prosecutor. Institutions must respect the will of voters.\u201d Later on Thursday, Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s rival, former first lady Sandra Torres, announced that she was suspending her campaign in solidarity with her opponent. \u201cWe want to demonstrate our solidarity with the voters of the Seed party and also with those who came out to vote,\u201d said Torres, who won the most votes in the election\u2019s first round. \u201cAs a candidate I want to compete under equal conditions.\u201d Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Guatemala\u2019s electoral law stipulated that a political party could not be excluded once an election was under way, but said the country was passing through \u201ca scary moment\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely undemocratic. It is a clear attempt to use the judicial system to take out an increasingly powerful political rival of the establishment,\u201d Freeman said, predicting the tactic could backfire. \u201cA few weeks before the elections only 27% of Guatemalans knew who Ar\u00e9valo was. Now, they are all going to know who he is \u2026 So I do think this could ultimately strengthen him. But he still has to survive the next few weeks politically \u2013 and that is no small thing,\u201d Freeman added. Ar\u00e9valo is the son of Guatemala\u2019s first democratically elected president, Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo, giving the election huge symbolism in a region suffering a broader process of democratic deterioration. Guatemala is one of several Latin American countries to have taken an authoritarian tack in recent years, alongside El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. More than two dozen Guatemalan judges and prosecutors have been forced into exile, while activists have denounced an increase in attacks on the press. Three prominent candidates were forced from the election\u2019s first round after controversial decisions from electoral authorities. Freeman compared the manoeuvre against Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s party to recent moves to stop Venezuela\u2019s leading opposition candidate, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, taking part in next year\u2019s presidential election. Late last month Machado \u2013 a longstanding critic of Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2013 was barred from holding public office for 15 years. Another prominent opposition figure, Henrique Capriles, was slapped with a similar ban in 2017. Parallels have also been drawn with Nicaragua\u2019s 2021 presidential election, which was preceded by an unprecedented crackdown on political rivals of its authoritarian leader, Daniel Ortega. Several top opposition candidates, including Cristiana Chamorro, the daughter of the former president Violeta Chamorro, were jailed before being deported to the US in February this year. Ortega, who has held power since 2007, won the election. Ar\u00e9valo is due to face Torres in a runoff scheduled for 20 August. Torres, 67, was married to the late former president \u00c1lvaro Colom, and is fighting her third presidential election but has faced corruption allegations herself. In a statement on Thursday morning, Torres expressed concern over the events of \u201cthe last few hours\u201d and the \u201cextremely confused, disconcerting and [democratically] harmful\u201d manner in which Guatemala\u2019s electoral process was playing out."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b88", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/jul/13/letter-lorraine-tollemache-obituary", "primaryCategory": "global", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Letter: Lorraine Tollemache obituary", "lead": "<strong>Anne Allison writes: </strong>Her ability to transform young lives was very evident", "author": "Anne Allison", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:55:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099337", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e607061a6b7507b48ec4fa890317bdd32a45f436/0_494_1624_974/500.jpg", "body": "Lorraine Tollemache was truly a remarkable person.

Adayar, ridden by William Buick, was a 1-3 chance to beat only three opponents in the Group Two contest and surged into the lead, with Israr in close attendance, around three furlongs from home. He was soon labouring to keep Israr at bay, however, and while John Gosden\u2019s colt ran on well up the final slope, Adayar weakened to finish four and a half lengths adrift at the line. Israr\u2019s connections seemingly have no immediate plans to run him in a Group One and Adayar was immediately pushed out as far as 33-1 (from around 9-1) for the King George, a race he won two years ago, after his disappointing effort. \u201cWe will give it a week or 10 days and see if anything transpires,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cHe owes no one anything, he\u2019s a Derby winner. You certainly can\u2019t go to a King George or a race like that on the back of a performance like that though. \u201cI thought he would go there and put it to bed. Israr, to be fair to him, came under the pump earlier than we did and we got him at it, but Will said he just emptied as he hit the rising ground. \u201cWe will see what his vitals are like after the race, but it wasn\u2019t the ground. I\u2019m not going to use that as an excuse.\u201d The victory completed a 76-1 Group Two double for Jim Crowley, Israr\u2019s rider, after a change of tactics led to a 16-1 success for Jasour in the July Stakes. Jasour was last of the nine runners as the field reached halfway but the 16-1 chance sliced through from there before kicking two lengths clear inside the final furlong for a comfortable success. \u201cMr [Clive] Cox thought it was vital to try and miss the kick and get him to relax,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cHe did that and they went a nice easy tempo and he went through the gears nicely. I was always confident and waiting for a split and he picked up very well.\u201d The winner could now be aimed at either the Richmond Stakes at Glorious Goodwood or the Group One Prix Morny at Deauville next month. \u201cI think the key to him is riding him that way and he\u2019ll only get better,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cHe\u2019ll improve the more he learns to race that way and he\u2019s got a very potent kick, which is important.\u201d Nostrum, unraced since finishing third in last season\u2019s Dewhurst Stakes, made a belated but hugely promising start to his three-year-old campaign with a convincing success in the Listed Sir Henry Cecil Stakes later on the card. Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s colt, a son of Kingman, pulled three lengths clear of the previously unbeaten Embesto with New Endeavour another two and a quarter away in third. \u201cWe could go a mile and a quarter when we want,\u201d Stoute said afterwards. \u201cHe will tell us [if he is ready to return to Group One company] but on that evidence you would think he is. \u201cHis two-year-old career was brimful of promise. Things didn\u2019t go right in the Dewhurst, and he has come here today and won impressively. We can only be very happy as he is a nice progressive horse.\u201d Nostrum was cut to 5-1 third-favourite for the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood next month by William Hill, in a market headed by Paddington, the winner of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown five days ago. Remarquee great value to land Falmouth Via Sistina and Nashwa, aged five and four respectively, head the betting for the Group One Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket on Friday but both are dropping back from middle distances to a mile and could be vulnerable to an improving three-year-old in Remarquee. Ralph Beckett\u2019s filly did not have the maturity to cope with a big field in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket earlier in the season, finishing 15th of 20 runners, but she resumed her progress to run Tahiyra to a length in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot last month despite being hampered a furlong out. That was just the fourth start of her career and Remarquee (3.35) looks an excellent bet at around 9-2 to find further improvement and record what would be a sixth win for a three-year-old in the last nine runnings of this race. Newmarket 1.50 The drop back to 10 furlongs is not certain to suit Tagabawa, the likely favourite, and Mighty River is interesting at a double-figure price. James Tate\u2019s colt has more mile on the clock but showed improved form last time out over this track and trip and could well be able to cope with a 4lb rise in the weights. York 2.05 Vafortino found plenty of trouble in the Buckingham Palace Stakes at Ascot last month but still finished within five lengths of the winner. With a little more luck in running, he should go very close off a 1lb lower mark. Newmarket 2.25 This Group Two for juvenile fillies was won by Mawj, this year\u2019s 1,000 Guineas winner, 12 months ago and Star Of Mystery, who has won her last two starts by a combined total of 15 lengths, should improve her position in the early betting for the 2024 Classic with a third straight success. York 2.40 Royal Aclaim, sixth when favourite for last season\u2019s Nunthorpe, is unexposed at six furlongs and looks overpriced at around 7-1 to get the better of Swingalong, third at 66-1 in the Commonwealth Cup last time. Newmarket 3.00 The reliable Ravens Ark has dropped to just 1lb above his last winning mark and has a big each-way chance at around 10-1."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b8a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jul/13/a-crash-is-unlikely-but-the-fall-in-uk-home-prices-has-a-long-way-to-go", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A crash is unlikely, but the fall in UK home prices has a long way to go | Nils Pratley", "lead": "First-time buyers face high mortgage rates, while soaring rents and bills hinder saving for deposits \u2013 no wonder there\u2019s a big slowdown", "author": "Nils Pratley", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:52:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099379", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0f85e86a6574407dfe24bae8c04416fc1c609b83/0_386_3801_2281/500.jpg", "body": "Inquiries by would-be buyers of homes hit an eight-month low last month, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which talked about \u201ca renewed deterioration in UK home sales\u201d. On the same theme, Barratt Developments\u2019 trading update on Thursday related a near-halving in reservations from first-time buyers year on year. And the estate agent Winkworth warned this week on profits because of a slump in activity. In other words, the news from the housing market is exactly as you would expect when buyers are adjusting to the new reality of sharply higher mortgage rates. The big slowdown is on, even if Barratt added that demand among existing homeowners was more resilient. A typical two-year fixed deal has risen to 6.66%, a 15-year high on Moneyfacts data. Here\u2019s the mini-mystery, though: house prices have fallen only about 4% so far, which feels a gentle response to a fundamental shift in what buyers can afford. Why such a small fall? Two big factors make the picture more nuanced than in previous house price downturns. First, we\u2019re not (yet) in recession and, even if we get there, the downturn is not expected to be as deep as the one after the financial crisis in 2007-08 or as prolonged as the early-1990s slump. Both episodes coincided with proper house price falls. Second, sharp rises in unemployment aren\u2019t on the cards this time, according to most forecasts. Instead, we have earnings growth ripping along at 7.3% in the three months to May compared with a year earlier. Thus all the big banks sound relaxed about their default rates and are happy to sing the chancellor\u2019s tune about the need to show forbearance to struggling mortgage-payers. Yet, from a house prices perspective, that backdrop still feels weak when you remember where we came from. We had a decade of rock-bottom interest rates and help-to-buy subsidies and then a whoosh of extra demand with stamp duty holidays during Covid. Even if the rise in mortgage rates had been gentler, the market would still have looked overstretched on important historical yardsticks. At the top, the price of houses expressed as a multiple of average earnings was seven times, higher even than in the heady days of 2007-08. These days, a 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is equal to about 55% of gross annual income, calculated Nationwide last month \u2013 down from the all-time highs of 59% of late 2022 but still marginally above 2007-08 levels. In theory, higher interest rates also make it easier to save for a deposit (when the banks get round to passing on the change); in practice, still-surging rents, energy bills and general inflation make the task impossible for most. Thus the only sensible prediction is that the price of houses has further to fall. No, it probably won\u2019t be another era-defining crash, which would require a deeper recession. But the thinktank Capital Economics\u2019 forecast of another 8% decline over the next 12 months, taking the drop from the peak to 12%, sounds entirely plausible. There is a long way to go yet."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b8b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/13/jordan-henderson-al-ettifaq-liverpool-contract-talks-jurgen-klopp", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jordan Henderson agrees huge contract with Al-Ettifaq after talks with Klopp", "lead": "Jordan Henderson has accepted a huge contract offer from Al-Ettifaq after holding talks with Liverpool\u2019s manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp", "author": "Fabrizio Romano and Andy Hunter", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:44:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099397", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e8b9432a0dae2e159832d556001d4932b0de2c91/1_269_4114_2468/500.jpg", "body": "Jordan Henderson has accepted a huge contract offer from Al-Ettifaq after talks with J\u00fcrgen Klopp but the deal depends on the Saudi Arabian club\u2019s willingness to meet Liverpool\u2019s asking price for their captain.

Veadhasa was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 18 years while Shergill, who was found to have acted in joint enterprise for the murder, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 16 years. On the day of the attack, Veadhasa had collected a ninja sword set and a large machete he had bought online, the court heard. Before Veadhesa and Shergill were sentenced, the judge Mr Justice Choudhury lifted reporting restrictions that had previously prevented their names from being made public.

While the commission would have the power to launch its own investigations when rules are broken, the deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, noted there will \u201cstill be a role for the prime minister\u201d, when asked if the PM would have the final say on whether to accept the watchdog\u2019s recommendations on sanctions. \u201cYes, there will still be a role for the prime minister, but because they won\u2019t have a veto on starting an investigation and then the recommendations again \u2026 the prime minister at the moment appoints his adviser who does the investigations,\u201d she told the Institute for Government. \u201cIt will be done through the independent ethics and integrity commission and then those recommendations will come to parliament.\u201d As it stands, former ministers can leave office and receive huge sums of money lobbying on behalf of companies, profiting from their work serving the public and giving some companies privileged access to government officials and public funds. Rayner vowed to \u201cstop the rot\u201d by creating the new commission with stronger powers to punish those who break the rules and show the public that \u201cpolitics is working for them\u201d by the end of Labour\u2019s first term in government. Speaking before her speech at the Institute for Government, Rayner said: \u201cAfter taking a wrecking ball to the economy forcing up mortgage rates, the former prime minister Liz Truss is cashing in after crashing out of government. We have a system where the door is held wide open for former ministers who want to line their pockets as soon as they leave office. \u201cLabour will stop the revolving door between government and the companies that ministers are supposed to regulate, banning ministers from lobbying after they leave office with proper enforcement against those who break the rules. \u201cLabour recognises the standards system has been broken and we have a plan to clean up politics. Our genuinely independent ethics and integrity commission will bring the alphabet soup of existing committees and bodies that oversee standards in government under a single body, removed from politicians.\u201d Rayner\u2019s pledge comes amid fresh analysis seen by the Guardian that shows Liz Truss\u2019s cabinet have received almost \u00a3300,000 in second-job income since the former prime minister was forced to resign on 20 October last year. Two former cabinet ministers under Truss, Brandon Lewis and Ranil Jayawardena, have taken on consulting jobs, while Truss and her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, have started touring the speaking circuit. Truss is understood to have spoken more times in paid-for engagements abroad since she was forced to leave No 10 than she has in the House of Commons chamber. Rishi Sunak had promised to lead with \u201cintegrity, professionalism and accountability\u201d, and after entering office appointed Sir Laurie Magnus as his independent adviser. Yet his cabinet was rocked after Gavin Williamson, Nadhim Zahawi and Dominic Raab were forced to quit over accusations over their conduct. The Conservative former minister Owen Paterson resigned from the Commons in 2021 after a scandal over his lobbying for two companies that employed him as a consultant. David Cameron, the former prime minister, was also involved in a lobbying scandal over his links to Greensill Capital. Responding to Rayner\u2019s remarks, a Conservative party spokesperson said it\u2019s \u201cunsurprising to see that Angela Rayner doesn\u2019t trust the leader of her own party to oversee ethics in Whitehall\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b8e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/13/conner-omalley-ai-comedy-standup-review-soho-theatre", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Conner O\u2019Malley review \u2013 Silicon Valley parody delivers standup solutions", "lead": "An AI comedian cracks jokes tailored to the audience\u2019s internet search history in this spoof corporate presentation", "author": "Brian Logan", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:38:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099459", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/84645264f08f7bd201ae4704ef9e8fae2cb3d8ff/0_369_3885_2331/500.jpg", "body": "Streaming platforms increasingly tailor content to our own, unique tastes.

That\u2019s the promise held out by Richard Eagleton, founder and CEO of Standup Solutions and developer of KENN, the world\u2019s first AI comedian, in this spoof corporate presentation by Conner O\u2019Malley. This US act has cultivated a covetable reputation for his online work, and there\u2019s much to enjoy in this parody of Silicon Valley values and tech utopianism. But it\u2019s not subtle, and its characterisation of O\u2019Malley\u2019s digital guru alter ego is not a surprising one. The joke to begin with, and the first seed sewn that Eagleton may be something less than a slick success, is that the revolutionary AI development we\u2019re promised is endlessly withheld. First we get to hear about Eagleton\u2019s childhood in Des Plaines, Illinois. Then all about his beloved car, extensive tech spec very much included. Then about his workout routine and diet, a livelier section sending up the bizarre, macho behaviour of performative, competitive wellbeing. The problem is that O\u2019Malley\u2019s loud and overhyped character can make for grating company, and the joke about how boring he is isn\u2019t always funny enough to forestall actual boredom. Just as later, the joke that KENN (whom we encounter on-screen only) is a crap standup doesn\u2019t offset the crapness of his comedy. But we mustn\u2019t blame KENN: he works, his inventor claims, by data-mining his audience, and delivering the jokes their internet history suggests they\u2019ll find funny. These are compelling ideas, but they too often devolve here into jokes about porn and poo. When Eagleton\u2019s backstory reveals itself, meanwhile, as one of cuckoldry and business failure, it\u2019s not exactly unexpected. In the show\u2019s favour, O\u2019Malley gets this across \u2013 in his vulnerable if not his brasher moments \u2013 with some artful character work, and latterly, some neat faux home videos too. No mere online comic, he\u2019s also good with the crowd, his improvised material more sensitive and less strident than the actual set. A show tailored to my tastes, by AI or otherwise, would see this lighter touch more widely applied.

The country has been put through seven months of NHS strikes, with the Royal College of Nursing provoked into striking for the first time ever and doctors starting another stretch on Thursday. Schools have closed and children already harmed by the pandemic have been made to suffer, the inevitable effect shown in this week\u2019s Sats results. Rail workers have been striking on and off for over a year, just as people should be encouraged back on to trains. Every public service has been disrupted, and all for what? A piffling sum of around \u00a34bn is all it will cost to settle the pay demands of hard-pressed public sector staff at the rates set by the pay review bodies, the head of the IFS, Paul Johnson, tells me. That\u2019s \u201cmoney down the back of the sofa\u201d, he says. Out of total UK public spending of around \u00a31tn, it\u2019s trivial \u2013 equivalent to an accounting or forecasting error. There is no plausible reason why the government put the country through the wringer, why children were harmed or why some patients will have died waiting for treatments, with hundreds of thousands more put at risk. As Sian Elliott, TUC policy officer for public services, tells me, these pay settlements would cost the government even less. Raising pay for millions of public employees means they pay more tax \u2013 and since many are very low paid, any extra they earn will reduce their top-up from universal credit (UC). Here\u2019s a disgraceful fact: a huge number of DWP staff are so low paid they claim UC, so while they spend their working lives handing out UC, they also swap places and go round to the other side of the desk as UC claimants. The wonder is not that the public sector finally rose up and went on strike, but that it has been so extraordinarily patient through all the years pay fell: in real terms, senior teachers in England have lost 13%, an average of around \u00a36,600, since 2010; senior police constables have lost 17%; and doctors, nurses, health visitors and prison officers have also lost heavily. Elliott says latest TUC calculations show that public sector workers have lost an average \u00a3260 a month in real terms compared with 2010, falling well behind private employees. Nor is raising public pay as inflationary as the Bank of England claims, as public services don\u2019t put up the prices of their products in the same way to cover the cost. How much is \u00a34bn? Johnson says that\u2019s easy to raise several times over from long overdue reforms to council tax and by making tax on unearned income from capital gains match that on PAYE earnings. Read his excellent book Follow the Money for many more such suggestions, in a country under-taxed compared with other western European nations. Johnson\u2019s constant refrain is that everything eventually must be paid for in growth or higher taxes. But Sunak\u2019s slippery talk of \u201cefficiency savings\u201d and \u201creprioritisation\u201d, while claiming no cuts to frontline services, is what the Tories and their supporters in the press would slam as \u201cmagic money tree\u201d talk if it came from Labour. After 13 bitter years of austerity, there are no squads of imaginary \u201cback-office pen-pushers\u201d to be shed in bare-bones public services. Teaching unions are satisfied that their 6.5% will not be stripped out of school or further education budgets. Is it to come from capital, when thousands of schools are crumbling, some with elements at \u201cserious risk of imminent failure\u201d? Where is the fat in the NHS? Sunak dare not admit that the sum is small \u2013 and low-paid staff need never have lost earnings to strike for what they deserved. Sunak mentioned only one new source of funds, and it was squalid politics: lifting the price of visas and NHS charges for immigrants by over \u00a31bn. He seeks to placate his ultras, who call for care worker visa cuts as the Commons and Lords ping-pong over the most brutal elements of his new migration bill: it\u2019s cheap, performative politics to deter the migrants whom he knows social care desperately needs. Cheap politics is the cause of all these months of pointless disruption. The Tories gambled that this would be their great culture war win, but as the polling guru John Curtice told the TUC\u2019s staff day last week, they got this \u201cbadly wrong\u201d: the public has stayed remarkably staunch in supporting the strikers. Everyone knows someone in the public sector, and nearly everyone feels the pinch themselves. Everyone knows this 6% settlement still leaves public pay lagging behind the 8.7% inflation rate. This is another mighty defeat for the government, on the same day as other bad news: GDP figures showed the economy shrinking again, and the Office for Budget Responsibility issued a grim warning that stubbornly high inflation and soaring borrowing costs add billions of pounds to the government\u2019s debt interest. Also on Thursday, the latest NHS waiting list figures showed another leap upwards, to 7.47m. On this day, too, the unions won an important battle, as the high court struck down Sunak\u2019s anti-union law permitting agencies to provide scab workers to cover for strikers: it amounted to making strikes impossible, said the court. We wait to see if all the unions fall in behind the teachers, as Sunak declares this pay offer is final, however long some may stay on strike. But the government\u2019s dithering and U-turning throughout may make that threat look hollow. Labour\u2019s employment policy, with fair pay agreements across every sector, would bring a measure of industrial peace and more voice to the unions. When they are for the first time given freedom to enter any workplace to recruit, the likes of Amazon, where workers have walked out again this week, will find the balance of power shifting between workforce and employer. Sunak\u2019s party flounders yet again, deaf to the mood of the times.

One of its hits last year was Manuel Li\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s \u00a1Viva! which saw Li\u00f1\u00e1n and company kitted out in full female costumes, giving expression to their queer identities. (Li\u00f1\u00e1n was nominated for both a National Dance award and an Olivier.) Li\u00f1\u00e1n is back this year, in an all-male gala show, and in a more low-key offering, Amor Amado Am\u00e9n, which muses on love. It\u2019s the result of a week\u2019s residency at Sadler\u2019s Wells, just five days in the studio with three collaborators: flamenco guitarist Francisco Vinuesa, multi-instrumentalist and psycho-sensory therapist Sabio Janiak and Croatian healer and spiritual coach Ivan Bavcevic. Not all conventional people to share the stage with. Much of the work-in-progress still feels improvisatory, different worlds not quite meeting. Li\u00f1\u00e1n experiments with using microphone taps and sharp breaths instead of contra-tiempo hand claps between the beats. Bavcevic intones, \u201cOnly desire keeps me alive\u201d on repeat to a clubby beat. Janiak plays mournful cornet with Li\u00f1\u00e1n dancing flirtatiously close. There are some beautiful moments, such as when two men walk simply together, smiling into each other\u2019s eyes, but this is definitely still at the development stage. Things fall more easily into place when Li\u00f1\u00e1n dances in intense conversation with Vinuesa\u2019s guitar. On familiar ground, Li\u00f1\u00e1n is neatly explosive, with the strong, sudden attack of a mousetrap, and when he gets sucked into the moment, so do we. Over in Sadler\u2019s Wells\u2019 main house, another all-male offering, La Confluencia, from Rafael Est\u00e9vez, Valeriano Pa\u00f1os and company sees more deeply engrossing rhythm and more underdeveloped theatricality. La Confluencia is inspired by the meeting of cultures that formed flamenco, from India to Europe, via Jewish and north African influences. But this is no travelogue, and everything\u2019s woven into the mass of movement, alongside other magpied steps: a courtly bow, ballet\u2019s arabesque and d\u00e9velopp\u00e9, contact partnering, a brief karate kick, some folk dance. At one point the men\u2019s wiggling bums underline that there\u2019s humour here, but it\u2019s played with a straight face. Thematically as the piece moves forward it\u2019s hard to read, but the dancing is irresistible. Five men, all in black, prowling to the front of the stage, intensely eyeing the audience. Their footwork has clarity of rhythm, not just a stampede. There\u2019s an economy to the performance, only what needs to move, moves, direct from A to B, but with style. Pa\u00f1os spins tightly, on an immovable axis, while Est\u00e9vez\u2019s hands are a flying blur, as if frantically whispering, or else he sits on a chair, facing off with warm-toned singer Francisco Blanco, just letting his feet do the talking. As the piece progresses over 100 minutes, some of it starts to feel relentless, and the no-doubt deeply researched references are lost to all but the most expert viewer. But there are still bursts of brilliance, like Est\u00e9vez\u2019s racing torrent of spoken syllables, presumably the bols, or vocal percussion of north India, where flamenco is thought to have originated centuries ago, its roots still underpinning an ever-progressing art form.

Whether its a small-scale drug operation or a major casino robbery, his multi-player ensembles offer not just a sense of the numbers, but the who and why of a scheme, a sense of purpose along with the pleasures of how. Full Circle, the director\u2019s new star-studded, mixed-bag Max limited series (RIP HBO Max), is a bit of an overdose. Sprawling yet often sedate, it disjointedly packs too many of these schemes into an overly complicated, sputtering noir mystery set in present-day New York. Written by Ed Solomon, Soderbergh\u2019s partner for the 2017 choose-your-adventure series Mosaic and the comparatively sleeker and more scintillating film No Sudden Move, Full Circle attempts to braid a thicket of secrets, plans, deceptions and exploitations into a grand picture of cascading connections. The result is less artful collage of counterbalanced motivations and complicities than a rubber-band ball of plot and money, money and plot. Some of that money is stolen, as in the first scene, when an ageing Asian American crime boss axes the brother-in-law of inscrutable rival Mrs Mahabir (an underused CCH Pounder), head of a Guyanese community in Queens. Some is spent by Mahabir\u2019s consigliere Gharmen (Phaldut Sharma) to bring two starry-eyed Guyanese boys, Xavier (standout Sheyi Cole) and Louis (Gerald Jones), to America as unwitting trainees, and then sought by said deputies to return home. There are series A investments and bribes and NDAs and an old, failed business in Guyana \u2013 numbers and accounts bandied about for six 45-55 minute episodes until my eyes blurred. But first and foremost, there\u2019s ransom for the kidnapping of a child: $314,159 \u2013 pi in dollars, a circle, as part of a ritual conducted by Mrs Mahabir to lift a curse on her family (the show\u2019s incorporation of the occult and Caribbean folk religion is messily handled, at best). The series is based on Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1963 film High and Low, in which kidnappers accidentally abduct the wrong child and ignite a complicated chain of events and, as such, things go awry from the start. Mahabir\u2019s nephew Aked (When They See Us\u2019s Jharrel Jerome, vibrating with stress), was supposed to pick up Jared Browne (Ethan Stoddard), grandson of celebrity \u201cChef Jeff\u201d (Dennis Quaid, with a french-braided rattail that speaks volumes); instead, he unwittingly grabs a similarly aged runaway stalking Jared and stealing his things (Lucian Zanes). The ransom debacle causes the real Jared\u2019s parents Sam (Claire Danes) and Derek (Timothy Olyphant) to unravel in different directions. (With her blunt blond bob and chagrined swilling of fine wine in a luxe Manhattan apartment, Danes essentially plays the downtown version of her character from last year\u2019s Fleishman is in Trouble.) To further scribble the lines, a rogue Postal Service inspector unfortunately named Melody Harmony (Zazie Beetz) starts connecting the Guyanese group to old business deals by the Brownes and her bumbling boss, Manny Broward (Jim Gaffigan). Beetz, so excellent in Atlanta, disappointingly plays a cop whose chronic boundary crossing and know-it-all attitude irks everyone, including the viewer. Part shallow writing, part gratingly self-righteous performance, she\u2019s a tough pill to swallow as one of the series\u2019 main protagonists. If this sounds like a lot to keep track of, it is, and I\u2019m even eliding a few subplots. But as circuitous as it may be, Full Circle has its moments, largely thanks to Sodebergh\u2019s keen eye for lingering details and a visual style that burrows in with the characters, especially Danes\u2019s Sam. The result is a curious, ultimately frustrating collection of disparate parts. There\u2019s a nagging discordance between Solomon\u2019s writing \u2013 which trends between too oblique and obvious drops of exposition, the kind I\u2019d expect in a dime-a-dozen Netflix thriller \u2013 and Soderbergh\u2019s v\u00e9rit\u00e9 direction. His tracking shots and shaky cam, lingering on the mundane details of repetition (turning the key at the front door, following someone through Postmates) gives the series a lived-in feel the dialogue and dense well of secrets do not. The performances, too, often mimic an archetypical scene \u2013 strained parenting of a Manhattan teenager who won\u2019t eat his avocado toast, two wives of reconciled brothers ruing old pain over wine \u2013 that never quite coheres into the full suspension of disbelief. I do appreciate, however, that six hours of investment does not produce one grand reveal or secret \u2013 there\u2019s no master to this web of shifting loyalties and plans, only those crushed when it inevitably buckles. It feels true to a film-maker long preoccupied with economic inequity and attempts to subvert it, though I can\u2019t imagine many viewers will see all these underwhelming plots through to the finish.

If Downing Street thinks in terms of the next news bulletin, China has a planning cycle that in some of its documents takes it to 2049, as the ISC was told by one of its intelligence agency witnesses. Moreover, China brings a whole-of-government response, while in the UK too much strategy is conceived in the Cabinet Office, as its implementation rests with individual Whitehall policy departments, many with no security remit or expertise. The shift in the UK government\u2019s strategy towards China has also too often been the product of individual prime ministers. Tony Blair came to power in 1997 just a few weeks before the handover of Hong Kong to China, leading to a decline in intelligence staffing and resourcing in China from 1997 to 2005, the committee report found. Blair promised difficult issues would be confronted, but the broad thrust of the relationship was to be based on being positive, and extending trade. The speed of China\u2019s rise after Beijing\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 caught the west by surprise, with China\u2019s GDP overtaking the British economy in 2005, Germany\u2019s in 2006 and, in 2010, moving into second place globally, replacing Japan and behind only the US. In 2009, Gordon Brown was sufficiently struck by China\u2019s transformation that he published in conjunction with David Miliband, the then foreign secretary, \u201ca framework for engagement\u201d, a document that painted China exclusively as an international partner and source of prosperity rather than a threat. In his foreword, Brown said: \u201cThe UK has a lot to offer China. Our commitment to economic openness, our strength in science and innovation, our cutting-edge design and our world-class universities all interest a country engaging with the rest of the international community like never before.\u201d It was a given that globalisation was great, and that prosperity would lead to greater openness. Tory ex-PM David Cameron\u2019s so-called \u201cgolden era\u201d with China was largely an acceleration of the Labour policy. He and George Osborne tried to strengthen financial ties with Beijing, even being prepared to break ranks with the US in March 2015 by signing up as a founding member of China\u2019s new infrastructure investment bank, an institution that the US saw as a rival to the World Bank. Osborne led the way in encouraging Chinese investment in the next generation of civil nuclear power plants in the UK and he ensured that the City of London would become the base for the first clearing house for the yuan outside Asia. It was, in the words of the committee, an era when \u201cChinese money was readily accepted by HMG with few questions asked\u201d. Since then, partly because of the repression of democracy in Hong Kong and under pressure from Donald Trump, Conservative backbenchers have forced ministers into a slow process of reassessment, one that has been mirrored right across Europe. In a change of mood, security interests were prioritised over economic ones. That required seeing China as a country seeking technological dominance over the west, targeting the acquisition of intellectual property and data in Britain\u2019s specialised industrial sectors. At China\u2019s service was the largest state intelligence apparatus in the world, intent on enforcing Chinese values upon liberal democracy. In a particularly arresting commentary, the committee said: \u201cWithout swift and decisive action, we are on a trajectory for the nightmare scenario where China steals blueprints, sets standards, and builds products, exerting political and economic influence at every step.\u201d The UK ISC inquiry started work in 2019 but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and government obstructionism. As such, it gathers evidence as Whitehall slowly turns away from optimism about China. The committee notes how long it took intelligence agencies and ministers to make the intellectual leap by turning its attention from covert Chinese operations to the impact of overt Chinese investment upon the UK infrastructure, research, technology and academia. It charts many government strategies on China, but doubts if individual departments felt guided by any of them, continuing to plough their own furrow in terms of Chinese students, civil nuclear investment or wider technological investment. One reason was that Boris Johnson, a self-confessed Sinophile, instinctively did not like seeing China in the dark terms he appeared to reserve for Russia. But the broad direction of Whitehall policy over the past two to three years led by agencies and figures such as the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, did change, and perhaps the sum of the committee\u2019s judgments, hampered by deadlines, does not quite capture the scale of the change wrought by recent legislation. The UK by now in policy terms is aligned with the mainstream European response to China, judging by the German government\u2019s Chinese strategy published by coincidence on Thursday. In some places, by contrast, the report pulls its punches, not calling for the closure of Confucius Institutes or setting out a strategy of how UK universities can wean themselves off their financial dependency on Chinese students. The report does not explain why extensive investment from undemocratic Gulf states is welcome, but China\u2019s is not. The mantra \u201cde-risk, but do not decouple\u201d has become the staple policy in the west. The future test is how that comes to be interpreted in detail, and it is noticeable that Whitehall is doing all it can to prevent the ISC from monitoring that process. Rishi Sunak prefers to speak of China as an \u201cepoch-defining challenge\u201d rather than an explicit threat to the UK\u2019s security, the phrase chosen by his predecessor, Liz Truss, during her brief premiership. The Foreign Office is slowly starting to assert itself in terms of dialogue, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is an advocate for engagement, plans a visit to Beijing shortly. One suspects that the ISC\u2019s warnings, even though they chime with a strong view from Conservative backbenchers, are unlikely to act as much of a brake on the UK\u2019s approach to China."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b93", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/fossil-fuel-deaths-inhaling-gas", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fossil fuel workers are dying inhaling gases \u2013 despite US warnings to big oil", "lead": "After multiple worker fatalities, the US government warned manual gauging was dangerous.

He was going to test the fluid in the tank before pumping it into his truck, a practice known as manual gauging. Instead he was engulfed by invisible chemicals that had built up inside. Springman passed out. A man he was training on the job that day in October 2019, Greg Fausto, caught him from falling several feet to the ground below, according to both men. When Springman came to, he saw that his gas monitor was beeping with a reading showing that the concentration of gas in the air had reached a flammable level. He had a nosebleed and felt nauseous. \u201cMy mouth was caked with some kind of weird film,\u201d Springman said. \u201cEverything was just wrong.\u201d Springman, who was working for an oil and gas transport company called Pilot Transportation, hauling oil for Diamondback Energy, finished the job that day with Fausto\u2019s help, but since then his health has deteriorated. He has cardiac arrhythmia, a known side-effect of breathing in hydrocarbon gases, as well as nervous system damage. He has a blood clot in his lung that cannot be treated with blood thinners because of his ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, according to medical records viewed by Drilled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they can do for me,\u201d Springman said. \u201cIf the blood clot leaves my lung and goes to my brain, I\u2019m done.\u201d He\u2019s not alone. After multiple worker fatalities related to manual gauging, the US government warned that the practice was dangerous. There were nine incidents of workers dying from inhaling gases while gauging tanks between 2010 and 2014, according to two government agencies. All of the workers died alone. Most of their bodies were found slumped over thief hatches at the top of storage tanks. But the oil industry seems not to have taken note. Since 2016, at least a dozen more workers have died as a result of manual gauging, though some experts think that is likely to be an undercount. Sharon Wilson, a longtime environmental advocate who researches methane emissions, says she still sees workers manually gauging tanks in Texas all the time. Wilson carries an optical gas imaging camera capable of viewing emissions coming off tanks, meaning she can see the gases that workers cannot. \u201cWhen I see a worker opening a thief hatch\u201d \u2013 the name for the hatch on top of a tank \u2013 \u201cit can look like a volcano erupts\u201d, as hydrocarbon gases spew forth. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying because I know when I see a worker walking up the stairs, I know what they\u2019re gonna do and I know that I could sit there on the side of the road and watch a worker die.\u201d The oil and gas industry is dangerous for its workers, with a fatality rate seven times higher than the national average, according to a 2013 study. But the fatal risk of hydrocarbon vapors \u2013 gases like methane, propane and butane that build up in the air space of storage tanks \u2013 gained attention after the death of 21-year-old Dustin Bergsing in North Dakota in 2012. His death was originally chalked up to cardiovascular disease, but toxicology testing found propane and butane in his blood. Dr Robert Harrison, an occupational medicine physician from the University of California, San Francisco, alerted the CDC\u2019s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) of Bergsing\u2019s death, as well as a second worker fatality in 2010 under similar circumstances. \u201cThese oil and gas vapors are breathed into the lungs and cross over very quickly into the blood,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIf the breathing centers shut down, you don\u2019t get enough oxygen into your body. Then you starve your heart of oxygen and the heart stops working. So that\u2019s probably what happens in most of the cases.\u201d The gases can also have a direct impact on the heart, sending it into fibrillation, he added. Harrison was the lead author of the 2016 CDC study that attempted to tally worker deaths from exposure to gases and vapors released from thief hatches on tanks. The team found more deaths under similar circumstances that they did not count because the medical examiners in those cases did not perform toxic exposure testing. For this reason, it\u2019s likely deaths related to hydrocarbon poisoning have been undercounted. On 21 January 2022, a diesel transport driver performing duties similar to Springman was found dead in the cab of his truck. The cause of death in his case was determined to be cardiac arrest, like earlier cases identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cardiac arrest is one of the most common immediate reactions to acute exposure to hydrocarbon gasses. In response to a 2016 Osha safety alert, the American Petroleum Institute (API) updated its best practices to include ways for oil and gas companies to lower the risk for workers during tank gauging, sampling and maintenance, said Stephanie Stevens, a spokesperson with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. To view those standards, one must pay API over $100. Recommendations include using electronic gauges that are capable of measuring fluid levels inside tanks and sending the information to a screen on site, which would allow workers to avoid opening thief hatches all together. Electronic gauges are now common on tanks on some federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and on new tanks, but manual gauging remains a common practice on private land. The government alerts were not followed by the passage of any laws regulating manual gauging or mandating remote gauging. API did not respond to questions from Drilled/the Guardian about manual gauging but pointed to the work of the Tank Gauging Focus Group. Federal agencies have continued to try to raise awareness of the fatal risk manual gauging poses to workers with safety videos and outreach to medical examiners and coroners about the need to test for toxins in the blood of workers who die on the job. Still, between 2016 to 2020, another 12 workers died while transferring oil and gas fluids at well sites, according to a public awareness video released in February by the CDC. Some of the workers died from cardiac events and others from explosions. \u201cHonestly, it is the most terrifying thing of all the horrors I\u2019ve witnessed in the oilfield,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cI\u2019ve been following it closely for a long time. More deaths have occurred since the Osha/CDC research and it\u2019s senseless because there is an alternative practice that would save lives.\u201d Harrison, the lead author of the 2016 CDC study, was surprised to hear from Drilled that workers were still manually gauging through thief hatches on storage tanks since his work for the CDC showed the risks of the practice. \u201cWe obviously have more work to do,\u201d he said. Springman estimates that 95% of the Diamondback Energy sites he was sent to in Texas during his time working with Pilot Transportation required manual gauging. (Neither company responded to requests for comment.) He has filed a lawsuit against Diamondback for the illnesses he has endured since the incident at one of their sites in 2019. \u201cIt needs to be mandatory that nobody ever goes on top of a tank,\u201d Springman said. He believes fossil fuel companies have failed to install electronic gauging equipment to protect workers, despite knowing about the risk since at least 2016, because of the cost. Instead, workers like him pay the price. On 26 June 2023, Springman was diagnosed by MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas with myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood cancer, caused by exposure to benzene, according to medical records seen by Drilled and the Guardian. His doctors have told him there is little they can do for him at this point. For more than three years he has been in pain as various parts of his body have begun to fail. But what hurts Springman the most is the fact that his family, including his children, is being forced to watch his health continue to worsen. \u201cFor a human being to watch somebody rot and die, what is that price?\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b94", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/13/tour-de-france-2023-stage-12-updates-from-roanne-to-belleville-en-beaujolais-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France 2023: Izagirre breaks away to win chaotic stage 12 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Rolling report:</strong> The Basque veteran prevailed on a day the peloton travelled through wine country and at times seemed drunk in a stage that was little short of bonkers", "author": "Barry Glendenning", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:57:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099567", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/223559549c8a6b7896dd998a49aaa87faf20a1fa/54_0_1662_997/500.jpg", "body": "Stage 12 report: The Basque rider Ion Izagirre, riding for Cofidis, won stage 12 from Roanne to Belleville-en-Beaujolais in the Rhone, after a solo attack in the final 30km. It was his team\u2019s second success in this year\u2019s Tour, following the French rider Victor Lafay\u2019s win in San Sebasti\u00e1n, on stage two. After another frantic opening to the stage, in which multiple riders fought to escape the peloton, the race eventually settled down, but only after close to 80km of attacking, with two main groups battling for control of the situation. Jeremy Whittle reports from Belleville-en-Baujolais Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) 50hr 30min 23sec Tadej Pogacar (UAE Emirates) +17sec Jai Hindley (Bora-Hansgrohe) +2min 40sec Carlos Rodriguez (Ineos Grenadiers) +4min 22sec Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) +4min 34sec Sepp Cuss drops out of the top 10 and is replaced by Thibaut Pinot, who is 6min 33sec off the pace. 1. Ion Izagirre 3hr 51min 42sec 2. Mathieu Burgaudeau +58sec 3. Matteo Jorgenson +58sec 4. Tiesj Benoot +1min 06sec 5. Tobias Halland Johannessen +1min 11sec The battle for second and third: Burgaudeau rolls over the line in second place ahead of Matteo Jorgenson. It\u2019s been a wonderful, chaotic afternoon\u2019s racing and it\u2019s won by the Basque rider, who takes a second stage for Cofidis, who hadn\u2019t won one in the 15 previous years. Izagirre pumps his right fist as he milks the applause of the crowd in the final 500 metres. Approaching the finish line, he blows kisses to the crowds and raises his arms above his head. Chapeau, Ion. 4km to go: With his teeth gritted, Izagirre ploughs on with those behind him duking it out for the other two podium places. Jorgenson and Martin go clear of the other four. 5km to go: Apologies, there are six riders in the group behind Ion Izagirre, but one of them is a teammate of the Spaniard\u2019s and has been trying to sabotage the hunt. Wout Poels is towing the yellow jersey group, who are 4min 20sec behind the stage leader. 7km to go: It\u2019s been a wild ride, with today\u2019s stage being one of the most chaotic I can ever recall. The five riders behind Izagirre have completely given up their chase. His lead goes out to a minute. 10km to go: Izagirre\u2019s Cofidis teammate Guillaume Martin is in the group of riders chasing the leader and is doing his best to disrupt what is currently passing for their rhythm. His pal has a lead of 48 seconds and will win his second ever Tour de France stage barring an accident. Caleb Ewan watch: He\u2019s 30 minutes off the pace and still has to negotiate the final climb. He might make it but it will be tight. 12km to go: Izagirre leads by 43 seconds from the small group of riders chasing him. They no longer seem to be working together, which is good news for the Spaniard. 14km to go: The final descent finished, it\u2019s fairly flat from now until the finish with a couple of little kicks. Izagirre is stretching his lead and it\u2019s now at 55 seconds. The yellow jersey group are 3min 07sec further back. 15km to go: Seven years since his most recent Tour de France stage, Izagirre has a commanding lead of 49 seconds over the chasing Benoot, Pinot, Martin, Jorgenson , Johannessen and Burgaudeau. He\u2019ll take some beating. 20km to go: Ion Izagirre is 36 seconds clear with six riders giving chase. Mathieu van der Poel is over a minute behind our leader and his goose looks well and truly cooked. 27km to go: Out on the course for Eurosport, Jens Voigt reports that the occupants of an AG2R-Citreon car have been given an almighty rollocking by a race official for allowing two of their riders to draft behind the car. They\u2019ll probably get fined for that. 28km to go: Izagirre goes over the top, collecting eight bonus seconds that are of absolutely no use to him. 29km to go: Matteo Jorgenson and Thibaut Pinaut attack off the front of the six riders in the group chasing Izagirre with less than a kilometre of the final climb to go. 30km to go: With two kilometres to go, Cofidis rider Ion Izagirre pulls clear of the lead group and opens a gap of 27 seconds. Mathieu van der Poel is struggling to stay in touch with the rest of the leaders, while Ineos Grenadiers have taken up position at the front of the yellow jersey group. 32km to go: Our lead trio are joined by another five riders, including Izagirre, Benoot, Martin and Johannesson. It\u2019s bad news for Mathieu van der Poel, who is the fastest rider of them all in a finish. The rest of those in his group will be doing their damnedest to drop him. 32km to go: At the head of the race, Mathieu van der Poel is joined by Thibaut Pinot and Matteo Jorgenson on the final climb of the day. 33km to go: \u201cWhat rider number is Jai Hindley and where is he in todays race,\u201d asks Anna. The correct answer is (a) No71 and (b) in the yellow jersey group. 35km to go: Mathieu van der Poel is approaching the final climb of the day and it\u2019s a category two bruiser. The Col de la Croix Rosier is 717m high and 5.3km in length with an average of gradient of 7.6 per cent to pile the pain on already tormented legs. The yellow jersey group is 3min 35sec behind Alpecin-Deceuninck rider Van Der Poel. He has a lead of 20 seconds over Thibaut Pinot and Matteo Jorgenson, who are 11 seconds clear of another trio. 37km to go: In 12th place on GC, the South African rider Louis Meintjes has done exceptionally well to bridge the gap from the polka-dot jersey group to the yellow jersey group. 41km to go: There is a very, very tricky and clearly signposted u-turn on this descent and Mathiu van der Poel almost comes a cropper and goes into some sandbags as he negotiates it. It could claim a few victims in a couple of minutes time. 44km to go: Mathieu van der Poel goes over the top with a lead of 17 seconds from his closest poursuivants. Will the breakaway regroup by the bottom of this descent? 44km to go: Jumbo-Visma have four riders including Jonas Vingegaard in the yellow jersey group, compared to the six UAE Emirates representative, including Tadej Pogacar. 45km to go: Mathieu van der Poel has a lead of 30 seconds over the chasing posse of 10 riders. The yellow jersey group is two minutes further back and dropping bodies like John Wick in a particularly bad mood. 47km to go: Having been ill for the past two days, Mathieu van der Poel drops Andrey Amador is now out in front on his own on the climb. Dylan Teuns is the latest to struggle as the day\u2019s breakaway group thins out. 48km to go: Mads Pedersen and Julian Alaphilippe are dropped by the lead group, while Jasper Stuyven is also struggling. Matteo Jorgenson, by contrast, is trying to bridge the gap to the two leaders, Van Der Poel and Amador. 50km to go: Amador and Van Der Poel open a gap of 15 seconds on the rest of the breakaway on the foot of the nexct climb, the Col de la Croix Montmain. It\u2019s 737m high and 5.5km in length with an average gradient of 6.1%. 53km to go: \u201cIf that explosive lunchtime concoction of food doesn\u2019t propel you up the Col de la Casse Froide then nothing will,\u201d writes Ger McCarthy. 55km to go: In the lead group, Mathieu van der Poel puts his foot down on the descent, with Andrey Amador hot on his heels. 58km to go: Giuliu Ciccone is one of five riders who hit the asphalt in a collision as various riders collect musettes in a feed zone. He looks fit to continue, although he did briefly clutch his shoulder Cavendish-style. He remounts and pedals away. 61km to go: AG2R-Citreon are doing the hard work at the front of the yellow jersey group and have chipped 30 seconds off the lead group\u2019s advantage, which is now down to 3min 10sec. It\u2019s a mightily strong lead group of 15 riders and it\u2019s nigh on impossible to pick a winner. In an interview with Eurosport\u2019s Jens Voigt, their team boss explains that they\u2019re trying to minimise the gap and try to move their riders closer to the top 10 on GC. Their highest placed representative is Felix Gall in 16th place. Ben O\u2019Connor is in 17th place but has missed out on today\u2019s yellow jersey group. I\u2019m far from an expert but it seems a lot of effort for very little return, in my humble opinion. 62km to go: The riders are on their way up the third categorised climb of the day, the Col de la Casse Froide. It\u2019s 740m high and 5.3km in length with an average gradient of 6%. The road is narrow and pleasantly dappled by the sun shining through the thick canopy of trees lining each side of the road. 63km to go: \u201cCome on Baz!\u201d writes Joe Pearson. \u201cMake like Sarah Rendell and regale us with the mouth-watering details of your snacks!\u201d I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess my colleague Sarah Rendell eats far more healthily, but having finally got to inspect the contents of my musette, I can reveal it contains a ham, cheese and salad sandwich with salad cream between two slices of wholemeal bread; two Activia yoghurts (one apricot, one strawberry), a bag of cheese and onion crisps and a handful of wine gums. I\u2019ve also been handed a bidon of lemon Fanta. That\u2019ll do. 64km to go: There are 39 riders in the yellow jersey group, with pretty much everyone from the top 10 on GC present and correct as far as I can tell. Louis Meintjes (12th) and Mikel Landa (14th) have definitely missed that particular bus. Interestingly, Thibaut Pinot, who is 15th on GC, 9min 36sec behind race leader Jonas Vingegaard, is in today\u2019s breakaway. The gap is 3min 32sec. 69km to go: The gap from the 15-man breakaway to the yellow jersey group stretches to 3min 28sec, while the polka-dot jersey group is another three minutes further back. Caleb Ewan watch: The Aussie sprinter is now being accompanied by a teammate but is already 18 minutes behind the leaders. With most of the day\u2019s climbing still to come, his chances of making the cut-off already look extremely slim. At a guesstimate, he\u2019d probably need to finish within around 40 minutes of today\u2019s stage winner to avoid being thrown off the race and his team won\u2019t want to lose two riders so he may have to do the lion\u2019s share of today\u2019s climbing on his own. 78km to go: Ladies and gentlemen, after 90 kilometres of racing we have ourselves a breakaway: Tiesj Benoot (Jumbo-Visma), Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ), Andrey Amador (EF Education-EasyPost), Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), Mathieu Van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Guillaume Martin, Ion Izagirre (Cofidis), Ruben Guerreiro and Matteo Jorgenson (Movistar), Dylan Teuns (Israel-PremierTech), Victor Campenaerts (Lotto-Dstny), Tobias Halland Johanessen (Uno-X) and Mathieu Burgaudeau (TotalEnergies). They are 1min 35sec clear of the yellow jersey group and are about to be joined by Julian Alaphilippe and Jasper Stuyven. Elsewhere on the course: the polka-dot jersey group of 60 riders is six minutes down on the leaders, while the green jersey group of 20 or so pedalling enthusiasts is a further four minutes behind. As for Caleb Ewan, well \u2026 more news as I get it. 82km to go: Our lead group of 13 riders (more of which anon) have a lead of a minute over the yellow jersey group and are being chased by Julian Alaphilipe and Jasper Stuyven, who are 32 seconds behind them. On the race radio, Bora-Hansgrohe\u2019s riders are told in the strongest possible terms not to mount any attacks and focus solely on protecting Jai Hindley, who is in third place on GC. Several of those riders potentially threatening his position on GC are in the group that is over five minutes behind the yellow jersey group, so this could be a great day for the Aussie in terms of cementing a podium place in Paris. 84km to go: In terms of pure chaos, this has been one of the most insane stages of the Tour I\u2019ve ever seen; a total free-for-all but it finally seems to be settling down at the halfway mark. 87km to go: The breakaway group is now 13 riders strong, with Julian Alaphilippe trying to crash the party. The gap back to the considerably smaller (for now) yellow jersey group is 43 seconds. 87km to go: On the eve of Bastille Day, Thibaut Pinot attacks off the front of the yellow jersey group and is followed about a minute later by Julian Alaphilippe. 89km to go: On the Eurosport commentary team, there is general bafflement at the tactics (or apparent lack of them) being employed by race leader Jonas Vingegaard\u2019s Jumbo-Visma team today. They\u2019ve sent man after man after man on the attack. The yellow jersey group currently numbers about 10 riders, if that! \u201cI\u2019m getting the impression I\u2019m watching the junior Tour de France the way they\u2019re all jumping around the place,\u201d says Robbie McEwen. 91km to go: Andrey Amador, Ion Izaguirre and Matteo Jorgensen are about to join the lead trio, as more and more riders counter-attack off the front of the yellow jersey group. 94km to go: Benoot, Teuns and Pedersen are 29 seconds clear of the yellow jersey group, with a trio of riders on the road between them trying to double the escape party in numbers. Just as it looks like things might be settling down, Bahrain Victorious attack off the front of the yellow jersey group as they\u2019re hoping to get Fred Wright into any breakaway. This is carnage! 95km to go: I hope none of the riders have fallen into the same trap as me and got so caught up in the excitement that they have either forgotten to, or not had time to eat and drink. If these dispatches dry up, you\u2019ll know I\u2019ve succumbed to the dreaded hunger \u201cknock\u201d but I am assured sustenance is on its way so we should be good for the second half of the stage. 100km to go: Still on their descent, Teuns and Benoot are joined by Mads Pedersen because \u2026 well, of course they are. We\u2019re almost 70 kilometres into a stage that has been super-aggressive from the gun and the only thing we can predict with any sort of certainty is that Caleb Ewan won\u2019t be winning it. 106km to go: Dylan Teuns (Israel-Premier Tech) and Tiesj Benoot (Jumbo-Visma) go for broke and open a gap of 14 seconds on the yellow jersey group as they reach the top of an uncategorised climb. They begin their descent. 107km to go: The latest breakaway is neutralised and we\u2019re still no closer to see this stage settling down. At the back of the field, poor Caleb Ewan is already 11 minutes off the pace and has been left to his own devices by his team. They haven\u2019t tasked anyone with helping him and he\u2019ll do exceptionally well to finish inside the time limit. 110km to go: Marc Soler (UAE Emirates) joins Kelderman and Skjelmose. The top two on GC now have teammates in the current breakaway. British Bahrain Victorious rider Fred Wright is trying to join them. 111km to go: Kelderman and Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) have opened a gap of seven seconds on the yellow jersey group, which is now about 12 riders strong. They\u2019ve opened a tiny gap on the rest of what\u2019s left of the bunch. 112km to go: Wout van Aert has been caught on an aggressive stage that resembles one of the spring Classics. The polka-dot jersey is 1min 49sec behind the yellow jersaey group. \u201cThe animals have taken over the zoo,\u201d says Robbie McEwen on Eurosport. Jumbo\u2013Visma rider Wilco Kelderman is the latest rider to try to attack, a weird state of affairs when you could be forgiven for presuming he\u2019d be tasked with protecting Jonas Vingegaard. Back in the bunch, neither vingegaard nor Pogacar have any teammates around them, but the latter is tracking the former\u2019s every move. 118km to go: Wout van Aert is next to go and on a speedy downhill, opens a gap of 18 seconds. What passes for the peloton is about \u2013 and this is a very rough estimate from an aerial view \u2013 about 60 riders strong. Van Aert will presumably be hoping some riders can bridge the gap from the bunch to join him. 126km to go: There\u2019s not a moment of respite as Soudal Quick-Step rider Dries Devenyns tries to attack but sees his effort foiled. The start to this stage has been little short of bonkers and the GC leaders won\u2019t be enjoying it one bit. Nobody is in control of what appears to be a lawless wild west of a bunch. 127km to go: We\u2019re still waiting for a breakaway but we do have the makings of a GC battle on our hands. Simon Yates is in a group alongside current King of the Mountains Neilson Powless, that is a minute down on the yellow jersey group. 131km to go: The three escapees are reeled in as another four riders including Pidcock and Wout van Aert try their luck with an attack. They crest the top of the mountain and have a short downhill before a series of uncategorised climbs. 133km to go: Alaphilippe, Omar Fraile and Matteo Jorgensen open a gap of 10 seconds on the bunch as the continue their climb to the top of Col des \u00c9scorban. Back in the bunch, Tom Pidcock tries to leap across. 135km to go: Well into the second climb of the day, up the category three Col des \u00c9corbans, Julian Alaphilippe mounts another attack, taking several riders with him. They\u2019ve opened a tiny gap on the yellow jersey group. 136km to go: It\u2019s been a frantic, helter-skelter start to today\u2019s stage, reminsicent of the early stages of stage 10. We\u2019re still waiting for a breakaway to form. 138km to go: The peloton has split into two distinct group following that crash on a fast downhill. David De La Cruz\u2019s race is over and he is now in an ambulance. Fingers crossed he\u2019ll be OK. 140km to go: Astana rider David De La Cruz hits the deck with another rider from Groupama FDJ and looks quite badly hurt, lying flat on his back in a ditch. Hopefully it\u2019s nothing too serious. His counterpart from the French team remounts and continues. 142km to go: Wout van Aert and three others, try to escape. There are two Lotto Dstny riders in the quartet. 144km to go: A group of 16 riders have been dropped by the green jersey group, who are around 20 seconds clear of the stragglers 145km to go: Dani Martinez is first over the top of the climb, followed by Giulio Ciccone. 147km to go: The peloton has opened a gap of around 37 seconds on a group containing the sprinters, who are in for another torrid afternoon. 150km to go: The peloton remains largely intact as they make their way up the climb with Mattias Skjelmose and Dylan van Baarle at the front. They pull away from the bunch along with another rider whose identity I will reveal as soon as I figure out who it is. 151km to go: Peter Sagan and Caleb Ewan have been dropped on the first climb. It\u2019s sad to see a legend like Sagan struggling like this in his final Tour but fair play to him for raging against the dying of the light. 152km to go: Today\u2019s first climb is the category three C\u00f4te de Thizy-les-Bourgs, which is 633m high and 4.3km in length with an average gradient of 5.6 per cent. 157 to go: The riders are approaching the first official climb of the day with the Slovenian Bahrain Victorious rider Matej Mohoric trying to put some distance between himself and the bunch. He\u2019s unable to snap the elastic. 160km to go: The peloton remains intact but is quite strung out. Julian Alaphilippe is at the front, baring his teeth in both a literal and metaphorical sense. 161km to go: The early leaders are reeled in by the bunch. Thwarted in his lengthy breakaway attempt two days ago, Krists Neilands is next to try his luck with an attack. 162km to go: Fred Wright and Alberto Bettiol were first to leap across to join Pedersen and were followed by Mathieu van der Poel. 168km to go: Gogl gets a new wheel and a push back to the peloton from a Tour motorbike pillion passenger, Christian Prudhomme waves his flag, his car accelerates up the road and the riders begin racing. The road starts going upwards immediately and Mads Pedersen is the first to launch an attack. The roll-out continues: Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck rider Michael Gogl punctures his back wheel moments before the signal to begin racing is given, so there\u2019ll be a delay until he gets his spoons, bucket of water and puncture repair kit out. Mathieu van der Poel: Rated as the best lead-out man in gthe business, the Dutch Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck rider was nowhere to be seen as his teammate Jasper Philipsen sprinted to his fourth bunch sprint win in this Tour yesterday. He has revealed he has been suffering from an illness over the past two days and simply didn\u2019t have the energy to help his teammate yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s not going worse so I hope I can improve from today on,\u201d he said this morning. \u201cI will see how the legs feel but I have already got my voice back. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m really sick but I\u2019ve had some sort of infection. My sleep is OK but I\u2019m not feeling 100 per cent. We\u2019ll see how it goes today.\u201d Rolling, rolling, rolling \u2026 The roll-out continues and with over half the race concluded, it seems remarkable that Jakobsen is only the eighth rider to leave this year\u2019s Tour. I\u2019m happy to stand corrected but going on memory alone, the rate of attrition usually seems to be a lot higher. Stage 12: The riders are meandering through the neutral zone and will be given the signal to begin racing in approximately 10 kilometres time. The Soudal-Quick Step rider and European champion has withdrawn from the Tour, stating that his knee is not recovering from the injuries he sustained in a crash towards the end of stage four. He says he has no chance of making it to Paris and has decided to abandon. \u201cDue to my stage four crash, and after discussions with the team, we decided it\u2019s better for me to stop my Tour de France journey here,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point it seems impossible for me to get to Paris, as I am not recovering, and my body is not healing from the crash. \u201cI\u2019m very sad to leave the Grande Boucle, because I had big goals for this race and wanted to be at my best with the team. I will now take some time to recover and clear my head, and hopefully be back at my best later this season.\u201d Roanne, today\u2019s starting town: \u201cThe town is renowned for its extraordinary number of starred chefs, inspired primarily by the Troisgros family,\u201d explains the Tour handbook. \u201cBut Roanne has also made waves on the basketball court, its Chorale team winning the French championship twice, in 1959 and 2007. \u201cThe following year, Roanne hosted a Tour start for the first time and in doing so provided Sylvain Chavanel with an instinct for victory, the Frenchman claiming his first Tour stage success in Montluc\u0327on at the end of one of his trademark breakaways. Since then, Roanne was the setting for a Wout van Aert time trial success in the 2019 Crite\u0301rium du Dauphine\u0301.\u201d Christian Prudhomme on stage 12: \u201cThe formation of the breakaway will be one of the critical moments on this hilly stage,\u201d writes the race director in the Tour handbook. \u201cAs the race passes through the vineyards that produce the Beaujolais vintages, there could well be a lot of action before the climbs of the Croix Montmain and Croix Rosier. The uphill finale may well produce an excellent sprint contest between a small group of riders.\u201d Yellow: Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) Green: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) Polka-dot: Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) White: Tadej Pogacar (UAE Emirates) Stage 11 report: Jasper Philipsen took his fourth win of this Tour de France, claiming stage 11 from Clermont-Ferrand to Moulins by sprinting clear of his closest rival Dylan Groenewegen, of Team Jayco AlUla, in the final 100 metres. Jeremy Whittle reports from Moulins \u2026 Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) 46hr 34min 44sec Tadej Pogacar (UAE Emirates) +17sec Jai Hindley (Bora-Hansgrohe) +2min 40sec Carlos Rodriguez (Ineos Grenadiers) +4min 22sec Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) +4min 34sec William Fotheringham on stage 12: This is the sort of stage the Tour organiser, Christian Prudhomme, loves, peppered with medium-difficulty climbs where anything can happen. Stage hunters such as Julian Alaphilippe, Magnus Cort and company will love it, and overall contenders who have flopped thus far will see a chance for redemption. But for a team trying to control the race, it will be a nightmare in the Beaujolais vineyards.

Last month saw a \u201cweak\u201d El Ni\u00f1o form, a periodic climatic event where the circulation of the equatorial Pacific Ocean shifts and its temperature rises, causing knock-on heat around the world, according to an update from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). This Ni\u00f1o, which has replaced a three-year period of its reverse condition, La Ni\u00f1a, which typically cools the globe, will almost certainly strengthen throughout the year, with an 81% chance it will peak with a \u201cmoderate to strong intensity\u201d between November and January, Noaa said. There is a one-in-five chance that this event will be of \u201chistoric\u201d strength, rivaling the major one experienced in 1997, Noaa said. Even if the record is not threatened, however, \u201cEl Ni\u00f1os tend to elevate global mean temperatures, so I would not expect this event to be an exception,\u201d said Michelle L\u2019Heureux, a Noaa meteorologist. The developing event has been closely watched by scientists as it is compounding the excess heat spurred by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. Last week was, preliminary data suggests, the hottest week ever reliably recorded, following a June that was the hottest ever documented globally. More than 100 million people in the US are currently under heat warnings, with scorching conditions felt across Texas and the south-west in recent weeks. Heatwaves have also roiled China, India, parts of Europe and the Arctic. The heat is not confined to the land, with Noaa confirming on Thursday that ocean surface temperatures were at a record high for a third consecutive month in June, with marine heatwaves sweeping the North Atlantic to the UK, as well as imperiling ailing coral reefs found off Florida. The developing Ni\u00f1o is likely to push the world towards even more record-breaking temperatures, scientists warn, as the tangible impacts of the climate crisis continue to unfold. \u201cWe have a major El Ni\u00f1o event on our hands, it will certainly continue to develop, and it will almost certainly contribute to 2023 being the hottest year on record,\u201d said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe combination of human-caused warming and this emerging event is already wreaking havoc across the northern hemisphere this summer in the form of record heat, drought, wildfires and floods.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b96", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/13/its-dr-sunak-and-mr-hyde-the-existence-of-two-rishs-would-explain-a-lot", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "It\u2019s Dr Sunak and Mr Hyde: the existence of two Rish!s would explain a lot | John Crace", "lead": "Here we had one of the Sunaks announcing the very opposite on pay of what had been said previously", "author": "John Crace", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:56:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099604", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7dbb930ebcb2f84ff92630e421bab10e90729864/1190_53_4638_2784/500.jpg", "body": "It was a brisk and businesslike Rishi Sunak who raced into the Downing Street media room at lunchtime. The desperation of someone keen to project an air of getting things done. Sooner or later. Usually later. At least, we had to assume it was the prime minister. Though it could have been a doppelganger. It\u2019s a while since Sunak had appeared in person before a UK audience. Still, best to take these things on trust. Good news, said Rish!. Of course it was. He wouldn\u2019t have shown his face if he didn\u2019t think he had a positive story to tell. Then it would have been just slipped out in a written ministerial statement. The government had agreed to accept the recommendations of the independent pay review boards and give public sector workers a rise of between 6 and 7%. Still in effect a pay cut, given inflation, on top of real-terms cuts over the past 13 years. But he didn\u2019t think to mention that. No need to spoil the Mr Nice Guy narrative. \u201cWe are accepting the recommendations in full,\u201d Sunak said magnanimously. Er \u2026 let\u2019s think this one through. The whole point of an independent pay review board is that it\u2019s not independent. It\u2019s totally rigged. Packed with government stooges who have been briefed to see if they can get away with offering workers the bare minimum. In which case, if even they think teachers and NHS staff are worth 6.5% then the chances are it\u2019s at the bottom end of what they should be getting. Generous, it isn\u2019t. Hold that thought. Because most of us \u2013 those of us who are still vaguely sentient at least \u2013 could have sworn we remembered Sunak telling us only a few weeks ago that a 6.5% pay rise was inflationary and unaffordable. Or maybe that was a different Sunak who was saying that. The one who prefers to stay hidden indoors. Come to think of it, the existence of two Sunaks \u2013 Dr Sunak and Mr Hyde \u2013 is maybe the best explanation of the current car wreck of a government. Suddenly things make sense. If not in a good way. Anyway, here we had one of the two Sunaks \u2013 let\u2019s hope there doesn\u2019t turn out to a third Sunak somewhere: that really would be confusing. Not so say terrifying \u2013 glibly announcing the very opposite of what he had said previously. And we were all meant to have a memory wipe. The past nine months had never happened. Here was the new reality. The independent pay review boards had made their recommendations and he had accepted them. Just like that. He hadn\u2019t said they were unaffordable and put the country through months of unnecessary industrial action only to change his mind at the last minute. Because one of the Sunaks would never have dreamed of doing that. One of them was a man who had told us we could trust him to tell the truth. A man of his word. Except he was now turning out to be a man of many words. Most of them contradictory. The new honesty, integrity and professionalism. \u201cIt would be wrong to fund the pay rises by increasing taxes or borrowing,\u201d continued Rish!. So instead he would be paying for them by increased departmental efficiencies and savings. Oh, goody. AKA the magic money tree, cuts to public services and redundancies. Most public sector services are already underfunded and understaffed. But hey, we\u2019re British and we can take it. There is no greater glory than to be asked to die on an NHS waiting list. But look! Sunak had been far too generous as it was in giving people not enough money to live on. Now he wanted to get tough. He had gone the extra mile by offering the bare minimum. And he was pleased the teaching unions had come onside. They weren\u2019t that bothered if there were cuts or not. Now he was asking everyone else who was on strike to do likewise. He wasn\u2019t going to negotiate again. This was his final offer. Except he had said his previous offer of 3.5% was his final offer. Or was that Mr Hyde\u2019s final offer? Either way, the NHS unions didn\u2019t seem particularly impressed. Most of the questions from journalists homed in on how the government was going to pay for the wage rises. Easy, said one of the Sunaks. We were going to charge migrants more for visas and increase the immigration health surcharge. That would raise \u00a31bn. More or less. Less, probably. Fine \u2026 so where was the other \u00a32bn-\u00a34bn going to come from? Oh that? Well, you know. Something would probably turn up. Stop talking the country down. This was meant to be a good news day. He didn\u2019t say whether frontline services would be protected. Probably not then. Still, we were a bit nearer to which Sunak was in the room by the end. Asked if he could put a figure to his inflation target, he suddenly became all coy. When he had said he would halve inflation, he hadn\u2019t meant it to be taken literally. Rather, it was just meant as mood music. People would know the target had been hit when they could be talked into feeling better about themselves. I\u2019ve got news for him. People won\u2019t feel better when inflation hits 5.35%. They will just be getting more broke slightly less slowly. This was the Sunak who couldn\u2019t tell the truth. Earlier in the morning, one of the Sunaks had made a rare appearance in the Commons. The speaker even said how nice it was to see him after so long. Rish! didn\u2019t look amused as he prepared to give his Nato statement. Not the most testing of hours as everyone is agreed on its importance and the need to offer ongoing support to Ukraine. Though this didn\u2019t stop this Sunak from getting quite snitty. He needs the country to show its gratitude to him for all the tremendous work he has been doing on its behalf. \u201cLabour didn\u2019t want me to go to Vilnius,\u201d he snarked. Keir Starmer looked bemused. He had never said that. It had been his excuse for missing prime minister\u2019s questions the week before that everyone had taken exception to. Hmm, Sunak snorted. At least Ukraine appreciates me. Whichever Sunak it was, it was the thin-skinned one. Depraved New World by John Crace (Guardian Faber, \u00a316.99) is out now.

Pita Limjaroenrat\u2019s progressive Move Forward party, which campaigned on a promise of change after nine years of rule by a former army chief, gained the most votes two months ago, but election rules rewritten after a military coup in 2014 require him to have majority support from parliament to become prime minister. He had formed a coalition with other opposition parties that was expected to grant him 312 votes, but to reach the threshold of 375, Pita also needed to win support from MPs outside his bloc or unelected senators in the upper house. However, all the current senators were appointed by the military and are seen as part of the conservative establishment. Pita ran unopposed in the vote but failed to gain a majority in parliament, made up of 749 members. Only 324 supported him, including 13 senators, while 182 voted against. A further 199 abstained. Speaking after the vote, Pita said he accepted the result but that he was not going to give up. \u201cThank you for the 13 votes [from senators] who are brave enough to reflect [the] people\u2019s voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand there\u2019s a lot of pressure on them, as well as several incentives that didn\u2019t allow them to vote in alignment with the people. But I\u2019m not giving up, I\u2019m going to strategise once again.\u201d The comment sections of livestreams broadcasting the vote were filled with anger towards senators, saying they had failed to respect the will of the people and that those who had abstained were a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. Near to parliament, shipping containers were stacked and razor wire was put on overpasses to deter demonstrations. Move Forward had campaigned on the promise of major reform, including breaking up monopolies, ending military conscription, removing the military\u2019s influence from politics and amending a strict law that forbids criticism of the monarchy. The pledge on the monarchy is highly controversial among conservatives and, in a parliamentary session before the vote, it was repeatedly cited as a reason why senators and MPs would not support him. Some accused Pita of risking chaos and seeking to undermine the royal family. One senator, Seree Suwanpanont, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this operation is aiming to overthrow [the royals]. How can we, the senators, support you to do this?\u201d Two days have been set aside next week for a repeat of the ballot and Pita can run again. If he does so, he is unlikely to be able to garner enough support to pass, said Punchada Sirivunnabood, an associate professor at Mahidol University. \u201cFor the senate, it\u2019s going to be very difficult for [Move Forward] to get more votes in the second round, and the dangerous thing is [that] those who voted [for Pita] might be lobbied by other senators to not vote in the second round,\u201d she said. Adding to Pita\u2019s troubles, he is facing two legal cases in the constitutional court, including over an allegation that he breached election rules by owning media shares, which he denies. The second case centres on a claim that his pledge to reform lese-majesty law, which protects the monarchy from criticism, amounted to an attempt \u201cto overthrow the democratic regime of government with the king as a head of state\u201d. Thailand has some of the world\u2019s strictest such legislation, under which criticism of the royals can lead to up to 15 years in prison. More than 250 people, including children, have been charged under the law since 2020. In parliament, Pita insisted that the allegations against him were unproven and he was still eligible to become prime minister. He also sought to allay concerns over his stance on the royal family, saying he believed that the Thai monarchy would continue. He said he was concerned that the institution and the lese-majesty law were being used as tools for political attacks. \u201cSeveral groups are trying to block me because they are losing benefits,\u201d Pita said, adding that the same people used the monarchy as a pretext to oppose change. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to face this problem maturely and solve it at its root, by ending the use of the monarchy in political conflicts, and finding a way to maintain good relations between the king and the people in these changing times, in line with a modern democratic society.\u201d It is likely that Move Forward\u2019s coalition partner, Pheu Thai, the party associated with the exiled leader Thaksin Shinawatra, will put forward a candidate for either the second or third ballot. A scenario where a Pheu Thai candidate is selected as prime minister may be acceptable to some voters, including those who want to oust Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has been in power since the coup, said Punchada. But young people are less likely to be satisfied with this arrangement, she added, saying they will protest, though it is unclear whether they will be able to sustain demonstrations. Napon Jatusripitak, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, said the events in parliament could \u201cignite substantial frustration and discontent among the public, particularly among those who feel that the democratic process has been undermined by actors or institutions that appear to prioritise interests other than the popular will\u201d. Crowds gathered in central Bangkok on Wednesday evening, some holding signs that read \u201crespect my vote\u201d and \u201csenators don\u2019t vote against the people\u2019s will\u201d. Arnon Nampa, a human rights lawyer and activist at the forefront of the monarchy reform protests of 2020, told those assembled: \u201cTomorrow, if we are betrayed, if we are prevented from having a government elected by the people, we will definitely stand up and fight.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b98", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/13/ukraines-top-security-official-dismisses-ben-wallaces-criticisms-of-kyiv", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ukraine\u2019s top security official dismisses Ben Wallace\u2019s criticisms of Kyiv", "lead": "Oleksiy Danilov says UK defence secretary misspoke when calling for more gratitude as he was \u2018emotional\u2019", "author": "Shaun Walker, Nick Hopkins and Jamie Wilson in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:31:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099640", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a110e9acc04d414e6069b75c05d53170a9441a94/0_635_3836_2302/500.jpg", "body": "Ukraine\u2019s top security official has dismissed criticism of Kyiv from British defence secretary Ben Wallace, suggesting Wallace misspoke due to a surfeit of emotion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to what he said,\u201d Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s security council, told the Guardian in Kyiv on Thursday. \u201cEveryone can say something when they are emotional and then regret it \u2026 I know for sure this isn\u2019t his actual position.\u201d Wallace criticised Ukraine on Wednesday for treating western allies \u201clike Amazon\u201d, providing lists of weapons it required and for not being thankful enough for western military aid. \u201cWhether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,\u201d said Wallace. The remarks caused surprise and confusion in Kyiv, as they appeared to jar with most British government statements offering unequivocal support for Ukraine, and Wallace had widely been seen as one of Kyiv\u2019s biggest champions among western politicians. The criticism appears to have been a response to an outburst of irritation from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy over the failure of Nato to agree on a concrete timeline to invite Ukraine to join the alliance prior to this week\u2019s summit in Vilnius. Prime minister Rishi Sunak swiftly distanced himself from Wallace\u2019s remarks and Zelenskiy, speaking in Vilnius on Wednesday, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what he means, how else we should be thankful. Let him write to me \u2026 Maybe in the morning we should wake up and personally thank the minister.\u201d On Thursday, Danilov was keen to move on from the row, portraying Wallace\u2019s words as a solitary ill-advised outburst rather than an indication of fatigue creeping in among Ukraine\u2019s allies. He insisted Ukraine had always been grateful for western support. \u201cWe\u2019d like more, but we are grateful for what we already have,\u201d he said. Speaking from his office in a fortified compound of government buildings, with a large screen on one wall showing detailed maps of Russian rocket strikes on Ukraine over recent months, Danilov made a point of singling out British support for Ukraine, contrasting it with some other countries. \u201cIf everyone had helped us as much as Britain helps us, we would have a totally different situation now,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly thanks to Britain we were able to withstand the very first period of the war, as well as the United States. The very first person who our president talked to at the beginning of the war was Boris [Johnson]. I still have this historic recording,\u201d he continued. Although Zelenskiy travelled to Vilnius furious at the lack of a firm Nato commitment, he later switched messaging and has been keen to portray the summit as a win for Ukraine, noting particularly a pledge of support from the G7. The G7 nations vowed their \u201cunwavering commitment to the strategic goal of creating a free, independent, democratic, and sovereign Ukraine\u201d and said each country would focus on bilateral support to help boost Ukraine\u2019s military capability. \u201cThe main result for us is that we will have direct dialogue with seven countries. With each country we will have an individual approach and see the best way of cooperation possible,\u201d said Danilov. He claimed that the G7 announcement on long-term support for Ukraine was one more nail in the coffin of Russia\u2019s imperial ambitions. \u201cThe most positive outcome of this summit is that it put an end to the restoration of the Russian empire. Russia cannot be an empire without Ukraine, and after what they\u2019ve done to us, we will never be together with them for at least 50, 80, 100 years,\u201d he said. The Nato summit came as Ukraine\u2019s much-anticipated counteroffensive is making slow progress, and Russia continues to bombard Ukrainian cities with missiles and drones. Military authorities said on Thursday morning that 20 Russian drones had been shot down over Kyiv and the surrounding region overnight, with four people injured in the city, two from smoke inhalation and two from shrapnel. Danilov urged patience on the counteroffensive. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat unripe fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you know the weather in Ukraine, you know when the majority of fruits become ripe: August and September,\u201d he said with a smile. He added that constant pressure to show results was unhelpful. \u201cThe situation with the counteroffensive was blown up in the world media. It\u2019s not a sporting competition. There\u2019s a lot at stake, people\u2019s lives are at stake,\u201d he said. Danilov also called on the west to work out a strategy for dealing with postwar Russia, saying the aborted armed revolt by warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin \u201cshould ring alarm bells\u201d in the west. Instead of fearing that a Ukrainian victory would destabilise Russia, the west should focus on planning for the scenario of a collapse of power in Moscow, he said. \u201cChaos will come [to Russia] whatever happens \u2026 In the west, not everyone is ready for a Ukrainian victory. The big problem is nobody has an answer what to do with Russia, what it would look like after the war, what its place in the world will be. It\u2019s definitely not going to look like how it does now. It will be fragmented, fragmented from the inside, and the world should be ready for that,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b99", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/13/songs-of-summer-2023", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Song of the summer 2023: writers pick their tracks of the season", "lead": "From Kylie Minogue to Jorja Smith, Guardian writers have picked the song they will be playing on repeat for the summer", "author": "Adrian Horton, Owen Myers, Jim Farber, Kate Hutchinson, Benjamin Lee, Alaina Demopoulos, Michael Cragg, Bryan Armen Graham, Laura Snapes, Rob LeDonne and Ben Beaumont-Thomas", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:30:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099657", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/36dce462145cf8f8c6a4e492432e1b971d200224/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "Charli XCX \u2013 Speed Drive This summer\u2019s Barbie movie/marketing campaign has been at once fun and sinister. It\u2019s hot pink, tongue-in-cheek frivolity; it\u2019s the tip of a wave of revisionist IP. Speed Drive, the pop chameleon Charli XCX\u2019s contribution to the soundtrack, follows suit. A hyperpop banger \u201cabout just being hot\u201d with its foot on the gas for all of one minute, 58 seconds, it feels potentially designed for TikTok virality \u2013 short, endlessly loopable, the soundtrack to a hot girl summer. It\u2019s also addictive, playful fun, the sonic equivalent of barreling down the highway with your friends, late-night adrenaline, temporarily impenetrable confidence, uppers. No thoughts, just frenetic vibes on loop, thanks in part to a version of Toni Basil\u2019s Mickey reprocessed for screen-addled brains. Once you\u2019ve rewired to the song\u2019s relentless 174bpm, it\u2019s difficult to come back down. (Do not try to parallel park to this song.) Am I getting steamrolled by the commerce machine? Maybe, but Speed Drive is a high I\u2019ll keep chasing all summer long. Adrian Horton Kylie Minogue \u2013 Padam Padam Any number of artists could have done Padam Padam, but only Kylie Minogue could nail its end-of-the-pier humor and coquettish sexuality \u2013 and sell the absurdity of it all like it is the secret to life. The lead single from her 16th album is a full love boat fantasy laced with below-deck seediness; you can imagine its metallic echoing through a cruise ship engine room amid hissing turbines and sea men wielding heavy machinery. It\u2019s made for this summer\u2019s best memes, but Padam Padam is stickier than a passing fad, with a vampish undercurrent of thick bass and pitched down vocals alongside cheeky demands to get your kit off. And while Minogue\u2019s recent singles have been colored by wistful longing and a refusal to be counted out, Padam Padam is unburdened by the personal narrative of its performer, freeing Minogue up to play sunny showgirl once more. It exists in its own shiny bubble of dance-pop joy. Owen Myers The Dare \u2013 Sex Some of the best songs of summer ooze sex. My pick for the best summer song of 2023 \u2013 a song that\u2019s actually called Sex \u2013 oozes the virtual opposite. While this hilarious ditty by The Dare has been seen by many as a throwback to the randy indie sleaze scene, it\u2019s more like a wacky send-up of it. The clunking synth beat in the song is about as a funky as a metronome, the vocals about as erotic as a zombie, and the lyrics the precise inverse of pillow talk. \u201cSex, it\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of / Some people call it \u2018love\u2019 / I might even finish way too quick,\u201d deadpans Harrison Patrick Smith, the 27-year-old New Yorker who performs as the Dare. Along with that cheeky salute to premature ejaculation, Smith\u2019s blunt verse also includes allusions to incest, S&amp;M, threeways and a hit-it-and-quit-it situation. His couplets can be clever in a Wet Leg meets Kim Petras\u2019s Slut Pop sort of way \u2013 ie \u201cSex / It doesn\u2019t hurt to try / Sometimes the hurt is why.\u201d Or, \u201cSex, to me / It\u2019s just a mystery / A lie we tell / Together we can prove it.\u201d The music has some smart twists too, especially halfway through, when a putrid slab of synthesized something comes plopping into the mix with a fury that evokes nothing so much as someone taking a dump in the middle of the recording. Critics of the song \u2013 and there have been many - call it \u201ccringy\u201d. I call it something else: \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Jim Farber Jorja Smith \u2013 Little Things The British singer Jorja Smith caused a minor stir last summer with her track All of This, when accusations of appropriation were levelled at its take on a style of house music that originated in South Africa called amapiano. But her latest single, Little Things, hones in on dancefloors closer to home. Its clackety-clack rhythmic workout is reminiscent of the glory days of UK funky (\u201csi-mi-nuh party hard\u201d), while the jaunty jazz-piano flourishes could have come off any broken beat classic. Production by P2J and New Machine aside, this is a nimble-footed anthem for the summer of singledom, where Smith enters a room, spots a hottie and hopes for a quick fling with them before she heads home. Smith is perhaps best known for her smouldering torch songs and it\u2019s refreshing to hear her in this new light: fun, flirty and feeling herself in the run-up to her new album, falling or flying. The drum\u2019n\u2019bass remix with Nia Archives, meanwhile, turbo-charges the BPM and takes Little Things from the house party to the festival. Kate Hutchinson Olivia Rodrigo \u2013 Vampire In a sea of sub-Swiftian young singer-songwriters, ex-Disney star Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s poignant debut Driver\u2019s License drove its way into our heads and hearts back in 2021 for its sad specificity. There was pulsing, prickly anger but it was overtaken by melancholy even when the song eventually goes up a gear. For sophomore album-starter Vampire, that sadness has been sucked out, falling tears replaced with growing bile. The 20-year-old is in a justified rage at a blood-sucking, fame-fucking opportunist (who could be anyone from her ex Zack Bia or, if some theorists are to be believed, alleged ex-friend Taylor Swift herself) and backed by frantic, thrilling piano, recalling both Elton John and the Beatles (the old guard\u2019s warm embrace of Rodrigo is easily explainable), she swiftly convinces us to remain fixed in her corner. Like Driver\u2019s License, it starts somewhere small and ends somewhere huge, and like that song it\u2019s a canny, cathartic place for us to exorcise our own demons, whatever or whomever they may be. Benjamin Lee Jessie Ware \u2013 That! Feels Good! With respect to the likes of Boygenius and Weyes Blood, as the world burns, I refuse to listen to sad music. I am simply depressed enough! You\u2019ll find me instead on dancefloors both literal and imagined, which is why I fully support pop\u2019s current obsession with disco and house-tinged songs. Beyonc\u00e9 got the party started with last year\u2019s instant classic Renaissance, and Jessie Ware continues the disco revival with my personal song of the summer, That! Feels Good! Ware enlisted a chorus of famous voices like Kylie Minogue and R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy to coo the titular line in a euphoric spoken-word intro, Love to Love You-style. Then the bass line kicks in, staccato, bouncing and rollicking, the musical embodiment of a night out. Salted rims and pink champagne feature into the lyrics, but it\u2019s not all fluff. \u201cJust remember, pleasure is a right,\u201d Ware sings during the bridge. Pop music traffics fantasies, and these days, it can feel like the ultimate fantasy is just making it to Friday night. Alaina Demopoulos Amaarae \u2013 Counterfeit Everything about Ghanaian American Amaarae\u2019s recent second album, Fountain Baby, screams summer idyll. Firstly, there\u2019s the shower-based artwork\u2019s confident sexual desire with a hint of practicality given heatwave-induced sweatiness, while musically it\u2019s a luxurious take on the perfect barbecue soundtrack, all muscle-relaxing polyrhythms, steel pan filigrees and sauntering horn sections. It\u2019s inclusive too: prefer your summer soundtrack to have a hint of emo? Enjoy Sex, Violence, Suicide\u2019s frantic punk-pop coda. But it\u2019s the confident swagger of Counterfeit that stands out. Built around a re-recorded sample of Clipse\u2019s 2006 Neptunes-produced heater, Wamp Wamp (What It Do), it reverberates with a heady sense of abandon, its playground chorus of \u201cRich bitch, rich bitch / Na-na-na-na-na\u201d an intoxicating, drinks aloft mantra. While Clipse paired their braggadocio with nihilism, here Amaarae is far more playful, flitting between love for her \u201c30 bitches in the crib\u201d and for her stacks of money. In the end, she chooses the latter: \u201cI reminisce and kiss the cash \u2018cause really that\u2019s my baby.\u201d An unrelatable sentiment for most, sure, but the best summer anthems are all about fantasy. Michael Cragg Coi Leray \u2013 Players (DJ Saige remix) The fast-rising New Jersey-bred emcee scored her first top-10 hit with Players, the lead single off her sophomore LP which sampled Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five\u2019s The Message and inspired remixes from DJ Smallz and David Guetta over the winter. But the DJ Saige rework that dropped at the end of March, adding a fresh verse from Busta Rhymes while interpolating the Brooklyn doyen\u2019s seminal 1997 smash Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See, is more than a fresh coat of paint: it\u2019s pure pop perfection and the brand of weapons-grade earworm with legs that will carry well past Labor Day. The streets have been divided throughout the swift ascent of Leray, the daughter of the Source magazine founder Benzino, who\u2019s been derided as a TikTok rapper and nepo baby/industry plant while also being hailed as one of hip-hop\u2019s most exciting (and over-hated) new talents. Your mileage may vary, but the latest and greatest Players remix \u2013 which has been unavoidable on Hot 97 since it dropped at the end of March \u2013 is the sort of old school/new school marriage with a broad appeal that won\u2019t be ignored. Bryan Armen Graham R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy \u2013 CooCool CooCool is as soft as R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy\u2019s last album, R\u00f3is\u00edn Machine, was fiercely hard. It\u2019s the sound of skin yielding to summer warmth, the first gulp of spritz-hitting, \u201csilly season\u201d, as she puts it, descending to melt away self-seriousness and fear. Made in collaboration with the impish German producer DJ Koze, the lead single from her forthcoming album Hit Parade gradually expands from cicada hiss and ambient glow to playful bass, boisterous brass, noodly little bits of guitar and radiant soul samples via some quizzical yet weirdly perfect samples of someone enthusiastically cleaning their teeth. It\u2019s an incitement to freedom: the fulfilment of, as Murphy puts it, \u201ca life\u2019s work to funkify\u201d. Laura Snapes Dua Lipa \u2013 Dance the Night Considering that it hails from the most talked-about movie of the summer (Barbie, of course), it checks out that it\u2019s also a formidable contender for the singular song of the sweltering season. While showcasing nothing technically groundbreaking in the lyrics department, Dua Lipa\u2019s Dance the Night is a deceptively simple bop which transforms a concept heard a million times over into something fresh and fun. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that the shiny repackaging, wrapped with disco strings and topped with an explosive chorus, comes courtesy Dua Lipa\u2019s go-to co-writer, Caroline Allin (Don\u2019t Start Now, New Rules), along with the mega-producer Mark Ronson, the latter known to enthrallingly toy with the sounds of yesteryear (see: Uptown Funk, or his work with Amy Winehouse). There\u2019s no use in resisting: throw on your best pink threads and let the joy of the track wash over you as you dutifully follow what its title suggests. Rob LeDonne Pangaea \u2013 Installation Across 16 years, Hessle Audio has established itself as one of the UK\u2019s greatest dance music labels: cerebral without being dry, and bass and breakbeat-loving without cleaving to any one genre (Objekt\u2019s Cactus, Joe\u2019s Claptrap, Peverelist\u2019s Dance Til the Police Come and Bruce\u2019s What are just some of their greatest hits). Pangaea, AKA Kevin McAuley, is one of the three founders alongside Ben UFO and Pearson Sound, and his own work perfectly encapsulates Hessle\u2019s balance between clever, artful arrangements and total brainless joy. The breakbeat house anthem Installation is his most commercial track yet: its female vocal, cut up into meaningless but wildly catchy syllables, is joined by the kind of central melody that lads chant on the way to an ill-advised bout of shirtless jetskiing. It\u2019s so appealing right across the summer dance scene \u2013 from pool party to sunlight-denying bunker \u2013 that you could run a sweepstake on how long it\u2019ll be until you hear it after entering the club.

Lee smashed down the door for Asian representation pretty much single- (and bare-) handedly, even if he died too soon to be a beneficiary of it. Lee is one of those rare stars who is bigger than his movies. Despite leaving a slim body of work \u2013 just four complete films \u2013 he practically spawned a whole genre, and wrote the book for Hollywood action to this day. Lee runs through the DNA of global culture: video games, hip-hop and mixed martial arts, not to mention the general rise of the super-fit, zero-body-fat masculine physical ideal. The fact that he died young, in perplexingly banal circumstances (a reaction to a painkiller) only burnishes his myth. Lee also built a unique persona \u2013 intense, disciplined, physical yet cerebral \u2013 light years away from western stereotypes of Asian masculinity that were very much in play when he first came to Hollywood in the mid-1960s. He was born in San Francisco, then grew up in Hong Kong before returning to the US, aged 18. It was a time when east Asian men were depicted as servants, sinister villains or buck-toothed buffoons (often played by white actors \u2013 see Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s). Lee grew exasperated at being used as a subservient sidekick in the TV series The Green Hornet. Despite training a roster of celebrity students in the martial arts (including Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Sharon Tate), Lee realised the US was not ready to accept an Asian leading man. The final insult came with the 1970s TV series Kung Fu. Lee\u2019s involvement in developing the show, which followed a Shaolin monk in the old west, is contested. Either way, he auditioned for the lead role, only to be passed over in favour of David Carradine, who had neither Chinese ancestry nor any knowledge of martial arts. Returning to Hong Kong in 1971, Lee churned out four movies in two years, and exploded into global superstardom. As well as displaying his dazzling physical skills, Lee\u2019s movies were narratives of resistance. He stood with the oppressed factory workers and against criminal corruption in The Big Boss; in Fist of Fury, he embarked on a one-man crusade against colonial oppression in 1920s Shanghai (and, by extension, British-ruled 1970s Hong Kong), forcing his Japanese adversaries to literally eat their words, describing China as \u201cthe Sick Man of east Asia\u201d. In The Way of the Dragon, he saves the family restaurant and tears a strip off Chuck Norris at the Colosseum. It wasn\u2019t just local audiences; Lee became a universal symbol of defiance: a man of colour seeking to express himself with the tools he had available. When Hong Kong students were resisting Chinese authoritarianism in 2019, they adopted Lee\u2019s maxim: \u201cBe water.\u201d The success of these films caught Hollywood\u2019s attention at last, but, even with his classic Enter The Dragon (released a month after his death), Lee wasn\u2019t trusted to carry the movie alone, so Jim Kelly and John Saxon were cast alongside him. The 70s kung fu craze fed into everything from comic books (Marvel\u2019s Stan Lee once described Lee as \u201ca superhero without a costume\u201d) to pop music. By that time, Lee had also reinvigorated the Hong Kong film industry, which has sent a flow of actors westwards ever since: Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Maggie Cheung and, of course, Michelle Yeoh. Not to mention a stream of western martial artists, from Jean-Claude Van Damme to Jason Statham. Equally significant was the export of action film-makers such as John Woo and Yuen Wo Ping, the latter famously giving The Matrix its distinctive action flavour. By the 21st century, Hong Kong-flavoured action had become the must-have ingredient of action cinema and it has remained so ever since. You could draw a direct line from Lee to, say, Tom Cruise\u2019s Mission: Impossible (Woo directed the second instalment), Marvel\u2019s Shang-Chi (the comic was inspired by Lee) or Keanu Reeves\u2019 John Wick (whose star and director, Chad Stahelski, both cut their teeth on The Matrix). And, let\u2019s not forget Quentin Tarantino, who borrowed wholesale from Hong Kong cinema in general (Reservoir Dogs lifted the plot of Ringo Lam\u2019s City on Fire) and, in Kill Bill, Uma Thurman wears a trademark yellow Bruce Lee tracksuit, facing off against \u2026 David Carradine. Tarantino did little to return the favour in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which depicted Lee (played by Mike Moh) as \u201ca little man with a big mouth\u201d, in the words of Brad Pitt\u2019s stunt man, who almost beats him in a fight. It was regarded as an insulting caricature by many, including Lee\u2019s daughter, Shannon. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need to treat him in the way that white Hollywood did when he was alive,\u201d she said. The problems have not totally gone away, in terms of the \u201cwhitewashing\u201d of Asian content, stereotyping and industry underrepresentation. But, there has been progress, and it is Lee we should thank. Beyond that, he is still exhilarating to watch on screen. Much about his movies now appears dated but Lee\u2019s physicality and presence are still awe-inspiring. He was the consummate self-made man, but also a man of the people. No wonder he still strikes a chord."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b9b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/13/boris-johnson-has-forgotten-passcode-for-phone-wanted-by-covid-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson \u2018has forgotten\u2019 passcode for phone wanted by Covid inquiry", "lead": "Spokesperson says ex-PM wants to hand over WhatsApp messages but experts describe latest development as \u2018pretty lame excuse\u2019", "author": "Aletha Adu Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:04:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099692", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c6909a80699e37f3ca3c7979cba36bee03914fdc/0_62_4678_2807/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson\u2019s WhatsApp messages are yet to be received by the Covid inquiry because he is said to have forgotten the passcode for his old phone. The former prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said Johnson still wants to cooperate with the inquiry and did not deny being unable to recall the code. Johnson stopped using the device in May 2021, after receiving security advice once it had emerged his phone number had been accessible online for at least 15 years. Bereaved families and technical experts have rubbished Johnson\u2019s excuse for not being able to send the messages to the inquiry, with experts noting the former prime minister would still be able to access his messages as long as his WhatsApp is backed up. Johnson used the Apple iPhone in question during the coronavirus pandemic, which is likely to contain messages relating to the announcement of lockdowns in 2020. The government handed over the rest of Johnson\u2019s unredacted notebooks, WhatsApp messages and diaries from his time in Downing Street to the inquiry after efforts to prevent their release failed. It had fought the request from the inquiry chair, Lady Hallett, to release them, arguing it should not have to hand over material that was \u201cunambiguously irrelevant\u201d. The argument was dismissed by the high court last week and the Cabinet Office was given until 4pm on Monday to comply with its ruling to pass on the documents. Government officials were continuing to try to retrieve the WhatsApp messages, being held by Johnson\u2019s lawyers, according to the Times, who said they feared that the contents of the device could be deleted if the wrong combination of numbers was entered. Andrew Whaley, a senior technical director at the cybersecurity company Promon, said: \u201cThis is a pretty lame excuse. Provided Boris\u2019s WhatsApp is backed up, accessing the data would take minutes. \u201cYou can simply take out the sim card, put it in another device and install WhatsApp using SMS verification to get access to all your old messages. As this is a diplomatic phone, the security measures may very well be different, but even still, it\u2019s not an impossible task by any means. \u201cThis is likely not a case of Johnson being unable to access his phone, but rather a tactic to try to further evade the release of messages relevant to the inquiry.\u201d However, on Thursday night an ally of Johnson suggested the government had recovered a passcode to unlock the former prime minister\u2019s old handset. The ally, who was not named, told the PA news agency: \u201cIt is not true that Boris does not remember his pin number, it is just that he does not have 100% confidence he remembers it. \u201cSeparately, the government has found its own version of the pin.\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cThe phone is in the possession of Mr Johnson\u2019s lawyers. The government\u2019s own appointed technical experts continue to work to recover material safely from the device. \u201cAs previously stated, Mr Johnson will cooperate fully with the inquiry. He wants to disclose any relevant material which is why he is fully co-operating with this process.\u201d Susie Flintham, the spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \u201cThis is a complete joke. No one seriously believes that Johnson\u2019s messages can\u2019t be accessed because he forgot a passcode that he was apparently using last December. \u201cJohnson needs to take full responsibility for ensuring that these messages are shared in their entirety with the inquiry, and the inquiry must be prepared to take legal action against him if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b9c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/13/why-are-australian-children-dying-from-the-flu-and-what-can-we-do-to-prevent-it", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why are Australian children dying from the flu and what can we do to prevent it?", "lead": "Medical experts say influenza A and B viruses circulating have greater impact on children and urge more vaccinations after second child dies", "author": "Donna Lu Science writer", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:00:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099710", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ec58e08008d0f02953419d447f6b326e7c4b8bc5/0_95_4693_2817/500.jpg", "body": "Health authorities are urging more young people to get the flu vaccine amid warnings that children are at heightened risk from influenza strains circulating this season. An 11-year-old Queensland girl was the second young person reported to die from influenza this week, after a student on the New South Wales Central Coast died days after contracting the virus. The Doherty Institute\u2019s Prof Ian Barr, who is deputy director of the World Health Organization\u2019s collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza, said flu strains circulating this winter had a greater impact on young people. \u201cThe viruses which are circulating this year are influenza A(H1N1) and B viruses \u2013 both of these viruses affect children more than the elderly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the B viruses around much for the last two years.\u201d Children make up a significant proportion of the 153,941 laboratory-confirmed flu cases this year to date. As of 13 July there have been 19,241 cases reported in under-fives, 31,172 cases in five- to nine-year-olds, and 18,678 in 10- to 14-year-olds. More than a third of all cases reported nationally have been in NSW (53,343), with Queensland reporting the second-highest number of infections (48,342). Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup State health authorities across the country told Guardian Australia they had seen high infection and hospitalisation rates in children. In NSW, children aged zero to 16 represented almost 47% of all admissions from emergency departments for influenza-like illness in the week ending 9 July. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said he was \u201cvery concerned about the increase in influenza B cases and the high rate of unvaccinated patients, particularly with school resuming this week\u201d. He said in a statement: \u201cInfluenza B is causing severe illness in otherwise healthy Queenslanders, young people in particular.\u201d \u201cSince 1 July, 78 children aged six months to four years old were hospitalised with flu \u2013 50 with the B strain. Only one of these children was vaccinated.\u201d Dr Paul Armstrong, Western Australia\u2019s acting chief health officer, said almost 40% of those who required hospitalisation for influenza treatment in the state this year were aged under nine. \u201cWA data suggests that we are on track for a large influenza season, similar to 2019, which was the largest on record in WA,\u201d he said in a statement. A South Australia health spokesperson said: \u201cThose aged six months to five years, and five to 15 years are experiencing more influenza infections this year than any other age group.\u201d They noted there had been no reported deaths in children in the state. Influenza B strains accounted for about 20% of the virus circulating in SA. Children normally overrepresented in infection rates Dr Daryl Cheng, an immunisation consultant at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute\u2019s SAEFVIC, said the highest rates of positive flu cases were usually in children under five. \u201cThey are an at-risk group,\u201d he said, adding that testing in this age group may be higher than in adults. Barr agreed that children were typically over-represented in flu infection rates, likely due to more diligent monitoring of symptoms and testing than in adults. Cheng said hospitalisation rates this year were similar to pre-Covid flu seasons. Historical figures show that hospitalisation rates in children under five are much higher than in elderly people. Data recorded between 2006 and 2013 found that hospitalisation rates were highest in children aged zero to five months (192 per 100,000), followed by those aged six to 23 months (109 per 100,000). Flu deaths in kids rare Influenza is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in Australian children, but flu deaths in young people are rare. Cheng has noted \u201cno anomaly or spike\u201d in child deaths from influenza this year to date in Victoria. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean people shouldn\u2019t get the vaccine [to] protect themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still early in the season.\u201d Cheng added there had been deaths in NSW and Queensland \u201cin age groups such as adolescents which are not eligible for flu vaccination as part of the national immunisation program\u201d. Between 2006 and 2013, the influenza mortality rate was the lowest in five- to 11-year-olds of any age group, at 0.05 deaths per 100,000 people, and was less than 0.35 deaths per 100,000 in under-fives. In comparison with kids under five, those aged 65 to 74 were more than twice as likely to die from the flu; in those over 75, the mortality rate was more than 10 times greater. In another study of Australian children hospitalised with influenza between 2010 and 2019, the mortality rate was 0.4% or one in every 2,500 children hospitalised. FluCAN surveillance data as of 25 June, which monitors influenza admissions at 15 hospitals nationally, shows that of those younger than 16 years hospitalised with influenza this year, 5.9% were admitted to ICU. In comparison, 12.1% of adults aged 16 to 64 and 1.8% of adults aged 65 years or older went to ICU. Vaccine coverage low National immunisation data shows that flu vaccine coverage is low in young people, and down about 10 percentage points from last year. Only 23.6% of under-fives and 13.7% of five- to 15-year-olds have been vaccinated this year to date, compared to 61.5% of those over 65. \u201cI suspect it\u2019s probably [a] combination of vaccine fatigue and reduced access to in-person consultations with GPs,\u201d Barr said. \u201cKiddies are going back to school now so there will probably be a little bit of a spike,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople should still consider getting vaccinated if they haven\u2019t already been infected.\u201d Influenza vaccinations are free for children aged six months to five years under the National Immunisation Program. They are also included on the childhood vaccination schedule."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b9d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/14/labors-refusal-to-extend-school-chaplaincy-tax-deduction-will-cause-cuts-christian-group-says", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labor\u2019s refusal to extend school chaplaincy tax deduction will cause cuts, Christian group says", "lead": "Parents\u2019 secular education group wants chaplains scrapped and student wellbeing officers employed instead", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099730", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/399e2b19f0eec407e2619e26dbe7d93ecc2d21a3/0_389_4953_2974/500.jpg", "body": "Australia\u2019s largest supplier of school chaplains has labelled the Albanese government\u2019s decision not to extend its eligibility to receive tax deductible gifts \u201cdisappointing and unexpected\u201d. Scripture Union Australia has warned the decision would probably result in cuts to chaplaincy services after Labor allowed its deductible gift recipient (DGR) status, previously granted by the Morrison government, to lapse. The largest provider of school chaplains, Scripture Union Queensland, had been the subject of a complaint to the tax office questioning whether it had breached its tax deductibility status to collect $33m in donations. The complaint noted that the deductible gift-recipient status of SUQ\u2019s schools ministry fund depended on it being for the \u201cfurtherance of religious instruction in government schools in Australia\u201d. The ATO has never revealed the outcome of the complaint, citing secrecy provisions in taxation legislation. The Morrison government temporarily fixed the potential defect in the 2021-22 budget by specifically listing the chaplaincy provider for DGR status from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2023. In early July, SU Australia revealed this status had not been extended, and as a result it \u201cwill no longer be able to issue tax-deductible receipts for donations made [after 1 July 2023] to support a chaplain\u2019s in-school hours\u201d. In an update to its website, since removed, SU Australia explained that \u201csince mid-2000 the [ATO] has allowed your financial donations for chaplaincy in public schools to be tax deductible\u201d. \u201cHowever, the ATO has since changed its stance on this.\u201d The group chief executive of SU Australia, Peter James, said the decision of the federal government to decline its request \u201cwill likely mean some cutbacks to chaplaincy services, however it is too early to predict to what extent\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWhile chaplaincy receives government funding, SU can only provide the number of chaplains, hours and services because of the donations made by thousands of community supporters,\u201d he said. James said financial support \u201cdirectly translates into additional hours of wellbeing services for students in government schools\u201d meaning loss of donations due no longer offering tax deductibility \u201cwill affect these hours\u201d. Since its election in May 2022 the Albanese government has reformed the $60m-a-year program by allowing schools the option to choose either a professionally qualified secular student welfare officer or chaplain. Queensland Parents for Secular State Schools (QPSSS) has argued the fact SU Australia no longer accepts tax deductible donations for chaplaincy is further evidence for the complaint made to the Australian Taxation Office in 2018 that it inappropriately allowed donors to claim a tax deduction. QPSSS complained that Scripture Union Queensland claimed to be able to receive donations to its ministry fund for the \u201cfurtherance of religious instruction in government schools in Australia\u201d, despite the fact the chaplaincy program is based on pastoral care, not religious education. QPSSS said that \u201cschool chaplaincy was an ill-conceived and poorly designed program from the outset\u201d. It cited the fact more than \u201c$1bn of taxpayer money been funnelled to religious organisations to place people hand-picked for their religious beliefs into diverse public schools\u201d. \u201cThe public purse has potentially been deprived of millions of dollars if religious organisations providing chaplains have wrongly issued tax deductible receipts for donations for school chaplaincy.\u201d QPSSS wants the chaplaincy program scrapped in favour of additional funding to state education departments \u201cto directly employ student wellbeing officers selected on merit alone\u201d. This would remove the \u201cblurred lines about what support workers should and should not do in terms of injecting religion into the role\u201d, it said. In 2018 Scripture Union Queensland rejected the charge it had inappropriately claimed tax deductible status for chaplaincy, saying it \u201cmeets its obligations under Australian taxation laws and there has never been an issue raised with us by the ATO\u201d. Asked why it no longer accepts tax deductible donations for chaplaincy, given its earlier position that this was allowable, James said: \u201cSU Australia has always acted within the scope of our DGR entitlements and under advice.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380b9e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/restless-dolly-maunder-by-kate-grenville-review-an-empathetic-story-of-a-formidable-grandmother", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Restless Dolly Maunder by Kate Grenville review \u2013 an empathetic story of a formidable grandmother", "lead": "Author turns her novelist\u2019s eye to her own grandmother, a smart and ambitious woman who became distant and demanding after a lifetime of disappointment", "author": "Kirsten Tranter", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099749", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/553f82b2a6492c3d238cb7bbf1e8c38231c2e288/0_0_2500_1500/500.jpg", "body": "With this new novel, Kate Grenville returns to her own family as the subject of her fiction and tells the imagined story of her maternal grandmother, Dolly Maunder. Dolly is the kind of smart, wayward woman who has always fascinated Grenville. Born in 1881 on a sheep farm in New South Wales, Dolly loved school and admired the local young female student teacher: \u201cShe was the only woman Dolly knew who wasn\u2019t just at home all day, banging the stove door open and closed, heaving the wet sheets around on washday. It was coming to Dolly slowly, like water seeping into sand: if you were born a girl that was the life you\u2019d have to live. Unless you could find a way out.\u201d At 14, Dolly is put to work in the busy farm household, whipped by her father if the bread doesn\u2019t rise. She never stops looking for \u201ca way out\u201d, and this unquiet restlessness dominates her life. From then on she rarely stops moving, like a creature afraid of being trapped if she stays in one place for too long. What kind of way out might there be for a woman like Dolly? She sees that marriage is just another form of servitude for a woman of her class. But in Bert Russell, a man who courts her with patient persistence, she senses a person who sees her as good for more than making babies and doing housework. Bert turns out to be a terrible philanderer, but he\u2019s a good match in the ways that really count: he has faith in her capacities, her business acumen. They start a shop and gradually acquire more businesses: a boarding house, a pub, a grand hotel. He teaches Dolly to drive and she loves \u201cthe freedom to go\u201d that comes with being able to \u201cgrab her handbag, put on her coat, get in the car and drive off\u201d. The stories about the grandmother that Grenville grew up with were complicated by her mother\u2019s strained relationship with Dolly, whom she regarded as \u201cuncaring, selfish, unloving\u201d. Grenville attempts to step back from the family narrative and ask, in her clear-sighted way, what on earth might have happened to Dolly to make her such a \u201ccold, dominating mother\u201d. Were her dreams of becoming a teacher crushed by her father? Did this lead her to crush her own daughter\u2019s artistic aspirations and \u201cbully\u201d her into the business of pharmacy, which she hated? Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The answers proposed here are all too believable and in many ways tragically ordinary. \u201cGirls were of no account, you learned that early on,\u201d Dolly observes. \u201cGood enough to make the bread and milk the cow, and later on you\u2019d look after the children. But no woman was ever going to be part of the real business of the world.\u201d Dolly proves that to be wrong. But in that struggle, something of her soul is destroyed, cauterised by all the cruelty and disappointment, the \u201cinjustice and frustration\u201d of women\u2019s lot. Her capacity to love her children is fatally compromised. When Dolly embraces her daughter Nance to celebrate her being recognised by her school as \u201cone of our best scholars\u201d, she feels not only \u201clove and pride, but \u2026 something else as well, a tangle of complicated feelings. There was something between them, like a splinter in the middle of a hug. It was that little long-lost Dolly Maunder who would have given anything to have the chance to be one of our best scholars.\u201d This is the tragedy at the heart of Dolly\u2019s story, which is in so many ways a success story of a woman who found a way out. Grenville sees the disappointed child who stands behind the distant, demanding mother and grandmother, and the way that childhood longing haunts her. The novel shows the shadow cast by that loss, the unsolvable tangle it creates, and the terrible scars it leaves. Dolly is a difficult subject in every sense of the word. She resists the lyricism with which Grenville was able to infuse Elizabeth Macarthur, wife of the notorious early settler John Macarthur and subject of Grenville\u2019s most recent two books. Dolly is not deftly ironic, a charming eccentric or a creative spirit. The gods of capitalism move her, not the muses: she comes alive in the cut and thrust of acquisition, trade, sale, profit. This makes her a tough subject in some ways for a novelist like Grenville, who adapts her prose to the dry, laconic mode of Dolly\u2019s worldview. And yet the writing sparkles with Grenville\u2019s gift for transcendently clear imagery, such as her description of how Dolly\u2019s father liked to rehearse tales of childhood humiliation: he \u201ctold over the hurts like jewels,\u201d she writes, \u201cturning them in his memory so that they flashed with his anger.\u201d These injuries were his most cherished treasures, polished rather than healed. There is a relentless, propulsive pace to Restless Dolly Maunder: like the workdays on the farm chronicled here, task after task with no breath between them from dawn to dark, the chapters of Dolly\u2019s life stride from one place to the next, never slowing, enduring lows and enjoying successes always with a view to what can be gained and achieved next, reflecting Dolly\u2019s restlessness. The severe emotional repression of everyone in this world means that even climactic exchanges leave much unsaid. At times, it is hard not to wish for more plot or character development. But the final chapter somehow makes sense of the shape of the story, in the short but impactful meeting it stages between grandmother and granddaughter. The simple, haunting question posed by Dolly to her granddaughter \u2013 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d \u2013 held for so long in the memory of the author, is reshaped a whole lifetime later through the machine for making empathy that is fiction. The result is a work of history, biography, story and memoir, all fused into a novel that suggests the great potential of literary art as redeemer, healer and pathway to understanding.

I see my role in leading the review into women\u2019s football in a similar vein, hoping that through the efforts of the team that took part we will have done the same for the game as a whole through our research and recommendations. The headlines in the women\u2019s game make it look as if it is in a healthy position: records for attendances and TV viewing figures are frequently being broken, and England are the European champions. Nothing can take away from these great achievements but it is like Instagram v reality, and the latter is worrying and we need to address it. We scratched beneath the surface to identify issues that need rectifying. Trying to manage and navigate such a wide\u2011ranging project while ensuring I gave it the care and attention that it deserved was the hardest part, and making sure no stone was left unturned has been a challenge. Every fan, player and stakeholder in women\u2019s football deserved this review to be the best it could be and I put a lot of pressure on myself to ensure that was the case. Four years into retirement, I had hoped the game had moved on in certain areas and in some aspects it has but in others it is still the same as I knew it when playing. I spoke to many current and former players and found out that elements within the professional game are not up to the standards we should strive for. It annoyed me that in 2023 we have incredible women, who are seen as elite athletes, being treated as second-class citizens. We need to be providing the best environment not just for players but for fans and staff, too. The sport deserves that. There need to be minimum standards across the board and we have spelled out what it is going to take to achieve these goals. Players deserve a minimum salary, the best medical care and facilities, and support when transitioning out of their playing careers. The aim was to be punchy and bold to help improve the sport but we had to be pragmatic. We are not here to make headlines, we are here to make change. I could easily have made a recommendation that would have taken the focus away from everything else in the review but was not part of the thinking. We had to focus on what requires the most work immediately. I am sure in years to come another team of people will review what the next steps are to improve women\u2019s football and look at different areas but I am confident our work will put the sport in a better place by turning the sport from vicious cycles into a virtuous one. The levels of participation have been increasing over a lengthy period and we need to allow those who want to play the opportunity to do so within a welcoming environment and with the best facilities available, on and off the pitch. It is not just about having the best at an elite level; we need to have improvements across all levels of the game to make sure it is inclusive to girls and women across all age groups and backgrounds. The sport is growing in popularity and we need to act on this to ensure it continues on an upward trajectory. I am sure there is going to be pushback when something is suggested that costs money but all the recommendations are cost-effective. Business-wise I believe women\u2019s football is in the startup phase and requires investment but I am fully confident that people will get a return on their money. In the next 10 years, with changes, the women\u2019s game could be a \u00a31bn industry. The immediate outlay may seem like a big ask but in a decade it will be seen as one of the best investments that will ever happen. The Women\u2019s Super League was in effect launched as a semi\u2011professional entity in 2011. It has come along over that time and we are at the point where England are European champions. But we cannot put the focus on that. This is a massive turning point in the women\u2019s game and we need to move forward by resetting and reinvesting as we did 12 years ago. There are plenty of examples of people raising the standards and we want this to be widespread. I am asking for minimum standards to be raised and this review shows what it will cost. If this is not acted upon, we are going to miss an opportunity and the momentum the game has gathered in recent years will eventually be lost, leaving a sport that is built on sand to inevitably fall away. I hope people take the time to read the review and the recommendations that I have put forward. It is upon the stakeholders involved to act with urgency to ensure we do not miss an opportunity to build on recent successes. I want the review to spark conversations and educate people on the issues within the game, and I hope that will instigate the positive change required."}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380ba0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/13/uk-told-to-prepare-for-possible-30-increase-in-uncomfortably-hot-days", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK told to prepare for possible 30% increase in uncomfortably hot days", "lead": "Britain and Switzerland among countries that need to adapt most for heating, says research looking at impact of 2C global rise", "author": "Helena Horton Environment reporter", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099785", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6db3aed5281281f5d3ae6a6a6af9cc7bf5f9e263/0_160_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "The UK and Switzerland will see a 30% increase in the number of days of uncomfortably hot temperatures if the world heats by 2C, and are two of the countries which need to adapt the most for global heating, scientists have predicted. The research, published in Nature Sustainability on Thursday, found that while central Africa will see the most extreme temperatures overall, it is mostly northern European countries that will experience the greatest relative increases in uncomfortably hot days. The people and infrastructure in these countries are not prepared for periods of hot weather, the study, based on climate modelling and data from the UK Met Office, predicts. The estimates by researchers at the University of Oxford are conservative, and do not include external factors such as extreme heatwaves, which would come on top of this average increase. Norway will also suffer one of the world\u2019s most dramatic increases in days that require cooling interventions, the study finds, with a 28% increase in days with uncomfortably hot temperatures if the world misses the 1.5C target. Eight of the 10 countries with the greatest relative increase in uncomfortably hot days are expected to be in northern Europe. Researchers said northern European countries had not prepared for sustainable cooling alternatives as homes become uncomfortably hot in the summer months and infrastructure struggles to cope above certain temperatures. Cooling measures needed to face these temperatures include making use of natural ventilation, external solar protection such as window shutters and fans. \u201cFor example, sustainable cooling barely has a mention in the UK\u2019s net zero strategy,\u201d said co-author Dr Radhika Khosla, an associate professor at Oxford\u2019s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment and leader of the Oxford Martin programme on the future of cooling. She said air conditioning could add to the problem if the grid was not decarbonised and fossil fuels were used to cool homes: \u201cWithout adequate interventions to promote sustainable cooling we are likely to see a sharp increase in the use of energy guzzling systems like air conditioning, which could further increase emissions and lock us into a vicious cycle of burning fossil fuels to make us feel cooler while making the world outside hotter.\u201d Currently, buildings in northern Europe are often made to trap heat in the cold seasons and can become swelteringly hot in summer. This needs to change if the world hits 2C of heating and the country faces a new, hotter climate. The co-lead author Dr Jesus Lizana said: \u201cIf we adapt the built environment in which we live, we won\u2019t need to increase air conditioning. But right now, in countries like the UK our buildings act like greenhouses: no external protection from the sun in buildings, windows locked, no natural ventilation and no ceiling fans. Our buildings are exclusively prepared for the cold seasons.\u201d The best way to avoid having to take these measures is to keep the world to the 1.5C of heating pledge made in Paris in 2015, but the chances of this are vanishing as countries burn through more fossil fuels. If this does not happen, northern European countries that do not have cooling measures in place can expect large-scale disruption. The co-lead author Dr Nicole Miranda added: \u201cNorthern European countries will require large-scale adaptation to heat resilience quicker than other countries. Extreme heat can lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion and even death, especially in vulnerable populations. It\u2019s a health and economic imperative that we prepare for more hot days.\u201d Top 10 countries by relative cooling change 1 Switzerland 30% 2 United Kingdom 30% 3 Norway 28% 4 Finland 28% 5 Sweden 28% 6 Austria 24% 7 Canada 24% 8 Denmark 24% 9 New Zealand 24% 10 Belgium 24%"}, {"_id": "64b1411651ac33196d380ba1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/14/how-to-care-for-skin-in-australian-winter-use-thicker-creams-foam-free-cleansers-and-dont-skip-sunscreen", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to care for skin in Australian winter: use thicker creams, foam-free cleansers and don\u2019t skip sunscreen", "lead": "With the change in seasons, it pays to tweak your routine when cleansing and hydrating your face, hands and body", "author": "Sarah Ayoub", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:34.099803", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3cbcf4954abe402772de320107e93d623a49a63f/0_0_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "Australia may be experiencing an unseasonably warm winter, but whenever temperatures drop and heaters switch on, our skin is likely to require a bit of extra care. \u201cYour skin doesn\u2019t necessarily behave the same way year-round and you need to modify your skincare,\u201d says dermatologist Dr Shreya Andric. \u201cIn winter, the air is generally drier and we spend more time inside with heaters. \u201cSkin can become more flaky and potentially irritated if we continue to treat it the same as we would in summer.\u201d One of the biggest problems comes not from cold, but the heaters we use to combat it, says Dr Natasha Cook, a specialist dermatologist. Sitting directly in front of a heater or open fire should be avoided \u201cat all costs\u201d, she says. Not only are they drying, but they damage the \u201cvery important barrier layer\u201d of our skin. Fortunately, if you\u2019re already suffering from dryness or irritation, you only need to make small modifications to your usual skincare routine. Dr Yalda Jamali, a cosmetic doctor, suggests a thicker moisturiser than you\u2019d use in summer, serums containing hyaluronic acid for extra hydration, and a gentle chemical exfoliant once or twice a week to help lift any flakiness that may develop. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared of exfoliating in winter,\u201d Jamali says. \u201cThe skin still would benefit from exfoliation and products can penetrate better on exfoliated skin, but maybe opt for more gentle ingredients such as PHAs [polyhydroxy acids]: lactobionic acid and gluconolactone.\u201d Andric\u2019s preference is to use \u201cfewer but more effective\u201d products. \u201cCleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen are your basics,\u201d she says. \u201cBased on your skin type, you can build from there.

She also suggests choosing an oil-free, non-comedogenic (pore-blocking) moisturiser. \u201cIf you have sensitive skin, choose products that are unfragranced and contain fewer ingredients. Vitamin B3, AKA niacinamide, is excellent for reducing inflammation and restoring skin barrier.\u201d Andric says those with dry skin should look for products with glycerol, hyaluronic acid and ceramides, which will attract moisture and repair the skin barrier. \u201cDrier skin or eczema-prone types will struggle more, so they will need thicker ointment-like moisturisers and potentially apply several times a day,\u201d Cook advises. \u201cDry skin is more than just how it feels or looks. Dry skin cannot function properly and is a cause of a lot of skin issues [like] dermatitis, rosacea [and] rashes.\u201d Do not skip sunscreen \u201cMany people feel they don\u2019t need to use a sunscreen in winter, but in Australia the UV index is often 3 or higher even in the cooler months,\u201d Jamali says. \u201cIf it is, then you need to be using your SPF30+ or higher sunscreen on a daily basis.\u201d Don\u2019t neglect your hands and body Although she recognises \u201cit\u2019s cruel\u201d, Andric suggests sticking to cool, three-to-five-minute showers if you have dry skin, even in the depths of winter. Using a soap-free body wash can also help. And if you are having a bath, Cook says: \u201cAdd in oil to hydrate at the same time.\u201d Once you are out of the bath or shower, Andric suggests patting yourself dry, rather than rubbing, then applying moisturiser top to toe. Cook agrees: \u201cPut moisturiser on straight away, before the skin dehydrates.\u201d As for the skin on your hands, Andric says \u201csoap and water [are] often worse for the skin than alcohol hand gels\u201d. While handwashing is essential for hygiene, she recommends using a soap-free wash where possible and ideally applying a moisturiser after every handwash. \u201cUse gloves when cooking [and] cleaning so that you\u2019re washing the gloves in between steps, rather than your skin,\u201d she adds. Optional extras Jamali says overnight hydrating sleeping masks are \u201ca great easy addition\u201d to your night-time routine and recommends topical retinoids to help increase skin cell turnover. \u201cSome prefer to use retinoid products in the winter as this ingredient usually makes our skin more photosensitive,\u201d she says. For the same reason, \u201cwinter is the perfect time to have in-clinic skin treatments such as laser, needling and chemical peels\u201d, Jamali says. \u201cThis is because in-clinic skin treatments tend to make us more photosensitive and, if exposed to high levels of UV, we may suffer post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation following treatments.\u201d But, she cautions, all of these treatments make wearing sunscreen even more paramount and should only be undertaken after consultation with a dermatologist or cosmetic doctor."}]
