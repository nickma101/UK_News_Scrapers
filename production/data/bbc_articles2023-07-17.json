It will also look at potential earnings when deciding if a degree offers enough value.<br/>Nearly three-in-10 graduates do not progress into highly-skilled jobs or further study 15 months after graduating, according to the OfS. <br/>The OfS already has the power to investigate and sanction universities which offer degrees falling below minimum performance thresholds - but the new rules would require the regulator to limit student numbers for those courses.<br/>The current thresholds for full-time students doing a first degree are for: <br/>Universities UK said the UK had the highest completion rates of any OECD country and overall satisfaction rates were high. <br/>\"However, it is right that the regulatory framework is there as a backstop to protect student interests in the very small proportion of instances where quality needs to be improved,\" a spokeswoman said. <br/>Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the announcement was \"an attack on the aspirations of young people\". <br/>Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said the prime minister was \"out of ideas\" and had \"dug up a policy the Conservatives announced and then unannounced twice over\".<br/>She said: \"Universities don't want this. It's a cap on aspiration, making it harder for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go on to further study.\"<br/>BBC political correspondent Ian Watson said some are asking why the courses are not being scrapped altogether if they are such bad value for money.<br/>Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Education Minister Robert Halfon said putting limits on underperforming degrees will mean those courses \"will then improve\". <br/>\"Students will be able to make informed choices,\" he said. \"If a course has poor outcomes they might choose to do another course at university, they may still decide to do that course but will have the recruitment limits on it.\"<br/>He called Labour's accusation that it was an attack on aspirations \"nonsense\". <br/>\"The Labour party has been obsessed with quantity over quality and had been party of poor standards in education,\" he said. <br/>The idea originated in a 2018 review set up under then-Prime Minister Theresa May. The same review also suggested that more money needed to be pumped into education and that tuition fees needed to be cut - but these are not being implemented.<br/>The new pledge comes ahead of three by-elections in Conservative-held seats on Thursday.<br/>The government also announced it would reduce the maximum fees universities can charge for classroom-based foundation-year courses, from \u00a39,250 to \u00a35,760. In 2021/22, 29,080 students were studying a foundation degree.<br/>Foundation year courses are designed to help prepare students for degrees with specific entry requirements or knowledge, such as medicine and veterinary sciences. <br/>However, the government said research suggested too many people were encouraged to take a foundation year in some subjects like business, where it was not necessary. <br/>University Alliance, which represents professional and technical universities, said cutting fees for foundation year courses was \"disappointingly regressive\" and \"makes them financially unviable to deliver\". <br/>Chief executive Vanessa Wilson said: \"Disadvantaged students and the 'Covid generation' will lose out if this provision is reduced or lost.\"<br/>She added that the government had chosen \"to berate one of the few UK sectors which is genuinely world-leading\". <br/>Mr Sunak said: \"The UK is home to some of the best universities in the world and studying for a degree can be immensely rewarding. <br/>\"But too many young people are being sold a false dream and end up doing a poor-quality course at the taxpayers' expense that doesn't offer the prospect of a decent job at the end of it.\"<br/>Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: \"These new measures will crack down on higher education providers that continue to offer poor quality courses and send a clear signal that we will not allow students to be sold a false promise.\"<br/>University student complaints hit another record high<br/>'Dumbed down' courses 'take advantage' of students<br/>How much will university cost me?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It is the site of the hottest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth: 134F (56.7C). <br/>The usually crowded streets of Las Vegas were considerably emptier than normal on Sunday, with security guards guarding the fountains of upscale casinos and hotels to prevent people from jumping in.<br/>The famous strip was a quiet inferno. Some people walked outside, but mostly just to cross the street to the next casino. And those who did exit were mostly intoxicated. <br/>When one couple was asked why they were outside, they said \"All roads lead to the Bellagio,\" referring to one of the most popular hotels and casinos on the strip. Another group of young men shouted, \"It's Vegas baby! The heat's not going to stop us!\" <br/>But elsewhere in Las Vegas, people were hanging on to any bit of shade, whether it came from the shadow of a building or even a small tree. At a taco shop on the strip, the tables were all full of patrons dripping with sweat and looking utterly wiped out from the heat. Workers too were draped in the booths, not speaking to each other, but fanning themselves down. <br/>Inside the casinos though, business continued. The air conditioning was blasting so high, people were wearing jumpers to stay warm, and there was no indication of devastating temperatures, other than the people walking in off the street with sweat streaming down their faces. <br/>El Paso, in Texas, has seen temperatures of 100.4F (38C) and above for more than a month now, with no respite in sight. <br/>In Phoenix, Arizona, temperatures have remained above 109.4F (43C) for 17 days. Thick cloud cover on Sunday meant the city was granted a modest reprieve from recent peaks, but daytime temperatures still reached highs of 114F (45.5C).<br/>The heat is set to continue for the foreseeable future, and authorities are warning that vulnerable people - including children, pregnant women and the elderly - are at serious risk of heat-related illness.<br/>Mobile clinics report treating homeless people suffering from third-degree burns. Public buildings in some parts of California and Nevada have been turned into \"cooling centres\" where people can take refuge from the heat. <br/>Amid the extreme temperatures being seen in Death Valley, Park Ranger Matthew Lamar said: \"We hadn't hit 130F (54.4C) here for over 100 years. And then in 2020, we got 130, in 2021 we got 130, and then we might hit it again this weekend.\"<br/>He added that the weather was attracting tourists who wanted to \"experience the extremes\".<br/>But some visitors said others should not lose sight of the fact that those extremes are a symptom of climate change. <br/>Speaking to Reuters on Saturday, Tom Comitta said: \"People are coming out here to celebrate this. People are excited. It's not a milestone. I'm calling it Happy Death Day.\"<br/>A heat dome occurs when an area of high pressure pushes air towards the ground, compressing it and causing it to heat. The warmer air then rises again, setting up a cycle in which air sinks through the centre of the 'dome' and rises up its sides. <br/>The pressure also prevents other weather systems that would cool the area - such as rain clouds - from forming. <br/>The NWS has said that the current system in the southwestern US is \"one of the strongest\" of its kind to hit the region.<br/>The Weather Channel has said the dome will expand across the nation's south by the middle of next week - meaning other southern US states will see temperatures rise.<br/>Meanwhile, other parts of the US are bracing themselves for severe thunderstorms and flash floods - and north-eastern states could experience another bout of poor air quality as a result of the continuing wildfires in Canada. <br/>\"As if the rain coming out of the sky isn't enough, if you start looking up tomorrow, you're going to see a similar situation in what we had a couple of weeks ago because of the air quality degradation [from the wildfires],\" New York governor Kathy Hochul said at a press conference. \"And as I said before, this is possibly our new normal.\"<br/>The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.<br/>'Dangerous\u2019 US heatwave threatens new records<br/>Canada's far north records its hottest temperature<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It's almost like there's a storyline written for you,\" she adds. <br/>Spraggan, who was 20 at the time, says the contestants were immediately put under huge pressure. <br/>\"From the very first stage that message was reiterated and reiterated and reiterated to the point where that's all you believe - [that] 'this is the biggest opportunity of my life,'\" she says.<br/>Now 31, she says she has never since experienced a situation where \"somebody completely takes the reins of my life\". <br/>\"If I had experienced that again, as a normal human being, I would have said that I would have been in an abusive relationship.\" <br/>Spraggan details her experiences on the show in her new memoir, Process: Finding My Way Through, including the sexual assault. <br/>It happened at a hotel where she and her fellow contestant - the broadcaster Rylan Clark - had been moved to, away from the others. <br/>They had initially been staying at the luxury Corinthia Hotel in central London, where Spraggan says they were guarded by 24-hour security. <br/>She says the show's producers told her the hotel had asked the pair to leave because they were \"causing too much trouble\". Headlines had branded them \"party animals\". <br/>\"So Rylan and I always sort of were under the impression that we were removed, because that supported the narrative,\" Spraggan says. <br/>The pair were not given additional security at the new hotel, she adds.<br/>If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, please visit BBC Action Line.<br/>The night they were moved, Spraggan attended Rylan's birthday party at a club in Mayfair. <br/>Spraggan says she can't remember what happened that night and has pieced together the incident through information from the police and others. <br/>She knows she was not conscious - because she had been drinking alcohol at the party - when she was escorted back to the hotel by a member of the production team. <br/>\"The hotel porter that had offered his help to get me up to bed\u2026 got a key card, let himself into my room and raped me,\" she explains. <br/>In 2013, Soby John pleaded guilty to the attack and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. <br/>Rylan was the first person Spraggan told about what happened. \"He was unbelievable,\" she says, describing him as \"an angel\". <br/>Spraggan says being examined by police for evidence was \"one of the worst experiences\" of her life. But she also knew that the show - which turned unknowns into singing stars - was the biggest opportunity of her life, and the fourth live show was due to be filmed the following day. <br/>\"It was like, this extraordinary thing's happened. The police are here, I've just had this examination. And people still asking me, 'What do you want to do? What do you want to do?' And I was like, 'I want to carry on with the show.' <br/>\"It kind of shows you what kind of world you are in, in what kind of mindset you are in, to not be able to really measure what has happened, and what you should do now.\" <br/>Lucy says the day after the attack she was put in another hotel room, with a security guard outside. <br/>\"I remember sort of having to peel myself away from jumping off the balcony. Like having to consciously do that.\" <br/>She decided to leave the show after week three of the competition. But she wasn't voted out by the public or the show's judges - she realised that mentally she couldn't continue. <br/>To explain why she had left, ITV announced that she was ill. Spraggan says she feels she had to go along with the narrative at the time, but says she is now relieved she can tell the truth.<br/>Spraggan felt like she didn't get enough support in the aftermath of the attack - and in the following years her mental health deteriorated considerably and she abused alcohol and drugs. She has now been sober for nearly four years. <br/>Fremantle said: \"Whilst we believed throughout that we were doing our best to support Lucy, as Lucy thinks we could have done more, we must therefore recognise this. For everything Lucy has suffered, we are extremely sorry.\" <br/>The star is now calling for all production and broadcast companies to better consider employees' and participants' mental health - by setting aside a portion of their budgets to invest in mental wellbeing services. <br/>\"I don't want to destroy anything. I want to build a better infrastructure,\" she says. <br/>\"We need these shows, because there's a thriving community of talented people who just don't have the funds and the opportunity to get there.\" <br/>X Factor's creator, Simon Cowell was not a judge in 2012 because he was in America launching X Factor US.  Spraggan says she was ready to give him \"a piece of my mind\" when he called her, after she had contacted his people to say she was writing her book. <br/>She says he said, \"Lucy, before you or I say anything else, the first thing I need to tell you is that I am sorry.\" <br/>Spraggan reflects: \"It makes me emotional because no-one else said sorry. And all it took was this one man to treat me like a human being, 11 years later.\" <br/>In 2021, Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, announced changes to its Broadcasting Code to better protect people made vulnerable by their participation in TV shows. The changes were introduced after suicides involving contestants from Love Island and The Jeremy Kyle Show in 2018 and 2019. <br/>Earlier this year, the BBC and ITV announced they were joining forces to recruit more registered psychologists to support TV programmes in their duty of care to contributors. <br/>\"My voice is extremely inconvenient for a lot of people. I've been petrified of telling the truth, because I'll lose what I have,\" Spraggan says. <br/>\"If I have to be the first person who says 'I'm actually not scared to stand up against you [the industry]', I will. And hopefully it inspires other people to be a little bit braver too.\" <br/>In a statement,  ITV said it had \"the deepest compassion for Lucy\".  It said the production companies, Fremantle and Syco, were primarily responsible for the duty of care towards all of its programme contributors. <br/>But it added it \"is committed to having in place\u2026 robust oversight procedures, to [ensure] that independent producers employ the correct processes to protect the mental health and welfare of participants\".<br/>X Factor star reveals sexual assault during filming<br/>Katie Waissel says she was 'ridiculed' on X Factor<br/>X Factor star welcomes new help for TV contestants<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It also warned that cost-cutting and inaccurate modelling of future demand could mean new hospitals are too small.<br/>The health department remained \"firmly committed\" to delivering the England building pledge, a spokesperson said.<br/>But Labour called the report \"damning\".<br/>The hospitals plan was a Conservative manifesto commitment during the December 2019 election campaign, and it was made policy the following year. <br/>When the health department officially set out the plan in October 2020, eight hospital construction projects already under way were not included in the target. But recent government statements about building 40 new hospitals include these eight projects, referred to as \"legacy hospitals\". <br/>And in May, the government changed the scope of the scheme to include hospitals in urgent need of repairs, including five judged to be at risk of collapse because of crumbling concrete infrastructure.<br/>Now the National Audit Office has analysed the plans and found that, by the definition set out in 2020, the target will be missed, and only 32 will be built in time. The NAO said the government has used a \"broad\" definition of \"new\", which includes refurbishment of existing buildings as well as completely new hospitals.<br/>The 32 that will be built in time include 24 from the original new hospitals programme, five that were added in May, and three new mental health hospitals. <br/>It said a further eight do not count towards the original definition of \"new\" because they were already under way when the commitment was made.<br/>Questions have been asked for some time about whether the programme is on track and it is significant that the watchdog has now ruled that, judged by the original template, it is not.<br/>In May, a BBC News investigation found that building work had not started on 33 of the projects. <br/>The NAO said staff shortages mean a planned design for a standardised hospital has been delayed until May 2024.<br/>It also warned that a push to meet the target at the lowest possible cost - combined with optimistic forecasts about how much care will be outside hospitals in the future - could result in new hospitals that are too small.<br/>The government had failed to achieve good value for money, the NAO said, as it called for a review of the underlying assumptions behind the plans to make sure the new hospitals are fit for purpose.<br/>Health Secretary Steve Barclay had already told MPs in May that some of the original group included in the new hospitals programme might not be completed by 2030.<br/>He made the admission as he updated the department's building plans to deal with hospitals built with a lightweight concrete that was used in the 1980s and is now judged to be unsafe.<br/>But he restated the commitment to deliver 40 new hospitals by the end of the decade.<br/>Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said the programme included \"innovative plans\" to improve efficiency and quality. But there are important lessons to ensure future major projects were affordable, transparent and delivered on time, he said.<br/>Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, urged the government to \"shift gears\" to get the hospitals built and warned that costs had \"spiralled due to high inflation\".<br/>He said many NHS trusts were \"deeply disappointed\" by delays and said the government \"could have better managed expectations about the funding available, given the uncertainty involved and the impact of inflation\".<br/>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the \"utterly damning report demolishes the government's claims to be building 40 'new hospitals'\".<br/>She called on the health secretary to make an urgent statement in Parliament addressing its findings, saying \"the public deserves answers\".<br/>Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The Conservatives have overpromised, under-delivered, and they've been found out. <br/>\"Meanwhile patients are being treated in outdated, crumbling hospitals.\"<br/>A health department spokesperson said: \"The NAO's report acknowledges that despite changes to the original programme, 40 new hospitals are still expected to be delivered by 2030 and praises the programme's innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, deliver efficiencies and improve quality.<br/>\"We remain firmly committed to delivering these hospitals, which are now expected to be backed by over \u00a320 billion of investment, helping to cut waiting lists so people can get the treatment they need quicker.<br/>\"Three new hospitals have already opened and more will open this year so patients and staff can benefit from major new hospital buildings, equipped with the latest technology.\" <br/>Work yet to start on 33 of 40 new hospitals<br/>Ministers set out plan to train and keep more NHS staff<br/>NHS waiting lists hit record high in England<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Someone who knows him put it to me more bluntly: \"He is obsessed with it.\"<br/>OpenAI, the firm behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, has announced that its first international office will be located in London, and data firm Palantir has also said it will open headquarters in the city.<br/>But the UK faces several challenges in positioning itself as a key player in this lucrative and fast-moving area of tech.<br/>This week BBC News is focusing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>Emma McClenaghan and her partner Matt run an AI start-up in Northern Ireland. They have built an AI tool called Wally which generates websites, and have ambitions to turn it into a more general digital assistant. <br/>The company has won awards but they still struggle to access the specialised chips - called GPUs (general processing units) - they need to develop their product further.<br/>\"I think there is a lack of hardware access for start-ups, and a lack of expertise and lack of funding,\" she said.<br/>She said they waited five months for a grant to buy a single GPU - at a time when in the US Elon Musk was reported to have purchased 10,000. <br/>\"That's the difference between us and them because it's going to take us, you know, four to seven days to train a model and if he's [able to] do it in minutes, then you know, we're never going to catch up\".<br/>In an email chat, Ms McClenaghan told me she thinks the best outcome for her firm, Gensys Engine, would be for it to get bought up by a US tech giant - something I hear a lot from UK start-ups.<br/>Re-nosing those ambitions to keep successful firms here in the UK and helping them to grow is another challenge.<br/>Trying to access GPUs might be less of an issue if they were available as part of a national infrastructure, like for example road networks or electricity cables, rather than being hoovered up by those companies which can afford them.<br/>Ian Hogarth thinks this could be the way forward.<br/>\"I think the we're going to enter a phase in which nation states start to see their role in directing critical AI infrastructure in a new way,\" he said.<br/>\"It is going to be a fundamental building block for the next generation of innovation.\" <br/>Despite the trials ahead, he is optimistic the UK can still take a seat at the centre of the AI revolution.<br/>\"I don't think we're too late,\" he says. <br/>\"I wouldn't have taken the job if I thought we couldn't do a lot.\"<br/>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might think<br/>How AI is helping doctors spot breast cancers<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Cash flow remains negative, Mr Musk said at the weekend, although the billionaire did not put a time frame on the 50% drop in ad revenue.<br/>In a tweet he said: \"Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else.\"<br/>After laying off thousands of employees and cutting cloud service bills, Mr Musk said Twitter was on track to post $3bn (\u00a32.29bn) in revenue in 2023, down from $5.1bn in 2021.<br/>The development is the latest sign the aggressive cost-cutting measures have not been enough to ignite a return of advertisers who fled after changes to its content moderation rules.<br/>That is despite an interview Mr Musk gave to the BBC in April, in which he suggested that most had returned to the site.<br/>However, Meghana Dhar, the former head of partnerships at Snap and Meta, which owns the new Twitter rival Threads, said the company had been struggling prior to Mr Musk's buyout. <br/>\"Elon and Twitter are in a candidly tough position right now,\" she told the BBC's Today programme. \"To be fair to Elon though, we've seen that decline in Twitter revenue and growth in revenue since pre-Elon - there's been kind of a steady decline.\" <br/>Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, said:  \"You wouldn't bet against him, he's a kind of mercurial figure and I think probably he will turn it around but it is just going to take longer.<br/>\"But unfortunately he has got $13bn of debt to pay by the end of July so we may see more pressure on the shares in Tesla if he has to sell more of his stake in that company.\"<br/>Mr Musk is also the chief executive and majority shareholder of electric car-maker Tesla, which will report its latest quarterly financial results on Wednesday.<br/>Linda Yaccarino, previously head of advertising at NBCUniversal, was taken on as chief executive of Twitter in June - a move suggesting advertising sales are still a priority for the company.<br/>Ms Yaccarino has said Twitter plans to focus on video, creator and commerce partnerships.

The government said it had acted on the BMA's request for pension reform, increasing the tax-free threshold on pensions contributions.<br/>Unlike junior doctors, consultants are not asking for full pay restoration in one go. Instead, they want the government to start at least giving pay rises that match inflation.<br/>During 2022, average NHS earnings exceeded \u00a3126,000 for consultants - this includes extra pay for additional hours and performance.<br/>Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA consultants committee, said the strikes were a last resort and that the union had \"been left with no choice\". <br/>He said the government was \"devaluing consultants' expertise\" and showing a \"lack of regard for the impact this is having on the NHS\".<br/>He said the pay body recommendation of a 6% pay rise showed \"the need to reform the pay review system\" and that the increase was a \"savage real-terms pay cut\".<br/>Dr Sharma warned of further strikes after August, saying consultants were \"in this for the long haul\". More than 85% of BMA members backed walkouts in a previous ballot.<br/>\"The future of the NHS depends on there being consultants within it, but attacks on their pay will drive them away - from the health service and from the country - with devastating consequences,\" he said.<br/>Are you a consultant with a view on the strike?

He soon became intrigued by \"these little rats sprayed everywhere.... and more and more of Banksy's street pieces just started to reveal themselves\".<br/>But as with many Banksy fans, it wasn't just the artwork itself - and its social commentary - that fascinated Peak. He was also drawn in by the artist's mystique, and the huge effort involved in producing graffiti undercover at speed to avoid both being identified and arrested by the police.<br/>\"There's a great line in his latest show which I think is something like: 'Monet had light, Hockney had colour and I've got police response time,'\" Peak says.<br/>Over the years, various news outlets have reported that they know who Banksy is, and in 2017, DJ Goldie referred to Banksy as a man called Rob in an interview.<br/>While rumours abound, his real identity has never been revealed. But have we gone beyond needing to know who he actually is?<br/>Peak says Banksy's anonymity \"lets him keep doing the campaigning stuff he does unfettered\" which, along with loyalty, probably stops the few in the know from letting the cat out of the bag.<br/>\"Being free to act in the way that he does, that's super valuable.\"<br/>In fact, very few people who know Banksy have spoken publicly about him at all.<br/>For the podcast, Peak spent a year getting to know gallerist Steph Warren, who worked with Banksy at his print house Pictures on Walls in Shoreditch in the early Noughties when she was in her early 20s.<br/>Once Peak had gained her trust, Warren opened up to him about her experiences, having declined to sign a non-disclosure agreement when she worked at the print house. She has never talked publicly before.<br/>So what was it like working with Banksy and his crew during those heady early days in a working-class area which would soon go on to become hipsterville?<br/>\"It was exciting,\" Warren tells me.<br/>\"The office was very DIY, you know, very punk. When I started there I was the packing girl and I was licking the stamps to go on the tubes to send the prints out, then carting them down to Old Street post office. It was very exciting because it felt like I could be involved with helping it grow.\"<br/>She then went on to organise the pop-up exhibition and store, Santa's Ghetto, which then became an annual event.<br/>Banksy was furtive to a degree even within the company and, in the podcast, Warren gives the impression that he's something of an observer, an outsider looking in.<br/>\"He was quite reserved,\" she says. \"You could tell that he had a lot going on in his head. <br/>\"And I hate to use the word genius because I wouldn't want to call him a genius! But he's a very clever man. [He had] a lot of philosophies and concepts that I just didn't understand at the time, but through his work, I have been able to learn.\"<br/>Warren says she was asked by Banksy in the office one day to pose for what would become his now famous mural Sweeping It Under the Carpet, which depicted a maid at work. She definitely has a look of Warren. There have also been claims attributed to Banksy that he based it on a hotel maid in Los Angeles.<br/>The stencil, which was said to be a comment on the Western world ignoring global issues, appeared on a wall in north London in 2006.<br/>But behind the scenes, things were beginning to fall apart for Warren as she became addicted to heroin, something she says was part of the art scene for some at the time and that she was introduced to while working there.<br/>\"There are lots of jobs where, to a certain extent, a certain level of alcoholism or substance misuse is accepted,\" Warren says.<br/>In the podcast, she claims Banksy was \"horrified\" when he found out and took her for a walk to talk about it but she denied she was taking the drug when he asked.<br/>Warren says heroin also enabled her to block out the grief she was going through after the death of her BMX biker boyfriend in an accident back in her home town of Hastings, not long before she moved to London.<br/>In the podcast, she explains that she then fell out with Banksy after not being available for the last Banksy concept store, Santa's Ghetto, in London in 2006.<br/>It got out of hand on its first day with hundreds of people fighting to get in, in the hope of buying one of the artist's limited prints. Warren had arranged the morning off, but said Banksy was uncharacteristically \"fuming\" with her because she wasn't there to manage the queue. <br/>In hindsight, she says: \"I should have been there, I wasn't exactly a model employee, I was on heroin.\" <br/>Soon after, Warren and Pictures on Walls parted company. <br/>While she does takes responsibility for her choices, she feels that Pictures on Walls could have offered to put her through a drug rehabilitation programme.<br/>But the drama still wasn't over. <br/>Warren was accused in the press the following year of fraudulently producing Banksy prints and selling them on, something she has always vehemently denied. When she wanted to defend herself publicly, she claims Banksy's PR, Jo Brooks, cautioned her against the move and that they tried to get her to sign  an NDA. Warren says she refused.<br/>Members of the local art fraternity defended her and Pictures on Walls then did their own swift investigation.<br/>They found that there was no evidence of any fraud and Warren was exonerated but as Peak says: \"By that point, of course, the damage had definitely been done.\"<br/>After leaving Pictures on Walls, Warren set up her own gallery, Stella Dore, in the Truman Brewery on Brick Lane. It folded a couple of years later, which Warren says was largely due to the global financial crisis and her addiction. However, she says being a woman in a male-dominated industry, alongside the false accusations, didn't help.<br/>\"As a woman, you're always disadvantaged anyway. And like in any industry, if there's rumours around your name, then it's an extra reason for people not to use your services.\"<br/>Jo Brooks PR and Pictures on Walls were both contacted twice for a response by Peak but neither got back to him. (Pictures on Walls' shop closed in 2018 but it is still listed at Companies House and is the controlling entity of Pest Control Office, Banksy's current company which authenticates his works).<br/>Warren later returned to the south coast, entered rehab and successfully re-launched Stella Dore in 2018 in St Leonards, again working with street artists.<br/>\"It's a fantastic community here,\" she says.<br/>\"They really have embraced me and looked after me. I've been able to build myself back up here.\"<br/>Given her time working with Banksy ended on a somewhat sour note, how does she feel about him now, looking back?<br/>\"I think what he's achieved is phenomenal and I'm just cross with myself because I wish I'd had a better head on my shoulders back then, you know, to really work for him properly. I think that he's a real force for good overall. Even if my personal experience isn't quite that.\"<br/>The Banksy Story will be available on BBC Sounds as a boxset from Monday 17 July. The 10 episodes will also be broadcast individually on week days at 13:45 on BBC Radio 4 from the same date.<br/>Banksy to stage first solo exhibition in 14 years<br/>Ukraine's Banksy stamps depict Putin being thrown<br/>Signed Banksy Colston Four T-shirt raises \u00a312k<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The Mail gives its backing to the plan, saying it will \"begin to correct a cruel deception which has gone on for far too long.\" <br/>The Times highlights concern about the effects of rising interest rates, expressed by the UK's largest debt support charity. Citizens Advice says it is now unable to help almost half the 40,000 people who come to it for debt advice every month, as they have already cut back their spending to the bare essentials.  <br/>The charity also warns that the number of people it is seeing who can no longer afford the property they live in has almost doubled in a year.  <br/>The Financial Times says new research by the Resolution Foundation think-tank has indicated that soaring interest rates have driven the biggest fall in household wealth since the end of World War Two. <br/>The Daily Mirror is excited by drug trial results set to be revealed on Monday afternoon, suggesting they \"could herald the beginning of the end of Alzheimer's disease\".  <br/>The BBC has previously reported a claim by the manufacturer that the drug, Donanemab, could slow patients' mental decline by a third.  The Mirror's leader column welcomes what it calls the \"potentially ground-breaking\" medical advance - arguing it's \"frustrating\" that effective treatment for dementia has been lacking for years, when Covid vaccines were invented, developed, produced and delivered in months.<br/>With the headline \"Sex Predators Stalking Britain's Police Stations\", The Daily Express says freedom of information requests have revealed more than 170 allegations of sexual assaults committed on police premises between 2019 and 2022.  \"What makes this doubly repugnant\", says the paper, \"is that so few of these incidents have resulted in charges\".  <br/>It warns that a civilised society \"is in grave danger when you can no longer trust those tasked with enforcing the law\".   <br/>Photographs of Carlos Alcaraz feature on many front pages, after the 20-year-old Spaniard defeated defending champion Novak Djokovic to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon.  <br/>The Guardian describes the final as a \"five-set thriller, watched by a deafening Centre Court crowd who could hardly contain their joy at bearing witness to this match for the ages\".  <br/>The Sun notes that Prince George and Princess Charlotte were among those to enjoy the \"gobsmacking\" match, but their younger brother was absent.

BBC News examined more than 40 online stories, as well as print editions of the Sun and other papers, to look at how the media - including the BBC itself - handled the most complex aspects of the story.<br/>It all began with a story in the Sun last Friday, a story that featured a very important phrase. <br/>The paper said that a high-profile BBC presenter had given a young person \"more than \u00a335,000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images\".<br/>Wording to this effect was used at least seven times online over the next three days, out of dozens of articles published on the subject by the Sun.<br/>That line rang alarm bells among readers and the media, partly because it hinted at criminality.<br/>It suggested the man - who we now know is Edwards - may have committed a criminal offence, if such images were sent before the teenager was 18.<br/>Other outlets including the Sunday Times and BBC News made that connection explicitly, and it was one factor that fuelled the story. <br/>It is worth saying Edwards has not yet addressed this, or any of the further claims that emerged during the past week. In her statement on Wednesday, his wife Vicky Flind said he would respond to the allegations when he is well enough. He will stay in hospital for the \"foreseeable future\" after recent events triggered a \"serious\" mental health episode, she said.<br/>On Sunday evening, in an editorial, the Sun began to refer to \"contact\" between the pair having started when the young person was 17, but did not specify what the nature of that contact was. <br/>The last time the Sun used the key phrase with the direct allegation (that the young person had been paid for \"sordid images\" since they were 17) online was on Monday evening. <br/>This was when it reported on a letter from the young person's lawyer to the BBC denying the substance of the Sun's story, and their parents' response, which formed the basis of a story in the following day's paper. This print story also repeated the phrase.<br/>The publication of this letter, which was adamant that \"nothing unlawful\" had taken place, might have changed the equation. <br/>For example, after this an online Sun editorial on Tuesday evening made no mention of the age the payments started or what the money was for. On Wednesday the paper stated the young person was 17 when they first received money, but did not say it was for explicit images.<br/>The Sun has said the story was \"always squarely in the public interest\".<br/>Its statement on Wednesday, after Edwards was named by his wife, said its original story did not allege criminality and further added that connection was only made by other outlets.  <br/>\"From the outset, we have reported a story about two very concerned and frustrated parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and payments from him that fuelled the drug habit of a young person.\" it said. <br/>That initial story did not explicitly mention criminality but, if the details within it were correct, then it suggested the presenter had broken the law.<br/>The paper also followed up comments in the Sunday Times from former chief crown prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who said that the presenter could potentially be charged with sexual exploitation under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.<br/>Its resulting story was headlined: \"Top BBC star who 'paid child for sex pictures' could be charged by cops and face years in prison, expert says.\"<br/>The Sun was approached for this story but did not wish to comment further, referring BBC News to its statement issued on Wednesday.<br/>While its first story reported claims from the young person's mother, it is not clear whether the Sun had seen evidence proving the allegations before publishing.<br/>Did Sun journalists see and verify bank statements allegedly containing payments from the star, or the so-called \"sleazy\" messages?<br/>Or were they relying on the family member's word? The paper said family members had signed a sworn affidavit when sharing their story.<br/>It is not clear what the Sun meant by this, as an affidavit is a document overseen by a solicitor for use in legal action.<br/>On Monday, in response to the young person's denial, the Sun said in a statement that it had seen evidence supporting their family's concerns.<br/>A dossier of evidence has reportedly been passed by the family to the BBC, but BBC News has not seen its content, nor any of the Sun's evidence.<br/>Backed up by a legal affidavit or not, this account was to be firmly challenged by the young person at the heart of the allegations.<br/>The letter from the young person's lawyer,  sent to the BBC on Monday evening, called the allegations \"rubbish\" and said \"nothing inappropriate or unlawful\" had taken place. <br/>Furthermore, it said the young person had sent a denial to the paper on Friday evening via WhatsApp, saying their mother's account was \"totally wrong and there was no truth to it\", but the \"inappropriate\" article was still published.<br/>But if the paper received a denial, many asked why it was not published, as is routine journalistic practice?<br/>With the young person's lawyers dismissing the claims, and no response yet from the unnamed presenter, eyes were on the BBC and police to investigate.<br/>On Monday, the BBC met the Metropolitan Police, who advised it to pause its investigation while police made enquiries. <br/>Meanwhile, the Sun had published an interview with the parents who said the BBC were liars and that they had told the BBC about the presenter's contact with the young person. <br/>The BBC has published a timeline of events and director general Tim Davie has said it is handling the situation \"responsibly and judicially\".<br/>The parents also told the Sun they had referred the matter to a police force, who told them there was no criminal case to answer. <br/>We now know two forces have concluded there was no evidence of criminality. <br/>South Wales Police - who the young person's parents first approached in April - said the allegation related to \"the welfare of an adult\", as opposed to a child. <br/>On Wednesday evening the Metropolitan Police said there was no information to indicate a criminal offence and they would take no further action.<br/>Media critics were quick to point out that this cast the story - and the balance between public interest in publishing the allegations and the presenter's right to privacy - in a very different light. <br/>Jacqui Hames, a board member of press campaign group Hacked Off, said a \"suggestion of criminality... screamed out\" at readers day after day.<br/>In the Sun's statement later that evening, reiterating that it did not initially allege criminality, it said its claims \"were always very serious\".<br/>Former Sky News anchor Adam Boulton called the question of illegality \"a side issue\".<br/>\"The issue is behaviour that many people would - potentially if it's true - disapprove of,\" he told Newsnight.<br/>Meanwhile, in the wake of the Sun's story, journalists began investigating the presenter and further allegations about his behaviour began to emerge. <br/>BBC News told the story of one young person who claimed they were placed under repeated pressure to meet the presenter after first being contacted anonymously by him on a dating app. They said they received abusive and menacing messages from Mr Edwards that left them frightened after they hinted online they might reveal his name.<br/>Separately, the Sun said the presenter broke Covid lockdown rules to meet a 23-year-old who he had contacted on a dating site.<br/>The paper also published messages it claimed were from the star to a 17-year-old on Instagram, including love heart emojis. <br/>Shortly after Edwards was named by his wife, BBC News reported that three current and former employees claimed Edwards had sent messages that made them uncomfortable.<br/>These alleged interactions raise questions about whether there was an abuse of power, and whether it would be acceptable behaviour for one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters and someone the nation is asked to trust during coverage of both the daily news and major national events.<br/>The Sun said the young person's parents only approached the paper after taking their concerns to the BBC. <br/>In mid-May, they spoke to the BBC customer services team, who passed them to the corporate investigations unit, which investigates alleged criminal and illicit activity involving BBC staff. <br/>We don't know exactly what these allegations were - the BBC has said they were \"very serious\" but not illegal, and different to those reported by the Sun. <br/>The investigations unit sent the parents one email and tried to phone them once in the subsequent seven weeks. <br/>Was that a sufficient response to a \"very serious\" complaint about one of the BBC's biggest names?<br/>\"That's a fair question,\" Mr Davie, director general, said when asked on BBC Radio 4.<br/>He also promised to \"immediately\" review how quickly \"red flags\" are raised internally after such complaints.<br/>The BBC has also said no executive directors were made aware until the Sun approached the corporation late last week.<br/>Some have questioned why the BBC did not discuss the allegations with Edwards earlier and give him a chance to respond - he was only made aware of the claims last Thursday. But Mr Davie has said: \"You don't take that complaint directly to the presenter unless it has been verified.\"<br/>The decision to air fresh claims of inappropriate messages from BBC colleagues - on the day of Edwards' wife's statement - has also been criticised. The Sun said it would not publish any further allegations. <br/>Sir Craig Oliver, former editor of the BBC News at Ten - the programme Edwards has fronted for so long - said the corporation's journalists had mostly done a good job, but \"in the desire to make sure that they look like they're covering this in a fair and impartial way, they perhaps have gone too far\".<br/>Edwards' wife made clear the impact of the days of fevered reporting and speculation on her family - and that will be a weighty factor as the debate develops about the balance between publishing in the public interest versus the right to privacy.<br/>Her statement \"acted like a dash of cold water to the face of all journalists\", Sir Craig told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. <br/>\"I think both the BBC and the Sun are now looking at themselves and asking themselves questions about: is it possible in a frenzied environment where there are so many different elements coming together and it's making people's heads spin... can you, in that environment, have a duty of care to the person involved? And can you allow due process to take place?\"<br/>Former ITN editor-in-chief Stewart Purvis said it raised questions around when it is legitimate to report on the private life of a high-profile individual. <br/>But Mark Damazer, a former controller of BBC Radio 4 and Radio 7, said on Thursday that BBC News journalists had used \"reasonable judgement\" to cover the story as they would any other. <br/>BBC News was willing to \"try and give the BBC an extremely good kicking, especially the boss class\", he said - because it did not want to be accused of being \"soft\" on the wider BBC.<br/>BBC resumes Edwards inquiry as no criminality found<br/>Timeline: How Huw Edwards allegations unfolded<br/>Who is Huw Edwards?<br/>'This is such dramatic news' - Katie Razzall<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The charge stemmed from his part interrupting a joint session of Congress, and carried a maximum prison term of 20 years.<br/>\"I am truly, truly repentant for my actions, because repentance is not just saying you're sorry,\" he said. \"Repentance is apologising and then moving in the exact opposite direction of the sin that you committed. <br/>\"In retrospect, I would do everything differently on January 6th.\"<br/>A judge called his apology \"the most remarkable I've heard in 34 years\" and sentenced him to 41 months in prison - considerably less than the maximum allowed. <br/>Now more than a year-and-a-half later, Angeli is out of jail early, and his remorse is gone. <br/>\"Regrets only weigh down the mind,\" he told the BBC. \"They're like sandbags on a hot air balloon.\"<br/>His about-face is such that he is even taking his case back to court to ask his guilty plea to be reversed. And he is far from the alone in changing his mind about the events at the Capitol.<br/>Since 6 January 2021, over 1,000 people have been charged over their participation in the riots, and almost half have pleaded guilty. But chatter on online forums and media coverage shows a small but growing number have started to have a change of heart.  Emboldened by shifting views of the riots, some have sought to recast their actions, and even benefit from their notoriety. <br/>Facing 30 days in prison and three years of probation, Athanasios Zoyganeles pleaded guilty last year to illegally demonstrating in the Capitol.<br/>But like Angeli, he has since changed his mind. He told a reporter this month that he didn't do anything wrong and had been persuaded into an admission. <br/>His lawyer has since asked to delay sentencing.<br/>In addition to walking back regrets, a number of rioters have tried to capitalise on their involvement in the riots in a number of ways.<br/>Derrick Evans, a former member of the West Virginia state legislature, resigned his post after being arrested. He pleaded guilty, apologised in court, and served three months in prison.<br/>Now he is running for a seat in the US House of Representatives, and he refers to himself and other defendants as  \"political prisoners\".<br/>The term is commonly used across a broad section of the right and far-right of American politics to cast rioters as heroic and patriotic.<br/>\"I think as time continues to go on, I'm going to be proven to be on the correct side of history,\" he told the BBC recently.<br/>Christina Baal-Owens, executive director of Public Wise, a voting rights organization that has worked to prevent 6 January rioters from being elected to office, said more and more rioters were using their public profiles to boost their political aspirations, especially in the lead-up to the 2024 elections.<br/>\"The far-right and January 6 rioters are trying to flip the narrative and make themselves martyrs,\" she said.<br/>A key moment for many was when Tucker Carlson aired small edited snippets footage of the day, which appeared to show rioters behaving peacefully inside Congress.<br/>The footage on his now-cancelled Fox News show fuelled the narrative that they were largely peaceful demonstrations, and emboldened some, like Evans, to run for office.<br/>\"We're finally at the point where people such as myself, who went through this January 6 process and have already served our time in prison, are finally able to start speaking out and sharing the truth,\" Evans said.<br/>The ferocity of feeling in some quarters means that some rioters have been able to raise funds - or social media clout - off of their newfound fame.<br/>On one popular Christian site, GiveSendGo, there are at least 150 campaigns mentioning the Capitol riot which have collectively have raised more than $4.1m (\u00a33.2m).<br/>In some cases, prosecutors are trying to recoup those funds.<br/>After he pleaded guilty to entering a restricted building, Daniel Goodwyn, a member of the Proud Boys, appeared on television calling the Jan 6 defendants \"political prisoners\".<br/>He made pleas for donations, raising more than $25,000. Prosecutors have since sought to fine him the same amount.<br/>John P Gross, a criminal law expert at the University of Wisconsin, said that having a change of heart can carry legal risks.<br/>The concept of \"trial penalty\" means that in general, defendants who plead guilty receive lighter sentences than those convicted after a trial. Judges also have leeway to impose harsher sentences if they believe defendants aren't truly sorry.<br/>\"A judge can absolutely take lack of remorse into consideration when sentencing,\" he said. \"I would tell a client, under no terms whatsoever should you be saying anything to the media between when you are plead and when you are sentenced.\"<br/>But what happens if someone has already served their time, and wants to take it all back?<br/>In order to change his guilty plea, Angeli must convince a judge he received ineffective representation from his original lawyer, Albert Watkins. He now says that statements his lawyer made in an attempt to mitigate his crimes weren't true. <br/>\"I never said I was duped by Trump,\" he told the BBC. \"I never denounced Q or the QAnon community\u2026 and I am not schizophrenic, bipolar, depressed or delusional.\"<br/>In an email, Mr Watkins denied that he had said his client had denounced QAnon or was delusional and described Angeli as a \"gentle, young man who, in his own way, is very bright and talented. I wish him nothing but the best.\"<br/>Legally, rioters who try to take back a guilty plea are getting into potentially risky territory, said Mr Gross. It's rare for courts to allow someone to do that, and when they do, they run the risk of facing a new trial - something that federal prosecutors have underlined in their response to Angeli's case.<br/>\"I wouldn't endorse it as a legal strategy,\" Mr Gross said.<br/>Because of his ongoing case, Angeli didn't answer questions about his actions during the riot. But he implied that spending time in solitary confinement - which he called \"a form of soft torture\" - led to his original decision to plead guilty.<br/>Angeli has used his notoriety to boost his profile since exiting prison. He has a podcast, runs online courses and sells merchandise on his website - including selling $44 flags, $33 t-shirts and $17 mugs.<br/>He is also back to spreading conspiracy theories online, insisting that he is only trying to spread the truth about a variety of government plots.  <br/>And while he backed away from his statement in court that he would have done everything differently during the Capitol riot, he did express one thought that sounded almost like a regret.<br/>\"I really tried to stop people from going crazy,\" he said. \"I would have tried a lot harder had I known what was going to happen.<br/>\"But who's going listen to the crazy guy in the face paint and the horns telling everybody to calm down?\"<br/>What happened in the US Capitol riots?<br/>'QAnon Shaman' freed early from federal prison<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

If a child successfully found a Pok\u00e9mon then a computerised animation of the creature would appear on their handset's screen, superimposed on top of the actual view through the phone's camera.<br/>It proved irresistible to millions and millions of young users. But are adults equally impressed by the use of AR?<br/>Since Pok\u00e9mon Go's success, a growing number of consumer brands are continuing to embrace AR, such as Coca-Cola and US whiskey Jack Daniels. You use your phone camera to scan a QR code on the can or bottle label, and an animation or video pops up on your screen.<br/>Does this use of AR remain a novelty, a gimmick that most people ignore, or does it actually increase consumer engagement and sales?<br/>In 2021, US soft drink firm Jones Soda introduced its first AR campaign, which it called Reel Labels. If you scan an image on the bottle labels then it transforms into a short video.<br/>To create the videos the firm partnered with an initial 15 so-called influencers, including a skateboarder, a breakdancer, and a BMX bike rider. Since then the firm's customers have been able to send in their own videos to be featured. <br/>And last year Jones Soda worked with music labels Sub Pop and Hardly Art to promote videos from more than a dozen new bands.<br/>\"A brand's packaging is so much more than a container for a product,\" says Bohb Blair, Jones Soda's chief marketing officer. \"It's now an opportunity to make a consumer's moment with your product special.<br/>\"Content is a great way to do that, and AR is a fun and convenient distribution vehicle.\"<br/>Another drinks business that has used AR to connect with the music industry is Estonian milk brand Tere Piim. In 2019 it joined with the Eurovision Song Contest to enable customers to see mini digital animations of that year's entrants perform on their kitchen counters and tables. All they had to do was scan a label on the milk cartons.<br/>The AR technology was provided by Latvian software firm Overly. \"Although you may doubt the compatibility at first glance, milk and a song contest make a good cross-marketing duo,\" says Overly's chief executive Ainars Klavins.<br/>\"In this instance, a traditional milk carton became a new medium for broadcasting Eurovision songs. It inspired consumers who may not be existing viewers to explore the contestant line-up and choose their favourites.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>He adds that consumers, especially younger ones, are ready to engage with brands \"in the augmented reality realm\".<br/>While you'd expect those involved in helping firms create AR to sing its praises, what do independent experts think?<br/>Stuart Duff is a leading business psychologist, who studies how firms can best connect with consumers. He says that AR can help products seem more \"interesting, engaging and memorable\".<br/>\"Research has highlighted that using AR not only captures our attention more quickly but also increases the likelihood of committing information to memory. So while AR may seem like a gimmick, it offers a genuine alternative approach to lodging brands in our psyche.\"<br/>Jenny Stanley is managing director of Appetite Creative, a Madrid-based tech and marketing firm that helps consumer businesses create AR labels.<br/>She says that a product's label is already an example of \"extremely targeted marketing\", whose effectiveness only increases further when AR content is added.<br/>\"It's not only impactful, but also cost effective. The average cost per digital advertising click is \u00a31.50, whereas a click or scan on packaging is technically free, giving brands a compelling reason to use connected packaging.\"<br/>Yet, as Mr Klavins of Overly cautions, content is key. And by that he means that what the AR offers has to be interesting and engaging.<br/>\"The key point here is that quality content for augmented reality is vital. I always say that AR content should either inspire, educate or entertain. It has to do at least one of those things to transform from a novelty tech into a strategic tool that drives business value.\"<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

That raised house prices sharply. <br/>In turn, that means millions of homeowners have more equity in the property. In other words, the difference between the value of the home and the mortgage is greater. When homeowners come to get a new deal, that could mean the home loan is not as expensive as it might otherwise have been.<br/>The second trend was high levels of savings, as spending options such as overseas travel were diminished. Some of that money is now being used to pay down mortgages.<br/>When lenders received a mortgage application they would \"stress test\" the finances of the applicant to see if they were able to afford interest rates at a higher level before approving it.<br/>Although the rules have now changed, it does mean that - now rates are higher - some people have not been saddled with unmanageable outstanding loans.<br/>Critics said that stress testing, which began in 2014, meant some applicants were turned down by lenders, even though they could have paid the interest rate at the time.<br/>Now, lenders are testing applicants to see whether they can cope with interest rates of 8% or 9% - although each lender's exact requirements are commercially sensitive.  <br/>Read more here<br/>Faced with a rising interest rate and more expensive repayments, existing borrowers are considering their options to mitigate the higher bills.<br/>That could include extending the term of their mortgage - although that does mean that ultimately they will pay more over a longer period of time. However, lenders are encouraging borrowers to discuss what can be done with them or a broker, rather than burying their heads in the sand.<br/>First-time buyers too are open to changing their plans. At the Treasury Committee hearing in the Commons earlier in the week, Andrew Asaam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group - the UK's largest mortgage lender, said: \"People are either putting down a larger deposit or buying a smaller property because affordability is tighter.<br/>\"We won't lend as much now, so people are moderating what they can afford to buy.\"<br/>Companies' borrowing costs, just like those of consumers, have been rising. However, so far, there have been no signs of big staff cuts.<br/>The jobs market remains resilient. So, when someone has a secure job and a regular income, they might still be able to afford higher mortgage bills - even if it means some pain and a change of priorities.<br/>Lenders say the most common reasons for people falling behind or having a home repossessed are generally life-changing events such as a job loss, or serious illness.<br/>The interest rates being demanded for buy-to-let mortgages are higher than those for homeowners. Often, landlords are on interest-only deals, leaving them even more vulnerable to rate rises.<br/>However, MPs heard that, of about 5.5 million properties in the private rental sector, only about two million are mortgaged.<br/>That means some landlords may be immune to rate rises. <br/>Tenants might feel the benefit of landlords not needing to pass on higher mortgage rates in higher rent. However, landlords' other costs are rising, as is the market rate for rent, so that quickly becomes a more complex picture.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

Yanks go home! And take your miserable grungewear and your self-obsessed slacker bands with you.<br/>\"We don't want plaid. We want crimplene, glamour, wit, and irony. It's time to bring on the Home Guard. These, Kurt, are the boys who will stop your little game: Suede, Saint Etienne, Pulp, Denim and the Auteurs. Bands with pride!\"<br/>It was a rallying call, for sure, but the movement didn't burst into life straight away - perhaps because, in addition to Britpop, Maconie insisted on calling these bands \"The Crimplenests\".<br/>Suede were first out of the traps, releasing their searing debut album in 1993, all glam guitars and sexual androgyny. <br/>But the scene really came together a year later. In the space of two weeks, Blur released Parklife, Oasis put out their debut single, Supersonic, and Pulp issued their breakthrough album His 'N' Hers.<br/>For the next few years, indie bands ruled the charts like they never had before. By 1996, all five of the best album nominees at the Brit Awards had a connection to the scene. <br/>Oasis won with their blockbuster second album, What's The Story (Morning Glory), but the competition was just as worthy - Pulp's Different Class, Blur's The Great Escape, Paul Weller's Stanley Road and Radiohead's The Bends (Radiohead always sat slightly apart from Britpop, partly because they spent so much time touring in the US, their eyes on a much bigger prize than the British charts).<br/>That same year, the Blur v Oasis chart battle made the BBC News, in an era where rock music only got on to the bulletins if someone had died; and two million people applied for tickets to see Oasis play at Knebworth. <br/>Britpop dominated the musical landscape so definitively that bands felt bulletproof.<br/>\"I suppose I felt like I could walk out into traffic and cars would bounce off me,\" recalled Blur's Graham Coxon. \"I probably tried it.\"<br/>Then, almost as soon as it arrived, Britpop fizzled out.<br/>In a new BBC Sounds series, The Rise And Fall of Britpop, Jarvis Cocker explains where it all went wrong.<br/>\"[Britpop] had this euphoria of thinking, 'Yeah, we're the snotty kids and we're finally getting to go centre stage,\" he says. <br/>\"Then everybody was drinking too much and getting a hangover - and then, of course, people don't want to buy records by hungover people. <br/>\"Then the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams appeared and they did some of the same things, but without the grumpiness. <br/>\"The record-buying public - and I don't blame them at all - just thought, all right, let's get rid of these misery guts. And so that was the end of it.\"<br/>His analysis bears weight. As Britpop matured, a sense of ennui and depression kicked in. <br/>Pulp's own This Is Hardcore was written about mid-life oblivion and the inevitability of death. Blur's self-titled 1997 album favoured lo-fi American guitar sounds over the colour-by-numbers vibrancy of Tracy Jacks and Country House. Oasis's Be Here Now was, in Noel Gallagher's own words, \"the sound of a bunch of guys, on coke, in the studio, not giving an [expletive].\"<br/>\"Broken bands make broken records,\" says Steve Lamacq, who co-hosts the Britpop series with Jo Whiley, recreating their influential partnership on Radio 1's Evening Session in the 1990s.<br/>The broadcaster recalls the experience of Elastica, whose debut album was released on Deceptive - a label he set up in 1993, <br/>\"They were like the Backstreet Kids of pop really, they were cheeky and sarcastic and cool and very credible. And their debut album was one of the best records of that era. <br/>\"But from day one, they were always in demand. Everybody wanted a piece of them. They become one of the very few British bands to find some sort of success in the States. Then you fast forward two years and they are absolutely knackered, mentally and physically.<br/>\"There was no let-up and at that point, they were probably running on adrenaline. And when the adrenaline ran out, they were fuelled by anything that might keep them going. And I think in short, it just, it stops being fun, really. But even when it stops being fun, the demands on you, they don't stop.\"<br/>He details how sessions for the band's second album were \"painfully slow\" with members failing to turn up for recording sessions, often for weeks at a time.<br/>When the record arrived, it was called The Menace - and the material was infinitely darker and more haunting than the bubblegum brightness of their debut.<br/>\"I really felt for them,\" says Lamacq, \"because despite all the people who were trying to direct them, they got absolutely lost.<br/>\"And they weren't the only ones because that level of success, and its subsequent pressures led to this rash of, if not cynical records, then albums that bare the soul of people who'd been in the music industry washing machine, and felt like they were being hung out to dry.\"<br/>Damon Albarn found himself in a similar position.<br/>\"I had a sort of a strange episode when I was walking under the the A12,\" he says on the podcast. \"Suddenly it looks like everything you've ever dreamed of is going to come true and I had a real... call it a panic attack or something like that. <br/>\"That reverberated for many years really.

But Whiley says the movement had an important legacy.<br/>\"There genuinely weren't many female bands [around] but I think the women who were there made a lasting impact on other girls who were listening to the radio and realising that they could actually get themselves a guitar, they could begin to make music... and I think that's really, really important.\"<br/>Whiley says it would be impossible to replicate Britpop today, as the music industry is too fractured to coalesce around any one particular sound.<br/>\"The whole model has completely changed and record labels lost a lot of control, so maybe it was the last hurrah.\"<br/>But speaking on the podcast, Noel Gallagher says Britpop \"was kind of absorbed back into the system\" and recycled by the major record labels.<br/>\"After what became known as Britpop, you end up with bands like Busted with the Les Paul [guitars] and all that. <br/>\"They're kind of rocking, they kind of play their own instruments, but it's just pure trash pop music.\"<br/>The first four episodes of The Rise And Fall Of Britpop are available now on BBC Sounds.

The timing of the 23 July vote has been widely criticised when temperatures in many parts of Spain have reached 40C and up to 10 million Spaniards are on holiday.   <br/>The Popular Party (PP) under Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o have their eye on victory but their lead has narrowed in the polls. To win a majority, they need to secure more than half the 350 seats in the lower house of parliament. Spaniards will also vote for their upper house.<br/>Neither the PP nor the Socialists are projected to win enough votes to govern on their own. The conservatives would likely need the support of far-right party Vox, while Mr S\u00e1nchez would look to left-wing grouping Sumar.<br/>LGBT and gender issues have become prominent campaign issues in the run-up to this election. Opposition parties PP and Vox have staunchly criticised the left-wing government's new laws on transgender rights - including making it easier for people to change their legal gender - and abortion. <br/>They have also attacked Spain's controversial \"Only Yes Means Yes\" law on sexual consent. It was passed only last August but created a loophole that cut jail time for over 1,000 convicted rapists - and Mr S\u00e1nchez ended up having to apologise and push through changes.<br/>The very existence of gender violence has been questioned by some Vox party officials, causing tensions with their potential conservative partners.<br/>Nationalism has been a hot issue too. The PP and Vox have labelled Mr S\u00e1nchez a \"traitor\" for pardoning jailed pro-independence leaders and downgrading the crime of secession.<br/>One highly effective right-wing tactic has involved targeting the prime minister with a slogan for relying on separatists to pass key reforms.<br/>He has been denounced for his pact with Basque separatist party Bildu, led by Arnaldo Otegi, who was jailed for crimes by the Eta militant group.<br/>The slogan Que te vote Txapote, meaning \"Let Txapote vote for you\", refers to another Eta militant who carried out a number of deadly terror attacks.<br/>As Spain experiences worsening droughts and heatwaves, most parties have measures to fight climate change. Only Vox's electoral programme fails to mention the issue entirely.<br/>The biggest issue for most voters is the economy, even if much of the campaign has focused on other issues. Spain is enjoying a period of growth and inflation slowed to below 2% in June, one of the lowest levels in Europe. <br/>But dismal jobless figures are one of the opposition's most frequent lines of attack against the current government. In May, Spain had the highest unemployment rate (12.7%) of all EU countries.<br/>Pedro S\u00e1nchez<br/>He became the first politician in Spain to snatch power from a sitting prime minister through a no-confidence motion in 2018. Then he narrowly won a confidence vote in January 2020 to form Spain's first coalition government since democracy was restored in the late 1970s.<br/>Pedro S\u00e1nchez, 51, is seen as a passionately pro-European integrationist and speaks English fluently; he has lectured in economics in Spain and had a spell working for the UN high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.<br/>His brand of governing has been labelled Sanchismo, and his opponents have styled the election as a choice between Sanchismo or Spain, suggesting he is a threat to the country, its traditions and values.<br/>He has spearheaded a law to bring dignity to victims of dictator Gen Francisco Franco, backed a rule giving workers the right to menstrual leave and laws expanding abortion rights.<br/>But this snap election could be a gamble too far, as his party trails his conservative rivals. He has accused the PP of seeking to put Spain in a \"sinister time machine\" with the support of far-right Vox and take the country back to \"who knows where\".<br/>Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o<br/>The Popular Party leader has knowingly cultivated a low-key image, saying recently that \"what for some may be boring, I think for the majority of citizens are qualities that a prime minister should have\". <br/>But he was seen to have won the only head-to-head TV election debate, telling Mr S\u00e1nchez he had no right to give lectures on governing pacts as he relied on separatists.<br/>A former civil servant born in Galicia in Spain's north-west, he has led the conservatives since 2022.<br/>He has gained a reputation as a safe pair of hands, serving as president of the former national health service and of the postal service.<br/>Santiago Abascal<br/>He has led the far-right Vox party he helped found in 2014, and he is known for his controversial declarations. He has said he does not believe in climate change and he has criticised the \"totalitarian law of gender ideology\", which he claims criminalises men. <br/>Last month, he used the riots in France to call for tougher immigration policies. \"Europe is threatened by mobs of anti-Europeans\u2026 who are unwilling to adapt to our way of life and our laws,\" he said. \"Europe cannot continue to accept immigrants from Muslim countries.\"<br/>Vox has already reached coalition deals with the conservatives in dozens of cities and three autonomous regions - Extremadura in the west, Valencia in the east and Castille and Le\u00f3n, north of Madrid. In the Balearic Islands, Vox have reached a pact with the PP but have no positions in government.<br/>Now Mr Abascal is looking for a share of national power too.<br/>He has cultivated strong ties with other European far-right and nationalist groups, from Hungary's ruling Fidesz and France's National Rally to the Brothers of Italy party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.<br/>Ms Meloni has given Vox's election campaign her backing, recording a video to reaffirm the parties' \"great friendship\".<br/>Yolanda D\u00edaz<br/>If Vox are the potential kingmaker for Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, then for the Socialists it would be Yolanda D\u00edaz's Sumar (Unite) alliance of 15 left-wing groups.<br/>A former Communist, she has been Spain's second deputy prime minister as well as labour minister and she is keen to be Spain's first female leader too: \"because women's time has come, and women want to be the ones who make history\".<br/>Sumar have made a big pitch for the youth vote, pledging \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,139) of funding to help 18-23 year-olds to kick-start their lives. <br/>Ms D\u00edaz is a popular politician who has helped increase the Spanish minimum wage to \u20ac1,259 and scrapped unpopular labour laws.<br/>While opinion polls have narrowed, the conservatives and Mr Feij\u00f3o are favourites to win. But they may need to form a coalition with Vox to form a majority and avoid repeat elections. <br/>Latest polls put the PP on 32-34% of the vote and the Socialists on 28-29%. Vox are on 13-14%, slightly ahead of Sumar with 12-13%.<br/>To win an absolute majority a party needs 176 seats, so no party would win outright with these results. <br/>Although Vox has made great strides in securing power-sharing deals with the conservatives in three of Spain's autonomous regions, and lesser deals in Murcia and the Balearic Islands, Mr Feij\u00f3o is less than enthusiastic at the prospect of governing with the far right.<br/>The PP leader has seemed rattled by his rival's accusations of a \"shameful\" pact with Vox. <br/>In their TV debate Mr Feij\u00f3o said Vox's Mr Abascal would not be a member of a prospective PP government \"if I don't need the votes\". He even offered the Socialists' Mr S\u00e1nchez a pact for the losing party to support the winner so that neither would need to rely on either the hard right or left.<br/>But Vox could be the only option. Last month Maria Guardiola, the PP president of the western Extremadura region, said she would never govern with a party that \"dehumanises immigrants\" and that \"rubbishes\" LGBT rights. <br/>She later changed her mind and welcomed Vox into her government, stating that \"my word is not as important as the future of Extremadura\". <br/>As well as taking a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights, another big issue that has driven support for Vox is its unequivocal stance on opposing Catalan nationalism.<br/>It has also taken a dim view over the status of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory at the southern end of the Iberian peninsula.<br/>Last year Vox objected to reports of talks between the UK and Spain by warning that \"any agreement that does not go through the recognition of the Spanish sovereignty of Gibraltar is an act of treason against Spain\".<br/>Spain makes it easier to legally change gender<br/>Spain approves divisive transgender bill<br/>Spanish PM vows to outlaw prostitution<br/>Spain confirms plans to pardon Catalan separatists<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff.<br/>The ONS says median pay for \"train and tram drivers\" is just under \u00a359,000.<br/>Although Aslef members tend to be better paid than other rail workers, Mick Whelan, general secretary of the union, told BBC News on 12 May that train drivers \"haven't had a pay rise for four years\". He was just referring to the ones who are taking industrial action.<br/>That's because a new pay deal has not been reached since their last agreement ended in 2019.<br/>However, Transport Minister Huw Merriman said the pay of train drivers \"has gone up by 39% since 2011... the highest increase of any employment group.\"<br/>He is right about the 39% increase, but we have not been able to establish whether it's the highest increase for any employment group. That's because of changes to the way the figures have been released over the last decade.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents the 14 train companies, made an offer that would have seen rail workers receive a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022. It would then negotiate reforms ahead of a second year's pay rise with individual operators.<br/>On 5 May, RMT members voted to extend the strike mandate for another six months.  <br/>The Aslef union, meanwhile, has rejected a two-year offer which would see drivers get a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.<br/>Separately, a revised offer from Network Rail was accepted by RMT members on 20 March, ending that dispute. <br/>The union said the offer amounted to an uplift on salaries of between 14.4% for the lowest paid grades to 9.2% for the highest paid. <br/>Unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. <br/>How will the rail strikes affect your journey?

But the jury's still out for me... we'll wait to see what comes out of Monday's meeting.\"<br/>Mr Cox said he would like to see retailers commit to a \"kitemark scheme\" in which they pledged to offer \"honest and fair pricing\". <br/>\"It's very simple and that's something motorists can see as they are driving past,\" he continued.<br/>The campaigner said the current system was \"opaque\" and called for every garage owner and retailer to input live prices to a database daily so \"we can see for once in our lives how prices are arrived at\". <br/>\"The phrase it goes up like a rocket and down like a feather couldn't be truer than with petrol prices,\" he added. <br/>Earlier this month, the government said that under its new initiative, drivers would be able to access live, station-by-station fuel prices on their phones or satnavs.<br/>At present, retailers only provide price information at petrol stations themselves, making it hard to compare rates, although some websites try to collate this data. <br/>Driving groups say the idea, which is used elsewhere in Europe, is overdue. <br/>For more tips click here<br/>Supermarkets forced to publish live fuel prices<br/>Fact v fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined<br/>NI fuel cheapest in UK due to Irish competition<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

At the time, there were reports that officers beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. <br/>It enraged millions of Iranians - leading to months of violent anti-government protests across the country, that saw nearly 600 protesters killed, including several state executions.<br/>In the months following the protests, many women stopped wearing hijabs altogether. It was the biggest outright challenge to the rule of the clerics in Iran since the 1979 revolution. <br/>Videos posted on social media suggest that, until recently, the sight of women not wearing hijabs was becoming more commonplace.<br/>But in turn, the Iranian authorities brought in stiffer punishments, including forcing businesses to close if they did not comply with the hijab laws.<br/>Although the protests drew out huge numbers of Iranians, some people still staunchly support the strict dress code. <br/>Earlier this year, a video emerged showing a man throwing a tub of yoghurt in the face of two unveiled women. His action was met with outrage by male and female bystanders, and he was later arrested - but so were the women.<br/>Speaking to the Reuters news agency, university student Ismail said she did not think the authorities would be able to reimpose the dress codes. <br/>\"They cannot impose it like before - the number of people who do not obey is too high now,\" she said. \"They cannot handle all of us, the last thing they can do is use violence and force against us. They cannot do it.\"<br/>Iran has had various forms of \"morality police\" since the revolution. This latest version, known formally as the Guidance Patrol (Gasht-e Ershad), began their patrols in 2006.<br/>It is unclear how many men and women work for the force, but they have access to weapons and detention centres, as well as what are called \"re-education centres\".<br/>In response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters, the UK and other Western countries imposed sanctions on the morality police and other top security figures last year.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The BBC has mapped how the death of Mahsa Amini sparked widespread unrest in Iran<br/>Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.<br/>Uncertainty over status of Iran\u2019s morality police<br/>Iran signals determination to enforce hijab rules<br/>West punishes Iran's feared morality police<br/>Iranian morality officer: Why we tell women what to wear<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated.<br/>An estimated 850,000 pensioner households do not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments.<br/>Other eligibility details are outlined here. <br/>None of these cost-of-living payments affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive.<br/>Up to six million people on the following disability benefits are receiving another \u00a3150:<br/>Those payments are being made between 20 June and 4 July.<br/>Households that receive the winter fuel payment - which is worth \u00a3200-\u00a3300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - should have received an extra \u00a3300 in November or December 2022, and will get another \u00a3300 this coming winter.<br/>Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.<br/>Two payments totalling \u00a3650 were made in 2022 to more than eight million low-income households. <br/>Payments of \u00a3300 were also paid to pensioners during the winter, and a \u00a3150 payment was also made to those with disabilities. <br/>Some people would have received all of those payments, if they were eligible.<br/>A \u00a3150 rebate, often through people's council tax bill, was made last year. The Household Support Fund, which is distributed by local councils, helped vulnerable people, including giving fuel vouchers to those in need.<br/>All household energy bills were cut by at least \u00a3400 between October and March. <br/>The discount was made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales. However, there are no plans to repeat this in winter 2023. <br/>Separate arrangements were made for households in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. <br/>They received a single payment of \u00a3600 starting in January, which was more than in the rest of the UK because a higher proportion of households use heating oil. <br/>Direct debit customers in Northern Ireland had the money paid into their bank accounts. Other customers were sent a voucher. <br/>The Commons Work and Pensions Committee is investigating whether cost-of-living payments have been received by those in most need of help.<br/>They are studying whether some have missed out on hundreds of pounds because they are just outside the qualifying criteria, and whether the package as a whole is sufficient for low-income families.<br/>The government launched an Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022, which currently limits a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to \u00a32,500.<br/>It is not a cap on how much customers actually pay - your bill depends on how much energy you actually use.<br/>The scheme, which applies to England, Wales and Scotland, was initially designed to last for two years, but was then reduced to six months. <br/>However, the government has confirmed the guarantee will continue until July, when a typical bill will fall to around \u00a32,074 a year under regulator Ofgem's energy price cap.<br/>A government scheme to cut energy bills for businesses finished at the end of March. <br/>Under a new scheme that began in April, firms get a discount on wholesale prices rather than costs being capped as under the previous deal.<br/>Heavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, get a larger discount than others.<br/>How is the rising cost of living affecting you?

This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean.<br/>There are no laws explicitly stopping this, but MPs are considering more protections for renters in England.<br/>Under a new law tabled in Parliament, tenants will be given a legal right to request to keep a \"well-behaved\" pet, which the landlord can only refuse on unreasonable grounds - such as the size of the property.<br/>However, landlords will be able to charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage.<br/>The law is also set to make it illegal for a landlord to refuse tenancies to families with children, or those on benefits.<br/>At present it could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children.<br/>However, BBC News foundalmost a quarter of some 8,000 adverts examined on the property website OpenRent indicated that families were not eligible.<br/>More than 300 listings on another property portal, Zoopla, explicitly said children were not wanted, although this was less than 1% of those we looked at.<br/>Some 73% of sampled OpenRent listings said tenants with pets were not welcome, compared with 6% on Zoopla. <br/>Shelter warned the problem would be even more widespread as sometimes prospective tenants were only told they were not welcome when they applied. <br/>Landlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to.<br/>If a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge a tenant more than the amount they pay. <br/>Exhausting, costly, miserable: My search to rent a one-bed flat<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The sector has seen considerable upheaval in the past year, after many years of ultra-low rates.<br/>The typical interest charged on fixed rates for new borrowers shot up after last autumn's mini-budget, then calmed somewhat, but has now risen to a 15-year high.<br/>That's because wages and prices are rising faster and for longer than expected, and meaning the Bank of England may raise the base rate to 6%.<br/>The Bank has warned that more than two million households will pay between \u00a3200 and \u00a3499 more a month on new deals from the end of this year and the end of 2026. <br/>A further one million mortgage holders will see their monthly payments rise by at least \u00a3500 over the next two and a half years.<br/>If the base rate does rise again, anyone on tracker deals will also face higher repayments.<br/>House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.<br/>The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggests that UK house prices will fall by 10% by 2024 compared with last year's peak.<br/>There are still likely to be plenty of options, depending on your circumstances.

If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs. <br/>The Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in over 300 years, hurting business and employment, and forcing government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.<br/>The UK narrowly avoided falling into recession at the end of 2022, after the economy grew by 0.1% between October and December compared with the previous three months.<br/>At the Budget in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility - the government's independent forecaster - predicted the economy would shrink by 0.2% this year but would avoid a recession.<br/>If GDP is growing, the government will use that as evidence to say that it is doing a good job of managing the economy. Likewise, if GDP falls, opposition politicians will say the government is running it badly.<br/>But it's not just a report card on how the government is doing. If GDP is going up steadily, people will pay more in tax simply because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals.<br/>Governments also like to keep an eye on how much they are borrowing in relation to the size of the economy. <br/>For example borrowing was equivalent to about 14% of GDP in the first year of the Covid pandemic, the highest proportion since World War Two.<br/>GDP can be measured in three ways:<br/>In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. <br/>The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.<br/>At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in.<br/>The ONS publishes more information on how this is done on its website.<br/>GDP growth doesn't tell the whole story. <br/>There are lots of things the statistics might not take into account:<br/>Just because GDP is increasing, it doesn't mean that an individual person's standard of living is improving. <br/>If a country's population increases, that will push GDP up, because with more people, more money will be spent. But individuals within that country might not be getting richer. They may be getting poorer on average, even while GDP goes up.<br/>So the ONS publishes a figure for GDP per head (of population), which can often tell a different story to the main GDP number. <br/>Critics have argued that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable, or the damage it might do to the natural world. Alternative measures have been developed. <br/>In 2010, the ONS started measuring well-being alongside economic growth. This measures health, relationships, education and skills, as well as personal finances and the environment. <br/>In 2019, New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, released the country's first \"well-being budget\", prioritising health and life-satisfaction rather than economic growth. <br/>Despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.<br/>Bank defends rate hike ahead of looming recession<br/>Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite<br/>Does GDP tell the whole economic story?<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But there are about 10 million people out of work. <br/>It may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.<br/>There have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. <br/>Yvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says \"Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. <br/>\"Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,\" she says.<br/>\"Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role.\"<br/>Ms Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.<br/>\"For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. <br/>\"So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. <br/>\"Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same.\"<br/>Not all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. <br/>Many businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. <br/>Miranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: \"Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.<br/>\"They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help.\"<br/>Lots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. <br/>But now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. <br/>Other platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. <br/>Yvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.<br/>\"Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application.\" <br/>It can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. <br/>Miranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: \"Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for.\"<br/>It's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. <br/>Our career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. <br/>Career influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. <br/>She's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. <br/>\"Maybe you landed an interview, received positive feedback on your resume or cover letter, or connected with a helpful contact. Celebrating these wins can boost your confidence and keep you motivated\".<br/>Six tips for getting a job if you're over 50<br/>Five tips when asking for a pay rise<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

List all the pros of what you've done,\" says Shan Saba, a director at Glasgow-based recruitment firm Brightwork.<br/>This evidence also helps your manager rationalise why you should be paid more, according to Stephanie Davies, a workplace psychologist.<br/>\"The brain needs a 'why' - why should I pay you this amount?\" she says.<br/>However, it's not just about bringing a list of all the things you've done. You should also be clear about what you want to do next, says Mr Saba.<br/>\"If you have aspirations of moving up through your organisation, have a plan of what you're looking to do over the coming year.\"<br/>When asking your boss for more money, it helps if you're confident and know your worth.<br/>That's something Ms Begum has noticed, from her experience of having these talks with staff.<br/>\"Here in Salisbury, it's quite difficult to get the staff we need,\" she says.<br/>\"It's also become harder to recruit from overseas. So workers have negotiating power because they know there's a shortage.\"<br/>Often people don't feel confident because there is a \"stigma\" around talking about pay, says Glassdoor's Jill Cotton, but it's \"an important part of work\".<br/>Women and people from minority backgrounds can often find it particularly hard to ask for more more, adds psychologist Stephanie Davies.<br/>Her advice to them is to ask for a mentor or role model, who can help guide them through those conversations.<br/>Most experts agree it's best to have an exact figure in mind before embarking on a conversation about pay.<br/>Do your research, advises James Reed, chair of recruitment firm Reed.<br/>\"You can go online and look at job adverts and see what other comparable jobs are being recruited for and what the salaries are,\" he says.<br/>Ms Cotton warns the figure should be realistic.<br/>\"We would all love to be paid millions of pounds every single year. But we are being paid to fulfil a role with the skillset we have,\" she says.<br/>If the above steps don't result in a pay rise, try not to be disheartened.<br/>\"Sometimes these conversations can take a while, even months, but it's important to keep the communication open,\" says Ms Begum.<br/>Pay is also not the be-all and end-all, says Mr Reed.<br/>\"It's not just necessarily about money. You might be able to get more holiday or more flexibility around working hours,\" he says, adding you could also negotiate extra training and development.<br/>And if you don't feel you're getting what you want from your employer, remember, there are other opportunities out there.<br/>\"You can always look elsewhere, that's the really big lesson,\" says Ms Davies.<br/>Pay rises at fastest pace for over 20 years<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Strike dates: What do junior doctors and teachers want?<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

If you own a house or a car you may lose them. <br/>The bankruptcy will affect your credit record for at least six years. But after one year all your debts will be written off. The procedure currently costs \u00a3680, but you can pay in instalments. <br/>Individual Voluntary Arrangement: Under an IVA, an insolvency practitioner will help you strike a deal with your creditors, which allows you to pay off your debts over a fixed period - say five years.

At the same time, the war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.<br/>The war also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. <br/>This effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of salad and other vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.<br/>Alcohol prices in restaurants and pubs also rose. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>The Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is well above that. <br/>The traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. <br/>This makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. <br/>When people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.<br/>Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. <br/>In June, the Bank increased interest rates for the 13th time in a row, taking the main rate to 5%. <br/>But when inflation is caused by factors such as global energy prices, action from the Bank of England may not be enough to slow it down. <br/>Many people's pay isn't keeping up with rising prices. <br/>The average weekly salary in the UK, excluding bonuses, was \u00a3607 in May, up from \u00a3604 in April,according to official figures.<br/>But when you take inflation into account, regular pay actually fell by 0.8% in the three months to May, compared with the same period the year before. <br/>Unions say wages should reflect the cost of living and many workers have been striking over pay. <br/>However, the government argues big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. <br/>Lower inflation doesn't mean prices fall. It just means they rise less quickly.<br/>The Bank of England has predicted inflation will drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% it had been anticipating.<br/>Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it was \"crucial that we see the job through\" and get price rises back to the 2% target, because people \"should trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value\".<br/>But he admitted that price inflation was being \"more sticky than previously expected\".<br/>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.<br/>In January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said halving inflation by the end of 2023 was one of the government's five key pledges. <br/>Other countries have also been experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.<br/>Many of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials and the fallout from Covid.<br/>The annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro was estimated to be 6.1% in May, down from 7% in April.<br/>The European Central Bank has also been increasing interest rates to try to bring eurozone inflation down. Its benchmark rate is now 4%, the highest level for 22 years.<br/>Inflation has also dropped back in the US. It was 4% in the 12 months to May, down from 4.9% in April, the 11th consecutive monthly fall. <br/>The US central bank has increased its key interest rate to between 5% and 5.25%, up from near 0% a year ago - and the highest level since 2007. <br/>However, it left rates unchanged in June, saying it wanted to assess the impact of the previous rises.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It is the site of the hottest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth: 134F (56.7C). <br/>The usually crowded streets of Las Vegas were considerably emptier than normal on Sunday, with security guards guarding the fountains of upscale casinos and hotels to prevent people from jumping in.<br/>The famous strip was a quiet inferno. Some people walked outside, but mostly just to cross the street to the next casino. And those who did exit were mostly intoxicated. <br/>When one couple was asked why they were outside, they said \"All roads lead to the Bellagio,\" referring to one of the most popular hotels and casinos on the strip. Another group of young men shouted, \"It's Vegas baby! The heat's not going to stop us!\" <br/>But elsewhere in Las Vegas, people were hanging on to any bit of shade, whether it came from the shadow of a building or even a small tree. At a taco shop on the strip, the tables were all full of patrons dripping with sweat and looking utterly wiped out from the heat. Workers too were draped in the booths, not speaking to each other, but fanning themselves down. <br/>Inside the casinos though, business continued. The air conditioning was blasting so high, people were wearing jumpers to stay warm, and there was no indication of devastating temperatures, other than the people walking in off the street with sweat streaming down their faces. <br/>El Paso, in Texas, has seen temperatures of 100.4F (38C) and above for more than a month now, with no respite in sight. <br/>In Phoenix, Arizona, temperatures have remained above 109.4F (43C) for 17 days. Thick cloud cover on Sunday meant the city was granted a modest reprieve from recent peaks, but daytime temperatures still reached highs of 114F (45.5C).<br/>The heat is set to continue for the foreseeable future, and authorities are warning that vulnerable people - including children, pregnant women and the elderly - are at serious risk of heat-related illness.<br/>Mobile clinics report treating homeless people suffering from third-degree burns. Public buildings in some parts of California and Nevada have been turned into \"cooling centres\" where people can take refuge from the heat. <br/>Amid the extreme temperatures being seen in Death Valley, Park Ranger Matthew Lamar said: \"We hadn't hit 130F (54.4C) here for over 100 years. And then in 2020, we got 130, in 2021 we got 130, and then we might hit it again this weekend.\"<br/>He added that the weather was attracting tourists who wanted to \"experience the extremes\".<br/>But some visitors said others should not lose sight of the fact that those extremes are a symptom of climate change. <br/>Speaking to Reuters on Saturday, Tom Comitta said: \"People are coming out here to celebrate this. People are excited. It's not a milestone. I'm calling it Happy Death Day.\"<br/>A heat dome occurs when an area of high pressure pushes air towards the ground, compressing it and causing it to heat. The warmer air then rises again, setting up a cycle in which air sinks through the centre of the 'dome' and rises up its sides. <br/>The pressure also prevents other weather systems that would cool the area - such as rain clouds - from forming. <br/>The NWS has said that the current system in the southwestern US is \"one of the strongest\" of its kind to hit the region.<br/>The Weather Channel has said the dome will expand across the nation's south by the middle of next week - meaning other southern US states will see temperatures rise.<br/>Meanwhile, other parts of the US are bracing themselves for severe thunderstorms and flash floods - and north-eastern states could experience another bout of poor air quality as a result of the continuing wildfires in Canada. <br/>\"As if the rain coming out of the sky isn't enough, if you start looking up tomorrow, you're going to see a similar situation in what we had a couple of weeks ago because of the air quality degradation [from the wildfires],\" New York governor Kathy Hochul said at a press conference. \"And as I said before, this is possibly our new normal.\"<br/>The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.<br/>'Dangerous\u2019 US heatwave threatens new records<br/>Canada's far north records its hottest temperature<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

At the time, there were reports that officers beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. <br/>It enraged millions of Iranians - leading to months of violent anti-government protests across the country, that saw nearly 600 protesters killed, including several state executions.<br/>In the months following the protests, many women stopped wearing hijabs altogether. It was the biggest outright challenge to the rule of the clerics in Iran since the 1979 revolution. <br/>Videos posted on social media suggest that, until recently, the sight of women not wearing hijabs was becoming more commonplace.<br/>But in turn, the Iranian authorities brought in stiffer punishments, including forcing businesses to close if they did not comply with the hijab laws.<br/>Although the protests drew out huge numbers of Iranians, some people still staunchly support the strict dress code. <br/>Earlier this year, a video emerged showing a man throwing a tub of yoghurt in the face of two unveiled women. His action was met with outrage by male and female bystanders, and he was later arrested - but so were the women.<br/>Speaking to the Reuters news agency, university student Ismail said she did not think the authorities would be able to reimpose the dress codes. <br/>\"They cannot impose it like before - the number of people who do not obey is too high now,\" she said. \"They cannot handle all of us, the last thing they can do is use violence and force against us. They cannot do it.\"<br/>Iran has had various forms of \"morality police\" since the revolution. This latest version, known formally as the Guidance Patrol (Gasht-e Ershad), began their patrols in 2006.<br/>It is unclear how many men and women work for the force, but they have access to weapons and detention centres, as well as what are called \"re-education centres\".<br/>In response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters, the UK and other Western countries imposed sanctions on the morality police and other top security figures last year.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The BBC has mapped how the death of Mahsa Amini sparked widespread unrest in Iran<br/>Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.<br/>Uncertainty over status of Iran\u2019s morality police<br/>Iran signals determination to enforce hijab rules<br/>West punishes Iran's feared morality police<br/>Iranian morality officer: Why we tell women what to wear<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

I hope one did some things right.\"<br/>The pair split in 1981 and Birkin continued her acting and singing career, releasing albums including Baby Alone in Babylone in 1983 and Amour des Feintes in 1990.<br/>She was also a model and came to be widely seen as a fashion trendsetter, inspiring the Birkin handbag, a style put into production by luxury French brand Herm\u00e8s in 1984.<br/>In a chance encounter on an Air France flight, Birkin happened to be sitting next to Jean-Louis Dumas, the then-CEO of Herm\u00e8s, when she spilled the contents of her bag. <br/>While bemoaning the lack of large bags on the market, especially for mothers, Dumas \"immediately sketched a supple and spacious rectangular holdall with a burnished flap and saddle stitching\", according to the Herm\u00e8s website.<br/>And thus, the Birkin was born. One of the most exclusive bags, some styles cost many tens of thousands of dollars and have waiting lists of months, if not years.<br/>The style became a fashion hit and has spawned several imitations - but in 2006, Birkin told the Guardian: \"I love it, but I lug so much stuff around in it that I believe it is part of the reason I have tendonitis.\"<br/>Birkin campaigned for numerous causes throughout her life - including asking Herm\u00e8s to drop her name from its product in 2015 over animal welfare concerns.<br/>Prior to moving to France and meeting Gainsbourg, Birkin was married to the British composer John Barry until the late 1960s. <br/>Their daughter, Kate Barry, was a fashion photographer who worked for Vogue and died in 2013 at the age of 46.<br/>Birkin has a third daughter - the musician, model and actress Lou Doillon - from her 1980s relationship with French film director Jacques Doillon.<br/>Birkin's acting credits included films such as the 1966 classic Blow Up, Death on the Nile (1978) and Evil Under the Sun (1982).<br/>She released a self-penned album in 2002 called Arabesque and a collection of live recordings in 2009 under the title Jane at the Palace.<br/>Menna Rawlings, the British ambassador to France, paid tribute to her on Twitter, describing her as \"the most French of British artists\".<br/>She was treated for leukaemia in the late 1990s and it was reported in September 2021 that she had suffered a stroke, forcing her to cancel a planned appearance at an American film festival.<br/>Jane Birkin: Artist and style icon's life in pictures<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Nigeria has 780 local councils but most of them are hardly functional. <br/>The vacuum is filled by men like Mr Nwokuha - or just about anyone who can set up a roadblock and enforce their authority.<br/>These tend to consist of a wooden bar between two rusty barrels, and home-made spikes for drivers who want to be smart by trying to avoid them.<br/>They are most common in the richer southern parts of Nigeria, including highways where tax collection is done on behalf of some state governments. <br/>One lorry driver tells the BBC he pays as much as 80,000 naira (\u00a380; $100) as he travels through scores of roadblocks on his way from Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, to Imo in the east: a distance of 540km (335 miles).<br/>\"Between Edo and Port Harcourt [alone] there are 15 such roadblocks,\" he adds.<br/>Expressing a similar view, a cold-chain logistics operator says: \"There are numerous haulage taxes, there is one called revenue, there is a radio tax, there is a tax for loading, another for parking, one for unloading.\" <br/>And that is not including the bribes he often has to pay police officers as he drives around the country.<br/>Clement Akanibo, of Nigeria's Chartered Institute of Taxation, describes it as \"akin to collecting tax at gunpoint\". <br/>\"It makes it difficult to do business and increases the final cost by as much as 15%,\" he says.<br/>It is unclear how Mr Tinubu plans to end this, but he will need the support of state and local governments as these taxes fall under their jurisdiction - not that of the federal government.<br/>At its heart lies a powerful system of patronage that sees a portion of the money going into the pockets of politicians, powerful families, and the army of unemployed men like Mr Nwokuha.<br/>Mr Tinubu's government says it wants to overhaul the entire tax system to boost its revenue so it can increase the amount it spends on services like health and education, as well as pay off its ballooning debts.<br/>It has set itself the target of increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio to 18% within the next three years.<br/>Official Nigerian data shows the ratio was around 11% in 2021, lower than what the World Bank reported for Kenya (13%) and South Africa (26%).<br/>For now, Mr Tinubu's government is focusing on the taxes it is responsible for - including Value-Added Tax (VAT).<br/>The federal government does not use so-called tax collectors, expecting businesses to make direct payments. <br/>In what appears to be an attempt to end tax evasion, it wants to digitise VAT payments, starting with the 40 million-strong association of market traders.<br/>This won't be easy as most of them do not keep financial records and have never paid VAT, so might resist the move amid the current economic hardship.<br/>But if the plan works, Mr Tinubu's government could then hope to persuade state and local governments to drop their archaic system - something that many Nigerians would welcome as it would free them from the clutches of menacing tax collectors like Mr Nwokuha. <br/>The five tests awaiting Nigeria's new president<br/>Focus on Africa podcasts<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The timing of the 23 July vote has been widely criticised when temperatures in many parts of Spain have reached 40C and up to 10 million Spaniards are on holiday.   <br/>The Popular Party (PP) under Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o have their eye on victory but their lead has narrowed in the polls. To win a majority, they need to secure more than half the 350 seats in the lower house of parliament. Spaniards will also vote for their upper house.<br/>Neither the PP nor the Socialists are projected to win enough votes to govern on their own. The conservatives would likely need the support of far-right party Vox, while Mr S\u00e1nchez would look to left-wing grouping Sumar.<br/>LGBT and gender issues have become prominent campaign issues in the run-up to this election. Opposition parties PP and Vox have staunchly criticised the left-wing government's new laws on transgender rights - including making it easier for people to change their legal gender - and abortion. <br/>They have also attacked Spain's controversial \"Only Yes Means Yes\" law on sexual consent. It was passed only last August but created a loophole that cut jail time for over 1,000 convicted rapists - and Mr S\u00e1nchez ended up having to apologise and push through changes.<br/>The very existence of gender violence has been questioned by some Vox party officials, causing tensions with their potential conservative partners.<br/>Nationalism has been a hot issue too. The PP and Vox have labelled Mr S\u00e1nchez a \"traitor\" for pardoning jailed pro-independence leaders and downgrading the crime of secession.<br/>One highly effective right-wing tactic has involved targeting the prime minister with a slogan for relying on separatists to pass key reforms.<br/>He has been denounced for his pact with Basque separatist party Bildu, led by Arnaldo Otegi, who was jailed for crimes by the Eta militant group.<br/>The slogan Que te vote Txapote, meaning \"Let Txapote vote for you\", refers to another Eta militant who carried out a number of deadly terror attacks.<br/>As Spain experiences worsening droughts and heatwaves, most parties have measures to fight climate change. Only Vox's electoral programme fails to mention the issue entirely.<br/>The biggest issue for most voters is the economy, even if much of the campaign has focused on other issues. Spain is enjoying a period of growth and inflation slowed to below 2% in June, one of the lowest levels in Europe. <br/>But dismal jobless figures are one of the opposition's most frequent lines of attack against the current government. In May, Spain had the highest unemployment rate (12.7%) of all EU countries.<br/>Pedro S\u00e1nchez<br/>He became the first politician in Spain to snatch power from a sitting prime minister through a no-confidence motion in 2018. Then he narrowly won a confidence vote in January 2020 to form Spain's first coalition government since democracy was restored in the late 1970s.<br/>Pedro S\u00e1nchez, 51, is seen as a passionately pro-European integrationist and speaks English fluently; he has lectured in economics in Spain and had a spell working for the UN high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.<br/>His brand of governing has been labelled Sanchismo, and his opponents have styled the election as a choice between Sanchismo or Spain, suggesting he is a threat to the country, its traditions and values.<br/>He has spearheaded a law to bring dignity to victims of dictator Gen Francisco Franco, backed a rule giving workers the right to menstrual leave and laws expanding abortion rights.<br/>But this snap election could be a gamble too far, as his party trails his conservative rivals. He has accused the PP of seeking to put Spain in a \"sinister time machine\" with the support of far-right Vox and take the country back to \"who knows where\".<br/>Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o<br/>The Popular Party leader has knowingly cultivated a low-key image, saying recently that \"what for some may be boring, I think for the majority of citizens are qualities that a prime minister should have\". <br/>But he was seen to have won the only head-to-head TV election debate, telling Mr S\u00e1nchez he had no right to give lectures on governing pacts as he relied on separatists.<br/>A former civil servant born in Galicia in Spain's north-west, he has led the conservatives since 2022.<br/>He has gained a reputation as a safe pair of hands, serving as president of the former national health service and of the postal service.<br/>Santiago Abascal<br/>He has led the far-right Vox party he helped found in 2014, and he is known for his controversial declarations. He has said he does not believe in climate change and he has criticised the \"totalitarian law of gender ideology\", which he claims criminalises men. <br/>Last month, he used the riots in France to call for tougher immigration policies. \"Europe is threatened by mobs of anti-Europeans\u2026 who are unwilling to adapt to our way of life and our laws,\" he said. \"Europe cannot continue to accept immigrants from Muslim countries.\"<br/>Vox has already reached coalition deals with the conservatives in dozens of cities and three autonomous regions - Extremadura in the west, Valencia in the east and Castille and Le\u00f3n, north of Madrid. In the Balearic Islands, Vox have reached a pact with the PP but have no positions in government.<br/>Now Mr Abascal is looking for a share of national power too.<br/>He has cultivated strong ties with other European far-right and nationalist groups, from Hungary's ruling Fidesz and France's National Rally to the Brothers of Italy party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.<br/>Ms Meloni has given Vox's election campaign her backing, recording a video to reaffirm the parties' \"great friendship\".<br/>Yolanda D\u00edaz<br/>If Vox are the potential kingmaker for Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, then for the Socialists it would be Yolanda D\u00edaz's Sumar (Unite) alliance of 15 left-wing groups.<br/>A former Communist, she has been Spain's second deputy prime minister as well as labour minister and she is keen to be Spain's first female leader too: \"because women's time has come, and women want to be the ones who make history\".<br/>Sumar have made a big pitch for the youth vote, pledging \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,139) of funding to help 18-23 year-olds to kick-start their lives. <br/>Ms D\u00edaz is a popular politician who has helped increase the Spanish minimum wage to \u20ac1,259 and scrapped unpopular labour laws.<br/>While opinion polls have narrowed, the conservatives and Mr Feij\u00f3o are favourites to win. But they may need to form a coalition with Vox to form a majority and avoid repeat elections. <br/>Latest polls put the PP on 32-34% of the vote and the Socialists on 28-29%. Vox are on 13-14%, slightly ahead of Sumar with 12-13%.<br/>To win an absolute majority a party needs 176 seats, so no party would win outright with these results. <br/>Although Vox has made great strides in securing power-sharing deals with the conservatives in three of Spain's autonomous regions, and lesser deals in Murcia and the Balearic Islands, Mr Feij\u00f3o is less than enthusiastic at the prospect of governing with the far right.<br/>The PP leader has seemed rattled by his rival's accusations of a \"shameful\" pact with Vox. <br/>In their TV debate Mr Feij\u00f3o said Vox's Mr Abascal would not be a member of a prospective PP government \"if I don't need the votes\". He even offered the Socialists' Mr S\u00e1nchez a pact for the losing party to support the winner so that neither would need to rely on either the hard right or left.<br/>But Vox could be the only option. Last month Maria Guardiola, the PP president of the western Extremadura region, said she would never govern with a party that \"dehumanises immigrants\" and that \"rubbishes\" LGBT rights. <br/>She later changed her mind and welcomed Vox into her government, stating that \"my word is not as important as the future of Extremadura\". <br/>As well as taking a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights, another big issue that has driven support for Vox is its unequivocal stance on opposing Catalan nationalism.<br/>It has also taken a dim view over the status of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory at the southern end of the Iberian peninsula.<br/>Last year Vox objected to reports of talks between the UK and Spain by warning that \"any agreement that does not go through the recognition of the Spanish sovereignty of Gibraltar is an act of treason against Spain\".<br/>Spain makes it easier to legally change gender<br/>Spain approves divisive transgender bill<br/>Spanish PM vows to outlaw prostitution<br/>Spain confirms plans to pardon Catalan separatists<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.<br/>The short-term gains are marginal.<br/>The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.<br/>Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.<br/>It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.<br/>Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate.<br/>However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.  <br/>Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income.<br/>In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.<br/>The key perk is greater access to each other's markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.<br/>But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.<br/>Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.<br/>That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.<br/>The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.<br/>Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.<br/>In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.<br/>In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.<br/>However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.<br/>So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.<br/>And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be consistent with re-joining the EU itself.<br/>In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?<br/>Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.<br/>The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.<br/>As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.<br/>And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.<br/>Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government. <br/>The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year. <br/>It is the partnership's potential that is key.<br/>The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.<br/>But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.<br/>China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.<br/>Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?<br/>The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.<br/>America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.<br/>At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.<br/>But ultimately it could yield considerable rewards.<br/>MPs back Sunak's new Brexit Northern Ireland deal<br/>More immigration not a Brexit betrayal, says Hunt<br/>How far is Brexit to blame for the tomato shortage?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Hours before arriving in Lithuania, he had hit out at Stockholm for failing to do enough to stop terrorism.<br/>His sudden change of tack highlights just how much the newly re-elected president is looking to mend diplomatic relations with the West and reassure foreign investors who have ditched Turkey in recent years because of its economic woes.<br/>\"It's classic Erdogan. It comes out of nowhere, the sudden shift in policy and tone,\" said Batu Coskun, an Ankara-based political analyst at the Sadiq Institute think tank. \"Any other political leader would suffer from such a U-turn. But he's prospering from it.\"<br/>That's because he secured commitments from Sweden, the US, Nato and even the European Union in return for his about-face.<br/>Turkey now looks on course to receive a long-awaited delivery of F-16 fighter jets from the United States, and Mr Erdogan says Brussels is \"positive\" about reviving Ankara's long-stalled bid to join the EU and moving forward on visa liberalisation.<br/>But the swiftness of his change of heart is being seen as a clear sign he is taking a more constructive approach with US and European allies who, for years, have worried about democratic backsliding in Turkey.<br/>There were numerous photo opportunities at the Nato summit with France's Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.<br/>US President Joe Biden highlighted his own bilateral meeting with Mr Erdogan, after years of keeping him at arm's length.<br/>\"I think post-elections Erdogan feels a bit more confident regarding relations both with Russia and the West,\" says political analyst Batu Coskun.<br/>Confidence abroad, but urgency at home to revive Turkey's floundering economy. It was the biggest issue in his hard-fought election win in a historic second-round vote at the end of May.<br/>\"Business is not so good,\" says Burhan Morkoc, a baker who spends 17 hours a day shovelling bagel-like pastries called simits in and out of a wood-burning oven.<br/>\"Everything is so expensive\u2026 people who used to buy two, now buy one. The demand has gone down.\"<br/>That's because inflation here is hovering stubbornly at just under 40%, down from its peak of 85.5% in October 2022.<br/>The nation's lira currency has plumbed record lows against the US dollar this summer. <br/>While central banks around the world have raised interest rates to cool rising prices, President Erdogan has resisted economic orthodoxy, arguing that higher rates would cause prices to rise. Instead he has kept pressure on the Turkish central bank to keep borrowing costs low.<br/>Burhan Morkoc runs his small bakery with three brothers in Istanbul's Kad\u0131koy neighbourhood.<br/>Rent in the area has surged 400% over the past year and a half, he complains.<br/>During the same period, other essentials for the bakery have also skyrocketed - wood for the oven has gone up 900%, flour is up nearly 500%, yeast 255%, and sesame seeds are 150% more expensive.<br/>To help ease such burdens, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, a Wall Street veteran whom President Erdogan appointed to the job last month, has vowed to restore \"rational economic policy\". <br/>Together with newly-appointed central bank governor Hafize Gaye Erkan - who also has Wall Street experience - he oversaw the first rise in interest rates the country has seen in 27 months, from 8.5% to 15%. <br/>But the baker isn't convinced the politicians understand the urgency of the situation for businesses like his.  <br/>\"Come and stand here for 18 hours, 20 hours. I work with three hours of sleep. Let [Mehmet Simsek] do this. It is easy to sit on a seat and make decisions. It doesn't work that way,\" he said. <br/>As he flew home from the Nato summit in Lithuania, President Erdogan's focus was on his promise to the Turkish public to restore economic prosperity.<br/>\"We will bring inflation down to single digits again,\" he told journalists on board the flight.<br/>Repairing Turkey's embattled $900bn (\u00a3685bn) economy will take time and patience, economists say.<br/>\"There's really no quick, magical cure in sight. You have to prioritise the problems and perform triage,\" said Murat Gulkan, head of OMG Capital Advisors, a small investment firm based in Istanbul. \"That involves cooling down the economy, which of course is politically undesirable.\"<br/>Turkey also needs to win back the confidence of foreign investors.<br/>Its current account deficit reached $37.7bn in the first five months of this year - a record level that means Turkey spent far more on imports than it made selling exports.<br/>It's not just the West where President Erdogan hopes to bridge some of that gap. Next week, he'll visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. <br/>\"We are, once again, turning our face to the West. Behind us is Russia,\" declared economist Iris Cibre.<br/>President Erdogan angered Russia last weekend when he allowed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to return home with five military commanders who were supposed to remain in Turkey for the rest of the war.<br/>The Kremlin has even warned Turkey not to view Europeans through rose-tinted lenses.<br/>But President Erdogan also plans to host Vladimir Putin in August, and he hopes to persuade Russia to rescue a Black Sea deal that runs out next week and which allows Ukraine to export grain.<br/>For Batu Coskun it is all part of a balancing act for a Turkish leader who wants to keep Russia onside: \"That relationship won't be so easily replaced with supposedly growing relations with the West.\"<br/>What is Turkey's leader Erdogan up to now?<br/>Erdogan: Turkey's all-powerful leader of 20 years<br/>Why Erdogan's victory matters for the West<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But studio executives have said their demands are unreasonable, leaving Tinseltown at an impasse.<br/>Here's why Hollywood is on strike. <br/>There are three major players involved in the negotiations. <br/>The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union speaks for more than 160,000 members who include actors, stunt co-ordinators, voiceover artists and background actors. <br/>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) is a union that represents writers in film, television, radio and online. <br/>And the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) represents major film studios like Disney and Paramount, American television networks like Fox and NBC, and streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. <br/>Talks broke down for several reasons. Let's walk through a few of them. <br/>The advent of streaming has reshaped the way the world consumes TV and films, but it's also changed how actors are paid.<br/>Typically, actors and writers are paid upfront for their work, but many maintain their income through residuals, steady compensation based on re-runs of TV shows and films. When shows were syndicated across ad-supported networks, residual cheques could sustain veteran actors, like SAG president Fran Drescher, throughout their careers. <br/>But streaming has changed that. Both actors and writers say their residuals have plummeted and it is destroying their livelihoods. <br/>Michael Patrick Lane has been acting in Hollywood for more than a decade. But he told BBC News he's made as little as $300 (\u00a3229) in residuals for five episodes of television. After paying for acting classes, agents and managers Mr Lane said he barely takes home $20,000 (\u00a315,200) a year. <br/>\"Even though I'm a consistent working actor, for the most part, these last few years, I can't take care of my family,\" he said, adding that it's delayed his plan to have kids. <br/>SAG-AFTRA says members are striking for more equitable division of the profits from movies and television. But according to the AMPTP, SAG negotiators chose to forego \"the highest percentage increase in minimums in 35 years\" in favour of going on strike. <br/>\"The AMPTP presented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases,\" the studio bosses said. \"The Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: How the Hollywood strike affects you in 75 seconds<br/>Maya Gilbert-Dunbar is a dual member of SAG and the Writers Guild who is now running for SAG-AFTRA president. She said the majority of members in the SAG union barely make above minimum wage. <br/>\"The bulk of our membership are career background actors,\" she said. \"These people are barely making $150 (\u00a3114) a day.\" <br/>For many actors, joining SAG-AFTRA is also the only pathway to health insurance. But Ms Dunbar estimates only 15% of the union's 160,000 members make the required $26,000 a year to qualify for healthcare coverage. What's more, she said \"elder\" actors are kicked off the insurance plan after they turn 65. <br/>AMPTP says it has proposed \"substantial increases in pension and health contribution caps\". <br/>While countless blockbusters warned of the dangers of AI, few could have predicted it would lead to Hollywood's first major strike in decades. <br/>The AMPTP says it offered SAG a \"ground-breaking AI proposal which protects performers' digital likenesses, including a requirement for performers' consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance\".<br/>But at the press conference announcing the strike, SAG's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, explained why the union flatly rejected the idea.  <br/>\"They proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day's pay, and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity, in any project they want with no consent and with no compensation.\"<br/>\"So if you think that's a ground-breaking proposal, I suggest you think again.\"<br/>For now at least, both sides seem firmly dug in. A strike often means that neither side is willing to negotiate, and it could take time for both unions to return to the table. The last time both writers and actors manned the picket line, the strike lasted 10 weeks and was led by then-actor Ronald Reagan. <br/>The writers' strike is already in its third month with no end in sight.<br/>While the strikes last, don't expect to see Hollywood stars at film premieres, festivals, conventions or red carpets. Union rules prohibit actors from taking any work, including promotion or publicity for projects. <br/>\"A strike isn't the end, it's the beginning, unfortunately,\" Ms Dunbar said, adding that she hopes that in the end both parties can agree on a suitable contract. <br/>\"We're going to strike, people can't work, [but] you have to secure a deal that justifies doing this. And that's what I hope happens,\" she said.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The famous faces out and about on the picket line supporting the Hollywood strike<br/>Strike impacts films and shows beyond Hollywood<br/>Hollywood strike could last until end of the year<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Kreiz began working on it when he became CEO of Mattel in 2018 and he remains executive producer. <br/>Barbie and Ken are played by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, with Greta Gerwig directing.<br/>Kreiz acknowledges there is some risk in giving Barbie the Hollywood treatment, working with directors and writers who have their own creative ideas.<br/>There is \"humour and self-deprecation\" in the film, he says (not least on his part, as he is played by Will Ferrell, a controlling and slightly stuffy CEO).<br/>It's clear even from the trailer that Barbie is the butt of jokes. <br/>If you're being generous, she is portrayed as na\u00efve and innocent. If you aren't, she's shallow and superficial, obsessed with appearance and unable to comprehend the meaning of sex, death - or life without high heels.<br/>Barbie's \"Dreamland\" is a pink utopia, divorced from reality.<br/>\"This movie has been 64 years in the making (Barbie launched in 1959),\" says Kreiz, \"but it represents how the culture sees Barbie today.\"<br/>Barbie remains Mattel's biggest-selling brand, making the company more than \u00a31bn ($1.5bn) annually. Its other brands include Hot Wheels, Masters of the Universe, Monster High, Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine.<br/>Kreiz argues Mattel's other brands also have the potential to be turned into successful spin-offs.<br/>\"The devil works hard but Barbie's marketing team is working harder,\" according to marketing expert Mike Buonaiuto, author of Founder Therapy, who admires the inventive advertising the team behind the film has been up to, including the Airbnb listing of a Barbie Dreamhouse. <br/>\"But let's be honest,\" Buonaiuto points out, \"the opportunity for the Mattel universe is vastly different to Marvel's, and whilst Barbie is being powered by millennial nostalgia collaborations, try and do the same for Thomas the Tank Engine or Hot Wheels and you probably won't get the same result. <br/>\"The depth of world-building Mattel can pull from isn't competition for Marvel's.\"<br/>But the recent collapse of Toys R Us shows why toymakers like Mattel need to diversify beyond the sale of physical products, adds Buonaiuto.<br/>Barbie was first introduced in America in 1959, developed by Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel. <br/>Before Barbie, dolls typically took the form of babies, so children could play at being a nurturing parent. However, Barbies encouraged children to play at being adolescents, imagining their future selves through the dolls.<br/>As the original TV adverts that ran during Mickey Mouse Club told children: \"Someday I'm going to be exactly like you.\"<br/>This proved alluring and good business. More than a billion Barbie dolls had been sold by the early 1990s.<br/>But there have also been questions about what exactly Barbie dolls teach children, especially around body image. <br/>The original Barbie design was extremely skinny and the messaging reinforced unhealthy ideas. One infamous slumber party set created in the mid-1960s featured bathroom scales fixed at 110 pounds (50kg) and a dieting book that advised: \"Don't eat\".<br/>Another talking Barbie created in the early 1990s had the doll saying, \"Math class is tough.\" Mattel later apologised.  <br/>These issues continued to affect people's perception of the brand and arguably lay behind a dip in popularity around a decade ago.<br/>Mattel has learned lessons and is now keeping up with the times, says Kreiz.<br/>\"Barbie is a flag carrier for diversity and inclusivity,\" he says, \"with more than 170 different Barbie types in terms of body shape and skin colour, and Barbie has more than 200 careers, so girls can explore their potential in different ways.\"<br/>Barbie has recently brought out dolls with disabilities, prosthetic limbs, and one with Down's Syndrome. <br/>The \"classic, traditional Barbie\" is less than half of the business now, says Kreiz.<br/>That new commitment to diversity is reflected in the cast of the film, while the classic Barbie, who is the central character, is gently mocked.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Kreiz also points out that Mattel is restructuring the company to move with the times.<br/>Now it simply divides its products into categories (like dolls, vehicles and pre-school), rather than having teams devoted to separate boys' and girls' products. This is despite the fact that many shops still divide toys by gender, with pink aisles for girls who want to be princesses, and blue ones for boys who like dinosaurs and construction sets.<br/>The Barbie film is part of Kreiz's masterplan to position Mattel as a \"talent magnet\", working with people like film directors to try different things with its well-known creations.<br/>\"People who buy our products aren't just consumers,\" says Kreiz. \"They are fans, who have an emotional relationship to the products. Kids touch, hug and go to bed with our toys.<br/>\"We believe in the long-term opportunity for Barbie. But we need to evolve her, keep her relevant and in the centre of cultural conversation.\"<br/>Feeling the 'Kenergy' on Barbie movie pink carpet<br/>Everything you need to know about the Barbie movie<br/>Is Barbie's makeover working?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

A failure to comply would see retailers legally forced to share their prices, it added.<br/>Petrol and diesel prices jumped to record highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, but have since dropped significantly. <br/>However, the CMA, the UK's competition watchdog, investigated the UK fuel market earlier this year following concerns falling wholesale prices were not being passed on to consumers.<br/>It concluded competition was \"not working as well as it should be\".<br/>The CMA found average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to \u00a3900m in extra costs for drivers.<br/>Howard Cox established FairFuelUK to campaign for more \"honesty, fairness and transparency\" in fuel pricing in 2010. <br/>He said: \"If it [the voluntary scheme] doesn't have teeth, they will have to have full regulatory powers and fine retailers. But the jury's still out for me... we'll wait to see what comes out of Monday's meeting.\"<br/>Mr Cox said he would like to see retailers commit to a \"kitemark scheme\" in which they pledged to offer \"honest and fair pricing\". <br/>\"It's very simple and that's something motorists can see as they are driving past,\" he continued.<br/>The campaigner said the current system was \"opaque\" and called for every garage owner and retailer to input live prices to a database daily so \"we can see for once in our lives how prices are arrived at\". <br/>\"The phrase it goes up like a rocket and down like a feather couldn't be truer than with petrol prices,\" he added. <br/>Earlier this month, the government said that under its new initiative, drivers would be able to access live, station-by-station fuel prices on their phones or satnavs.<br/>At present, retailers only provide price information at petrol stations themselves, making it hard to compare rates, although some websites try to collate this data. <br/>Driving groups say the idea, which is used elsewhere in Europe, is overdue. <br/>For more tips click here<br/>Supermarkets forced to publish live fuel prices<br/>Fact v fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined<br/>NI fuel cheapest in UK due to Irish competition<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff.<br/>The ONS says median pay for \"train and tram drivers\" is just under \u00a359,000.<br/>Although Aslef members tend to be better paid than other rail workers, Mick Whelan, general secretary of the union, told BBC News on 12 May that train drivers \"haven't had a pay rise for four years\". He was just referring to the ones who are taking industrial action.<br/>That's because a new pay deal has not been reached since their last agreement ended in 2019.<br/>However, Transport Minister Huw Merriman said the pay of train drivers \"has gone up by 39% since 2011... the highest increase of any employment group.\"<br/>He is right about the 39% increase, but we have not been able to establish whether it's the highest increase for any employment group. That's because of changes to the way the figures have been released over the last decade.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents the 14 train companies, made an offer that would have seen rail workers receive a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022. It would then negotiate reforms ahead of a second year's pay rise with individual operators.<br/>On 5 May, RMT members voted to extend the strike mandate for another six months.  <br/>The Aslef union, meanwhile, has rejected a two-year offer which would see drivers get a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.<br/>Separately, a revised offer from Network Rail was accepted by RMT members on 20 March, ending that dispute. <br/>The union said the offer amounted to an uplift on salaries of between 14.4% for the lowest paid grades to 9.2% for the highest paid. <br/>Unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. <br/>How will the rail strikes affect your journey?

Cash flow remains negative, Mr Musk said at the weekend, although the billionaire did not put a time frame on the 50% drop in ad revenue.<br/>In a tweet he said: \"Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else.\"<br/>After laying off thousands of employees and cutting cloud service bills, Mr Musk said Twitter was on track to post $3bn (\u00a32.29bn) in revenue in 2023, down from $5.1bn in 2021.<br/>The development is the latest sign the aggressive cost-cutting measures have not been enough to ignite a return of advertisers who fled after changes to its content moderation rules.<br/>That is despite an interview Mr Musk gave to the BBC in April, in which he suggested that most had returned to the site.<br/>However, Meghana Dhar, the former head of partnerships at Snap and Meta, which owns the new Twitter rival Threads, said the company had been struggling prior to Mr Musk's buyout. <br/>\"Elon and Twitter are in a candidly tough position right now,\" she told the BBC's Today programme. \"To be fair to Elon though, we've seen that decline in Twitter revenue and growth in revenue since pre-Elon - there's been kind of a steady decline.\" <br/>Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, said:  \"You wouldn't bet against him, he's a kind of mercurial figure and I think probably he will turn it around but it is just going to take longer.<br/>\"But unfortunately he has got $13bn of debt to pay by the end of July so we may see more pressure on the shares in Tesla if he has to sell more of his stake in that company.\"<br/>Mr Musk is also the chief executive and majority shareholder of electric car-maker Tesla, which will report its latest quarterly financial results on Wednesday.<br/>Linda Yaccarino, previously head of advertising at NBCUniversal, was taken on as chief executive of Twitter in June - a move suggesting advertising sales are still a priority for the company.<br/>Ms Yaccarino has said Twitter plans to focus on video, creator and commerce partnerships.

Someone who knows him put it to me more bluntly: \"He is obsessed with it.\"<br/>OpenAI, the firm behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, has announced that its first international office will be located in London, and data firm Palantir has also said it will open headquarters in the city.<br/>But the UK faces several challenges in positioning itself as a key player in this lucrative and fast-moving area of tech.<br/>This week BBC News is focusing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>Emma McClenaghan and her partner Matt run an AI start-up in Northern Ireland. They have built an AI tool called Wally which generates websites, and have ambitions to turn it into a more general digital assistant. <br/>The company has won awards but they still struggle to access the specialised chips - called GPUs (general processing units) - they need to develop their product further.<br/>\"I think there is a lack of hardware access for start-ups, and a lack of expertise and lack of funding,\" she said.<br/>She said they waited five months for a grant to buy a single GPU - at a time when in the US Elon Musk was reported to have purchased 10,000. <br/>\"That's the difference between us and them because it's going to take us, you know, four to seven days to train a model and if he's [able to] do it in minutes, then you know, we're never going to catch up\".<br/>In an email chat, Ms McClenaghan told me she thinks the best outcome for her firm, Gensys Engine, would be for it to get bought up by a US tech giant - something I hear a lot from UK start-ups.<br/>Re-nosing those ambitions to keep successful firms here in the UK and helping them to grow is another challenge.<br/>Trying to access GPUs might be less of an issue if they were available as part of a national infrastructure, like for example road networks or electricity cables, rather than being hoovered up by those companies which can afford them.<br/>Ian Hogarth thinks this could be the way forward.<br/>\"I think the we're going to enter a phase in which nation states start to see their role in directing critical AI infrastructure in a new way,\" he said.<br/>\"It is going to be a fundamental building block for the next generation of innovation.\" <br/>Despite the trials ahead, he is optimistic the UK can still take a seat at the centre of the AI revolution.<br/>\"I don't think we're too late,\" he says. <br/>\"I wouldn't have taken the job if I thought we couldn't do a lot.\"<br/>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might think<br/>How AI is helping doctors spot breast cancers<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

So how have they done it, and could it be possible to fly without causing climate change much sooner than people had thought?<br/>The Gloucestershire-based company are moving much faster because they are not designing an entirely new aircraft. <br/>ZeroAvia is working on the Dornier 228, a conventional 19-seater plane that has two propellers, usually powered by kerosene.<br/>One of these has been replaced by an electric engine, and the electricity is generated on-board using a hydrogen fuel cell. For the testing period, the other engine remains fuelled by kerosene, in case of failure. <br/>But once the technology is proved, both engines will run on electricity from the hydrogen fuel cell. <br/>Only the new engine needs to pass safety tests, and the company is working with the Civil Aviation Authority to achieve certification.<br/>Test pilot Jon Killerby flew the aircraft and told me that once airborne, they have managed without the kerosene engine.<br/>\"We can throttle right back on the conventional engine,\" he said, \"and fly purely on the hydrogen electric system, it generates enough thrust to fly the aircraft level. <br/>\"It really is amazing how well it works.\"<br/>Hydrogen fuel cells are not new, and have been widely used in cars and trucks. <br/>They use a chemical process called \"reverse hydrolysis\" which combines hydrogen with oxygen and creates heat, water vapour and, crucially, electricity.<br/>So the on-board engine creates no greenhouse gases.<br/>But what matters is where you get your hydrogen.<br/>At Bath University, Prof Tim Mays has been studying hydrogen for thirty years. He runs the UK Hydrogen Research Hub which has just been awarded \u00a311m to explore how hydrogen can help combat climate change.<br/>He explained: \"At the moment people make it by treating natural gas with steam, which is about as unsustainable as it gets.\"<br/>But it is also possible to use electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, using renewable electricity.<br/>\"That makes green hydrogen, which is what the aviation industry needs,\" said Prof Mays.<br/>\"It's a really serious option, because we do need to replace kerosene.\"<br/>It is not a big plane.<br/>The Dornier 228 will carry about 12 passengers with the hydrogen engine on board.<br/>It can fly about 250-310 miles (400-500km), according to Chief Commercial Officer Sergey Kiselev.<br/>That would get you from Bristol Airport to Newcastle, or London to Paris.<br/>By 2027, the company plans a larger hydrogen-electric engine which would power bigger aircraft. This could carry around 50 passengers and go nearer to 620 miles (1,000 km).<br/>\"Like all technologies, there are challenges,\" smiles Prof Mays.<br/>\"Making it, transporting it, and storing it.\"<br/>The aviation industry needs to build an entirely new infrastructure. Hydrogen production centres, a network to get the fuel to airports, storage at airports, the lot. And hydrogen is very different from conventional kerosene.<br/>Hydrogen takes up a lot of space. To carry it all manageably, the gas is compressed to 350 or 700 times atmospheric pressure.<br/>Even then, it takes up more space than kerosene. If you want to transport it as a liquid, you must first chill it to 253 degrees below zero. <br/>So exactly where to make it, how to move it around and store it are all being examined now by airports and aerospace firms.<br/>Prof Mays put it like this: \"You can fly using hydrogen as a fuel, but it is not optimised, not super efficient yet, and the infrastructure is not there yet.\"<br/>The hangar in the Cotswold Airport is small, and far from the big research labs of Airbus, Rolls Royce and Boeing.<br/>But ZeroAvia already has orders for more than 1,500 of its first engine.<br/>Air Cahana is one, a new Californian airline with \"a mission to decarbonise aviation\".<br/>Another early customer is closer to home, the environmental entrepreneur Dale Vince, who founded renewable energy firm Ecotricity.<br/>Mr Vince is launching an airline called \"Ecojet\", which will use the ZeroAvia engines on passenger flights, at first from Edinburgh to Southampton.<br/>He said: \"The question of how to create sustainable air travel has plagued the green movement for decades. <br/>\"The desire to travel is deeply etched into the human spirit, and flights free of C02 emissions, powered by renewable energy will allow us to explore our incredible world without harming it for the first time.\"<br/>Bigger aerospace firms are watching the small start-up with interest. Airbus has a huge research programme called ZeroE, which also uses hydrogen. The company is exploring both hydrogen fuel cells to create electricity to power propellers, and using liquid hydrogen directly for combustion. <br/>But Airbus is aiming to have hydrogen-powered planes in the sky by 2035, a full decade later than the small ZeroAvia engines.<br/>Sergey Kiselev told me that's why they decided not to create a completely new aircraft, but instead just change the engine on an existing plane.<br/>He said: \"It helps us eliminate all the complexity with the certification of the aircraft, we can focus only on the engine. So we can get the aircraft up into the air in commercial operations, much faster.\"<br/>The company has made its pledge. It now has at least two big challenges. <br/>One is to make its engine safe, certified, and ready to use by 2025.<br/>They are well on their way to that one.<br/>The other, harder, challenge, will be making sure there is some fresh new hydrogen waiting for the aircraft when it lands at the other end.<br/>Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The Asia Pacific is going to be responsible for at least 50% of global growth that we're expecting between now and 2035.\"<br/>The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.<br/>As it announced the signing of the deal, the government said CPTPP-owned businesses employed about 400,000 people across the UK.<br/>It also said that CPTPP companies \"punch above their weight economically\", as while they account for 0.3% of all businesses in the UK, they generate 6.1% of total turnover.<br/>Business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the deal was \"good news for UK businesses to enter or upscale their trade in these markets\".<br/>\"We see particular relevance for small- and medium-sized businesses in reduced costs to import components from member countries to use in manufactured goods for export,\" said William Bain, the BCC's head of trade policy.<br/>However, there have been some doubts expressed. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC trade union body, said the pact was \"bad for workers at home and abroad\".<br/>\"Once again, Conservative ministers have turned a blind eye to egregious human and workers' rights abuses in their pursuit of trade deals,\" he said.<br/>Concern has also been expressed over how the UK intends to make sure that environmental and animal welfare standards are met.<br/>The chair of the John Lewis Partnership, Dame Sharon White, told the Laura Kuenssberg programme that she would like to hear more on the impact on British farmers.<br/>She said she would want to be sure that \"we're not undercutting British farmers, we are not undercutting great animal welfare standards in this country that we've had for many, many years\".<br/>\"I think that matters to many people.\"<br/>Overall, she said that while signing the CPTPP was \"obviously a positive\u2026 I don't think it's going to be a gangbusters substantive shift\".<br/>Questioned on why the UK has not yet signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, Ms Badenoch said that was due to the change in government.<br/>\"Yes, it was expected that we would sign an FTA with the US, but that was with a different president.  You cannot force a country to do something if its administration changes.\"<br/>On the issue of whether China should be allowed to join the CPTPP, Ms Badenoch said that was \"one of the things that we have been discussing\".<br/>However, when pressed on whether the UK should veto China's membership, as some have suggested, she said: \"When you join a club, the very first thing you don't do is tell the other club members who should be or shouldn't be allowed to join.\"<br/>UK agrees to join Asia's trade club - but what is it?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

That raised house prices sharply. <br/>In turn, that means millions of homeowners have more equity in the property. In other words, the difference between the value of the home and the mortgage is greater. When homeowners come to get a new deal, that could mean the home loan is not as expensive as it might otherwise have been.<br/>The second trend was high levels of savings, as spending options such as overseas travel were diminished. Some of that money is now being used to pay down mortgages.<br/>When lenders received a mortgage application they would \"stress test\" the finances of the applicant to see if they were able to afford interest rates at a higher level before approving it.<br/>Although the rules have now changed, it does mean that - now rates are higher - some people have not been saddled with unmanageable outstanding loans.<br/>Critics said that stress testing, which began in 2014, meant some applicants were turned down by lenders, even though they could have paid the interest rate at the time.<br/>Now, lenders are testing applicants to see whether they can cope with interest rates of 8% or 9% - although each lender's exact requirements are commercially sensitive.  <br/>Read more here<br/>Faced with a rising interest rate and more expensive repayments, existing borrowers are considering their options to mitigate the higher bills.<br/>That could include extending the term of their mortgage - although that does mean that ultimately they will pay more over a longer period of time. However, lenders are encouraging borrowers to discuss what can be done with them or a broker, rather than burying their heads in the sand.<br/>First-time buyers too are open to changing their plans. At the Treasury Committee hearing in the Commons earlier in the week, Andrew Asaam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group - the UK's largest mortgage lender, said: \"People are either putting down a larger deposit or buying a smaller property because affordability is tighter.<br/>\"We won't lend as much now, so people are moderating what they can afford to buy.\"<br/>Companies' borrowing costs, just like those of consumers, have been rising. However, so far, there have been no signs of big staff cuts.<br/>The jobs market remains resilient. So, when someone has a secure job and a regular income, they might still be able to afford higher mortgage bills - even if it means some pain and a change of priorities.<br/>Lenders say the most common reasons for people falling behind or having a home repossessed are generally life-changing events such as a job loss, or serious illness.<br/>The interest rates being demanded for buy-to-let mortgages are higher than those for homeowners. Often, landlords are on interest-only deals, leaving them even more vulnerable to rate rises.<br/>However, MPs heard that, of about 5.5 million properties in the private rental sector, only about two million are mortgaged.<br/>That means some landlords may be immune to rate rises. <br/>Tenants might feel the benefit of landlords not needing to pass on higher mortgage rates in higher rent. However, landlords' other costs are rising, as is the market rate for rent, so that quickly becomes a more complex picture.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.<br/>The short-term gains are marginal.<br/>The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.<br/>Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.<br/>It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.<br/>Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate.<br/>However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.  <br/>Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income.<br/>In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.<br/>The key perk is greater access to each other's markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.<br/>But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.<br/>Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.<br/>That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.<br/>The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.<br/>Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.<br/>In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.<br/>In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.<br/>However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.<br/>So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.<br/>And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be consistent with re-joining the EU itself.<br/>In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?<br/>Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.<br/>The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.<br/>As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.<br/>And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.<br/>Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government. <br/>The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year. <br/>It is the partnership's potential that is key.<br/>The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.<br/>But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.<br/>China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.<br/>Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?<br/>The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.<br/>America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.<br/>At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.<br/>But ultimately it could yield considerable rewards.<br/>MPs back Sunak's new Brexit Northern Ireland deal<br/>More immigration not a Brexit betrayal, says Hunt<br/>How far is Brexit to blame for the tomato shortage?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It says nearly 300m e-cigarettes (disposable and otherwise) were sold in the UK over the last year. <br/>Elfbar and Lost Mary, which are made by the same Chinese firm, Shenzhen Imiracle Technology Co, made up more than half that number. That is an increase of more than four times compared to their sales the year before. <br/>Councillor David Fothergill, chairman of the LGA\u2019s Community Wellbeing Board, said: \u201cDisposable vapes are fundamentally flawed in their design and inherently unsustainable products, meaning an outright ban will prove more effective than attempts to recycle more vapes.\u201d<br/>Councils are not against vaping altogether as they believe vapes are less harmful than tobacco and can help smokers to quit.<br/>John Dunne, director general of the UK Vaping Industry Association, said that the \u201clow price, accessibility and ease of use\u201d of disposable products had helped bring UK smoking rates to an \"all-time low\u201d.<br/>\u201cThe vape industry is working hard to minimise its environmental impact, but this is mainly a consumer education issue about how to dispose of used vapes, which overall are evidenced to be highly recyclable,\" he said.<br/>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Disposables have been around for well over a decade and provide a low priced accessible product that helps smokers to quit smoking tobacco.\".<br/>A blanket ban could see \u201cpotentially deadly\u201d black market products flood the UK, Mr Dunne warned.<br/>Selling vapes and e-cigarettes to under 18s is illegal in the UK.<br/>Lancashire County Council director of public health Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said vaping had originally been seen as a way to curtail the harm caused by tobacco, but said there was a marketing problem.<br/>He told BBC Breakfast the advertising was \"unvetted and unscrupulous\".<br/>Councils are also worried that disposable varieties with \u201cfruity and bubble gum flavours, and colourful child-friendly packaging\u201d could appeal to under-age vapers, and called for restrictions on their display and marketing, similar to those used for conventional tobacco.<br/>The anti-smoking charity ASH said it did not support a ban, as it would \"turbo-charge\" illegal sales, increasing the risk that children would be able to buy them. It favours higher taxes on disposables and stronger controls on import and sales, deputy chief executive Hazel Cheeseman said.<br/>A spokeswoman for Elfbar said the firm is working on developing a \"comprehensive programme\" to safeguard and protect children.<br/>\"Simply calling for a ban on single use vapes will do nothing to tackle these issues,\" she said.<br/>\"The illicit market will simply fill the void with products that are unlicensed and unregulated containing substances that potentially pose a health risk.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said it was also concerned about the use of vaping products, particularly among young people. Earlier this year it launched a consultation looking into the environmental and health impacts of vaping, and is considering responses.<br/>\u201cWe strongly encourage all consumers to consider the environment and dispose of electrical waste, including by making use of take-back schemes at participating retailers,\u201d the spokesperson said.<br/>In Scotland, Lorna Slater, Minister for Circular Economy, said in June that single use vapes had become a \"big problem - for our environment, local communities and young people,\u201d and promised to announce new plans in the autumn. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Millions of vapes littered in Scotland, says report<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>New measures to crack down on illegal teen vaping<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

For households who pay their bills by direct debit, the support was given automatically through monthly payments from October to March.<br/>But people who live off-grid, on narrow boats, travellers, people in park homes and some tenants and people on heat networks, did not automatically receive the support, because they did not have an energy provider. <br/>The government set up the Alternative Funding scheme for the over 900,000 households in those categories. It also applied to people living in care homes, who are charged for energy costs in their bills.<br/>But only 141,000 bill-payers managed to apply for and receive the subsidy before the scheme closed on 31 May. <br/>There remain 750,000 eligible households who have missed out on the \u00a3400 support payment.<br/>PHD student Sheree Smith said she spent more time at university than at her flat so she didn't have to pay higher energy bills.<br/>She told BBC Breakfast: \"I was really hoping that \u00a3400 would have helped me to weather the storm so I could stay in my flat, but ultimately it didn't come in time. <br/>\"I ended up having to return to my parents.\"<br/>Mr MacNeil, a former SNP member, who now sits as an independent and chairs Parliament's energy security and net zero committee, said the scheme should be improved and extended so that people could claim the subsidy they were entitled to.<br/>\"A lot of these will be vulnerable people who are particularly suffering the bite of the energy price spike and government should be moving heaven and earth almost, to make sure these people are getting the money,\" Mr MacNeil said in an interview with the BBC's Money Box programme.<br/>In his role as chair of the parliamentary committee, Mr MacNeil is due to question Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Grant Shapps in September. Mr MacNeil said he would ask him to relaunch the scheme and make it easier to use, since \"clearly delivery has failed\".<br/>Some applicants criticised the scheme for being too complex or not recognising their circumstances. Others said their applications were repeatedly rejected, despite being eligible.<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter, covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill.<br/>\"We're now seeing costs fall even further with wholesale energy prices down by over two thirds since their peak.\"<br/>You can hear more on this story on the Money Box podcast after broadcast.<br/>Follow Money Box or Dan on Twitter.<br/>More than 700,000 miss out on energy bill support<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But many airports and airlines that had made cuts during the pandemic struggled to recruit staff quickly enough.<br/>They insist they've pulled out all the stops to make their operations more resilient this year.<br/>For example, EasyJet told the BBC in March it started recruiting far earlier than usual and was already fully staffed for summer.<br/>However, there are different headaches this year, which could mean further disruption, although not necessarily on the scale of last year's problems.<br/>Strike action, notably by French air traffic controllers, has been causing cancellations and delays for months. <br/>Flights over France to destinations such as Spain and Portugal have also been affected, which Ryanair's boss has repeatedly complained about.<br/>The Unite union says ground handlers contracted by airlines at Gatwick Airport will take eight days of strike action in late July and early August. Gatwick is Europe's busiest single-runway airport.<br/>This could mean disruption, although the airport says it will work with airlines to ensure as many flights as possible operate as scheduled.<br/>Meanwhile, at Birmingham Airport, around 100 security officers and terminal technicians will begin continuous strike action from 18 July.<br/>But proposed summer strike action by security workers at Heathrow was called off after the Unite union accepted an improved pay offer.<br/>The threat of strikes by European air traffic managers at Eurocontrol remains, but no dates have been set. The union involved told the BBC it hopes to reach an agreement with the employer.<br/>Industrial action isn't the only issue. <br/>The air traffic control environment is \"challenging\", according to Willie Walsh, who heads up global airline body Iata.<br/>EasyJet has already axed 1,700 summer flights at Gatwick to reduce the chance of last-minute cancellations, blaming what it called \"unprecedented\" air traffic limitations.<br/>Europe's air space remains constrained and clogged up due to the Ukraine war.<br/>\"In the event of French strikes some flights may be rerouted through other, already congested, air space which itself creates additional pressure,\" says aviation expert John Strickland.<br/>\"Manpower shortages in parts of Europe such as Greece and Denmark [are] causing capacity bottlenecks, which create further delays. <br/>\"Indeed one European airline CEO told me that the whole of European air traffic control except the UK was 'a mess'.\"<br/>Mr Strickland thinks events like summer storms could add pressure to an already stretched system, leading to delays and cancellations.<br/>On the railway, the plans of thousands of people going on day trips or holidays could be affected.<br/>Another period of disruption will begin on Monday as train drivers in the Aslef union will refuse to work overtime at 15 train companies between 17 and 22 July. <br/>This isn't a full strike but could cause some reduced timetables and last-minute cancellations.<br/>It's worth checking before you set off. <br/>Then, rail workers in the RMT union at 14 train companies with government contracts are due to walk out on 20, 22 and 29 July. <br/>Their dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions has been going on for more than a year now.<br/>The operators are all based in England but some run services into Wales and Scotland.<br/>The level of disruption during these strikes will vary around the country. Many will run reduced services. <br/>Strike day timetables will be published a week before each date.  <br/>These RMT strikes are happening after the union rejected the latest proposals from the industry, which is backed by the government.<br/>The train companies are under pressure from the government to cut costs. With the national dispute at a standstill, they have since announced controversial plans to close most station ticket offices in England.  <br/>Passengers are being asked to provide their views until 26 July, in a consultation run by watchdogs Transport Focus and London Travelwatch.<br/>In London, the Underground will be affected by significant disruption between 23 and 28 July, with the RMT, Aslef and Unite scheduling strike action that week.<br/>Traffic is expected to increase as we head into the summer holiday season, and roads could be busier than usual as train strikes push people into cars instead. <br/>\"It's likely that people will consider altering their journey plans and they may well travel by car instead so it's important they check their vehicle is roadworthy before setting off,\" says Frank Bird, senior network planner at National Highways.<br/>\"We'd also remind motorists to check the weather forecast... and to take plenty of drinking water with them as well as food that won't be affected by the heat in case of delays.\"<br/>Dover is Europe's busiest ferry port, and summer is its peak time as passengers head across the Channel.<br/>It will be under the spotlight again after many passengers experienced long queues last July and during this year's Easter holidays.<br/>In late May, port boss Doug Bannister told the BBC everything possible had been done to prevent the same level of delays.<br/>However, he said \"it would be foolish\" to guarantee there would never be queues.<br/>Mr Bannister added that additional passport checks introduced after Brexit were a factor.<br/>The port's location between cliffs and the sea means space is limited. <br/>It says measures in place ahead of the summer holidays include working with coach and ferry operators to spread out travel at peak times, extra space to process coach passengers, and putting in more border control posts. <br/>Local authorities and emergency services have traffic management plans for busy times, including queuing up lorries on the M20 motorway.<br/>This system was reinstated on Thursday, ahead of the busy July and August period.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Strike action could hit holiday flights in Europe<br/>Easyjet cancels 1,700 flights from July to September<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Workers are mainly demanding pay rises that stay aligned with the rising cost of living.<br/>The exact timing of each strike will vary depending on the individual company's shift patterns, but all strikes will begin in the early hours of the morning on the 28 July and 4 August, and end in the early hours of the morning on 1 and 8 August.<br/>On the days of the Gatwick strikes, a total of 4,410 flights - covering more than 880,000 seats - are scheduled to depart the airport, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Easyjet cancels 1,700 flights from July to September<br/>Strike action could hit holiday flights in Europe<br/>Heathrow security staff call off strikes<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The survey was conducted before the latest increases in mortgage rates, now at a 15-year high, which is likely to affect both homeowners and landlords.<br/>The ONS survey suggested that nearly six in 10 renters (58%) said they were spending less on food shopping and essentials, compared with 48% of mortgage holders. They were also more likely to have run out of food in the previous two weeks - with 14% of renters compared with 3% of mortgage holders in that situation.<br/>Renters, some of whom will want to buy a home, were less likely to say they could save money in the current climate.<br/>Helen Morrissey, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The cost of living crisis continues to squeeze the life out of our finances with renters particularly vulnerable to rising costs.\"<br/>Read more tips here<br/>The ONS said that renters were more likely to face financial vulnerability, compared with those who owned their home.

Nigeria has 780 local councils but most of them are hardly functional. <br/>The vacuum is filled by men like Mr Nwokuha - or just about anyone who can set up a roadblock and enforce their authority.<br/>These tend to consist of a wooden bar between two rusty barrels, and home-made spikes for drivers who want to be smart by trying to avoid them.<br/>They are most common in the richer southern parts of Nigeria, including highways where tax collection is done on behalf of some state governments. <br/>One lorry driver tells the BBC he pays as much as 80,000 naira (\u00a380; $100) as he travels through scores of roadblocks on his way from Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, to Imo in the east: a distance of 540km (335 miles).<br/>\"Between Edo and Port Harcourt [alone] there are 15 such roadblocks,\" he adds.<br/>Expressing a similar view, a cold-chain logistics operator says: \"There are numerous haulage taxes, there is one called revenue, there is a radio tax, there is a tax for loading, another for parking, one for unloading.\" <br/>And that is not including the bribes he often has to pay police officers as he drives around the country.<br/>Clement Akanibo, of Nigeria's Chartered Institute of Taxation, describes it as \"akin to collecting tax at gunpoint\". <br/>\"It makes it difficult to do business and increases the final cost by as much as 15%,\" he says.<br/>It is unclear how Mr Tinubu plans to end this, but he will need the support of state and local governments as these taxes fall under their jurisdiction - not that of the federal government.<br/>At its heart lies a powerful system of patronage that sees a portion of the money going into the pockets of politicians, powerful families, and the army of unemployed men like Mr Nwokuha.<br/>Mr Tinubu's government says it wants to overhaul the entire tax system to boost its revenue so it can increase the amount it spends on services like health and education, as well as pay off its ballooning debts.<br/>It has set itself the target of increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio to 18% within the next three years.<br/>Official Nigerian data shows the ratio was around 11% in 2021, lower than what the World Bank reported for Kenya (13%) and South Africa (26%).<br/>For now, Mr Tinubu's government is focusing on the taxes it is responsible for - including Value-Added Tax (VAT).<br/>The federal government does not use so-called tax collectors, expecting businesses to make direct payments. <br/>In what appears to be an attempt to end tax evasion, it wants to digitise VAT payments, starting with the 40 million-strong association of market traders.<br/>This won't be easy as most of them do not keep financial records and have never paid VAT, so might resist the move amid the current economic hardship.<br/>But if the plan works, Mr Tinubu's government could then hope to persuade state and local governments to drop their archaic system - something that many Nigerians would welcome as it would free them from the clutches of menacing tax collectors like Mr Nwokuha. <br/>The five tests awaiting Nigeria's new president<br/>Focus on Africa podcasts<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Kreiz began working on it when he became CEO of Mattel in 2018 and he remains executive producer. <br/>Barbie and Ken are played by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, with Greta Gerwig directing.<br/>Kreiz acknowledges there is some risk in giving Barbie the Hollywood treatment, working with directors and writers who have their own creative ideas.<br/>There is \"humour and self-deprecation\" in the film, he says (not least on his part, as he is played by Will Ferrell, a controlling and slightly stuffy CEO).<br/>It's clear even from the trailer that Barbie is the butt of jokes. <br/>If you're being generous, she is portrayed as na\u00efve and innocent. If you aren't, she's shallow and superficial, obsessed with appearance and unable to comprehend the meaning of sex, death - or life without high heels.<br/>Barbie's \"Dreamland\" is a pink utopia, divorced from reality.<br/>\"This movie has been 64 years in the making (Barbie launched in 1959),\" says Kreiz, \"but it represents how the culture sees Barbie today.\"<br/>Barbie remains Mattel's biggest-selling brand, making the company more than \u00a31bn ($1.5bn) annually. Its other brands include Hot Wheels, Masters of the Universe, Monster High, Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine.<br/>Kreiz argues Mattel's other brands also have the potential to be turned into successful spin-offs.<br/>\"The devil works hard but Barbie's marketing team is working harder,\" according to marketing expert Mike Buonaiuto, author of Founder Therapy, who admires the inventive advertising the team behind the film has been up to, including the Airbnb listing of a Barbie Dreamhouse. <br/>\"But let's be honest,\" Buonaiuto points out, \"the opportunity for the Mattel universe is vastly different to Marvel's, and whilst Barbie is being powered by millennial nostalgia collaborations, try and do the same for Thomas the Tank Engine or Hot Wheels and you probably won't get the same result. <br/>\"The depth of world-building Mattel can pull from isn't competition for Marvel's.\"<br/>But the recent collapse of Toys R Us shows why toymakers like Mattel need to diversify beyond the sale of physical products, adds Buonaiuto.<br/>Barbie was first introduced in America in 1959, developed by Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel. <br/>Before Barbie, dolls typically took the form of babies, so children could play at being a nurturing parent. However, Barbies encouraged children to play at being adolescents, imagining their future selves through the dolls.<br/>As the original TV adverts that ran during Mickey Mouse Club told children: \"Someday I'm going to be exactly like you.\"<br/>This proved alluring and good business. More than a billion Barbie dolls had been sold by the early 1990s.<br/>But there have also been questions about what exactly Barbie dolls teach children, especially around body image. <br/>The original Barbie design was extremely skinny and the messaging reinforced unhealthy ideas. One infamous slumber party set created in the mid-1960s featured bathroom scales fixed at 110 pounds (50kg) and a dieting book that advised: \"Don't eat\".<br/>Another talking Barbie created in the early 1990s had the doll saying, \"Math class is tough.\" Mattel later apologised.  <br/>These issues continued to affect people's perception of the brand and arguably lay behind a dip in popularity around a decade ago.<br/>Mattel has learned lessons and is now keeping up with the times, says Kreiz.<br/>\"Barbie is a flag carrier for diversity and inclusivity,\" he says, \"with more than 170 different Barbie types in terms of body shape and skin colour, and Barbie has more than 200 careers, so girls can explore their potential in different ways.\"<br/>Barbie has recently brought out dolls with disabilities, prosthetic limbs, and one with Down's Syndrome. <br/>The \"classic, traditional Barbie\" is less than half of the business now, says Kreiz.<br/>That new commitment to diversity is reflected in the cast of the film, while the classic Barbie, who is the central character, is gently mocked.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Kreiz also points out that Mattel is restructuring the company to move with the times.<br/>Now it simply divides its products into categories (like dolls, vehicles and pre-school), rather than having teams devoted to separate boys' and girls' products. This is despite the fact that many shops still divide toys by gender, with pink aisles for girls who want to be princesses, and blue ones for boys who like dinosaurs and construction sets.<br/>The Barbie film is part of Kreiz's masterplan to position Mattel as a \"talent magnet\", working with people like film directors to try different things with its well-known creations.<br/>\"People who buy our products aren't just consumers,\" says Kreiz. \"They are fans, who have an emotional relationship to the products. Kids touch, hug and go to bed with our toys.<br/>\"We believe in the long-term opportunity for Barbie. But we need to evolve her, keep her relevant and in the centre of cultural conversation.\"<br/>Feeling the 'Kenergy' on Barbie movie pink carpet<br/>Everything you need to know about the Barbie movie<br/>Is Barbie's makeover working?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It cited the unavailability of quality tomatoes \"due to seasonal crop issues\" as the reason.<br/>The skyrocketing prices have been particularly hard on India's middle and lower classes, who make up the bulk of the population.<br/>In the western city of Pune, a vegetable seller allegedly smacked a customer in the face with a weighing scale for bickering over the price of 250g of tomatoes. <br/>In Varanasi - the holiest city for India's Hindu majority - a politician reportedly hired two bouncers to prevent people from haggling over tomato prices at his shop.<br/>There have been reports of people stealing tomatoes from fields and hijacking tomato-laden trucks.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The government has said that the soaring prices are a \"temporary problem\" and that they will drop in the coming months.<br/>Some states have started selling tomatoes at reduced prices at government-run or farmer-backed outlets to help consumers. On 30 June, the Indian government launched a Tomato Grand Challenge Hackathon in Delhi to encourage the public to share ideas to combat the escalating prices.<br/>The tomato holds a surprising amount of sway over Indian cooking - it's added to almost every dish. So when it becomes scarce and expensive, it becomes the subject of headlines and even political rows.<br/>Economists say the steep price rise could disrupt India's delicate inflation balance, pushing retail inflation towards 5.5% in July-September from 4-5% in April and May.<br/>Ironically, close to two months ago, farmers in India dumped crates of tomatoes on the road after prices crashed to 2-3 rupees a kilo in the wholesale market as supply exceeded demand. <br/>Farmers resorted to the same measure last year to draw attention to their plight and, in March, farmers in Maharashtra state took out a protest march to demand higher prices for onions.<br/>India often faces supply-demand challenges when it comes to perishable, but essential, vegetables like the onion and tomato. Both crops are grown almost around the year and produce from different states hits the market during different months.<br/>This year, a bumper crop of tomato was followed by a poor harvest season.<br/>\"The current bout of tomato prices is actually a result of unseasonal rains during March-April-May in tomato-growing areas, particularly Kolar belt [in southern Karnataka state], which has the largest tomato market of the country,\" says, Ashok Gulati, farm economist.<br/>\"From mid-June, the supplies have shrunk, while demand pressures have mounted, leading to spikes in fresh tomato prices,\" he adds.<br/>Mr Gulati says the excessive rains in north-western India are likely to put further pressures on supply. <br/>\"Significant areas are also reeling under floods, especially Himachal and Uttarakhand states. Supply lines during heavy rains often get displaced,\" he says.<br/>Anil Malhotra, an Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) member, told PTI news agency that though tomato prices escalate every monsoon, he had never seen them this high.<br/>\"There is a major dip in supply due to rains. Around half our stock, which we get from Himachal Pradesh, got damaged,\" he said.<br/>Arvind Malik, a tomato farmer from Haryana state, told the Guardian newspaper that while he usually sold 30,000kg of tomatoes every year, this year he could only harvest half of that as his crops had been destroyed by pests. <br/>\"Experts told us that irregular weather - sudden rise and decline in temperatures - is the reason behind the diseases in our tomatoes,\" he said.<br/>So how does India overcome this supply-demand gap? A straightforward solution would be to just store excess produce for the proverbial - and in this case, literal - rainy day. <br/>But experts say that this is easier said than done because tomatoes are highly perishable and tend to go bad after a few weeks even in cold storage. <br/>Mr Gulati says that one way to stabilise supply is to incentivise protected cultivation of tomatoes to save the crop from extreme heat or unseasonal heavy showers.<br/>Another step is to process tomatoes into puree, which can help consumers shift to processed tomatoes when prices of fresh tomatoes are running high. \"But to promote processing of tomatoes, the government has to incentivise the processing and lower GST [general sales tax] on tomato puree from 12% - 5%,\" says Mr Gulati.<br/>\"Overall, a value chain approach has to be adopted to de-risk the vegetable from production to consumption, but the framework is absent right now.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

The amount of money is expected to be more than $100m (\u00a378m) every 12 months.<br/>Meanwhile, the other 2% of the retailer's shares were transferred to a new trust, called the Patagonia Purpose Trust, which now runs the company, and - as the firm says - guides its environmental and philanthropic principals.<br/>Yvon Chouinard, who led Patagonia for 50 years, is now 84 years old. He and his family decided on the new business structure and cash giveaway as he stepped back from being in the company's driving seat.<br/>\"We looked at different approaches,\" says Patagonia's chair Charles Conn. He adds that one option could have been floating the firm on a stock exchange and  \"then give the money away\", but that may have resulted in the company subsequently not being run in such an environmentally-focused way.<br/>\"So we kept coming back to giving shares to environmental foundations, and using it to fight the environmental crisis,\" says Mr Conn. \"It's a radical thing to do, but we're dependent on Mother Earth.<br/>\"The family walked away from billions, but Yvon is the real deal. He doesn't have a mobile phone, they drive old cars.\"<br/>You might think that Patagonia is an unusual one-off, but a small number of other firms are making similar arrangements to add nature and the environment - at least figuratively  - to either their ownership or board rooms.<br/>UK beauty products company Faith in Nature now has two directors who are there \"to give nature a voice and a vote on how Faith In Nature is run\". These two external board members come from two environmental organisations - Earth Law Centre and Lawyers for Nature.<br/>\"It's about how to make business better, so less damage is done,\" says Anne Hopkins, creative director at Faith in Nature.<br/>\"We are a company with our hearts in the right place... we didn't want this to just be marketing. We wanted to create a formal and legal structure with a practical framework.\"<br/>Fellow creative director Simeon Rose adds that the two environmental directors come to an agreement \"and give nature's view\". He adds: \"The biggest difference is now it enables other board members to see what decisions nature makes, and it helps them make further conscious decisions\".<br/>Faith in Nature, which was founded back in 1974, has now created an online guide for any companies that would like to follow its example.<br/>In the Netherlands, Dutch vegan cheese-substitute company Willicroft appointed \"Mother Nature\" as its chief executive in 2020, replacing co-founder Brad Vanstone, who became head of impact.<br/>But what does that actually mean?<br/>\"It means that every single decision we make every day is geared towards the planet. For example, I now take the train when I travel to the UK, whereas before I wouldn't think about it, and I would fly,\" says Mr Vanstone.<br/>Since the new boss was appointed, other environmental decisions made by Willicroft include only accepting investors who are committed to ditching any fossil fuel investments within five years.<br/>In addition, the firm switched from making its cheese substitutes out of cashew nuts to using beans and pulses instead.

Lastly, they must establish values, principles, operations and practices that are reflective of natural law.\"<br/>Still, for companies wishing to add an environmental representative to their ownership or board, Tad Ostrowski, founder and managing director of UK law firm Artington Legal, says they should carry out due diligence first.<br/>\"Care would need to be taken to ensure that the finances of the company and the relationships with the other shareholders were clear, transparent and aligned with the company and its relevant stakeholders,\" he says.<br/>\"But done properly, there is no reason why the company's long-term success for the benefit of its members as a whole cannot be linked to positive decision making for the long-term benefit of nature.\"<br/>Back at clothing firm Patagonia, Mr Conn says it was vital to put Planet Earth in charge of the business. \"Many species are in decline, and climate change is impacting us all.

However, the name of the service conjures up a rather different meaning to viewers who caught a seminal BBC drama aired almost 40 years ago.<br/>As families settled down in front of the TV on a Sunday evening in September 1984, little did they suspect the impact of the horror to come.<br/>At 9:30 the BBC aired the 112-minute film Threads.<br/>With only four channels to choose from, the harrowing post-apocalyptic Cold War drama found its way into millions of homes - and led to sleepless nights for many who saw the Sheffield-based dystopian drama unfold.<br/>Written by Kes author Barry Hines, the film showed the unrelenting impact of a thermonuclear blast on ordinary Britons - in graphic detail.<br/>Produced on a low budget and directed by documentary maker Mick Jackson, who would later go on to helm Hollywood blockbuster The Bodyguard, it managed to horrify people at a time when nuclear war seemed a very real possibility.<br/>From a kitchen sink drama focused around a young couple in a South Yorkshire, then riven by the Miners' Strike, Threads shows society breaking down as nuclear winter sets in.<br/>\"It never loses its power, ever. I have never seen anything so horrible and bleak in my life,\" said Stephen Brotherstone.<br/>He and David Lawrence are the authors of Scarred for Life - a series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.<br/>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it \"wrecked\" his head.<br/>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.<br/>\"I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much.\"<br/>Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had \"looked really special\" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.<br/>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama's impact.<br/>\"We said 'wow if we can pull this off it'll be great,' but I didn't have a clue that it held that much of a punch.\"<br/>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.<br/>\"There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room,\" the actor recalled.<br/>\"People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. <br/>\"People say it is the most scary thing they've ever seen in their life and remains so to this day.\"<br/>Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR.<br/>Lawrence and Brotherstone are currently working on a third volume of their series, which looks at the Cold War and includes a chapter on Threads.<br/>\"I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,\" said Lawrence.<br/>\"You've got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you've got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there's every nightmare you've ever had on screen.\"<br/>Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990.<br/>\"It wasn't a question of if they pressed the button, but when are they going to press the button,\" he said.<br/>Jimmy, played by Dinsdale, and Ruth, played by Karen Meagher, have just learnt that Ruth is expecting a baby as the film opens.<br/>The growing tensions between East and West appear on TV and newspapers as Sheffield's residents go about their daily lives, ignoring the looming threat.<br/>\"There's the build-up to war, but you don't see it you, just hear about it in the background as they are discussing what to have for tea,\" Lawrence said.<br/>\"They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think.\"<br/>For Dinsdale, it was a \"fantastic\" piece of writing by Hines.<br/>\"They are everyman and everywoman, they are just normal people with normal lives, there's nothing special about them and this very special event happens to them and it just draws you in.\"<br/>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.<br/>\"Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up,\" he said.<br/>\"It is very 70s, 80s Play for Today, but I think it works in its favour because it was so British.<br/>\"That was a house that looked like mine, there's Woolworths getting vaporised, it really struck home.\"<br/>The final parts of the film follow the characters as they struggle through the nuclear winter in the aftermath of the blasts.<br/>\"It is watching everyone die and it is watching society collapse forever. <br/>\"It makes the point we are never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other,\" Brotherstone said.<br/>For the actors and crew it was \"a ball\" to make, according to Dinsdale.<br/>\"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever.\"<br/>To him though, Threads remains a \"seminal\" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.<br/>\"It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created,\" he said.<br/>\"It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.<br/>\"I am very proud of it.\"<br/>Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Travellers pay higher ticket prices and more tax. <br/>It is often cheaper to fly to another continent than to another African country.  <br/>For a quick comparison, flying from the German capital, Berlin, to Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, will probably set you back around $150 (\u00a3120) for a direct flight taking less than three hours. <br/>But flying a similar distance, say between Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, you will be paying anything between $500 and $850, with at least one change, taking up to 20 hours. <br/>This makes doing business within Africa incredibly difficult, and expensive - and it is not just elite travellers that are affected.  <br/>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the global trade body representing some 300 airlines which make up about 83% of world air traffic - argues that if just 12 key countries in Africa worked together to improve connectivity and opened up their markets, it would create 155,000 jobs and boost those countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $1.3bn. <br/>\"Aviation contributes directly to the GDP in every country. It generates work and it activates the economy,\" says Kamil al-Awadhi, IATA's regional vice-president for Africa and the Middle East.<br/>Adefolake Adeyeye, an assistant professor of commercial law at the UK's Durham University, agrees that Africa as a whole is missing out because of its poor air service.   <br/>\"It's been shown that air transport does boost the economy. As we've seen in other continents, budget airlines can improve connectivity and cost, which boosts tourism, which then creates many more jobs,\" she says.  <br/>The poor quality of road networks and lack of railways in many African countries often makes air transport the practical choice for cargo too.  <br/>The climate emergency, which has severely impacted Africa, means everyone needs to be more careful about their carbon footprint and should aim to fly a lot less. <br/>But even though around 18% of the world's population lives in Africa, it accounts for less than 2% of global air travel and, according to the UN's Environment Programme, just 3.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is in contrast to 19% from the US and 23% from China.  <br/>Africa may be rich in minerals and natural resources, but of the 46 nations on the UN's Least Developed Countries list, 33 are on the continent, and poverty continues to be the biggest daily threat for millions of people on the continent.  <br/>But there is also a growing middle-class who could potentially travel by air if the tickets were priced at similar levels to Europe or elsewhere.<br/>African states have been trying for decades to integrate the aviation sector, but they haven't been successful, yet. <br/>\"There needs to be a coherent strategy by Africa to address the issue of its poor air service if they want to transform Africa's economies,\" says Zemedeneh Negatu, the global chairman of US-based investment firm Fairfax Africa Fund.<br/>He says that flights within Africa are still structured around cumbersome bilateral agreements from one country to the next, and that most  flag-carrying state airlines in Africa barely cover their costs, while some even run at a loss.  <br/>\"Every government in Africa wants to see their flag on the tail of an aircraft at Heathrow or JFK airport, but African governments need to realise that stand alone carriers are not viable.\" <br/>Mr Zemedeneh argues that African airlines should take inspiration from Europe and form major partnerships, such as between flag-carriers Air France and KLM of The Netherlands, and the Anglo-Spanish International Airlines Group (IAG) formed between British Airways and Iberia. <br/>He says even in the rich market of Europe, conglomeration is the way forward for airliners to survive, and provide a cheaper more reliable service. <br/>The current system in Africa is very fragmented, and although 35 countries are signed up to the Single African Air Transport Market, an African Union (AU) initiative to free up the skies to African airlines and bring down costs, it could be years before it's implemented.  <br/>IATA's Mr Awadhi says governments are reluctant to work together. <br/>\"There is a hard-headedness where each state thinks they know how to handle it better and will stick to their remedies even when they are not very effective,\" he says.<br/>\"In the end it's a business and there is a level of protectionism that starts to hurt the aviation industry. Then there is no benefit to having your own national carrier.\" <br/>There is one notable exception in Africa of an airline that is absolutely thriving, and that could provide a blueprint for others to copy - Ethiopian Airlines.  <br/>Just over 15 years ago the company employed about 4,000 people. Now that figure is over 17,000. <br/>It is state-owned but run entirely as a commercial venture without government interference. <br/>It has more than doubled the size of its fleet of cargo and passenger planes and has made Addis Ababa a regional hub, driving foreign currency into the Ethiopian capital, and boosting the country's service industry.  <br/>At the turn of the millennium Ethiopia was one of the poorest countries in the world, now it's one of the fastest growing economies. <br/>Mr Zemedeneh, an Ethiopian-American who played a key role as an adviser to Ethiopian Airlines as it developed its strategy, says Ethiopian Airlines has played a part in that boom. <br/>\"Ethiopian Airlines generates millions of dollars in hard currency for the country, and it makes every Ethiopian proud that they have been able to create one of the most successful indigenous African-owned, African-operated, multinational companies,\" he adds.    <br/>African travellers will be hoping these kinds of commercial successes will ultimately impact their airfares, bringing them down more in line with Europe or Asia - and that they can finally get to where they want to go more quickly and cheaply.<br/>One woman, 30 African countries, five lessons<br/>Waiting for take-off in West Africa<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But Mr Namasivayasivam recently divulged his blunder to dozens of people at an event in Toronto, Canada.<br/>His mistake seven years ago involved his work trying to ensure that when bands and solo artists submitted 10-second long, looping videos to accompany their songs, they would play smoothly on people's mobile phones.<br/>At the time the videos were being trialled in Canada.<br/>They should have been streamed to users' handsets just the one time, but due to Mr Namasivayasivam's error they were constantly re-downloaded onto people's phones every 10 seconds.  <br/>For those not connected to wi-fi, it quickly used up all their data.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam only became aware of the mistake when he read complaints on an online forum. One person had written that it had \"killed his data\".<br/>Another said: \"I hate this feature so much. Whoever came up with this, should be fired and shot.\"<br/>While most of us might have wanted to keep such memories locked away, Mr Namasivayasivam revealed all into a microphone while standing on a stage in front of room full of strangers.<br/>The gathering was part of a global movement, with more than 250 cities now participating in public showcases of how entrepreneurs and other business leaders, mainly in the tech space, fail and then recover from their gaffes.<br/>The idea is that it is cathartic to talk about such things, and everyone in attendance can learn from the mistakes, and ask questions.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam told the crowd in Toronto: \"It was at this moment that I messed up, and this is where the feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety and shame came flooding in.\"<br/>He was one of three speakers at the event. Afterwards he told the BBC that it felt good to share his face-palm moment, \"and how someone can bounce back from that embarrassment\".<br/>Today Mr Namasivayasivam is the founder and chief executive of Skillify, a Toronto-based provider of software coding training.<br/>Bill Murray (not the famous actor), works for Canadian software firm Padiem, which makes systems that enable firms to handle timesheets and wages.<br/>He was in the audience watching Mr Namasivayasivam, and says that the story particularly resonated with him. <br/>\"If you've never made any mistakes as a coder, you probably weren't innovating enough,\" says Mr Murray.<br/>\"Most people want to hide their embarrassing moments or failures, but because the speakers open the floor with some of their toughest moments, it sets the stage for everyone attending to let their guard down and really get to know one another.\"<br/>Tech entrepreneurs shouldn't only celebrate their wins, Mr Murray adds. \"When you study someone's success, it's almost like asking them what lottery numbers they played to win.<br/>\"Of course you can learn lots from successful people, but to me the concept of openly talking about your failures felt like there was much more to learn from.\"<br/>Marsha Druker, who organises the regular failure talks in Toronto, says she looks for speakers willing to not just be open about their professional failure story.<br/>Instead she also wants them \"to tell audiences about what they learned about that mistake, now that they have had time to reflect on it\".<br/>She says a common theme to what tech entrepreneurs face when they fail is \"a story of resilience and coming out at the other side, and recognising that failure shouldn't be a taboo topic we don't talk about openly\".<br/>Venturing into that often off-limits topic is the reason why such celebrations of failure began in Mexico City in 2012, says Carlos Zimbr\u00f3n, a Mexican tech entrepreneur who first came up with the idea for the evenings.<br/>During a barbeque at home with other friends, Mr Zimbr\u00f3n says he expressed how boring it was to attend \"typical conference with keynote speakers talking about their successes, and how it was rare to hear the B-side of that story\".<br/>Soon after, he and his friends held the first failure talk in the same backyard space.<br/>As word spread about the Mexico City event, other entrepreneurs in cities in 80 countries around the world have since started their own parallel nights. They hold monthly talks, coupled with a Q&A session after each speaker.<br/>Mr Zimbron says that the talks, many of which are later uploaded to YouTube, \"can be inspiring for people who may have gone through the same problems\".<br/>He adds: \"When you can connect to someone else's mistakes, and can see how vulnerable they are in sharing that story, that's where you can connect with other entrepreneurs.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Leah Edwards, is both a director at US investment fund Lighter Capital, and a lecturer on leadership and innovation at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>She says she loves that these public talks about business failure are \"normalizing the fact that something is hard, and that it takes a number of at-bats [a baseball term for a batter's turn] in order to find the right combination of teams and market opportunity, and the right product or service\".<br/>Ms Edwards adds Silicon Valley has long had a high tolerance for start-ups not succeeding, and that it is good to see this spreading.<br/>\"There will always be entrepreneurs whose companies don't work out in the end, but they pick themselves back up and try again,\" she says. \"I'm excited to see this recognition of that kind of resilience spreading into other geographies and cultures.\"<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

A recent survey suggested 14% of people with the illness have since lost their jobs. <br/>Before the pandemic, Marcus Whitehead had a demanding and fulfilling career in financial services in London. But after catching coronavirus in 2020, he became far too ill to work.  <br/>Three years on, although he is physically much better, brain fog has prevented the 55-year-old from returning to his job.  <br/>Marcus, who lives in Harpenden, feels a \"sense of loss\" at retiring early and losing his mental agility. \"I was no longer who I was,\" he says.<br/>Listen: Marcus explains how long Covid affected him<br/>It was in April 2020 that Marcus first developed symptoms of Covid-19.  <br/>\"It was typical corona - a temperature, a cough - a bit like flu. It wasn't too bad and I was able to work a bit,\" he says.  <br/>But a few days later it hit him \"like a tonne of bricks\" and he experienced \"crushing, paralysing fatigue, like you'd been injected with horse tranquiliser\".<br/>Marcus also suffered \"fierce organ pain\" and intense headaches, spending the following three months in bed. <br/>\"I spent another 12 months on the couch. For 18 months I didn't drive and had to use a walking stick. And I haven't been able to work since.\"<br/>Marcus was managing partner of actuary firm Barnett Waddingham, overseeing 1,000 members of staff. <br/>He likens the role of co-ordinating client strategy and supporting employees to \"spinning plates\". <br/>\"I was juggling dozens of plates a day, and then after Covid I was turned into this person who could hardly hold a single plate, let alone spin dozens.\"  <br/>In 2022, he attempted to reintegrate at work with support from his company.  \"I managed two days\", he explains, \"and I was back in bed with a massive relapse.  <br/>\"It was quite soul-destroying, when I'd been so close to getting back to work. The first time I put my brain under any kind of pressure, it just gave up on me again.\"<br/>Eventually it became clear that Marcus would have to leave his high-performance job, and he decided to retire a decade earlier than planned.<br/>\"I'm very fortunate to have a lot of health back. But it's been quite a dramatic change in what I expected of that decade up to my early sixties,\" he says. <br/>The personal cost to Marcus has also been felt in the wider economy. A survey in March of 3,000 people self-reporting long Covid found 14% of them had lost their jobs for reasons connected to the condition. <br/>Of the two million people in the UK who report having long Covid, 20% feel significantly limited in their ability to undertake day-to-day activities, according to the Office of National Statistics.<br/>Claire Hastie is a founding member of the charity Long Covid Support, whose online support group has over 60,000 members. She set it up after struggling to find any information or help when she failed to recover from the virus.<br/>\"Huge numbers of people are no longer able to work at all, or to their previous capacity, having to reduce their hours and take less senior roles,\" she says. <br/>Claire believes Marcus's story highlights a significant need for \"urgent research\" into the \"debilitating condition\". <br/>\"At a time of labour and skills shortages, the impact of long Covid on the economy is significant,\" she says. <br/>As well as those who have stopped working, \"others are struggling to keep their jobs but at a huge cost to their health and ability to do anything else\", she adds.<br/>And it is not just limited to those with long Covid, but their families too. Marcus's wife Sue also decided to stop working for a while to help him recover.  <br/>\"I spotted that Marcus's health was better on weekends, when we're doing stuff together and I'm not working ten-hour days, leaving him to his own devices.\"<br/>She believes that giving up her job, as a capital programme director for a local authority, has been the secret to \"unlocking\" his recovery.<br/>Although Marcus still struggles with brain fog, his physical health has recently improved. <br/>The couple were left to look for solutions, trawling social media for advice, as \"the medical profession did not have any cures and still doesn't\". <br/>So they tried anything and everything to improve his condition. \"I felt like a guinea pig. At times I would beg Sue not to bring another attempted solution,\" he says. <br/>He spent time in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, changed his diet and took all kinds of pills and supplements - \"even resorting to buying medication from Bangladesh\".<br/>Sue also worked on pacing his energy levels, which led to some improvements alongside \"an exceptionally good diet\" with no ultra processed foods.<br/>But the real change came earlier this year, through a programme called the lightning process, which is not endorsed by the NHS but has been used to treat people with chronic fatigue syndrome.  <br/>The privately funded programme focuses on interactions between the brain and the body.<br/>\"The turnaround was really quite dramatic,\" Marcus says. \"I was already on a good underlying healing curve, but this boosted it.<br/>\"There isn't medical, scientific proof - it is just my personal experience - but I tried an awful lot of things that haven't worked. Now I feel physically much better.\"  <br/>Sue says the couple are now spending time travelling and visiting friends, after observing that Marcus felt better when they went away. <br/>\"We've called it the Year of Yes,\" she says. \"Anything that's happening, we're going to try and do it.\"<br/>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was providing \u00a350 million to scientists to better understand the long-term effects of coronavirus.  <br/>\"We recognise that long Covid has debilitating impacts on physical and mental health.

In the business world, the fight has already begun.<br/>Less than 24 hours after Mr Zuckerberg launched his alternative to Twitter, Threads, it had already claimed some 30 million sign-ups - lending it credibility as a serious contender in the world of social media.<br/>That's still a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of Twitter users. <br/>But analysts think it's a sign that Mr Zuckerberg's Meta has a good shot at wooing some of its gigantic 3 billion-plus users on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to the new offering - and bringing advertisers with them.<br/>After all, Mr Zuckerberg, whose Meta made more than $117bn in sales last year, has a monster track record when it comes to selling adverts - and none of the apparent qualms of Mr Musk, who has disdained advertising at his electric car company, Tesla, and been looking for alternative ways to fund Twitter. <br/>Mr Zuckerberg said there would be no ads on Threads initially, giving the company time to fine-tune the app, which allows users to scroll endlessly through text-based posts. <br/>\"Our approach will be the same as all our other products: make the product work well first, then see if we can get it on a clear path to 1 billion people, and only then think about monetization at that point,\" he wrote. <br/>But eventually, Threads adverts could add 1% to 5% to Meta's overall revenue, generating more than $6bn in the most optimistic scenario, Justin Patterson, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a note.  <br/>That's not huge. But it's also not nothing, especially as the company continues to look for ways to combat the hit to ad sales sparked by stricter privacy rules from Apple. <br/>And it is well within striking distance of Twitter, which generated $4.5bn in ad revenue in 2021, before Mr Musk's takeover sparked upheaval. <br/>Whether that money materialises will depend on what Threads becomes, if anything, in the weeks and months ahead. <br/>Mr Musk was ready on Thursday with the counter-punch, reportedly threatening legal action against Meta for stealing trade secrets.<br/>But frustration with Twitter has left plenty of people hungry for an alternative; and Meta's promise of a \"saner, kinder place\" than Twitter \"supercharged\" early sign-ups, Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said.<br/>\"Posting. With optimism,\" quipped Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker, one of the celebrities jumping into the fray alongside Shakira, Oprah and Khloe Kardashian.<br/>Success will depend on winning over Twitter's power users or people who never signed up for the app in the first place - no sure bet, analysts said.<br/>Though the fashion and lifestyle content that is the bread-and-butter of Instagram clearly holds appeal for advertisers, it is not clear the world needs another platform to consume it.<br/>Mr Zuckerberg also has a complicated relationship with news, one of Twitter's main functions. <br/>He has said surveys show users want less of it on the platforms he runs and in Canada, his company is preparing to block local reporting, rather than pay news providers there for their content.  <br/>\"News hounds and avid Twitter loyalists aren't likely to defect... and Meta will need to keep Threads interesting to maintain the momentum once the novelty wears off,\" Ms Enberg said, adding that Mr Zuckerberg - who has been skewered before for creating copycat products - has \"struggled\" with innovation. <br/>Advertisers will also be looking for confidence that they are not spending money on a platform exposing them to risks tied to issues like misinformation and privacy.<br/>Under Mr Musk, Twitter, which had struggled to be profitable, has alienated advertisers with abrupt changes to how the site moderates content and more recently, a new limit on how many posts audiences can see. <br/>Analysts say Meta has already been one of the beneficiaries from Twitter losing business.<br/>But Mr Zuckerberg is not coming to the table with a clean record either. <br/>His company has clashed with marketers for years over the transparency and accuracy of its data, while its handling of user data and misinformation has drawn widespread criticism. <br/>\"Advertisers want a clean ... well-lit environment where content is moderated on the terms and conditions agreed to, on a consistent basis,\" said marketing veteran Lou Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory. \"Overall right now social media is a bit of a dumpster fire.\"<br/>Meta shares popped 4% on Wednesday ahead of the launch - a sign of investor confidence that Mr Zuckerberg has the ability to make it work, despite flops like Facebook Dating. <br/>But replicating the way that news breaks on Twitter will be difficult, Mr Paskalis said, leaving room for both platforms to exist.<br/>Or, he suggested, the presence of a serious threat could prove a \"wake-up call\" for Mr Musk.<br/>\"One of the keys will be how long will Threads eschew advertising,\" Mr Paskalis said. \"Whatever that period of time is, that's the period of time that Twitter has to right that ship.\"<br/>Twitter threatens legal action over Threads app<br/>Threads could cause real problems for Twitter<br/>'Almost every influencer will be hopping on Threads'<br/>30 million join Meta's Twitter rival - Zuckerberg<br/>Musk and Zuckerberg agree to hold cage fight<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

While analysts said Mr Biden's comment was unlikely to have a major negative effect, it was also widely seen as not helping matters.<br/>In another sign that the trade dispute between the two countries is far from being resolved, China this week announced it was tightening controls over exports of two materials crucial to producing computer chips. From next month, special licences will be needed to export gallium and germanium from China, which is the world's biggest producer of the metals.<br/>The move follows Washington's efforts in the past year to curb Chinese access to some advanced computer chips. In October, Washington announced it would require licences for companies exporting chips to China using US tools or software, no matter where they are made in the world.<br/>The US and China face a complex set of issues, said Priyanka Kishore from the business forum IMA Asia.<br/>\"The official rhetoric and visits by senior diplomats indicate a desire to establish a working political relationship between the two countries,\" she added. \"But the actions suggest otherwise, with the tit-for-tat policies dominating.\"<br/>During meetings with her counterparts in Beijing Ms Yellen is expected to make clear that the US will continue to defend human rights and its national security interests.<br/>However, she is also expected to emphasise Washington's willingness to work with Beijing on issues, including climate change and the problems faced by heavily-indebted countries.<br/>While some high-profile figures have called for the US to completely break economic ties with China, Ms Yellen will take a more placatory approach. She is expected to tell her counterparts in Beijing that Washington does not intend to decouple the two economies.<br/>This is in line with her worldview, which is more globalist than some of her predecessors, as she outlined in a speech earlier this year: \"A full separation of our economies would be disastrous for both countries. It would be destabilising for the rest of the world.\"<br/>\"I would say it's a little bit like good cop, bad cop, Blinken being the bad cop,\" former International Monetary Fund chief economist Ken Rogoff told the BBC.<br/>\"And now Yellen going in as the good cop trying to say, look, you know, we have a lot in common. Let's see what we can do together,\" he added.<br/>In his role as secretary of state, Mr Blinken had to raise some hard issues, such as Taiwan and Ukraine, Mr Rogoff said.<br/>However, Mr Rogoff cautioned that this should not be taken as a sign that Ms Yellen will be soft on Beijing as she is likely to press Chinese officials on a number of issues, including intellectual property laws and access to markets.<br/>Also, while some figures on both sides of the US-China divide talk of splitting away from one another, the reality of the interdependence can be seen in trading figures.<br/>Trade between the two countries grew in 2022 for the third year in a row, with official figures showing China exported more than $536bn (\u00a3422.3bn) worth of goods to the US last year, while $154bn of goods went in the other direction.<br/>But even as Washington and Beijing try to resolve their differences, the spectre of the US presidential election looms.<br/>\"If there is a second Biden administration beginning after 2024, on the economic front I expect loosening of many of the Trump-era trade sanctions and tariffs, in particular ones less related to high technology sectors,\" Professor Eric Harwit of the Department of Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii said.<br/>\"However, if Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, all bets are off.\"<br/>China curbs exports of key computer chip materials<br/>China's new law tightens Xi's powers against the West<br/>Netherlands to restrict chip equipment exports<br/>Biden calls Xi a dictator a day after Beijing talks<br/>Japan plans to restrict some chip-making exports<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

A blue lake sparkles in the sunshine below.<br/>Many would call the view breathtaking, but Alan Viader, a second generation winemaker at Viader Vineyard and Winery says what he sees now, is an overgrown forest. <br/>\"Potential fuel,\" he calls it. <br/>Northern California's Napa Valley had a historic wildfire season in 2020. The first blaze erupted in August, consuming hundreds of thousands of acres and killing five people.<br/>Then in late September another - dubbed the \"Glass Fire\" - quickly became the most destructive wildfire in the famous wine region's history.<br/>It engulfed Alan's winery, destroying some of the prized old vines, and incinerating two of the buildings on the property. After 24 hours of waiting, and praying, firefighters deemed the area safe, and Alan was finally able to return to his vineyard, where trees were still burning. <br/>\"I felt very helpless,\" Alan recalls. \"I know what I can do. I know where we have our fire hoses and all our pumps. I know how to protect the property. But I just wasn't able to get up here and that was a struggle.\"<br/>The perennial presence of wildfires is forcing him, like many others in the region, to confront a harsh reality - harvest season is now also fire season. <br/>Nearly three years after the Glass Fire, Alan hasn't just adapted the property, rebuilding with fire resistant materials, paving wider roads for fire engines and mobile water tanks, he's also undergone training and is now a certified firefighter.<br/>\"There's a huge connection, a real parallel with firefighting. We play with pumps and hoses, too, except our hoses are full of wine,\" he says. \"I'm always dragging hoses somewhere\".<br/>Just across the valley sits Storybook Mountain Vineyard, where 86-year-old Jerry Seps still gets up at 05:00, puts on his straw hat, and tends to his vineyard, just like he has everyday for nearly 50 years.<br/>In 2017, when flames started to threaten Jerry's land and livelihood, he decided to not evacuate, and instead to try to fight the flames himself. He was told he single-handedly saved the winery. <br/>He blushes at the memory and sighs. <br/>\"You're not saving a vineyard, you're saving your life,\" he says. \"This is our life choice. And I've put a lot into it. The family's put a lot into it. And it was too much to lose without a struggle.\"<br/>Fast forward three years, and there were more ferocious fires to fight, but it wasn't the flames that posed the greatest threat. Instead it was the smoke.<br/>The wine that's finally bottled after fermentation is a living entity that ages and develops. And what winemakers in the region quickly realized is that even if the vines are saved from the flames, the pernicious effects of the smoke can be even more costly than the fires themselves.<br/>Jerry attempted to make wine after the 2020 harvest, hoping that his crop had been spared. But once testing began, he discovered that smoke taint had affected two-thirds of his grapes, and therefore the resulting wine.<br/>\"So we just poured it down the drain,\" he says. \"We took the economic loss in a feeling that we have a very strong reputation. And we really care about the people that drink our wine and we want to keep that reputation.\"<br/>California's wine industry is worth around $40bn (\u00a332bn) to California's economy. Winemakers across the Napa are desperately seeking solutions to smoke taint. <br/>Prof Anita Oberholster, at the University of California at Davis, is leading research into how the impact of smoke taint can be mitigated. She's become a wine \"doctor\", helping to cure sick wine. <br/>Prof Oberholster says there are some filtration techniques, like reverse osmosis, and treatments involving activated charcoal which are already used to remove bitter compounds from wine. But these treatments can remove more than just the ashy taste created by compounds from the smoke, they also takeaway some of the wine's complexity.  <br/>\"Unfortunately, both of these also impact the overall quality of the wine. So you probably will need to sell that wine at a lower price level, because the quality will be impacted.<br/>And that's the problem, you can still make wine after wildfires, but in a region that exists on a world renowned reputation built up over many decades, can they make Napa quality wine?<br/>At Realm Cellars, head winemaker Benoit Touquette takes a sip of his prized cabernet sauvignon and loudly slurps it with pleasure. He calls the noise \"the sound of joy.\"<br/>He and his team decided not to make any red wine with the 2020 harvest because of the smoke taint. It was a decision that cost the winery more than $25m.<br/>More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.<br/>\"It's not just make or don't make,\" he says. \"You've got to think about everything at once.<br/>\"What if it goes bad in the consumer's hand? What does it mean for the brand? There's the instance where there is no income, but there's also the longevity of the brand and our values.  There's much more at stake than the income which is a tremendous number.\"<br/>Just up Silverado Trail, the main road that winds through Napa Valley, sits the Signorello Estate It was the only Napa winery to burn to the ground in 2017. Almost six years on, the rebuilding process continues.<br/>Priyanka French, the head winemaker at the winery, is helping oversee the construction of what will be one of the most fireproof wineries ever built, she says they are only using non-flammable materials and will produce most of the wine in underground caves, as a natural form of fire protection. <br/>Despite the increased threat of fires and the black smoke they billow, she feels positive about the future.<br/>\"As long as we're being conscientious, not just of being responsible as environmental stewards, but really thinking about what the industry in Napa is going to be able to say about itself in the future, I think it's exciting.<br/>\"I think we're having some really interesting and important conversations about important issues at the moment.

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

He helped mastermind some of the biggest hits of the 1980s, working with the likes of Sade and Spandau Ballet. He lost his sight in his mid-thirties and this has shaped the way he works with artists. <br/>\"Singers who are very pretty or handsome, without knowing it, are quite disarmed by me,\" says Sir Robin. <br/>This suits his working method. To encourage artists to sing with emotion, he invites them to \"sing ugly\", he tells me, as we sit in his south London home studio. <br/>\"I want them to adopt mannerisms and facial expressions that reflect what they are going through.\"<br/>They need to do this so he can capture the emotional turmoil they feel inside.<br/>It's easier to not care what you look like when you are working with a blind producer, he reflects.<br/>Sir Robin grew up in north London and loved music from an early age, showing an aptitude for playing the guitar. <br/>However, his world changed at the age of 16 when he found out that he would progressively go blind, because of the genetic condition retinitis pigmentosa.<br/>It was a stroke of luck that gave him his initial ticket into the music world. His sister married Mick Taylor, who joined The Rolling Stones in 1969. He toured with the band and observed the magic of the music-making process.<br/>He tried a range of jobs, including being a solo musician, before setting up his own music studio in London. Possessing a nose for business, he created a record label and management business in parallel to his recording work, which over time has made him millions.<br/>His biggest hits came in the 1980s, from his recordings with Fine Young Cannibals, Boy George (who nicknamed him \"Golden Ears\"), Terence Trent D'Arby, Spandau Ballet and Everything But The Girl. But the record that cemented his reputation was Diamond Life by Sade, one of the best-selling albums of the decade, containing smash hits Smooth Operator and Your Love is King.<br/>It was during the recording of Sade's follow-up album in France in the mid-80s that he finally lost his sight completely.<br/>Rather than tell the band though, he started an argument as an excuse to leave, then phoned his wife, asking her to come out and take him home - which is where it hit him.<br/>Hung on the walls of his house were his gold and platinum discs.<br/>\"I thought, 'I can't even see these wretched things anymore. What's it all for?' Smash, smash, smash.<br/>\"But I think it's important to note the next day, my wife and I put them back up and pieced them together and got them reframed.<br/>\"When a person's got a disability, you have this feeling you are trying to crawl out of a big hole. You've got to the point where your elbows are on the grass, but your feet are still dangling. Every day you are focusing on trying to get out of that hole, but sort of knowing that you can't, then every now and then you lose your footing and fall back down. In France I fell down the black hole. But pretty quickly you want to scramble up. There is a natural buoyancy in our human nature.\"<br/>With his discs restored to pride of place, he got back to work in the studio. Artists like Laura Marling and Emeli Sande have enjoyed his services since.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Many in the music industry fear the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens the very essence of authentic songwriting, but not Sir Robin. <br/>\"Artificial intelligence is in the news, but it is not new for the music industry,\" he argues.<br/>Computer-generated music was used by The Who and Pink Floyd, and even the autotune technology in Cher's 1998 hit Believe is another example of AI in action, he says. <br/>The music industry is perfectly able to adapt, he reckons, and his own label Blue Raincoat Music, which bought Chrysalis Records, will work with AI and the opportunities it brings.<br/>But what AI cannot do is replace humans in the recording process, or replicate the \"real emotion\" that is the key ingredient in hit songs, says Sir Robin.<br/>He has tricks to test whether his studio alchemy has distilled that magic quality.<br/>He plays the song on small speakers that distort the sound. He plays the song in the background while holding a conversation with someone. He plays the song and listens to it from a different room, imagining it is \"playing faintly in the distance from a Greek taverna\".<br/>His ears are straining to hear \"real emotion\" that will \"catch people deep down\" and let listeners feel compassion for the singer.<br/>He sees his job as a producer as akin to that of a psychologist or mentor, helping the artist explore the true feelings behind the songs, which often involves discussing their childhoods.<br/>A good example of that was Wonderful Life, by Black, he recalls, which drew on many of singer Colin Vearncombe's early experiences and his relationship with his mother.<br/>He heard the same pure emotion in Adele's Someone Like You, when he first heard it. <br/>\"I stopped in my tracks in the supermarket because I'd had an emotional reaction to something and I didn't know what it was. After 40 seconds I had tears in my eyes. It was compassion for her [and the story told in the song].\"<br/>Music generated by AI will be able to simulate emotion, but it won't have what Sir Robin calls \"that lovely chain\" - the genuine human backstory that powers the voice in the song, which producers like him strive so patiently to coax out of the artist.<br/>You can follow CEO Secrets reporter Dougal Shaw on LinkedIn<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

He also had a short period as chief executive of US giant Hewlett-Packard.<br/>He believes Europe has got a lot to offer.<br/>Partially retired, the 69-year old divides his time between Paris and London and has spent the last decade advising small software companies.<br/>Today he has a new role, as one of a team of tech veterans determined to end Europe's underwhelming record of producing giant technology firms.<br/>Mr Apotheker is part of Boardwave, the brainchild of Phill Robinson. Mr Robinson is a British former software boss who has lived in Silicon Valley and retired after a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease. <br/>Boardwave grew out of Mr Robinson ruminating on what he could do to lift Europe's tech scene to Californian levels.<br/>Mr Apotheker joined Boardwave the day after its website went live. As Mr Robinson puts it, \"we're grateful for the careers we've had and the opportunity to share what we know.\" <br/>Both are driven by a pressing sense of passing time and a desire to spare future generations of tech pioneers the pains they endured.<br/>Mr Apotheker points out that Europe does have some leaders. He highlights specialist fields such as industrial design programs and the UK's lead in financial software. London's financial technology (fintech) scene wins his approval. <br/>But why aren't there more?<br/>He rejects the traditional argument that finding money is much easier in the US. <br/>\"I don't think this is about raising capital, Europe is awash with venture capital companies.\" <br/>Investors will sink $50bn into European tech businesses in 2023, according to venture capital firm Atomico.  <br/>One problem for European tech entrepreneurs is a lack of peers. <br/>\"I lived in Silicon Valley and there's always a group of people around who can give you advice. When I ran SAP and needed advice I talked to the wall!, \" says Mr Apotheker.<br/>\"Boardwave is trying to mentor other company bosses to help them grow. Being in charge can be a very lonely job. You worry about something in the middle of the night and it keeps on chewing at you. The value of picking up the phone and talking to someone is huge.\"<br/>He sees Boardwave's team saving his youthful successors from those sleepless nights and guiding the big ideas to fruition. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Apotheker still wishes he could have had a sympathetic guide to share concerns with when he ran SAP. \"There were a lot of decisions I struggled with at SAP and I wish I could have talked with someone who'd been there before me, someone I could bounce ideas off.\"  <br/>Boardwave was also born out of a sense that time is not on the side of wise older guys. \"Of the few hairs I have left lots of them are grey. So I'm willing to spend the time I have left on this.\" <br/>That includes talking about decisions that did not work out.<br/>\"We talk about mistakes we've made. We've made a lot of mistakes, and got a few things right!\" <br/>European scepticism is often cited as a poor contrast to the overwhelming optimism of Silicon Valley.<br/>Yet Mr Apotheker values the ability to ask penetrating questions in an industry with its fair share of fraudulent ventures such as Theranos, the Silicon Valley start-up whose founder Elizabeth Holmes has just begun an eleven-year prison sentence for defrauding investors. <br/> \"I am of mixed German/French heritage and I can be cynical and sceptical but I turn that to an advantage.\" <br/>His colleague, 58-year old Mr Robinson, is candid about how Parkinson's Disease motivates him. \"I've accumulated a lot of knowledge of the software sector and I want to share it with others before my brain gets mushy.\"<br/>He took one of the first computer science degrees in the UK and  worked in Silicon Valley at the age of 23, beginning an impressive career in business software. <br/>\"I believe Europeans have a great talent pool but it's fragmented. We're 1,000 miles across while Silicon Valley is 40 miles long.\" He founded Boardwave on his kitchen table in 2022 and it now has 800 members, chief executives and founders across Europe. <br/>Start-ups registered with Boardwave can connect with these mentors. Boardwave aims to shepherd them towards the critical stage of \u00a3100m turnover when they can spread their wings on the international stage. <br/>Other established initiatives echo Boardwave's drive to expand Europe's top tier of tech. Finland hosts a huge annual gathering, Slush, where tech start-ups can meet potential investors. <br/>The boss of Finnish success story WithSecure, a cybersecurity business that confronts the global threat of malware, hacking and ransom demands, is Juhani Hintikka. <br/>He too does pro bono coaching for local start-ups and agrees with the concept behind Boardwave. \"People do ask for advice and I try to do my bit.\" <br/>But he admits innovators are curbed by Europe's fragmentation, with multiple business cultures as opposed to the vast home market US companies can tap into.<br/>Ever ambitious, Mr Apotheker cites planemaker Airbus as a great European guiding light. \"European airline makers came together to take on Boeing and Airbus is now the largest in the world.\"<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

When she is not doing that, she volunteers at the Sense charity shop on Clacton High Street.<br/>Describing the moment she got her first wage packet, Ms Phillips' face lights up.<br/>\"I felt like I wanted to run away with it, just to enjoy all the money,\" she says.<br/>\"I wanted to get out and do a job. Since I have come to the caravans, I've [found] my own voice and I don't feel nervous any more.\"<br/>People like Penny are \"untapped resource\", according Mike King, operations manager for Essex for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).<br/>He says a significant number of economically inactive people are claiming benefits but \"are not actually looking for work or feel like they are capable of work\".<br/>But why is there such a high proportion of economically inactive people in Clacton particularly?<br/>\"I think most seaside towns are the same,\" he says.<br/>Seasonal work patterns, a shortage of big employers and being at the far end of the transport network all play a part, Mr King says.<br/>Giving people the right tools to get back into the workplace, he adds, is vital.<br/>\"We are working with employers and people with both physical and mental disabilities. We are not saying they will be ready for work instantly - it may be we move them closer to work through training courses and then supporting them when they are in work.<br/>\"We will support them all the way through and make sure they've got everything they need.\"<br/>One effort to try and encourage people back into work is a monthly community bus, organised by Kerrey Goosetree from the Suffolk and North Essex Integrated Care Board, which visits locations in Clacton and the surrounding areas.<br/>Representatives from volunteering organisations, education institutions, health services, the DWP and others set out their stalls waiting to share their expertise and advice to interested passers-by.<br/>She says many people they meet have misconceptions.<br/>\"For example, people might come along and say they would like to start working again but are not sure how they will survive if their benefits are stopped straight away.

It says the figure is likely to rise by 73% to 3.88 billion tonnes by 2050.<br/>Plastic is particularly problematic. From the start of large-scale production of the material in the 1950s until 2015, more than 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste was produced, research from the Universities of Georgia and California calculated.<br/>Someone who will not find those statistics surprising is Mikela Druckman. She has spent a lot of time looking at what we throw away, as the founder of Greyparrot, a UK start-up that has created an AI system designed to analyse waste processing and recycling facilities.<br/>\"In a single day you will have literally mountains of waste in one facility coming through, and what's very shocking and surprising is that it never stops,\" she says. There are no holidays for waste, it just keeps coming.\"<br/>Greyparrot places cameras above the conveyor belts of around 50 waste and recycling sites in Europe, utilising AI software to analyse what passes through in real-time.<br/>AI technology has come on in leaps and bounds over the past year, and its ability to process images is now very sophisticated. However, Ms Druckman says it was still hard to train a system to recognise rubbish.<br/>\"A product like a Coke bottle, once it goes into the bin, will be crumpled, crushed and dirty, and makes the problem much more complex from an AI standpoint.\"<br/>Greyparrot's systems now track 32 billion waste objects per year, and the firm has built up a huge digital map of waste. This information can be used by waste managers to become more operationally efficient, but it can also be shared more widely.<br/>\"It is allowing regulators to have a much better understanding of what's happening with the material, what materials are problematic, and it is also influencing packaging design,\" says Ms Druckman.<br/>\"We talk about climate change and waste management as separate things, but actually they are interlinked because most of the reasons why we are using resources is because we're not actually recovering them.<br/>\"If we had stricter rules that change the way we consume, and how we design packaging, that has a very big impact on the value chain and how we are using resource.\"<br/>She hopes that big brands and other producers will start using data generated by firms like GreyParrot, and ultimately design more reusable products.<br/>Troy Swope runs a company that is intent on making better packaging. Footprint has worked with supermarkets, and with Gillette to convert its plastic razor trays to ones made of plant-based fibre.<br/>In a blogpost on Footprint's website, Mr Swope claims that consumers are being misled by a \"myth of recycling\".<br/>He referenced a plastic salad container that was labelled \"ready to recycle\" and asked what that actually meant.<br/>\"It's less likely than ever that their discarded single-use plastic ends up anywhere but a landfill,\" wrote Mr Swope. \"The only way out of the plastics crisis is to stop depending on it in the first place.\"<br/>So-called greenwashing is a big problem, says Ms Druckman. \"We've seen a lot of claims about eco or green packaging, but sometimes they are not backed up with real fact, and can be very confusing for the consumer.\"<br/>To help retailers know that used plastic bottles are in fact being recycled, and in what numbers, UK-firm Polytag covers them with an ultraviolet (UV) tag that is not visible to the human eye.<br/>When the bottles then arrive at the determined recycling plants, the tags are read by a Polytag machine. The number of bottles is then uploaded to a cloud-based app in real time, which Polytag's customers can access.<br/>\"They can see exactly how many bottles are being recycled, which is something these brands never had access to before,\" says Polytag's project manager Rosa Knox-Bradley.<br/>So far the firm has worked with UK retailers Co-Op and Ocado.<br/>To make it easier for people to recycle, and encourage more to do so, the UK government and the administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland are due to launch a deposit return scheme in 2025.<br/>This is due to see \"reverse vending machines\" located in shops and other public areas, where people will be able to deposit used plastic bottles and metal drinks cans, and be paid money for doing so - around 20p per item.<br/>The search to find a planet-friendly way to get rid of rubbish remains a tough race, however, as seemingly every year a new trend comes along to throw a spanner in the works.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>The latest is an addiction to e-cigarettes, or vapes, which are creating a whole new mountain of electronic waste that is hard to recycle.<br/>\"It's a huge problem. And it's getting bigger,\" said Ray Parmenter, head of policy and technical at the Chartered Institute of Waste Management. <br/>He adds that the \"fundamental issue\" is disposable single-use vapes, which he says \"are basically an anathema to the circular economy\".<br/>Disposal vapes are composed of many materials - plastics, metals, a lithium battery and some even have LED lights or microprocessors.<br/>Research last year from Material Focus, an organisation that campaigns for more recycling of electrical products, suggests 1.3 million vapes are thrown away per week in the UK alone. This means that some 10 tons of lithium goes into landfill every year, enough to power 1,200 car batteries.<br/>\"The way we get these critical raw materials like lithium is from deep mines - not the easiest places to get to. So once we've got it out, we need to make the most of it,\" says Mr Parmenter.<br/>Vapes are a good example of how we need to change thinking, says Ms Druckman.<br/>\"It doesn't make economic sense, it doesn't make any sense. Rather than ask how do we recycle them, ask why we have single-use vapes in the first place?\"<br/>While industry and policy-makers have big roles to play in making products more recyclable or reusable, so do consumers, she adds.

When we meet in a warehouse, his mouth is covered and he wears smart-looking sunglasses. <br/>Nearly all of his \"customers\" are regulars, he says, paying off their debts within two or three months. They're usually back again a few weeks later.<br/>D adds that with inflation remaining high, demand has soared. He now hears from single mums and families looking to borrow smaller amounts of \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000 to pay gas and electricity bills or for groceries.<br/>For those customers, he charges interest rates of up to 50%, but others more commonly face \"double bubble\" interest, where the original loan is doubled.<br/>Most of D's clients would probably accept whatever terms he set out, he says, largely out of desperation.<br/>With prices failing to drop as quickly as predicted, demand is unlikely to fade soon.<br/>Research shared with BBC Newsnight suggests that the potential client base could be expanding.<br/>A new report commissioned by Fair4All Finance, a government-backed body that works on financial inclusion, looks at the lived experience of illegal moneylending in the UK. Researchers from fraud prevention firm We Fight Fraud and Lancaster University heard from 287 people across London, Preston, Port Talbot and Glasgow who had engaged with loan sharks and illegal moneylenders in the last three years, as well as eight illegal moneylenders.<br/>Current users said they were borrowing about \u00a33,000 on average, and clients were more likely to be lower-waged, full-time workers.<br/>D calls himself an \"enforcer\", referring to what happens if payments are missed or his messages go ignored.<br/>\"Then, the car outside is uninsurable. The windows and doors in the front of your house are pulled out and then it even goes up to you being badly beaten.\"<br/>He says that beatings are \"rare\", but admits to carrying out violent acts - breaking legs, smashing teeth or eye sockets, leaving people in hospital.<br/>When challenged on why this type of \"enforcement\" has to be so brutal, he says: \"It's personal. The way they've hurt me, I want to hurt them - physically and financially.\"<br/>In his own words, he is \"providing a service\" that relies on people \"helping him back\" after he has lent them money.<br/>Another active illegal moneylender we spoke to, \"M\", claims to have lent millions of pounds to clients over the past 20 years.<br/>He now runs a team that operates in different areas across the UK. He estimates that he has about \u00a32m out in loans at the moment. When a request for money above a certain value comes in, it gets referred up to him.<br/>M deals with \"the rich\" - people borrowing higher values to fund house renovations or to get a business out of difficulty. The interest rates rise with the risk attached and a guarantor is often required. <br/>Clients give him a form of guarantee in case they are not able to keep up with repayments. They might include a watch, a set of car keys, or pictures of photo IDs of their friends so he knows where to find them and chase the money.<br/>\"I'm constantly amazed who comes to me,\" he says. M claims to have funded birthday parties for well-known footballers who pay him back on payday.<br/>With many people unwilling to talk about debt, there is little data available about the number of lenders operating without a licence. In a report last year, the right-leaning think tank the Centre for Social Justice estimated that about one million people in England could owe money to illegal moneylenders.<br/>M dismisses what he describes as an outdated view of \"a bully boy business\". His collection tactics instead rely on fear. <br/>\"In this day and age, it's gone round to more being a nuisance,\" he says. \"If there's no contact, there might be pictures outside the house, or a knock on the neighbour's door asking where you are.<br/>\"That fear, that intimidation, that coercion is better to be used without an act.\"<br/>The recent research for Fair4All Finance did find that violence was rare, although the threat of it was common.<br/>One client told the report authors that the reality of the threat felt most serious when it came to their family. \"Stuff was going to happen to me, but not just me\u2026 I get threats for hurting my family\u2026 your mum is getting this, your brother is getting that.\"<br/>Another female client in Glasgow claims that she was forced to clean an office building for an illegal lender as an alternative way to pay back \u00a31,000 she had borrowed. Her debt would be reduced by about \u00a330 per shift.<br/>She described the experience as \"degrading\" and said she felt anxious and depressed. She now rarely leaves the house. <br/>\"Today, it is much more about someone getting inside your head than breaking your legs,\" says Cath Wohlers of the Illegal Money Lending Team, which prosecutes loan sharks in England.<br/>\"That can be anyone,\" she adds, pointing out that one in five people arrested by her team last year was female.<br/>Research also suggests that clients were more likely than the average person to have been refused credit elsewhere before turning to an illegal moneylender.<br/>Those with poor credit ratings are often limited to payday loans or other high-cost options. However, many of these - such as Wonga - have been regulated out of business, after concerns that they were causing severe financial distress to consumers.<br/>Jason Wassell, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, suggests there is a risk that a smaller market \"can be taken too far\", with access to credit being reduced for people who might then go to friends and family, or even illegal lenders.<br/>But Mick McAteer, a former board member of the UK's financial watchdog, says that improving the regulation of \"subprime\"  lenders has protected people from being targeted with unaffordable products.<br/>He suggests that more efforts should be made to help people manage their debts and to boost alternative options such as community lenders or credit unions.<br/>According to the Bank of England, about 1.98 million people across the UK use credit unions. Some experts say there is a long way to go before these can plug the gap left by the exit of higher-cost lenders. Credit unions can't reach consumers as quickly and struggle to scale up as quickly as private companies due to a lack of access to technology.<br/>And as prices continue to rise, business for illegal money lenders like D and M shows no sign of slowing.<br/>But as Cath Wohlers warns: \"They will absolutely bleed you dry. It's just not worth it.<br/>\"If you are in debt, speak to your creditors and have conversations rather than borrowing more money to get out of it.\"<br/>Information and support: If you need help with debt, these BBC Action Line links may be helpful.

While other wine recommendation apps are now increasingly incorporating AI, such as market leader Vivino, the difference with Sippd is that it was based on the technology from the very beginning.<br/>New users start by completing an online wine quiz that analyses their wine preferences, such as colour, body, acidity, flavour, sweetness and price.<br/>Then the app's AI software does the \"heavy lifting\", generating thousands of personal wine recommendations that it calls \"taste matches\". These are rated in percentage terms, with scores of 100% aiming to be a perfect match.<br/>You can then start scanning wine lists or labels with your mobile phone's camera, and Sippd will give you your taste match scores for each bottle.<br/>Sippd then continues to learn when the user tells the app about his or her wine purchases. The aim is that the app's individualised recommendations get ever more accurate.<br/>\"Beginner drinkers are commonly overwhelmed with the number of choices they have when purchasing wine, and they often have no clue where to start learning about their preferences towards certain flavours, characteristics, and styles,\" he says.<br/>\"So our team developed the introductory quiz to provide novice drinkers with a simple, approachable way to enter the vast world of wine.\"<br/>Currently only available in the US, Maryland-based Sippd now has 100,000 users, and the app is free to use. The business makes its money by inviting people to buy recommended wines directly via the app for delivery.<br/>In Norway, tech entrepreneur Alexander Benz launched the first version of his AI-powered wine recommendation app Finp\u00e5Vin back in 2020. <br/>Mr Benz describes the AI as a \"living, breathing thing\" that learns from a users preferences, forever fine-tuning its recommendations.<br/>While the app currently only works with wines on sale at Norway's state-owned alcohol shops, Mr Benz is looking at the possibility of expanding overseas. <br/>He says he is also now aiming to train the AI \"to create unique personalities for wines based on their characteristics\", with the wines being able to \"talk\". Or at least for the AI to pretend to be a talking wine.<br/>\"I'm also developing a social network where wine takes centre stage, and with the help of AI, each wine shares social media content like pictures and text updates. Users can even chat with a wine to learn more about it.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>But what do professional wine experts think about such apps? The view is mixed.<br/>\"Overall I think they can be really good, if used properly,\" says John Downes, who is a master of wine - a holder of the top qualification in the industry. \"These apps connect with people, the guy in the street, in a way that the wine trade often fails at.<br/>\"They have a great potential in helping people along, and helping them to understand wine more.\"<br/>Wine writer Jamie Goode is far more critical, saying that wine apps \"often promise a lot, but fail to deliver\".<br/>\"The problem with trying to match wines to consumers is  - how do you you break down a wine into it component parts, and then understand their nature and qualities in a meaningful way that gives you data to play with in an app?\" he asks.<br/>\"And how can the app know about the tens of thousands of different wines made each year, with numerous vintage variations? If you want to find a more interesting bottle to drink, go to a genuinely good independent shop or website, which will have a carefully chosen range of wines.\"<br/>At Oxford University, Sandra Wachther is a professor of technology and regulation, where she researches the legal and ethical implications of AI. Given that she is a global leader in the study of AI, you might imagine that she would be all in favour of AI-powered wine apps. <br/>Instead she says it is an area where humans should really try to find a good bottle on their own, without reaching for the help of technology. \"When it comes to smells and taste, food or drink, we might want to enjoy grazing and tasting ourselves, rather than to follow recommendations [from an app].<br/>\"We might enjoy following our own eyes and noses, and value being surprised by a dish or beverage. While I can see many exciting roles for AI in our society, some areas of expertise might be best left to ourselves.\"<br/>Sippd's head of marketing, Alicia Ortiz, counters that the app is simply about helping people, especially beginner wine drinkers, \"so they no longer have to roll the dice, or spend unnecessary time researching, when they could be just sipping and enjoying\".<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The customer in question was moving in, a single man with his own place. <br/>Again and again, someone working for the removals firm passed Robson as she toiled and asked, \"Where do you want this, then?\"<br/>Three times she found herself having to explain: \"It's not my house, I'm not married to the man who's moving in, I'm just fixing the heating.\"<br/>Today, Ms Robson runs Your Energy Your Way, a firm that specialises in renewables, heat pumps, plumbing and similar services. She and other women in the industry argue that in 2023 the workforce behind many building trades should be far more diverse - and far too many people still assume that a woman couldn't be a plumber.<br/>According to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), the proportion of women plumbers is tiny, though the ONS estimates that their number grew from 2,700 (1.9%) in 2021 to 3,500 (2.4%) in 2022. <br/>\"Even 2.4% is woeful, isn't it?\" says Ms Robson. There is a similar proportion of women working in other building trades.<br/>The ONS cautions that its data is only an estimate, and is based on extrapolated results from a nationwide survey. Respondents included people who described themselves as plumbers or heating engineers. <br/>A government report published in January suggested that 5% of employees across 687 heating and cooling businesses were female, but the report noted: \"The sector may be slightly less diverse than these numbers imply.\"<br/>The Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers' Federation (SNIPEF) has said it wants to see women making up 10% of all apprentices in the trade. <br/>\"I worked for 17 years without meeting another woman. Then I started to look for them,\" says Hattie Hasan, founder of Stopcocks Women Plumbers, a plumbing company.<br/>She and Ms Robson point out the value of social media in connecting women in the trade around the country - from Facebook groups to TikTok - as well as in-person events such as those run by Stopcocks. The company also has a register of 750 women tradespeople in the UK, including 100 plumbers.<br/>Employers sometimes assume that including women in their advertising or claiming to be equal opportunities is enough but it isn't, argues Ms Hasan.<br/>To actually encourage women into a job, plumbing companies should consider how to cater to their needs - from menopause support, flexible working for single parents, separate toilets and personal protective equipment that fits women correctly, which keeps them safe from dust and other hazards at work.<br/>\"Some women we've spoken to have been told they have to buy their own clothes because it's more expensive for the company to buy it for them,\" says Ms Hasan.<br/>Women might find that working as a plumber is slightly easier at present if they are self-employed, suggests Ms Hasan, as that allows them to manage various commitments besides work on their own terms. She notes that she was forced to set up as self-employed trader herself, years ago, despite approaching multiple companies seeking work.<br/>Sovay Berriman is a self-employed plumber in Cornwall. She uses the business name \"Plumbmaid\", which she explains is not about being a maid in a subservient sense, but rather it is a reference to Cornish slang, where calling a woman \"some maid\" is a colloquial way of giving her especially high praise.<br/>\"A lot of male customers as well find it a relief,\" she says, of being a woman in the industry. \"They're just like, 'Oh, great!' - they're not having to be a bloke.\"<br/>While some are very supportive, Sovay Berriman has, like Ms Robson, faced her share of prejudice and says that the industry must work to push back against assumptions that tradespeople are, by default, men. <br/>She adds that she would be cautious about ascribing any particular attributes to either men or women in the industry, to avoid perpetuating stereotypes. It's not as if all women are better communicators than men, for instance.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>However, she points out that she feels her own skills have served her well. \"I have found that customers are open to how I explain things,\" she says.<br/>\"I don't know if that's about my gender but I do think potentially that's something that's more ingrained in society - that women are good at [communication].\"<br/>Given the shortage of plumbers and heating system installers in the UK, having an industry dominated by white men is a real problem - it means, by definition, that there are huge resources of \"untapped talent\" out there, says Vivien Kizilcec, consumer research manager at Energy Systems Catapult, a government-funded research group. <br/>Today, plumbing and heating are high tech trades that require knowledge of smart controls, renewable energy systems and efficient appliances. <br/>If more people were aware of this, a larger and more diverse cohort might take up the job, she suggests: \"With these new green technologies, you are getting a much wider range of skills.\"<br/>Parental encouragement can make a big difference, notes Aimee Holloran, a business development manager at Samsung Electronics. She specialises in advising customers about heat pumps, but started out as a plumbing apprentice. Her dad got her into all kinds of things boys typically do, she says, including riding motorbikes. And her mum suggested the plumbing apprenticeship.<br/>Some companies are setting targets for improving gender equality. LiveWest, a housing association in the south west of England, has appointed seven female apprentices in the last year, across various trades, for example. It now has 21 women among a 471-strong trades workforce.<br/>Earlier this year, the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (CIPHE) published advice for employers, suggesting that they make their diversity goals public, put together diverse interview panels when hiring people for jobs, and stick to inclusive language. Avoid obviously discriminating terms that continue to be used in job ads such as \"tradesman\", for example.<br/>\"There is certainly still a long way to go\" in terms of gender equality, says Kevin Wellman, chief executive of CIPHE.<br/>Ms Hasan agrees - and makes one final point. Women can bring new and improved approaches to plumbing, beyond simply expanding the workforce. People, she suggests, should stop questioning whether women can be merely \"as good as\" a man.<br/>\"Since when has the way men do things been the high bar that we all have to reach?\" she says, with a laugh. <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The convenience and breadth of an AI chatbot can't compete with the pleasures of chatting with someone whose personality quirks I've learned over the course of years. It is however a useful supplement.<br/>And I'm just one of many people who have discovered in recent months the benefits of AI-based chat for language learning.<br/>A Costa Rican who works in the construction industry tells me that his AI-powered keyboard has been useful for polishing up his technical vocabulary in English. For instance, it's saved him a great deal of time to be able to find an English word for a tool by describing it. <br/>A South African caf\u00e9 owner has gone further in improving his Spanish grammar with the aid of AI. He had a hard time finding simple study tools, especially given his ADHD, so he started using ChatGPT to quickly generate and adapt study aids like charts of verb tenses. <br/>Developers have been quick to jump on this wave of interest, and there are now numerous apps that have drawn on open-source code to customise AI for language learners. These can be more appropriate for learners than general chatbots like the virtual companion Replika. <br/>Blanka Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, an associate professor of applied linguistics at the University of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 in Czechia, says that Replika has been useful for her students to practise informal English. <br/>But the conversations could become repetitive, language corrections were missing, and the chatbot would sometimes ask students for sexy pictures. \"This was quite abusive.\"<br/>In contrast, one of the specific language-learning chatbots is LangAI, launched in March by Federico Ruiz Cassarino. Mr Ruiz Cassarino drew on his own experiences of learning English after moving from Uruguay to the UK. His English skills improved dramatically from speaking every day, compared to more academic methods. He's now using his own app to work on his Italian.<br/>Many people get self-conscious about making mistakes in a language they barely speak, even to a tutor, Mr Ruiz Cassarino notes. But a chatbot won't judge you. And the new wave of generative AI is so advanced that it can cultivate AI penpals, which is how he sees his product.<br/>Rather than sticking to boring pre-scripted roleplays, with current AI \"you can speak about things that are interesting to you, which makes it feel like not as much of a chore to learn\".<br/>While many language learners are using popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard to practice, Mr Ruiz Cassarino believes that specific language-acquisition apps like his are useful.<br/>\"We worked really hard to make this well tailored for somebody who wants to learn languages,\" he says. The team customised LangAI's user interface to match users' vocabulary levels, added the ability to make corrections during a conversation, and enabled the conversion of speech to text.<br/>According to Mr Ruiz Cassarino, they're seeing some impressive retention numbers for an education app. Of users who try the app for around 10 minutes, roughly 45% will still be using it a month later. They're now focused on building the subscriber base of people willing to pay for unlimited use. <br/>Related to that, they're planning advancements like tracking of improved skills and the ability to personalise the chatbot's tone and personality (perhaps even to practise a language while conversing with historical figures).<br/>Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, who is also a member of the research project Language in the Human-Machine Era, has assessed the useability and usefulness of AI chatbots for students of foreign languages. This research suggests that AI chatbots are helpful for vocabulary development, grammar and other language skills, especially when they offer corrective feedback.<br/>To stay ahead of the trend, well-established language-learning apps have been integrating AI into their own platforms. Duolingo began collaborating with OpenAI in September 2022, using that company's GPT-4.<br/>It seems unlikely that AI chatbots will replace Duolingo altogether. Joy Ehonwa, an editor and writer in Lagos, mainly uses Duolingo to learn French.<br/>But lately she's also been using an AI chatbot developed in Nigeria to help with her French.<br/>She interacts with this chatbot, Kainene vos Savant, the way she would with \"an all-knowing human friend\". <br/>Ms Ehonwa explains, \"My questions revolve around 'why'? When I fail an exercise on Duolingo, the app is not great at helping me understand why the thing that was wrong, was wrong. So, I ask Kainene. Also, when I think a sentence should be a certain way and it isn't, I ask Kainene why and she helps me understand why it cannot be the way I expect it to be, as an English speaker.\"<br/>If the older language-learning platforms have weaknesses, so does AI-powered language learning. Users are reporting that chatbots are well versed in widely spoken European languages, but quality degrades for languages that are underrepresented online or that have different writing systems. Many of the AI language-learning apps are available for a limited set of languages.<br/>Even in common languages, the chatbots make errors - sometimes even inventing words. One problem is that they deliver text so confidently, it would be easy for a relatively new learner to take what they say as correct.<br/>Emily M Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington in the US, has concerns, \"What kind of biases and inappropriate ways of talking about other people might they be learning from the chatbot?\" Other ethical issues, such as data privacy, may also be neglected.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Still, Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 believes that there will be an enormous market for such technologies. And like a number of language learners, she points out that GPT-4, available with a paid subscription to ChatGPT, has made astonishing strides on accuracy.<br/>Though many teachers disagree, she believes, \"It's just a matter of time when artificial intelligence will replace us as teachers of foreign languages.\"<br/>While that may sound extreme, \"teachers will still have an important role as mentors and facilitators, particularly with beginner learners and older people since teachers have a strong understanding of the individual learning styles, language needs, and goals of each student.\"<br/>It will be key for language teachers to assess the added value of AI and their role in relation to it, as more sophisticated self-directed learning becomes possible. As Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 advises, \"Technology is here to stay, and we have to face it and reconsider our teaching methods and assessments.\" <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

How are homeowners coping?<br/>Victoria Watts, who lives with her husband and two children in Norwich, knew her mortgage of \u00a31,300 a month was going to increase but she was shocked to learn by how much.<br/>The 35-year old senior insurance manager received a letter last month saying her fixed-rate deal was coming to an end, and the family would need to find an extra \u00a31,400 a month.<br/>Instead they have chosen to go on a tracker mortgage, which will cost them an extra \u00a3700 a month, so they can be more flexible in the hope of rates going down in the future.<br/>Meals out, new clothes and holidays are a thing of the past, she says, and improvements to the kitchen and bathroom are on hold. <br/>\"My husband and I both work and luckily we've got savings but we're going to have to really cut back and be really cautious. We just don't know when things are going to get better and we might have to consider selling our house in the future,\" she says.<br/>Lisa Ward has lived in the same house for 25 years and hoped to stay there for many more. But the mother-of-two has put her three-bed home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire on the market after her mortgage rate went up by nearly 300%. <br/>The 49-year-old was not able to extend her interest-only mortgage when it came to an end recently, and offers from other lenders were not within her financial reach.<br/>\"I got a letter saying my mortgage was going up from \u00a3289 to \u00a31,150 a month,\" she says. \"Now my mum is having to sell her house too and we are hoping to buy a house together in Norfolk because we can't afford anything in Hertfordshire.<br/>\"We don't want to move there but we have no choice. I can't think about the future but I've got to. I've got to be positive and pick myself up and push myself through this.\"<br/>Lisa used to have her own painting and decorating business but had to stop working due to a bowel condition, arthritis and fibromyalgia.<br/>She receives some benefits but they are not enough to cover the huge rise and she feels \"very let down by the government\".<br/>The average rate for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 6.15%, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.<br/>The Bank of England's response to rising inflation has been to increase the UK's official interest rate, in the belief that people are more likely to save money and less likely to borrow it.<br/>The base rate, currently at 4.5%, will be reviewed on Thursday and is widely expected to increase for the 13th time in a row.<br/>Rachelle Gleed, 53, from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, describes the situation as \"ridiculous, scary and very, very stressful\".<br/>The mother-of-two has a rental property with an interest-only mortgage deal that ends in October and is facing an increase from \u00a3500 a month to \u00a31,471.<br/>\"I can't pass that increase on to a tenant, I have a lovely family who rent from me and they won't be able to afford it. I really don't want to have to sell it, I would feel terrible for the family, but where am I supposed to find that sort of money?\".<br/>Rachelle and her husband, who both work full-time, are also worried about the mortgage on their own home which comes up for renewal early next year.<br/>\"I have worked since I was 16 years old and we had got to a place where we could live comfortably and go on nice holidays but now I feel like we have gone back to worrying about every penny,\" she says.<br/>Richard, 61, from Cambridge, had to use all of his \u00a350,000 of savings to get the costs down when his fixed-rate mortgage ended last month.<br/>The IT worker is now on a tracker mortgage, which cost \u00a31,000 in fees to switch to. His monthly interest payments were due to increase from \u00a3260 per month to \u00a3803 but he managed to get that down to \u00a3765 using his savings.<br/>\"Why is the Bank of England still raising interest rates?' We got the message to curb our spending months ago.<br/>\"The government is concentrating on food prices and fuel. I appreciate that it affects a lot of people very badly. For me, a few pence on the price of a box of eggs is a drop in the ocean compared to a monthly interest payment rise of \u00a3500 and everything else to follow.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said it was providing support worth an average of \u00a33,300 per household over this year and next.<br/>\"Central banks around the world are raising interest rates in a collective effort to combat high inflation and the Chancellor has met with mortgage lenders to make clear that borrowers should continue to be supported now and in the future,\" the spokesperson added.<br/>Read more here<br/>How have you been affected by mortgage rate increases?

They have built an AI tool called Wally which generates websites, and have ambitions to turn it into a more general digital assistant. <br/>The company has won awards but they still struggle to access the specialised chips - called GPUs (general processing units) - they need to develop their product further.<br/>\"I think there is a lack of hardware access for start-ups, and a lack of expertise and lack of funding,\" she said.<br/>She said they waited five months for a grant to buy a single GPU - at a time when in the US Elon Musk was reported to have purchased 10,000. <br/>\"That's the difference between us and them because it's going to take us, you know, four to seven days to train a model and if he's [able to] do it in minutes, then you know, we're never going to catch up\".<br/>In an email chat, Ms McClenaghan told me she thinks the best outcome for her firm, Gensys Engine, would be for it to get bought up by a US tech giant - something I hear a lot from UK start-ups.<br/>Re-nosing those ambitions to keep successful firms here in the UK and helping them to grow is another challenge.<br/>Trying to access GPUs might be less of an issue if they were available as part of a national infrastructure, like for example road networks or electricity cables, rather than being hoovered up by those companies which can afford them.<br/>Ian Hogarth thinks this could be the way forward.<br/>\"I think the we're going to enter a phase in which nation states start to see their role in directing critical AI infrastructure in a new way,\" he said.<br/>\"It is going to be a fundamental building block for the next generation of innovation.\" <br/>Despite the trials ahead, he is optimistic the UK can still take a seat at the centre of the AI revolution.<br/>\"I don't think we're too late,\" he says. <br/>\"I wouldn't have taken the job if I thought we couldn't do a lot.\"<br/>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might think<br/>How AI is helping doctors spot breast cancers<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

They told me to delete the app, turn the phone off and on and reinstall\u2026 but when trying to redownload it they'd taken it off the App Store so I couldn't download it. <br/>\"I was left without an active test, other than the fingerprint testing. Pricking your finger 100 times a week is a nightmare, so the app and the sensor is really helpful.\"<br/>Sonja Sleator from Belfast said the app was \"so important\" to her and she was concerned about not being able to use it.<br/>\"Knowing I don't have that constant check, it feels like going back to when I was first diagnosed and having to finger prick a few times a day,\" she said.<br/>The LibreLink app, developed by Abbott, connects to a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) - a white disc covering a needle inserted under the skin of the user, typically in the arm or belly.<br/>People with Type 1 diabetes use the CGM to monitor their blood glucose levels - or blood sugar - around the clock, meaning they don't have to constantly take blood samples by pricking their fingers for readings.<br/>By monitoring glucose levels in real time, people can make better-informed decisions about when to eat or exercise.<br/>Critically, it can also alert the user or their family members when their blood sugar level is too low or too high.<br/>Abbott has come under fire after its Libre 2 CGM stopped interacting with the LibreLink app of some Apple users.<br/>Abbott said the problem emerged after it updated the LibreLink app to give users a significant quality-of-life improvement, removing the need to manually scan the disc with a device.<br/>Instead, the new update would allow the CGM to send the app data continuously, removing the need for a scan. Abbott's competitor Dexcom already allows this.<br/>But an issue with the update has caused some Iphone users to report the app has stopped working for them altogether, leaving them unable to monitor their blood sugar levels.<br/>David told the BBC he was \"luckily\" able to continue testing himself, as he happened to also have a manual sensor, athough this does not provide data to other peoples' devices.<br/>People without these sensors have had to resort to taking between four and 10 finger-prick tests per day to monitor their levels.<br/>\"I was able to recover the app after seeing someone on Twitter giving suggestions to go to 'purchased history' and download it from there,\" he said.<br/>\"It was people helping people online that fixed it, rather than the actual company. But not everyone is an active user on Twitter or Facebook.<br/>\"The data also goes to my wife, so if something happened she'd know, but I don't know if that is going to happen at the moment. I'm sure there are going to be people who aren't getting critical alerts about their loved ones.\"<br/>Abbott said it had temporarily removed the FreeStyle LibreLink app from the App Store while working on solutions to improve it.<br/>It said affected users should contact its customer service line: \"Customers experiencing issues with the iOS app should uninstall and reinstall the app. <br/>\"People using the [app] without issue can continue to use it as normal. The Android version of the [app] continues to be available for download in the UK. No other countries are impacted.\"<br/>Sonja said the app had made her life \"more easy and flexible\". <br/>\"I'm now going to have to set alarms to wake me up because I'm going to have to get up during the night to test,\" she said.<br/>\"Thankfully I found an old monitor in the back of my drawer, old test strips and an old pen to prick my finger - so it's just about keeping an eye on it.\"<br/>Unusual rise in child type 1 diabetes after Covid<br/>Paramedics to screen children for type 1 diabetes<br/>Increase in number of people living with diabetes<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

We don't have a lack of writers, we don't have a lack of actors, we don't have a lack of film-makers - so we don't need AI,\" she said. <br/>\"The problem it solves is for the corporations that feel they don't have wide enough profit margins - because if you can eliminate the overhead of having to pay everyone you can appease Wall Street and have greater earnings reports.<br/>\"If AI use proliferates, the entertainment industry it will crater the entire structure of this business.\"<br/>Perhaps it is only a question of time before ChatGPT or Bard can conjure up an innovative movie script or turn an idea into a blockbuster screenplay.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Brian Cox: 'I am concerned about artificial intelligence'<br/>Some say AI will always lack the humanity that makes a film script great, but there are legitimate concerns that it will put writers out of a job. <br/>The Writers' Guild of Great Britain (WGGB) - a trade union representing writers for TV, film, theatre, books and video games in the UK - has several concerns, including: <br/>The WGGB has made a number or recommendations to help protect writers, including AI developers only using writers' work if they have been given express permission and AI developers being transparent about what data is being used to train their tools. <br/>WGGB deputy general secretary Lesley Gannon said, \"As with any new technology we need to weigh the risks against the benefits and ensure that the speed of development does not outpace or derail the protections that writers and the wider creative workforce rely upon to make a living. <br/>\"Regulation is clearly needed to safeguard workers' rights, and protect audiences from fraud and misinformation.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Susan Sarandon on the dangers of AI in film industry<br/>The rapid development of AI over the past year has led to the concept of ownership becoming convoluted. <br/>When someone inputs their likeness into an AI-generated portrait app such as DrawAnyone, DALL-E or even Snapchat - the resultant images are now in the public domain and free to use by anyone.<br/>The new image is not protected by copyright law.<br/>Dr Mathilde Pavis, a lawyer who specialises in digital cloning technologies, told the BBC that UK copyright laws need to change. <br/>\"It's strange to me that your face and your voice is less protected than your car, your laptop, your phone, your house or your books - but that's the state of the law today. <br/>\"And that's because we didn't think that we'd be so vulnerable, as vulnerable as we are in terms of being reused and imitated with AI technologies,\" she said. <br/>Additional reporting by Tom Gerken and Tom Singleton. <br/>Actors' strike to hit production of major films<br/>What happens next as Hollywood grinds to a halt<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

More than 125,000 applied for design, creative and performing arts courses.<br/>Subjects allied to medicine, social sciences, biological and sports sciences, and engineering and technology were all more popular than computing.<br/>However, the numbers applying for computer-related courses have risen every year since 2019, UCAS said. <br/>This year software engineering saw the steepest rise in applications, up 16% compared to last year. Computer science attracted 11% more applicants. There was a 2% rise in students applying to study computer games and animation, and 4% in artificial intelligence (AI).<br/>The increased interest in computing courses may in part be down to a growing public conversation around technology and artificial intelligence, Ms Marchant said.<br/>\"We know that changes in the world around us translate into increased demand for certain courses, as we saw for economics post-2008, and for medicine and nursing during the Covid-19 pandemic,\" she said.<br/>Chris Derrick, deputy headteacher at Kelvinside Academy in Glasgow said pupils applying for computing courses now were all \"digital natives\" who have \"honed and developed these skills from a young age using powerful tech every day\".<br/>\"Programming knowledge is also so accessible via YouTube and ChatGPT,\" he said. <br/>\"Pupils can explore their passions and learn at pace.

It, and similar AI products, are expected to dramatically change the way people get information they are searching for online.<br/>Tech rivals are racing to offer their own versions of the technology, even as it generates fierce debate, including over the data it uses, the accuracy of the responses and whether the company violated authors' rights as it was training the technology.<br/>The FTC's letter asks what steps OpenAI has taken to address its products' potential to \"generate statements about real individuals that are false, misleading, disparaging or harmful\".<br/>The FTC is also looking at OpenAI's approach to data privacy and how it obtains data to train and inform the AI.<br/>Mr Altman said OpenAI had spent years on safety research and months making ChatGPT \"safer and more aligned before releasing it\".<br/>\"We protect user privacy and design our systems to learn about the world, not private individuals,\" he said on Twitter.<br/>In another tweet he said that it was important to the firm that its \"technology is safe and pro-consumer, and we are confident we follow the law. Of course we will work with the FTC.\"<br/>Mr Altman appeared before a hearing at Congress earlier this year, in which he admitted that the technology could be a source of errors.<br/>He called for regulations to be created for the emerging industry and recommended that a new agency be formed to oversee AI safety. He added that he expected the technology to have a significant impact, including on jobs, as its uses become clear.<br/>\"I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong... we want to be vocal about that,\" Mr Altman said at the time. \"We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.\"<br/>The investigation by the FTC was first reported by the Washington Post, which published a copy of the letter.

The consumer watchdog has taken a high profile role policing the tech giants under its current chair, Lina Khan. <br/>Ms Khan rose to prominence as a Yale law student, when she criticised America's record on anti-monopoly enforcement related to Amazon. <br/>Appointed by President Joe Biden, she is a controversial figure, with critics arguing that she is pushing the FTC beyond the boundaries of its authority. <br/>Some of her most high-profile challenges of tech firms activities - including a push to block the merger of Microsoft with gaming giant Activision Blizzard - have faced setbacks in the courts.<br/>During a five-hour hearing in Congress on Thursday, she faced tough criticism from Republicans over her leadership of the agency.<br/>She did not mention the FTC's investigation into OpenAI, which is at a preliminary stage. But she said she had concerns about the product's output.<br/>\"We've heard about reports where people's sensitive information is showing up in response to an inquiry from somebody else,\" Ms Khan said. <br/>\"We've heard about libel, defamatory statements, flatly untrue things that are emerging. That's the type of fraud and deception that we are concerned about,\" she added.<br/>The FTC probe is not the company's first challenge over such issues.

But the imposition of a 28% GST on the full face value of a gaming transaction will mean the entire amount collected from players will now come under the ambit of taxation.<br/>According to industry estimates, total tax collection on player winnings will go beyond 50%, including GST, platform commissions and income taxeswhen the new law is implemented. <br/>In effect, for every $100 (\u00a376.8) spent by a player, there will be a \"sunk cost\" of $28 towards GST, in addition to a $5-15 charge by the gaming platform and a 30% tax deducted at source (TDS) on any winnings drawn.<br/>This will \"disincentivise players and is totally inconsistent with global standards\" where VAT or GST is levied at a median rate, and that too only on platform fees or commissions, said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, partner at corporate law firm Khaitan & Co.<br/>\"The move has completely blindsided the industry. It will shake investor confidence and lead to a funding winter,\" Mr Bhattacharjee added.<br/>The online gaming industry has seen a massive boom in India over the last five years, with an annual compounded growth rate of 28-30%. Driven by easy access to affordable smart phones and cheap mobile data, the sector attracted $2.5bn in foreign direct investment, including from the likes of Tiger Global. <br/>But these growth rates will now be called into question as the GST council's decision will impact startups at \"multiple levels\", including their user base, revenues as well as investor sentiment, according to Soham Thacker, Founder & of CEO of GamerJi - an eSports tournament company.<br/>\"Many gaming companies, in order to limit the impact on the investors side, may choose to relocate their business outside India,\" Mr Thacker added.<br/>\"They have killed the multibillion-dollar industry with a single stroke. And at the same time the decision could give a massive boost to illegal and illegitimate operators in the country,\" Gaurav Gaggar, Promoter of Poker High, a poker site, said.<br/>Terming the decision \"unconstitutional, irrational, and egregious\", the All India Gaming Federation said the government had ignored over 60 years of \"settled legal jurisprudence\" by lumping online skill gaming with gambling activities.<br/>Gambling, which is seen as a chance-based game, is illegal in many India states and is frowned upon. But most states have allowed online games which are seen as skill-based. <br/>The industry body expects hundreds of thousands of job losses in the online gaming sector because of the latest move.<br/>Gaming startups in India currently employ 50,000 people and were expecting to create another 350,000 direct and 1,000,000 indirect jobs by 2028.<br/>Many gaming companies the BBC spoke to said there was a lack of consistency behind the ruling.<br/>\"It is very unfortunate that when the government has been supporting the industry\u2026 such a legally untenable decision has been taken,\" Roland Landers, CEO of the All India Gaming Federation said in a statement. \"It will be catastrophic for the $1tn digital economy dream of the prime minister.\"<br/>Indian PM Narendra Modi has on more than one occasion praised the gaming industry as a sunrise sector that had the potential to create jobs and cater to the global market. <br/>\"This kind of extortionist tax regime flies in the face of these steps and advocacy needs to happen at multiple levels to retract this proposal,\" said Mr Bhattacharjee.<br/>He expects the gaming industry to unite and mount a strong legal challenge if the federal and state governments go ahead and enact the amendments into their tax laws.<br/>But India's revenue secretary called the move a \"unanimous\" decision that would not be reviewed or rolled back.<br/>Announcing the decision late on Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the GST council, which comprises of federal and state finance ministers, said \"no one wanted to kill an industry\".<br/>\"But they can't be encouraged to such an extent over essential goods and services,\" she said.  <br/>The 28% tax is a \"step in the right direction\", Siddhartha Iyer, a Supreme Court lawyer who has been fighting to ban online gaming told the BBC.<br/>Mr Iyer called gaming a \"speculative activity\".<br/>\"Every week there is a story of someone killing themselves because of this [debts incurred due to online gaming],\" he said.<br/>\"Here, under the GST regime, the government has taken the view that [these games] are gambling and that is correct in my opinion because you are putting a wager on the performance of something not in your control,\" Mr Iyer added. \"We tax alcohol and cigarettes because we want to discourage people from these activities, it should be the same for this [online gaming] as well.\"<br/>Others like Faisal Maqbool, a former gaming addict who lost close to 400,000 rupees ($5,000, \u00a33,750) while playing an online card game in 2022, say even stricter measures are needed.<br/>\"This is an addiction. And it has afflicted children and teenagers. Along with higher taxes, the government needed to put in restrictions on the basis of age, income etc. I vouch for a total ban on these activities,\" Mr Maqbool told the BBC.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

not for any content reason, but simply on the basis that 13-year-old boys are like each other and one of them has already been on that site\".<br/>Mr Tate, who is under house arrest in Romania, has been charged with rape, human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. <br/>The influencer, who has millions of followers online, denies all allegations against him.<br/>A self-proclaimed misogynist, numerous social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have banned him -

He said that though laying off staff had been a \"tough\" decision, it was \"necessary\".<br/>\"Given the state of economy, start-ups are prioritising 'profitability' over striving to become 'unicorns', and so are we,\" he wrote. Mr Shah added that customer support had been a struggle for the firm for a long time and that he was looking to fix this.<br/>He also wrote about how they built the bot and the AI platform in a short span of time so that all of Dukaan's customers could have their own AI assistant. He said that the bot was answering all kinds of queries with speed and accuracy.<br/>\"In the age of instant gratification, launching a business is not a distant dream anymore,\" he wrote. \"With the right idea, the right team, anyone can turn their entrepreneurial dreams into reality.\"<br/>Mr Shah also added that the firm was hiring for multiple roles.<br/>However, many users criticised his tweets and accused him of disrupting the lives of his staff with this \"heartless\" decision. <br/>\"As expected, didn't find any mention about the 90% staff that were laid off. What assistance were they provided?\" asked one user. <br/>\"Maybe it was the right decision for the business, but it shouldn't have turned into a celebratory/marketing thread about it,\" said another.<br/>Mr Shah responded to one tweet saying \"as expected, someone will get offended on behalf of someone else\" and added that he would post about assistance for his staff on LinkedIn, because on Twitter, people are in search of \"profitability and not sympathy\".<br/>In recent years, generative AI tools like ChatGPT have proliferated and become more accessible. There have been reports of organisations using these tools to increase productivity while cutting costs. This has made workers fearful about losing their jobs to technology.<br/>In March, Goldman Sachs published a report showing that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. In India, several firms are investing into AI to develop products and it has sparked concerns about job losses. <br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

These are interim payments for those in urgent need, which are then repaid monthly.<br/>It uses machine learning, a widely-used form of artificial intelligence (AI), to analyse historical benefits data to predict how likely a new claim is to be fraudulent or incorrect.<br/>Claims scored as risky are then referred to civil servants to investigate, with payments put on hold until the referral has been dealt with.<br/>In its annual accounts last week, the DWP disclosed plans to pilot \"similar\" models to review cases in four areas with high overpayment rates, including undeclared earnings from self-employment and incorrect housing costs. <br/>A date for the full deployment of the models has not been given by the department.<br/>The department says it continually monitors the algorithms to guard against the \"inherent risk\" of unintended bias, and says caseworkers are not told when cases have been flagged by the model.<br/>But campaign group Privacy International said it had \"ongoing concerns\" over a \"persistent lack of transparency\" over how it was being used.<br/>The group told the BBC the DWP had failed to provide \"substantive information\" about the tools it is using.<br/>It added that an outside body should be handed an oversight role, given the \"well-documented serious risks to fundamental rights\" from decisions informed by algorithms.<br/>Child Poverty Action Group said it was alarmed by plans for greater use of machine learning, adding \"key flaws\" in DWP's digitalisation approach had not yet been addressed.<br/>\"Expanding the technology while ignoring calls for transparency and rigorous monitoring of and protections against bias will risk serious harm to vulnerable families,\" added chief executive Alison Garnham.<br/>Gareth Davies, the boss of the National Audit Office, the UK's spending watchdog, has also urged the department to publish details of any potential bias in its machine learning tools to \"improve public confidence\" in the systems.<br/>In his statement on the accounts, he said the DWP had conceded that its ability to test for unfairness relating to protected characteristics - such as age, race and disability - was \"currently limited\".<br/>This was partly because claimants did not always respond to optional questions on their background, but also because certain information had been taken out of its systems for security reasons, he wrote.<br/>The department says it is taking steps to integrate the data in its systems soon, and has committed to reporting to MPs annually on how AI-powered tools are affecting different groups of claimants. <br/>It also argues it faces a \"challenge\" in balancing calls for more transparency with a desire not to \"tip off\" potential fraudsters by revealing too much information about how it identifies potential fraud.<br/>The department is expected to respond to the NAO's recommendations later in the year.<br/>Labour has also backed the use of AI to tackle fraud, with shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth saying it could help tackle criminals \"taking the taxpayer for a ride\".<br/>In a speech on Tuesday to the Social Market Foundation, he added that the department's use of the technology had yet to be \"properly scaled\". <br/>The party says it is committed to safeguards to prevent bias in the use of algorithms, although it is yet to set out detailed proposals.<br/>UK must be more open on use of AI, say campaigners<br/>Public sector urged to be open about algorithm use<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It will enable competition rather than allow entrenched market leaders to continue to dominate our rapidly growing industry,\" Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said after the ruling.<br/>In a message to staff shared by the company he added: \"We're optimistic that today's ruling signals a path to full regulatory approval elsewhere around the globe, and we stand ready to work with UK regulators to address any remaining concerns so our merger can quickly close.\"<br/>The decision in the US is not necessarily the end of the process. The FTC can appeal the ruling. It has also separately challenged the merger in a parallel process running in administrative court.<br/>\"We are disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services, and consoles,\" FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said. \"In the coming days we'll be announcing our next step to continue our fight to preserve competition and protect consumers.\"<br/>For more gaming content, go to Press X to Continue, the BBC Sounds gaming Podcast.<br/>Microsoft's $69bn Activision deal approved by EU<br/>Microsoft's Activision takeover blocked in UK<br/>US moves to block Microsoft's Activision takeover<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

When it announced the app's launch, the company said it would add a \"more robust search function\" along with improvements to the selection of recommended posts.<br/>Meanwhile the only way currently to fully delete a Threads profile is to delete the associated Instagram account, which many users would be reluctant to - another issue the company is looking to fix.<br/>When Threads was launched, Meta announced it planned to allow it to communicate with other social-media platforms, such as Mastodon, using something known as the fediverse.<br/>But this suggestion while welcomed by some, has met opposition.<br/>The idea of the fediverse is it is like email. Someone on Gmail can exchange emails with someone using Hotmail, for example, and the fediverse could be described as that idea applied to social media.<br/>At some point in the future Meta wants users to be able to use their Threads account to interact with other social-media platforms using ActivityPub - a protocol with the necessary programming code - such as Mastodon, WordPress or Reddit-alternative Lemmy.<br/>But some worry Threads threatens the idea of this system altogether, because of a practice big tech companies have utilised in the past - \"embrace, extend and extinguish\", when a company with a lot of resources extends what is possible from a new technology so drastically it becomes the new standard, leaving people with no choice but to use its platform.<br/>Mastodon chief executive Eugen Rochko dismissed these fears, saying Meta joining Threads was \"validation of the movement towards decentralised social media\" and \"a clear victory for our cause\".<br/>But concern among users has grown with over a hundred Mastodon communities joining what they call the \"fedipact\" - an agreement to block Meta from being able to access their community under any circumstances - so even when Threads does begin to support ActivityPub, users will not be able to access everything on the fediverse.<br/>One other feature coming to Threads at some point may also receive mixed reviews.

But now the real challenge - logging and preserving all of it - begins.<br/>You might recognise California-based Danny from his YouTube channel NoClip, which has produced making-of documentaries about top games including Final Fantasy, Rocket League, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us and God of War.<br/>His latest project began when a contact got in touch to tip him off about a media company in San Francisco sitting on a huge collection of tapes that he'd definitely want to see. <br/>It was about to throw them all out, but Danny had other ideas. <br/>So he rented a truck, and was soon driving boxes and boxes of tapes back to his studio. And that got him thinking. <br/>\"Sure enough, there were more and more of these collections that were just kind of sitting in these buildings, and were eventually going to end up in their own landfills or were just going to rot away.\"<br/>After contacting those others, Danny's now got stacks of cardboard containers stuffed with tapes of different shapes and sizes, including some super-rare professional formats. <br/>On each tape is a nugget of video game history from the late 90s up to about 2010 - and it's very unlikely that you'll have seen it before. <br/>\"A lot of this stuff was before YouTube,\" says Danny. \"So it was before any of us had high-speed internet. <br/>\"There's stuff like videotapes that were sent to video game websites or TV channels that were never meant to be shown.\"<br/>From just a few tapes pulled from a \"couple of random boxes\", he's already uncovered an interview with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima and a tour of Call of Duty studio Infinity Ward featuring two developers who were later fired and went on to launch multiplayer shooter Apex Legends. <br/>Since then he's found other gems. <br/>\"A couple of days ago, I found a tape that had 'Nintendo Tour' written on it,\" he says. <br/>When he loaded it up, he found footage of an employee-only museum inside Nintendo's old USA headquarters.<br/>\"It's like 30 minutes of this room that none of us have ever seen, and doesn't exist any more,\" he says.<br/>Danny and the NoClip team plan to go through all the tapes and digitise them, turning the footage into files that can be uploaded online.<br/>But to do that they've had to level up their equipment inventory, as some of the tech needed to actually play some of the specialist tapes is rare and pretty ancient by today's standards. <br/>\"Finding ones that work today is incredibly difficult,\" says Danny. \"They cost a lot of money to buy and then shipping them is a nightmare because they weigh a ton.\"<br/>It's a challenge for a crowdfunded company that relies on donations to keep going, but Danny says dealing with different machines, cables and monitors is \"tough work\", but worth it. <br/>\"When you get the tape in these things and see it looking as good as it does, you can't buy that feeling,\" he says.<br/>\"Hidden in that collection, I know is going to be some stuff that's really going to shock and excite the larger video game world. <br/>\"So I'm excited for those big moments.\"<br/>And Danny, who's originally from Waterford, Ireland, says he's \"equally excited\" about smaller moments and awakening people's memories.<br/>\"Somebody's going to stumble across one of these videos, and it's going to be an old game they loved or they used to play with their cousin that they forgot about, right? <br/>\"If that person has that moment, where they watch that video, and they send the YouTube link to their cousin and go, 'do you remember when we used to play this?' <br/>\"That's why we do it.\"<br/>NoClip's putting all the footage on a dedicated YouTube channel and internet library archive.org. <br/>It's available to anyone, and he hopes other creators, documentarians and historians will use it in their projects. <br/>\"We hope that people interact with this stuff,\" says Danny.<br/>\"We've already seen people starting their own Twitch streams, where they watch a bunch of the videos or make their own YouTube video essays using this footage. <br/>\"But to me having a living, breathing archive, it's like a museum, there's no point having a museum if people aren't walking around it and interacting with the history that's there. <br/>\"We want people to check out the videos, share the videos, make their own art out of these videos and try and breathe new life into them.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Is Kick really a threat to Twitch?<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>A gaming safe space with screams, jumps and scares<br/>Noclip<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Meta, which also owns Facebook, said the app had 10 million users within the first seven hours of launch and more than 30 million by Thursday morning.<br/>Around 24 hours later, that figure had more than doubled. <br/>It still has some way to go to catch its main rival though. At 100 million, Threads' user base stands at less than a third of the 350 million users that Twitter is believed to have.    <br/>Some Twitter users have become disenchanted since billionaire Elon Musk took over. Thousands of jobs have been cut under his ownership and he has announced a number of changes to help generate revenue at Twitter.<br/>Other rivals have emerged like Mastodon and Bluesky but have struggled without an existing user base. <br/>Threads has capitalised on being linked to Instagram which has more than one billion users.<br/>People who sign up to Threads will display a link to their profile in the app in their Instagram profile but there is an option to hide this.<br/>In order to sign up for Threads, users must have an Instagram account. <br/>It is not possible to delete your Threads profile without deleting the associated Instagram profile.  <br/>However, deactivating your Threads profile will not deactivate your Instagram account. <br/>Deactivation will mean your Threads profile, your posts and interactions with others' posts won't be visible, Meta says.<br/>Since Threads' launch, Twitter has threatened the rival with legal action. <br/>A lawyer for the company accused Mr Zuckerberg of \"systematic, wilful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property\" to create Threads. <br/>Twitter claimed that Meta had hired former employees who \"had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information\". Meta has denied this.<br/>Users on Threads can post text of up to 500 characters, more than the 280 characters available on Twitter.

Experts say it marks a necessary correction in the bull run of Indian start-ups.<br/>\"Byju's is a company that has grown too fast too soon,\" says Shriram Subramanian, who heads an independent corporate governance research and advisory firm.<br/>Founded in 2011, Byju's launched its learning app in 2015. With 15 million subscribers by 2018, the edtech firm became a unicorn (valued at $1bn) amid much fanfare.<br/>It expanded substantially during the Covid-19 pandemic as students turned to online classes during lockdowns. But in 2021, it posted a loss of $327m, which was 17 times more than the previous year.<br/>Since then, the edtech giant has witnessed an extraordinary unravelling. Valued at $22bn (\u00a317.28bn) last year, Byju's has seen its valuation slashed to $5.1bn this year by Prosus NV, the company's biggest investor and shareholder.<br/>The company did not respond to the BBC's queries.<br/>\"After the pandemic, when children returned to schools there was going to be a downturn,\" Mr Subramanian said. \"But Byju's kept on growing and investors kept on putting money into it. They did not see the signs that there could be a downturn.\"<br/>Aniruddha Malpani, an angel investor and vocal critic of Byju's business model, says the company had \"paper fortunes\". <br/>\"There's a big gap between value and valuation,\" he said.<br/>With exponential growth during the pandemic, Byju's went on an acquisition spree in 2021, spending $2bn to acquire edtech start-ups and firms like WhiteHat Jr, Aakash, Toppr, Epic, and Great Learning. <br/>It soon surpassed digital payments platform Paytm to become India's most-valued start-up.<br/>Byju's channelled hundreds of millions into its marketing, roping in Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and football star Lionel Messi as its brand ambassadors. It became the main sponsor of the Indian cricket team and an official sponsor of 2022 FIFA World Cup. <br/>But in recent months, the company has been dogged by complaints as parents accused it of not fulfilling its promises - coercing them into buying courses they couldn't afford and then not providing the promised services. Some also said that the firm used predatory practices to exploit customers. <br/>Former employees complained of high-pressure sales culture and unrealistic targets. The firm has laid off thousands of employees in the past year in a bid to cut costs.<br/>Byju's has denied the allegations made by parents and its former staff. It has also been facing investigations from the government. <br/>In April, the firm's office in Bengaluru was raided by Indian authorities over suspected violations of foreign exchange laws. The company denied any wrongdoing and assured its workers that it had fully complied with the laws. <br/>In May, lenders to the company filed a suit in a US court, accusing it of defaulting on payments and breaching terms of the loan agreement, including months-long delays in releasing financial statements. The lenders also accused the company of diverting funds through its US-based subsidiary Alpha, a claim Byju's denied.<br/>In June, after reportedly missing an interest payment of nearly $40m, Byju's sued the lenders over alleged harassment.<br/>It also began another round of layoffs, firing nearly a thousand employees. There was more trouble waiting for the firm from its own auditors. <br/>Deloitte Haskins and Sells Llp quit as the company's auditors citing the delay in Byju's submitting its financial statements. The auditors said it impacted their ability to assess the company's books. <br/>This was soon followed by news that three of its board members had resigned, leaving just CEO Byju Raveendran, his wife Divya Gokulnath and brother Riju Raveendran on the board.<br/>The start-up is reportedly now in talks to restructure its debt load.<br/>Reports also said that there were calls for the CEO's resignation at a shareholders' meeting this week, but two investors at the company denied these claims.<br/>\"Byju's failed at holding itself to the standard expected of a company its size,\" said K Ganesh, a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who founded one of India's largest online grocers, BigBasket.<br/>The delay in filing financial statements was \"unacceptable and unconscionable\", he says.<br/>\"Most sectors that benefited from the pandemic and expanded rapidly are now facing headwinds because the return to normal has been more drastic than they expected,\" Mr Ganesh said. \"This is true for all companies in the edtech sector.\"<br/>Experts say the sector's potential was overestimated during the pandemic.<br/>\"Technology by itself will never work,\" Dr Malpani explains. \"You need it along with safe space for children where there is adult supervision, peer to peer learning.\"<br/>\"Byju's was essentially selling hardware, like its tablets, with study material that could be found online for free,\" he says.<br/>These start-ups were valued at a \"stratospheric, unrealistic level\" during the pandemic and are being valued at \"realistic levels now,\" Mr Ganesh said.<br/>He added that one of the reasons Byju's is at its current crossroads is the \"detrimental\" board structure of venture capitalist-funded companies.<br/>\"With just managers, founders and investors on board - each of whom is bound to protect their own interests -  there is nobody to protect the interests of the company. This is unlike a public listed company where regulatory rules ensure a set of independent directors on board and insist on an audit committee headed by an independent director,\" Mr Ganesh explained.<br/>Several experts, including Mr Ganesh, have been advocating that start-ups that reach a certain level should be told to work like public listed firms. <br/>At the shareholders' meeting, the company is said to have agreed to form an advisory committee consisting of independent directors to advise and guide the CEO on the composition of the board and the governance structure <br/>Mr Ganesh and Mr Shriram said the company could still course correct if it acknowledges its missteps and commits to immediate action on all fronts.<br/>But Dr Malpani believes Byju's has not shown the intent to do this.<br/>\"They need to conserve as much cash as possible which will give them a long runway and cut down on costs aggressively, more than just through layoffs,\" says Mr Shriram. \"Also, sell off some businesses to raise capital.\"<br/>Byju's has set a timeline of September end for the completion of its 2022 audit and December end for its 2023 audit. <br/>Analysts believe Byju's current situation will only have a positive short-term impact on India's start-up ecosystem.<br/>\"Due diligence, founders' rights, the need for an internal auditor, independent board members and terms and conditions of corporate governance, which were earlier glossed over, will become stricter,\" Mr Ganesh said. <br/>\"India has good corporate governance laws,\" Mr Shriram said. \"It is for the investors and other stakeholders to demand more from Byju's.\"<br/>Analysts say investors are used to handling bull and bear runs and have short memories when it comes to these dips. <br/>\"There'll be another [like this] in two years,\" Dr Malpani says.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

He said the news feed and the reposting were \"incredibly familiar\".<br/>But US copyright law does not protect ideas, so for Twitter to be successful in court it would have to prove that its own intellectual property, such as programming code, was taken.<br/>And in 2012 Meta was granted a patent for \"communicating a newsfeed\" - the system that displays all the latest posts when you use Facebook.<br/>In a move first reported by news outlet Semafor, Twitter attorney Alex Spiro sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday accusing Meta of \"systematic, wilful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property\" to create Threads. <br/>Specifically, Mr Spiro alleged that Meta had hired dozens of former Twitter employees who \"had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information\" that ultimately helped Meta develop what he termed the \"copycat\" Threads app. <br/>\"Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,\" the letter says. <br/>\"Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice.\" <br/>BBC News, which has seen a copy of the letter, has contacted both Meta and Twitter for comment.<br/>Mr Musk said that \"competition is fine, cheating is not\" in response to a post on Twitter that referred to the legal letter.<br/>On Threads, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone posted that \"no one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee - that's just not a thing\". <br/>Sarah Kunst, managing director at venture capital firm Cleo Capital, told the BBC's Today programme Threads could offer a \"brand-safe environment\" for existing Instagram advertisers who \"feel they can allocate some budget and see what happens\".<br/>She added that while the app reaching 30 million users could be the result of an initial rush, it will likely see a steady increase in users.<br/>\"They've made it very easy to cross-post to other platforms like Instagram, so I think that we'll continue to see growth,\" she said.<br/>Both Mr Musk and Mr Zuckerberg have acknowledged the rivalry over Threads, which is linked to Instagram but works as a standalone app.<br/>As it launched in 100 countries, Mr Zuckerberg broke more than 11 years of silence on Twitter to post a highly popular meme of two nearly identical Spider-Man figures pointing at each other, indicating a stand-off.<br/>Shortly after, and as the word \"Threads\" trended globally on his platform, Mr Musk said: \"It is infinitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter, than indulge in the false happiness of hide-the-pain Instagram.\"<br/>Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a tweet on Thursday that while the platform, is \"often imitated\" it \"can never be duplicated\". <br/>Both Meta and Twitter have undertaken significant layoffs this year, with Meta announcing in April that it would cut staff levels by approximately 10,000. <br/>Twitter lost a large proportion of its 7,500 employees, as high as 80%, in waves of redundancies following Mr Musk's takeover last October.<br/>Can Threads make more money than Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter?<br/>'Almost every influencer will be hopping on Threads'<br/>30 million join Meta's Twitter rival - Zuckerberg<br/>Threads could cause real problems for Twitter<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

I already have an Instagram account so within three clicks I had a profile, and I selected to follow everybody I already follow on the photo-sharing app.<br/>Suddenly it was like I'd walked through the door to a great big house party.

(I've still got fewer than 300 on another Twitter alternative, the Jack Dorsey-founded text-based network, BlueSky, which I've been on for weeks.)<br/>If you're familiar with Twitter, you'll recognise the design of Threads instantly. Everything from the heart-shaped symbol to \"like\" a post, to the circle of arrows denoting the feature to repost, is the same.<br/>Some early complaints include the lack of a private messaging feature, no hashtags or trends to help navigate popular content, and no timeline curation options other than the ability to mute accounts or words, and block others.<br/>But I feel we should add the word \"yet\" - Threads is officially only a few hours old (although it is its second outing following an earlier version in 2019 that was discontinued. Perhaps the world wasn't yet ready, or sufficiently annoyed with the goings on at Twitter).<br/>What stands it apart from other Twitter rivals is the instant integration of this vast, ready-made Instagram community. Two billion people use the photo-sharing app and this offers an easy way for them all to land on another platform. <br/>This makes it instantly engaging, which will appeal hugely to advertisers, who I imagine will eventually fund it, although there will apparently be no ads for the first year.<br/>First impressions of Threads: can Meta do this? Is this not somehow plagiarism? <br/>The app looks almost identical to Twitter. The news feed, the reposting. It's all incredibly familiar. <br/>Mark Zuckerberg claims millions of people have signed up in the first few hours. You should always be sceptical when a tech boss says how many users have signed up to a platform. But it does feel like a lot of people are already on it.<br/>That's partly because it's connected to Instagram. Meta isn't creating an app from scratch. It's benefiting from its two billion Instagram followers that are giving it a massive shot in the arm. <br/>Platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon did not have this luxury. They started with zero users. <br/>But whether this is \"fair\" or not, Mr Zuckerberg doesn't care. He's copied other apps before to great success (Reels is a clone of TikTok) and he's happy to do so again.<br/>Knowing the power of celebrity, Mr Zuckerberg has also utilised famous names on Instagram and managed to get some of them on Threads, like Shakira and Gordon Ramsay. <br/>Mr Zuckerberg will be thrilled with the buzz around the app. When it comes to social media, it's all about the network effect. The more people use the app, the better the app is. <br/>When it comes to social media, the network effect can create a sort of tipping point. When so many of your friends or people you want to hear from are on a platform, you kind of feel you have to join. <br/>It's very, very hard to create a network effect on a social media platform. But when it works, it really works. The reverse is also true. When communities leave a social media platform, they can do so quickly - and it can be devastating. Think Myspace or Bebo. <br/>Let's go to some of the problems with Threads, though.<br/>Unlike Twitter, which has two feeds - a recommendations feed and an option just to see tweets from those you follow - Threads has just one feed that blends your followers and content it thinks you will want. That could get annoying. <br/>It doesn't seem to have desktop functionality yet - it doesn't work well on your computer. That's a shame. <br/>There doesn't seem to be any trending information, so it's hard to see what's going viral. <br/>And when it comes to verification, users can still buy their blue ticks for a monthly fee, just as you can with Twitter. <br/>Mark Zuckerberg described the app as an \"initial version\" - and that's what it feels like. It does the basics well. But this is a no-thrills app right now. <br/>That said, Meta's boss will be over the moon with how this has gone so far. Considering the bad press he's got over the years, he is reinventing himself as the adult in the room - the sensible tech billionaire who wants a friendly social media platform. <br/>You can tell this has riled Elon Musk. \"Thank goodness they're so sanely run,\" he tweeted sarcastically on Monday. <br/>But if Mr Zuckerberg was nervous that disaffected Twitter uses would spurn Meta's offer, so far, it looks like those fears were unfounded. <br/>And if that is the case, with an app that works perfectly well, if not spectacularly, that could be a real problem for Mr Musk.<br/>30 million join Meta's Twitter rival - Zuckerberg<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But Mr Rodriguez said Canada's move in theory would apply to all platforms under the parent company. <br/>The loss of government advertising is a drop in the bucket for Meta, whose annual revenue in 2022 was over $116bn. But Mr Rodriguez said Canada is determined to send a message that it will not be intimidated. <br/>He added he hopes it will inspire others, including Canadian companies, to do the same. Media firms Quebecor and Cogeco, both based in the province of Quebec, said they will also be pulling advertisements from Meta.<br/>In a statement to the BBC, Meta said that Bill C-18 \"is flawed legislation that ignores the realities of how our platforms work\".<br/>\"Publishers actively choose to post on Facebook and Instagram because it benefits them to do so,\" the company said. <br/>The federal government says the bill is necessary to allow struggling news organisations to \"secure fair compensation\" for news and links shared on the tech platforms.<br/>A similar law to Bill C-18 was passed in Australia in 2021 but it was tweaked after Meta briefly blocked users in the country from sharing or viewing news on its platform. <br/>The blackout ended when the amendments were made, and Google and Meta have since negotiated more than 30 deals with Australian media companies.<br/>On Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he believes Canada has become a global test case for laws like Bill C-18. <br/>\"This is what they want to do, make an example of us,\" said Mr Trudeau of tech giants like Meta. <br/>\"Facebook decided that Canada is a small enough country that they could reject our asks,\" he said. \"They made the wrong choice by deciding to attack Canada.\" <br/>Mr Rodriguez said Canada has been discussing its law with other countries looking to pass similar legislation, like the UK, Indonesia and Brazil. <br/>Canada has also seen support from some US senators and pundits. <br/>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times by columnist Brian Merchant on Wednesday said \"Canada must absolutely not give in to the tech giants' tantrum\".<br/>US Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is leading the push for a similar bill in Washington DC, has also spoken up in support of Canada's law. <br/>Meta has already begun restricting access to news to a small percentage of Canadians in tests and said it plans to implement a full blackout in the coming weeks. <br/>On Instagram, some users have reported seeing a message that reads \"In response to Canadian government legislation, news content can't be viewed in Canada\" when trying to view news content. <br/>Canada is going to war with Google, and it might not win<br/>Google to scrap local news in Canada over law<br/>Facebook and Instagram to block news in Canada<br/>Facebook reverses ban on news in Australia<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It is a \"very extreme and unprecedented tactic\" which is \"already failing\", said Dr Chowdhury.<br/>Twitter saw advertisers flee amid worries about Mr Musk's approach to content moderation rules, affecting its revenue. <br/>When Mr Musk spoke to the BBC in April, he said the company was now \"roughly breaking even\", claiming most of its advertisers were returning. <br/>The limit on tweets saw some journalists, who use Twitter to find information for live reporting and verification of stories, confronted with the curbs. <br/>Bel Trew, chief international correspondent for The Independent, tweeted that limits to how many tweets she could read on the platform had left her at a \"complete loss\" while reporting on Sunday.<br/>And a reporter in the US city of Baltimore was left unable to view tweets from the local police department's Twitter account in the wake of a shooting that left two people killed and a further 28 injured.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The vast majority of its revenue comes from advertising, just like Meta and Google.<br/>When users go onto the platform, they're served ads. The more time they spend on Twitter, the more ads they see. The equation is pretty simple. That's the business. <br/>However, Elon Musk has traditionally eschewed advertising. Tesla famously doesn't do ads.<br/>In 2019 he tweeted \"I hate advertising\".<br/>And yet he's bought a company that is totally reliant on it.<br/>So, Elon Musk is desperate to generate different revenue streams.<br/>This is not just a business decision. He believes that advertisers hold too much power over social media companies when it comes to moderation.<br/>Advertisers can, and have, pulled their money from Twitter.<br/>Advertisers don't want their ads placed next to racist or extremist content. And so Twitter's main revenue stream also has an influence over how much \"free speech\" is allowed on the platform.<br/>Mr Musk told me in April that \"most\" of the advertisers had returned after initially pausing their ads from Twitter after his takeover.<br/>However Mr Musk has another plan to turn Twitter into a profitable company.<br/>He wants Twitter to make money out of the vast amount of data it holds.<br/>Platforms like Twitter and Reddit hold a treasure trove of hundreds of billions of real human conversations - an incredible resource for AI companies.<br/>Large language models (LLMs), can learn from these interactions, and work out how to respond to questions in more human-like ways.<br/>But platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for the use of their data in this way.<br/>In April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing.<br/>\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" he said. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"<br/>At around the same time, Elon Musk said that Microsoft was \"ripping off the Twitter database, demonetizing it (removing ads) and then selling our data to others\".<br/>On Saturday it became clear how frustrated Mr Musk was getting.<br/>\"We were getting data pillaged\" he said.<br/>\"Almost every company doing AI, from start-ups to some of the biggest corporations on Earth, was scraping vast amounts of data,\" he said.<br/>And so, by restricting usage, Elon Musk is hoping to prevent its data from being pulled into LLMs. He wants to negotiate with AI companies and get paid for the content that they take.<br/>But there could be other factors at play too, and it goes back to another one of his attempts to decrease Twitter's reliance on advertising revenue.<br/>Mr Musk is desperate for people to pay for Twitter.<br/>For months, he's been trying to push people towards Twitter Blue. There's been some carrot, giving Twitter Blue members a blue tick and verification, and some stick - removing verification from users that don't pay.<br/>But Twitter Blue has not been what Elon Musk had hoped. People aren't paying up in their droves.<br/>Perhaps he's looking at another way to get users to open their wallets. In future, if want access to unlimited tweets, perhaps you'll have to pay a monthly fee?<br/>Whatever Mr Musk is thinking, one thing is clear though. Restricting tweets is not good for advertisers.<br/>The limits are \"remarkably bad\" for users and advertisers already shaken by the \"chaos\" at Twitter, Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester, told Reuters.<br/>This is perhaps the most perplexing part of Elon Musk's restrictions. He has recently hired Linda Yaccarino to be Twitter's chief executive. She's a former advertising executive.<br/>She reportedly has grandiose ideas for how Twitter can make more money - including full-screen video ads and trying to convince more celebrities to use the app.<br/>Her job is made far harder by having restricted tweets. Fewer eyeballs on posts means advertisers will be less interested in spending money.<br/>And then there's Meta.<br/>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly launching a Twitter clone, called Threads, at some point this summer. The chances that there will be restrictions on its feed, on how many posts you can read, are zero. That is not the Meta way.<br/>Elon Musk is an extraordinarily successful businessman, and he has a genuine gripe when it comes to AI companies ripping off its data.

Several free speech experts hailed it as a significant lawsuit. <br/>It was the first instance of a social media company suing the government over its content takedown orders, often criticised for being arbitrary and opaque.<br/>Last week the Karnataka High Court dismissed Twitter's case and imposed a fine of 5m rupees ($61,000; \u00a348,000) on the company for not complying with the contested orders for over a year. Twitter has more than 24 million users in India, by one estimate.<br/>The verdict has left many digital rights experts worried. <br/>\"The judgement reposes untrammelled power in the state to issue blocking orders that bypass procedural safeguards,\" said Radhika Roy, a lawyer and spokesperson for digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation.<br/>She added that the court could have countered \"the rampant misuse\" of law to take down unfavourable content on the internet, rather it has ended up legitimising it.<br/>Commentators are apprehensive about Twitter's next move. Will the social media giant comply with the take down orders or appeal the judgement?<br/>The case was filed by Twitter under its previous leadership. Under new owner Elon Musk, the company has complied with takedown orders.<br/>After a recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US, Mr Musk said that the company has no choice \"but to obey local government laws\" or it risks getting shut.<br/>The recent judgement raises concerns about free speech since the government has been accused of increasing its censorship of online content in recent years. Federal minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has said that all foreign Internet platforms had to comply with Indian laws.<br/>In 2022, India blocked 3,417 Twitter URLs, while only eight Twitter URLs had been blocked in 2014.<br/>Twitter's case was that 39 orders of the federal government to block access to accounts and tweets went against the law - India's information technology law allows the government to block online content that \"threatens the security of the state\" and public order among other things.<br/>It said that the government does not have the power to block accounts, but only specific tweets. <br/>Further, it said that the orders had not been properly reasoned and that the grounds required for taking down content had not been made out by the government. <br/>Also, users whose accounts and tweets were being blocked had not been informed by the government.<br/>The government argued that the orders were legal. It said that the contested content was posted by \"anti-India campaigners\" and that if such users were informed about the action being taken against them, they may choose to tweet anonymously and cause more harm. <br/>Therefore, it was appropriate that only Twitter was informed about these orders, the government said.<br/>Since the law requires these orders to be confidential, it is not clear which accounts and tweets were challenged. <br/>However, one instance cited in the judgement reveals that at least one account had posted tweets related to the farmer's protest in 2021 against new farm laws brought by the government.<br/>The court has now said that the government has the power to block not just tweets, but entire accounts as well. <br/>These orders could extend indefinitely. It also added that when the government is blocking content, the user does not necessarily have to be informed.<br/>Under the law, users or the company hosting the information - such as Twitter - have to be given a notice and a chance to be heard in court before a blocking order is passed. <br/>In cases of emergency, the government can immediately block a website and give notice later.<br/>The orders also need to have details in writing about why a website needed to be blocked. Twitter argued that this was missing in the orders the government had passed.<br/>However, the court looked at the tweets and accounts in contention and found that they had \"outrageous\", \"treacherous and anti-national\" content which could threaten national security and public order. It said that these details had been shared with Twitter.<br/>Further, the court accepted the government's arguments that detailed reasons had been shared with Twitter in review meetings that had taken place before the blocking order was passed. <br/>The court also said that giving notice to users was discretionary. The users in question \"comprised of terrorists\" and \"foreign adversaries who intend to discredit and destabilise India and jeopardise national security on communal lines\". <br/>Thus, it accepted the government's argument that it was \"not desirable\" to issue notice to such \"anti-India\" campaigners.<br/>Experts say that this judgment limits users' ability to defend their right to free speech. <br/>Users \"won't be given a chance to defend themselves before a blocking order is passed\" said Sachin Dhawan, a programme manager at digital rights research body Centre for Communication Governance. <br/>\"Even after an order is passed, they will be left in the dark about why their content has been blocked\" he added.<br/>As a result, \"a process which was already shrouded in secrecy will become even more opaque,\" he said. Mr Dhawan added that this undermined \"basic due processes\" such as giving a \"notice and a hearing\" to an aggrieved party.<br/>However, another significant case pending before the Delhi High Court may lead to a different outcome.<br/>It relates to a satirical dowry calculator website being blocked by the government without the website's founder being given a notice.<br/>In May last year, the High Court directed the government to provide the founder a copy of the order and give him a hearing, during which the ban was upheld. The court is now hearing whether the website can be blocked.<br/>The court's order to provide a copy to the founder \"inspires hope\", Ms Roy from Internet Freedom Foundation said. However, the final verdict is yet to be decided.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Meanwhile, accounts with \"verified\" status are currently limited to 10,000 posts a day.<br/>The tech billionaire initially set stricter limits, but he changed these within hours of announcing the move.<br/>Mr Musk said the temporary limits were to address \"extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation\".<br/>He did not explain what was meant by system manipulation in this context.<br/>\"We were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users,\" Mr Musk explained on Friday, after users were presented with screens asking them to log in to view Twitter content. <br/>The move was described as a \"temporary emergency measure\".<br/>It is not totally clear what Mr Musk is referring to by data scraping, but it appears he means the scraping of large amounts of data used by artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train large language models, which power chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.<br/>In simple terms, data scraping is the pulling of information from the internet. Large language models need to learn from masses of real human conversations. But the quality is vital to the success of a chatbot. Reddit and Twitter's huge trove of billions of posts are thought to be hugely important training data - and used by AI companies.<br/>But platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for this data. <br/>In April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing.<br/>\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" he said. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"<br/>Twitter has already started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which is often used by third party apps and researchers - which can include AI companies.<br/>There are other potential reasons for the move too.<br/>Mr Musk has been pushing people towards Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. It's possible he is looking at a model where users will have to pay to get a full Twitter service - and access to unlimited posts.<br/>Signalled by a blue tick, \"verified\" status was given for free by Twitter to high-profile accounts before Mr Musk took over as its boss. Now, most users have to pay a subscription fee from $8 (\u00a36.30) per month to be verified, and can gain the status regardless of their profile.<br/>According to the website Downdetector - which tracks online outages - a peak of 5,126 people reported problems accessing the platform in the UK at 16:12 BST on Saturday.<br/>In the US, roughly 7,461 people reported glitches around the same time. <br/>Initially, Mr Musk announced reading limits of 6,000 posts per day for verified accounts, 600 for unverified accounts, and 300 for new unverified accounts.<br/>In another update Mr Musk said \"several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively\". <br/>He later indicated there had been a burden on his website, saying it was \"rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis\".  <br/>A server is a powerful computer that manages and stores files, providing services such as web pages for users.<br/>Adam Leon Smith from BCS, the UK's professional body for IT, said the move was \"very odd\" as limiting users' scroll time would affect the company's advertising revenue.<br/>Mr Musk bought the company last year for $44bn (\u00a335bn) after much back and forth. He was critical of Twitter's previous management and said he did not want the platform to become an echo chamber.<br/>Soon after taking over, he cut the workforce from just under 8,000 staff to about 1,500.<br/>In an interview with the BBC, he said that cutting the workforce had not been easy.<br/>Engineers were included in the layoffs and their exit raised concerns about the platform's stability.<br/>But while Mr Musk acknowledged some glitches, he told the BBC in April that outages had not lasted very long and the site was working fine.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Elon Musk's unexpected BBC interview... in 90 seconds<br/>Twitter restores blue tick to high profile accounts<br/>Musk on layoffs, misinfo and sleeping in the office<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

She said there needed to be more consideration of the risks that come with forcing websites to verify the age of their users.<br/>\"Some of these systems use facial scanning techniques to identify people's age. The processing of the collection of large pools of children's biometric data by private companies, with no governance structures in place, is something that all parents should be very worried about.<br/>\"We don't know how these systems work. Is our data being stored? Who has access to it? If so, are they processing it?\" she said. <br/>The bill will give the communications regulator Ofcom powers to fine tech companies, block access to sites and also see the introduction of criminal liabilities for executives of companies who fail to co-operate.<br/>Iain Corby from the Age Verification Providers Association said he welcomed the bill's requirements but \"with five million adult websites, the government still needs to give the regulator better powers to enforce at scale before the bill is finalised\".<br/>Concerns have also been raised that the requirement for users to provide official documentation could lead to discrimination against certain socio-economic groups, who are more likely to lack these documents.<br/>Mr Scully rejected criticism that the legislation could mean vital sexual health education content could be blocked.<br/>\"I want to reassure people working in those areas that they won't be harmed by this bill,\" he said. <br/>Mr Scully added it would be up to Ofcom to decide on the guidelines in determining \"what is and what isn't available for under-18s\".<br/>Children are being exposed to online pornography from as young as nine, according to research. By the age of 13, around 50% had been exposed to it.<br/>Some teenagers simply lie about their date of birth to get round age restrictions on websites.<br/>Mr Scully said the amendments would \"stop the majority of children - who don't look for VPN or don't look for other ways around this - just to be able to almost trip over access to pornography, which is the case at the moment\".<br/>The UK has been grappling over how to protect social media users, and in particular children, from harmful content without damaging free speech.<br/>New measures will also seek to hold top executives personally responsible for keeping children safe on their platforms, the government said, after agreeing to toughen the bill in January with the prospect of jail time for tech bosses.<br/>Other changes to the bill will allow regulators to obtain information on a child's social media use if requested by a coroner, which will help bereaved families understand any possible influence of online activity in their death.<br/>The tech industry, including firms like Apple, have criticised sections of the Online Safety Bill, particularly provisions that could be used to make messaging services break end-to-end encryption in order to scan for child abuse material.<br/>The government said there would be no further amendments to that part of the bill before it is voted on. <br/>The bill, which is possibly months away from being passed, will be voted on next week in the House of Lords.<br/>Wikipedia refuses Online Safety Bill age checks<br/>WhatsApp and messaging apps against 'surveillance'<br/>WhatsApp: Rather be blocked than weaken security<br/>Can age verification stop children seeing porn?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

That legislation passed two years ago, but Australian lawmakers made changes after Meta briefly blocked users in the country from sharing or viewing news on its platforms. <br/>The blackout ended when the amendments were made, and Google and Meta have since negotiated more than 30 deals with Australian media companies.<br/>Google had previously called the Canadian law \"unworkable\" in its current form and proposed amendments. Both Google and Meta have held talks with the government about the legislation. <br/>But in response, the Canadian government has said the legislation will help provide fair compensation to struggling news outlets and has argued it is necessary \"to enhance fairness in the Canadian digital news market\".<br/>Speaking to CTV News on Thursday afternoon, the minister responsible for the file, Pablo Rodriguez, said he was surprised by Google's move, noting they had had \"conversations as recent as this morning\".<br/>The Canadian parliament's independent budget watchdog found news organisations could receive as much as C$329m ($248m; \u00a3196m) per year from digital platforms.<br/>But many of the same media associations and outlets that championed the bill may now face a threat to their businesses, as Google fuels a significant portion of web traffic to Canadian news outlets.<br/>At the Globe and Mail, for instance, Google accounts for 30% of the traffic, publisher Phillip Crawley told parliament last month.

If the two sides cannot reach a deal, the country's broadcast regulator can force them into arbitration.<br/>An independent parliamentary budget watchdog has estimated that measure could generate more than C$300m (\u00a3180m; $226m) in total annually - or funding for roughly 30% of a typical newsroom's operations. <br/>But instead of a windfall, La Presse - and every other Canadian news organisation - is now facing a potential blackout, as the tech giants pledge to block links to news articles on their platforms rather than comply.<br/>Meta, which had opposed the proposal from the start, said it would start blocking news sites for Canadian users over the next few months.<br/>Google has struck payment agreements with news providers in Europe, Australia and elsewhere and had appeared willing to negotiate. <br/>But this week it called Canada's current law \"unworkable\" and said it would remove links to Canadian news from its search, news and discover products in the country once the act goes into effect in six months. <br/>It says it currently has agreements with more than 150 Canadian news organisations, and estimated its traffic helped news websites earn C$250m a year.<br/>\"We're willing to do more,\" the company said, referring to payments. \"We just can't do it in a way that breaks the way that the web and search engines are designed to work, and that creates untenable product and financial uncertainty.\" <br/>Before the law was passed this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dismissed the threats from the tech firms to pull news. <br/>\"The fact that these internet giants would rather cut off Canadians' access to local news than pay their fair share is a real problem, and now they're resorting to bullying tactics to try and get their way. It's not going to work,\" he said earlier in June.<br/>Tech industry organisations have compared the effort to a \"shakedown\", but Mr Levasseur says no one in media is looking for a handout.<br/>\"We're asking to have an opportunity to negotiate a fair commercial agreement,\" he says. \"The only reason that they haven't done it is because they're monopolies.\" <br/>How the dispute gets resolved could prove a pivotal moment in a wider fight, as countries around the world, including Indonesia, South Africa, India, the UK and the US consider similar measures. <br/>The sums under discussion amount to a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the tens of billions of dollars made by the tech giants each year - but could prove a lifeline for journalism, says Courtney Radsch, director of the Center for Journalism and Liberty at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think-tank.<br/>\"There is an increasing consensus around the world that Google and Facebook ... should pay for the news that they use,\" she says. \"People realise that there is a need to protect journalism as a fundamental pillar of democracy.\"<br/>Canada modelled its rule on a measure that Australia passed in 2021. That law sparked similar objections, prompting Meta to impose a brief news blackout.<br/>But after some changes to the bill the two companies ended up negotiating more than 30 deals with publishers worth more than $130m (A$200m), according to economist Rodney Sims, who led Australia's competition agency, which developed the law.<br/>He says he expects the companies to behave similarly this time - even though at Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been pushing the platform away from news in favour of more personal content.  <br/>\"Facebook just hates the whole thing,\" he conceded. But \"you can't have effective search with no news and I think Facebook is going to find ... that it is very hard for them to give you your feed without any news,\" he says. <br/>\"It's what makes their service complete.\"<br/>But others are warning that how the fight plays out in Canada could be different. <br/>Phillip Crawley, chief executive of the Globe and Mail, which has licensing deals in place with Google, Meta, Apple and others, pointed to broader changes in search that are under way, such as the rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, which generate answers, not a list of links, in response to user questions.<br/>With more countries considering such measures, the companies also have bigger incentive to fight, he says. <br/>\"The world is in a different place,\" says Mr Crawley, who spoke in support of the bill, while raising concerns that certain powers granted Canada's broadcast regulator could threaten the independence of the press. <br/>\"So I don't think the model in Australia is one that that we should be guided by too much. That was then. This is now.\"<br/>Google and Meta say that Canada's law differs from Australia's in key ways. Notably, in Australia, companies could satisfy regulators without doing deals with everyone. In Canada, there's no such out. It also regulates more types of content.<br/>Google says it tried - with little effect - to raise its concerns about the bill with the government before it passed. Though the government came back to the bargaining table after the law passed, those \"overtime\" discussions were too late to fix the problems, a source at the company told the BBC.<br/>Michael Geist, a Canadian tech legal scholar and noted critic of the bill, says the government has miscalculated given the shifts in Meta's business. <br/>The company has said the proportion of adults using Facebook for news fell by about a third between 2016-2022, from 45% to 30%, and its surveys of users show they want to see less news on the platform. <br/>\"Why did the government not read the room?\" Mr Geist said. \"Facebook is not bluffing - they would like to get out of news.\"<br/>Google has said it will continue to participate in the regulatory process, which could take months to resolve and leaves many newsrooms facing more turmoil. <br/>At the Globe and Mail, which now gets two-thirds of its revenue from subscriptions, Google accounts for 30% of the traffic, Mr Crawley told parliament last month. <br/>For Le Devoir, a major French-language publication, Google drives 40% of its traffic and nearly 30% comes from social media.<br/>Meta has already moved to cancel the deals it has in place with publishers in Canada - which can be worth millions of dollars, according to reports - as well as a funding it had provided to a fellowship programme. <br/>Mr Levasseur conceded that a blackout would have an impact at La Presse, which is profitable and funded largely by advertising and reader donations. But he said he believed the publication, which reaches roughly 1.4 million readers each day, would adjust, as it has to the other upheavals in the news business that tech giants have unleashed.<br/>\"When we put an end to the [print] paper, advertising revenue was decreasing. Now it's increasing,\" he says. \"We were able to adjust then and I'm sure we'll be able to adjust in the future.\"<br/>Google to scrap local news in Canada over law<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But is that about to change?<br/>Rival Kick has been grabbing headlines after it poached Amouranth and xQc - two of the biggest names on the Amazon-owned platform.<br/>Those high-profile converts have inspired other smaller streamers to follow them, helped by the promise of a larger revenue cut.<br/>But not everyone is sold and opinions are mixed on the new contender.<br/>It's fair to say Twitch has had a tough time recently - some streamers quit in protest against plans for stricter advertising rules, forcing it to abandon them. <br/>And then Amouranth and xQc went Kick in the space of 48 hours. <br/>It's reported that xQc was tempted over with a deal worth about $100m (\u00a378m), although he's been broadcasting on both platforms since.<br/>If you jump on Kick, which launched officially in January this year, you'll notice it looks quite similar to Twitch.<br/>There's the usual rolling page of livestreams which you can filter by category or game title.<br/>And there's a chat, where fans can talk to each other and the person streaming, with options to subscribe or tip the creator.<br/>Payment's one of the big differences - and big attractions - of Kick.<br/>At the moment, it's letting all content creators keep 95% of their subscription revenue, compared with Twitch's 50% and YouTube's 70%.<br/>For streamers like Dean, also known as AverageDad, that makes switching a no-brainer. <br/>\"Why would you not want to make twice as much as you would do on another platform?\" he says.<br/>Dean, from Greater Manchester, left Twitch earlier this month and now streams on various platforms including Kick, which he says will give Twitch \"a good old fight\".<br/>\"At the end of the day, content creators want to earn revenue every which way possible,\" he says.<br/>Another big difference between the two is Kick's more relaxed content policy.<br/>And its gambling streams, which feature prominently on the platform and regularly appear in its top three categories, have been a talking point.<br/>Kick was co-founded by Ed Craven, the billionaire owner of crypto and betting site Stake.com, which sponsors Alfa Romeo's F1 team and Everton FC. <br/>Stake.com was among the accounts banned during a recent gambling crackdown on Twitch.<br/>And some streamers, including hugely popular Pokimane, have said Kick's gambling links put them off. <br/>She told her 9.3m followers moving there would compromise her morals.<br/>But Dean dismisses much of the criticism as a \"smear campaign\" because there are still some gambling streams on Twitch, such as slots and roulette streams from companies officially licensed to run them.<br/>Some streamers have also described Kick as a much more toxic place, particularly for LGBT streamers and people of colour.<br/>They say there are fewer options for dealing with harassment and abuse.<br/>Nic from Leeds, otherwise known as NicScreams, says streaming on Kick wouldn't feel safe for her or her community of followers. <br/>She's also concerned about some big signings, such as Adin Ross, who was banned from Twitch.<br/>\"He's quite openly homophobic. He's openly misogynistic,\" says Nic.<br/>\"There are videos of him abusing random women on the internet because of their appearance, and nothing happens. <br/>\"He's still streaming and he's still making money on Kick.\"<br/>BBC Newsbeat's asked Kick for a comment and is waiting for a response.<br/>It's fair to point out the platform isn't a content free-for-all - it does have rules against drug use and discrimination.<br/>And xQc already got in trouble for copyright infringement when he streamed Batman film The Dark Knight on his channel.<br/>But Nic says she feels that Twitch does more to combat hate speech.<br/>\"If there's something going down in my stream that I don't like or my community doesn't like, I know that Twitch will look out for me,\" she says.<br/>Nic admits, though, that it's become more difficult to make money on Twitch, and she's gone from streaming full-time to part-time.<br/>Although it backed down on proposals to restrict its advertising options, it's still going ahead with another unpopular measure.<br/>It's banning simulcasting, where streamers go live on multiple different platforms at the same time- something many do to boost their income.<br/>\"Financially, it's terrible to stream on Twitch,\" says Nic.<br/>\"You work really hard to turn this into a career or a side hustle, and it feels like Twitch are very quick to take that away.\" <br/>So will Kick be a success? <br/>Lots of people have pointed out similarities to Mixer - a short-lived Twitch competitor launched by Microsoft.<br/>It made headlines by signing up popular Fortnite streamer Ninja in a deal worth $50m (\u00a339m), but was shut down just a year later. <br/>So far, perhaps not surprisingly, Amouranth and xQc's Kick follower numbers are nowhere near their Twitch levels.<br/>But Dean is convinced Kick will be different.<br/>\"I think the conversation is going to be more about Kick in five years than Twitch,\" he says.<br/>Kick's suggested more big names like xQc will be joining, and Dean thinks that can only help streamers like him. <br/>\"When xQc stops streaming, all of his viewers don't just go, 'I'm not going to watch any more',\" he says.<br/>\"They'll hang out for a little bit, maybe look at some different streams, which is going to allow that platform to constantly evolve and constantly move forward.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>How Zelda is helping fans with their mental health<br/>Has Diablo IV completed its quest for inclusivity?<br/>Why is Reddit full of pictures of John Oliver?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

If you want data for four people it costs a lot and I was always overdrawn,\" she said.<br/>\"There were times when I was literally crying because it was a struggle, especially when your doctor says fill in the form online.<br/>\"You need that data. It's vital. I have days when I can't go out and I need to do shopping online. How do you get by if you can't access the internet?

However, it is incredibly difficult for me to be able to do this and it does cross my mind whether I can carry on doing it,\" she said. <br/>\"These kinds of barriers don't need to be there because we've got the technology - it's just we're not legally allowed to use it for public meetings.\"<br/>The LGA surveyed around a third of local authorities in England and found 95% of these wanted the power to be able to reintroduce virtual or hybrid meetings. No council wanted to hold fully virtual meetings but the overwhelming majority wanted hybrid options for councillors who needed them. <br/>Previous LGA research also found when hybrid meetings took place during the pandemic, public attendance increased.  <br/>Joe Harris, vice-chairman of the LGA, said: \"Good decision-making needs people who reflect the range of experiences, background and insight that exist in their communities.  <br/>\"However, councillors are restricted by law to attend council meetings in person, which can deter a range of people including full time professionals, parents of young children, carers, workers and disabled people from stepping forward to represent their communities.\"<br/>A consultation on remote council meetings closed in June 2021, with a government response expected shortly. <br/>A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesman said: \"While remote meetings gave councils the necessary flexibility to support businesses and communities during the Covid-19 pandemic, we believe physical attendance at meetings remains important, not just to build strong working relationships but to deliver good governance and democratic accountability. <br/>\"It is right that councillors regularly meet and debate in person so that communities can hold their council to account.\"<br/>Jackie Weaver: Don't stop virtual council meetings<br/>Jackie Weaver and the new era for council meetings<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

She contacted the BBC via children's charity the NSPCC in order to highlight her findings.<br/>\"Since AI-generated images became possible, there has been this huge flood\u2026 it's not just very young girls, they're [paedophiles] talking about toddlers,\" she said. <br/>A \"pseudo image\" generated by a computer which depicts child sexual abuse is treated the same as a real image and is illegal to possess, publish or transfer in the UK.<br/>The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead on child safeguarding, Ian Critchley, said it would be wrong to argue that because no real children were depicted in such \"synthetic\" images - that no-one was harmed.<br/>He warned that a paedophile could, \"move along that scale of offending from thought, to synthetic, to actually the abuse of a live child\".<br/>Abuse images are being shared via a three-stage process:<br/>Some of the image creators are posting on a popular Japanese social media platform called Pixiv, which is mainly used by artists sharing manga and anime. <br/>But because the site is hosted in Japan, where sharing sexualised cartoons and drawings of children is not illegal, the creators use it to promote their work in groups and via hashtags - which indexes topics using key words. <br/>A spokesman for Pixiv said it placed immense emphasis on addressing this issue. It said on 31 May it had banned all photo-realistic depictions of sexual content involving minors.<br/>The company said it had proactively strengthened its monitoring systems and was allocating substantial resources to counteract problems related to developments in AI.<br/>Ms Sheepshanks told the BBC her research suggested users appeared to be making child abuse images on an industrial scale.<br/>\"The volume is just huge, so people [creators] will say 'we aim to do at least 1,000 images a month,'\" she said.<br/>Comments by users on individual images in Pixiv make it clear they have a sexual interest in children, with some users even offering to provide images and videos of abuse that were not AI-generated. <br/>Ms Sheepshanks has been monitoring some of the groups on the platform. <br/>\"Within those groups, which will have 100 members, people will be sharing, 'Oh here's a link to real stuff,'\" she says. <br/>Many of the accounts on Pixiv include links in their biographies directing people to what they call  their \"uncensored content\" on the US-based content sharing site Patreon. <br/>Patreon is valued at approximately $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) and claims to have more than 250,000 creators - most of them legitimate accounts belonging to well-known celebrities, journalists and writers. <br/>Fans can support creators by taking out monthly subscriptions to access blogs, podcasts, videos and images - paying as little as $3.85 (\u00a33) per month.<br/>But our investigation with Octavia Sheepshanks found Patreon accounts offering AI-generated, photo-realistic obscene images of children for sale, with different levels of pricing depending on the type of material requested.<br/>One wrote on his account: \"I train my girls on my PC,\" adding that they show \"submission\". For $8.30 (\u00a36.50) per month, another user offered \"exclusive uncensored art\".<br/>The BBC sent Patreon one example, which the platform confirmed was \"semi realistic and violates our policies\". It said the account was immediately removed.<br/>Patreon said it had a \"zero-tolerance\" policy, insisting: \"Creators cannot fund content dedicated to sexual themes involving minors.\"<br/>The company said the increase in AI-generated harmful content on the internet was \"real and distressing\", adding that it had \"identified and removed increasing amounts\" of this material.<br/>\"We already ban AI-generated synthetic child exploitation material,\" it said, describing itself as \"very proactive\", with dedicated teams, technology and partnerships to \"keep teens safe\".   <br/>AI image generator Stable Diffusion was created as a global collaboration between academics and a number of companies, led by UK company Stability AI.<br/>Several versions have been released, with restrictions written into the code that control the kind of content that can be made.<br/>But last year, an earlier \"open source\" version was released to the public which allowed users to remove any filters and train it to produce any image - including illegal ones.<br/>Stability AI told the BBC it \"prohibits any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes across our platforms, and our policies are clear that this includes CSAM (child sexual abuse material). <br/>\"We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes\".<br/>As AI continues developing rapidly, questions have been raised about the future risks it could pose to people's privacy, their human rights or their safety.<br/>Jo [full name withheld for security reasons], GCHQ's Counter Child Sexual Abuse (CCSA) Mission Lead, told the BBC: \"GCHQ supports law enforcement to stay ahead of emerging threats such as AI-generated content and ensure there is no safe space for offenders.\" <br/>The NPCC's Ian Critchley said he was also concerned that the flood of realistic AI or \"synthetic\" images could slow down the process of identifying real victims of abuse.<br/>He explains: \"It creates additional demand, in terms of policing and law enforcement to identify where an actual child, wherever it is in the world, is being abused as opposed to an artificial or synthetic child.\"<br/>Mr Critchley said he believed it was a pivotal moment for society.<br/>\"We can ensure that the internet and tech allows the fantastic opportunities it creates for young people - or it can become a much more harmful place,\" he said.<br/>Children's charity the NSPCC called on Wednesday for tech companies to take notice. <br/>\"The speed with which these emerging technologies have been co-opted by abusers is breath-taking but not surprising, as companies who were warned of the dangers have sat on their hands while mouthing empty platitudes about safety,\" said Anna Edmundson, the charity's head of policy and public affairs.<br/>\"Tech companies now know how their products are being used to facilitate child sexual abuse and there can be no more excuses for inaction.\"<br/>A spokesman for the government responded: \"The Online Safety Bill will require companies to take proactive action in tackling all forms of online child sexual abuse including grooming, live-streaming, child sexual abuse material and prohibited images of children - or face huge fines.\"<br/>App to block child abuse images gets \u00a31.8m EU cash<br/>Child abuse images found on VR headsets, data shows<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The Online Safety Bill poses a serious threat to this protection, and could put UK citizens at greater risk.<br/>\"Apple urges the government to amend the bill to protect strong end-to-end encryption for the benefit of all.\"<br/>But the government told the BBC that \"companies should only implement end-to-end encryption if they can simultaneously prevent abhorrent child sexual abuse on their platforms.<br/>\"We will continue to work with them to seek solutions to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material while maintaining user privacy.\" <br/>The Online Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament, contains powers that could enable communications regulator Ofcom to direct platforms to use accredited technology to scan the contents of messages.<br/>The government said these powers would only be used as \"a last resort, and only when stringent privacy safeguards have been met\".<br/>Recently Home Office ministers have also been highly critical of Facebook's roll-out of the tech for messaging.<br/>Several messaging platforms, including Signal and WhatsApp, have previously told the BBC they will refuse to weaken the privacy of their encrypted messaging systems if directed to do so.<br/>Signal said in February that it would \"walk\" from the UK if forced to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging app.<br/>Apple's statement now means that some of the most widely used encrypted apps oppose this part of the bill.<br/>The government argues it is possible to provide technological solutions that mean the contents of encrypted messages can be scanned for child abuse material. <br/>The only way of doing that, many tech experts argue, would be to install software that would scan messages on the phone or computer before they are sent, called client-side scanning.<br/>This, critics say, would fundamentally undermine the privacy of messages.<br/>In 2021 Apple announced plans to scan photographs on people's iPhones for abusive content before they were uploaded to iCloud but these were abandoned after a backlash. It has now clearly signalled its opposition to any measure that weakens the privacy of end-to-end encryption.<br/>Its announcement comes as the digital civil liberties campaigners The Open Rights Group sent an open letter to minister Chloe Smith.<br/>The letter, signed by more than 80 national and international civil society organisations, academics and cyber-experts, says: \"The UK could become the first liberal democracy to require the routine scanning of people's private chat messages, including chats that are secured by end-to-end encryption. <br/>\"As over 40 million UK citizens and 2 billion people worldwide rely on these services, this poses a significant risk to the security of digital communication services not only in the UK, but also internationally.\"<br/>Element, a British tech company whose products using E2EE are used by government and military clients, has previously told the BBC measures in the bill that are seen to weaken the privacy of encrypted messages would make customers less trustful of security products produced by UK firms. <br/>There is a growing expectation, the BBC has learned, that changes may be made to part of the bill which critics say could be used to mandate scanning. These could be included in a package of amendments to be revealed in the coming days.<br/>But it is not clear what the detail of those changes might be, or if they will satisfy the concerns of campaigners. <br/>Minister attacks Meta boss over encryption plan<br/>Signal to quit UK if law changes on encryption<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

the law in England and Wales.<br/>Amendments to the Online Safety Bill being tabled on Tuesday will remove the requirement for prosecutors to prove perpetrators intended to cause distress to secure a

register.<br/>\"Revenge porn\" is sharing an intimate image without consent. \"Deepfake porn\" involves creating a fake explicit image or video of a person.<br/>Revenge porn was criminalised in 2015 but up until now prosecutors had to prove there was an intention to cause humiliation or distress.<br/>TV personality Georgia Harrison, whose ex-partner Stephen Bear was jailed earlier this year for posting intimate footage of her on his OnlyFans account, was among those to call for a change to the legislation.<br/>The Love Island star said she was grateful for the support she had been given. <br/>\"The reforms to the law that have been passed today are going to go down in history as a turning point for generations to come and will bring peace of mind to so many victims who have reached out to me whilst also giving future victims the justice they deserve,\" she said.   <br/>The government announced its intention to legislate last year, and the amendments are part of the Online Safety Bill, which is due to be voted on by MPs later this month before it becomes law.<br/>Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said: \"We are cracking down on abusers who share or manipulate intimate photos in order to hound or humiliate women and girls.<br/>\"Our changes will give police and prosecutors the powers they need to bring these cowards to justice, safeguarding women and girls from such vile abuse.\"<br/>Deepfakes have been increasing in recent years with a website that virtually strips women naked receiving 38 million hits in the first eight months of 2021.<br/>Research shows one in seven women and one in nine men aged between 18 and 34 have experienced threats to share intimate images,.<br/>More than 28,000 reports of disclosing private sexual images without consent were recorded by police between April 2015 and December 2021.  <br/>The overhaul of intimate image law builds on previous amendments. <br/>A detailed review by the Law Commission recommended reforming measures protecting against intimate image abuse.<br/>Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs welcomed the news and said the changes would \"hold perpetrators to account for this insidious form of abuse\".<br/>She said: \"Intimate image abuse causes significant distress to victims and survivors and often exists as part of a wider pattern of abuse that continues offline.\"<br/>Ruth Davison, chief executive of the domestic abuse charity Refuge, pointed to the \"woefully low\" conviction rates for intimate image abuse.<br/>\"The amendments to the Online Safety Bill will make it easier to prosecute perpetrators of intimate image abuse, ensuring justice and better protections for survivors,\" she said.<br/>However, others have highlighted that more needs to be done to fully address image-based abuse.<br/>Honza \u010cervenka, a lawyer at McAllister Olivarius, said the changes were welcome but pointed out there were likely to be \"jurisdictional issues\".<br/>\"Some of these websites may not be easily traceable, others may be hosted in countries specifically chosen for their lax laws when it comes to online harm and harassment,\" he told the BBC.<br/>\"Very often, victims become aware of images resurfacing months or even years after their apparent takedown.\"<br/>Rani Govender, senior child safety online policy officer at the NSPCC, said it was a positive move but big tech firms needed to be held more accountable for what was posted on their platforms.<br/>\"More needs to be done if the Online Safety Bill is to tackle the creation and sharing of child sexual abuse material which takes place on industrial levels,\" she said.<br/>\"The government should act today by closing a loophole in the legislation that will let tech bosses off the hook if they fail to

I wouldn't wish it on anybody.\"<br/>New figures released by Police Scotland show there has been a 68% increase in fraud since 2018, with 17,000 cases recorded last year - the vast majority online. <br/>Mr Donald's company Robop, now based in Arisaig, makes robot peregrine falcons for bird pest control.<br/>The firm sold its products in 17 countries but was hit hard by Covid.<br/>At 16:30 one Friday afternoon in December 2020, Mr Donald was agonising over the company's future when he received a call.<br/>It set in motion one of the worst experiences of his life.<br/>Speaking in a well-to-do Edinburgh accent, the caller said they were from a joint banking task force and had discovered fraud in his account.<br/>\"I was under a lot of stress at the time and the way it was done was very, very sophisticated,\" said Mr Donald.<br/>His gut instinct told him something was badly wrong.<br/>But when he asked questions, it became clear that the caller knew a great deal about him and his business. Mr Donald felt their answers were plausible.<br/>Using another phone, he tried to call his bank but couldn't get through. <br/>The caller then ramped up the pressure.<br/>\"They basically said we've got this time window because there's a gap between what we see on our system and what you see on yours, so we need to get this wrapped up as quickly as possible,\" said Mr Donald.<br/>\"They asked me to transfer money out of an account into another account in my name.<br/>\"This wasn't a five minute affair.

It was huge and the investigation is still going on.<br/>\"Instead of always reacting to these crimes, we need to look at how we prevent it.\"<br/>Senior officers at Police Scotland believe cyber-crime is massively under-reported and the latest figures represent the tip of the iceberg.<br/>It has become such a challenge that the detection rate for fraud has halved in recent years and now stands at roughly 16% of cases.<br/>Assistant Chief Constable Andy Freeburn warned that Scottish crime groups were increasingly involved.<br/>He said: \"What we have seen over the last year is emerging serious and organised crime groups operating in that space, trying to exploit the Scottish public through cyber, through fraud, and we are now actively working against those gangs.<br/>\"This is something we are not going to arrest our way out of. There is a significant threat in Scotland.<br/>\"We are having successes in identifying people and recovering money in consultation with banking and financial partners.<br/>\"But we are also improving our prevention messaging, making it very clear to the public how they can help themselves by not giving out details, making sure their software is up to date on their computers and reporting anything suspicious to us.\"<br/>Police Scotland is investing an additional \u00a34.3m in its cyber-crime strategy to buy new equipment and provide training for all of its operational officers.<br/>The force has also drawn up a protocol to ensure its use of new technology is ethically sound.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Donald said the public need to know how sophisticated cyber scams can be.<br/>He added: \"My simple advice is, have your bank's fraud line on speed dial on your mobile phone. <br/>\"And, for the bank, to please answer when people call these numbers.\"<br/>Cyber and Fraud Centre Scotland<br/>Contact Police Scotland<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Could the attack, and the response from the Russian government, be rewriting the narrative of who the good guys and bad guys are in cyber-space?<br/>Camaro Dragon, Fancy Bear, Static Kitten and Stardust Chollima - these aren't the latest Marvel film superheroes but the names given to some of the most feared hacking groups in the world.<br/>For years, these elite cyber teams have been tracked from hack to hack, stealing secrets and causing disruption allegedly under orders from their governments.<br/>And cyber-security companies have even created cartoon images of them.<br/>With dots on a world map, marketeers at these companies regularly warn customers about where these \"advanced persistent threats\" (APTs) are coming from - usually Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.<br/>But parts of the map remain conspicuously empty.<br/>So why is it so rare to hear about Western hacking teams and cyber-attacks?<br/>A major hack in Russia, unearthed earlier this month, might provide some clues.<br/>From his desk overlooking the Moscow Canal, the cyber-security worker watched as strange pings began to register on the company wi-fi network.<br/>Dozens of staff mobile phones were simultaneously sending information to strange parts of the internet.<br/>But this was no ordinary company.<br/>This was Russia's biggest cyber company Kaspersky, investigating a potential attack on its own employees.<br/>\"Obviously our minds turned straight to spyware but we were pretty sceptical at first,\" chief security researcher Igor Kuznetsov says.<br/>\"Everyone's heard about powerful cyber tools which can turn mobile phones into spying devices but I thought of this as a kind of urban legend that happens to someone else, somewhere else.\"<br/>After painstaking analysis of \"several dozen\" infected iPhones, Igor realised their hunch had been right - they had indeed unearthed a large sophisticated surveillance-hacking campaign against their own staff.<br/>The type of attack they had found is the stuff of nightmares for cyber defenders.<br/>The hackers had invented a way to infect iPhones simply by sending an iMessage that automatically deletes itself once the malicious software is injected into the device.<br/>\"Wham, you're infected - and you don't even see it,\" Igor says.<br/>The victims' entire phone contents were now being pinged back to the attackers at regular intervals. Messages, emails and pictures were shared - even access to cameras and microphones. <br/>Keeping to Kaspersky's long-standing rule of not pointing fingers, Igor says they are not interested in from where this digital espionage attack was launched. <br/>\"Bytes don't have nationalities - and anytime a cyber-attack is blamed on a certain country, then it's done with an agenda,\" he says.<br/>But the Russian government is less concerned about that. <br/>On the same day Kaspersky announced its discovery, Russian security services put out an urgent bulletin saying they had \"uncovered a reconnaissance operation by American intelligence services carried out using Apple mobile devices\". <br/>The Russian cyber-intelligence service made no mention of Kaspersky but claimed \"several thousand telephone sets\" belonging to both Russians and foreign diplomats had been infected.<br/>The bulletin even accused Apple of actively helping in the hacking campaign. Apple denies it was involved. <br/>The alleged culprit - the United States National Security Agency (NSA) - told BBC News it had no comment.<br/>Igor insists Kaspersky did not coordinate with the Russian security services and the government's bulletin took them by surprise. <br/>Some in the cyber-security world will be surprised by this - the Russian government had appeared to be issuing a joint announcement with Kaspersky, for maximum impact, the kind of tactic increasingly used by Western countries to expose hacking campaigns and loudly point fingers.<br/>Only last month, the US government issued a joint announcement with Microsoft - Chinese government hackers had been found lurking inside energy networks in US territories. <br/>And this announcement was swiftly and predictably followed by a chorus of agreement from America's allies in cyber-space - the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - known as the Five Eyes.<br/>China's response was a rapid denial saying the story was all part of a \"collective disinformation campaign\" from the Five Eyes countries. <br/>Chinese Foreign Ministry official Mao Ning added China's regular response: \"The fact is the United States is the empire of hacking.\"<br/>But now, like Russia, China seems to be adopting a more aggressive approach to calling out Western hacking.<br/>State-run news outlet China Daily has warned foreign-government-backed hackers are now the country's biggest cyber-security threat. <br/>And that warning came with a statistic from Chinese company 360 Security Technology - it had discovered \"51 hacker organisations targeting China\".<br/>The company did not respond to requests for comment.<br/>Last September, China also accused the US of hacking a government-funded university responsible for aeronautics and space research programmes.<br/>\"China and Russia have slowly figured out the Western model for cyber exposure is incredibly effective and I think we are seeing a shift,\" Rubrik Zero Labs head and former cyber intelligence worker Steve Stone says.<br/>\"I'll also say I think that's a good thing. I have zero issue with other countries revealing what Western countries are doing. I think it's fair play and I think it's appropriate.\" <br/>Many brush off the Chinese charge of the US being the empire of hacking as hyperbole - but there is some truth in it.<br/>According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the US is the only tier-one cyber power in the world, based on attack, defence and influence. <br/>Tier two is made up of:<br/>The National Cyber Power Index, compiled by researchers at the Belfer Centre for Science and International Affairs, also deems the US the world's top cyber power. <br/>The paper's lead researcher, Julia Voo, has also noticed a shift.<br/>\"Espionage is routine for governments and now it's so often in the form of cyber-attacks - but there's a battle of narrative going on and governments are asking who is behaving responsibly and irresponsibly in cyber-space,\" she says.<br/>And compiling a list of APT hacking groups and pretending there are no Western ones is not a truthful depiction of reality, she says. <br/>\"Reading the same reports about hacking attacks from only one side adds to a general ignorance,\" Ms Voo says.<br/>\"A general education of the public is important, because this is basically where a lot of tensions between states are going to be playing out in the future.\" <br/>And Ms Voo praises the UK government for publishing its inaugural transparency report into National Cyber Force operations. <br/>\"It's not super-detailed but more than other countries,\" she says.<br/>But the lack of transparency could also stem from cyber-security companies themselves. <br/>Mr Stone calls it a \"data bias\" - Western cyber-security companies fail to see western hacks, because they have no customers in rival countries.  <br/>But there could also be a conscious decision to put less effort into some investigations.<br/>\"I don't doubt that there's likely some companies that may pull the punch and hide what they may know about a Western attack,\" Mr Stone says.<br/>But he has never been part of a team that deliberately held back.<br/>Lucrative contracts from governments such as the UK or US are a major revenue stream for many cyber-security companies too.<br/>As one Middle Eastern cyber-security researcher says: \"The cyber-security intelligence sector is heavily represented by Western vendors and greatly influenced by their customers' interests and needs.\"<br/>The expert, who asked to remain anonymous, is one of more than a dozen volunteers regularly contributing to the APT Google Sheet - a free-to-view online spreadsheet tracking all known instances of threat-actor activities, irrespective of their origins.<br/>It has a tab for \"Nato\" APTs, with monikers such as Longhorn, Snowglobe and Gossip Girl, but the expert admits it is pretty empty compared with tabs for other regions and countries. <br/>He says another reason for the lack of information on Western cyber-attacks could be because they are often stealthier and cause less collateral damage.<br/>\"Western nations tend to conduct their cyber operations in a more precise and strategic manner, contrasting with the more aggressive and broad attacks associated with nations like Iran and Russia,\" the expert says.<br/>\"As a result, Western cyber operations often yield less noise.\"<br/>The other aspect to a lack of reporting could be trust. <br/>It is easy to brush off Russian or Chinese hacking allegations because they often lack evidence. <br/>But Western governments, when they loudly and regularly point the finger, rarely, if ever, provide any evidence either.<br/>Did hackers start this steel factory fire in Iran?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Cyril had pitched to over 100 investors and was unable to secure any funding.<br/>Having faced so many rejections, he tells me how difficult it was to find funding.<br/>\"I had to deal with a lot of no's and eventually I realised I was not the only black entrepreneur finding it hard to grow my business,\" he says.<br/>\"The founders we work with now need three things: capital, connections and access. We work to provide all of those things.\" <br/>Talking to the founders, it's clear that the scope of Black Seed goes far beyond just investing in companies - it's about community too. <br/>\"There are certain challenges that black entrepreneurs face that their peers don't. We speak to many start-up founders who have no mentor or network of support,\" says Yvonne Nagawa.<br/>The 30-year-old left her full time job in finance a few years ago to work with Black Seed full time.<br/>\"I was tired of angrily protesting and I wanted to make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>\"I feel super privileged to set up a fund in the heart of Brixton and give back to the community that essentially raised me.\"<br/>Up to now Black Seed has been hosting regular community events, from fireside panels with successful entrepreneurs to networking dinners. The trio plan to continue these in addition to making investments.<br/>\"We've worked with around 2,500 to 3,000 companies so far, providing them with anything from mentoring, to networking opportunities, to investment,\" Yvonne says.<br/>One of the companies that caught the eye of Black Seed is a mother and daughter duo who run an online fashion and wellness brand.<br/>Caliya and Rose Sterling from Ealing, west London, set up The Pro Box seven years ago and have been receiving support from the entrepreneurs.<br/>Rose says Black Seed has \"helped us expand our network and we've been able to meet up with other entrepreneurs to share ideas.<br/>\"They have validated who we are as founders and allowed us to build more conviction around our proposition.<br/>\"It's super challenging to get funding for your business in the UK and being connected to Black Seed has opened so many doors for us.\"<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The convenience and breadth of an AI chatbot can't compete with the pleasures of chatting with someone whose personality quirks I've learned over the course of years. It is however a useful supplement.<br/>And I'm just one of many people who have discovered in recent months the benefits of AI-based chat for language learning.<br/>A Costa Rican who works in the construction industry tells me that his AI-powered keyboard has been useful for polishing up his technical vocabulary in English. For instance, it's saved him a great deal of time to be able to find an English word for a tool by describing it. <br/>A South African caf\u00e9 owner has gone further in improving his Spanish grammar with the aid of AI. He had a hard time finding simple study tools, especially given his ADHD, so he started using ChatGPT to quickly generate and adapt study aids like charts of verb tenses. <br/>Developers have been quick to jump on this wave of interest, and there are now numerous apps that have drawn on open-source code to customise AI for language learners. These can be more appropriate for learners than general chatbots like the virtual companion Replika. <br/>Blanka Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, an associate professor of applied linguistics at the University of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 in Czechia, says that Replika has been useful for her students to practise informal English. <br/>But the conversations could become repetitive, language corrections were missing, and the chatbot would sometimes ask students for sexy pictures. \"This was quite abusive.\"<br/>In contrast, one of the specific language-learning chatbots is LangAI, launched in March by Federico Ruiz Cassarino. Mr Ruiz Cassarino drew on his own experiences of learning English after moving from Uruguay to the UK. His English skills improved dramatically from speaking every day, compared to more academic methods. He's now using his own app to work on his Italian.<br/>Many people get self-conscious about making mistakes in a language they barely speak, even to a tutor, Mr Ruiz Cassarino notes. But a chatbot won't judge you. And the new wave of generative AI is so advanced that it can cultivate AI penpals, which is how he sees his product.<br/>Rather than sticking to boring pre-scripted roleplays, with current AI \"you can speak about things that are interesting to you, which makes it feel like not as much of a chore to learn\".<br/>While many language learners are using popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard to practice, Mr Ruiz Cassarino believes that specific language-acquisition apps like his are useful.<br/>\"We worked really hard to make this well tailored for somebody who wants to learn languages,\" he says. The team customised LangAI's user interface to match users' vocabulary levels, added the ability to make corrections during a conversation, and enabled the conversion of speech to text.<br/>According to Mr Ruiz Cassarino, they're seeing some impressive retention numbers for an education app. Of users who try the app for around 10 minutes, roughly 45% will still be using it a month later. They're now focused on building the subscriber base of people willing to pay for unlimited use. <br/>Related to that, they're planning advancements like tracking of improved skills and the ability to personalise the chatbot's tone and personality (perhaps even to practise a language while conversing with historical figures).<br/>Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, who is also a member of the research project Language in the Human-Machine Era, has assessed the useability and usefulness of AI chatbots for students of foreign languages. This research suggests that AI chatbots are helpful for vocabulary development, grammar and other language skills, especially when they offer corrective feedback.<br/>To stay ahead of the trend, well-established language-learning apps have been integrating AI into their own platforms. Duolingo began collaborating with OpenAI in September 2022, using that company's GPT-4.<br/>It seems unlikely that AI chatbots will replace Duolingo altogether. Joy Ehonwa, an editor and writer in Lagos, mainly uses Duolingo to learn French.<br/>But lately she's also been using an AI chatbot developed in Nigeria to help with her French.<br/>She interacts with this chatbot, Kainene vos Savant, the way she would with \"an all-knowing human friend\". <br/>Ms Ehonwa explains, \"My questions revolve around 'why'? When I fail an exercise on Duolingo, the app is not great at helping me understand why the thing that was wrong, was wrong. So, I ask Kainene. Also, when I think a sentence should be a certain way and it isn't, I ask Kainene why and she helps me understand why it cannot be the way I expect it to be, as an English speaker.\"<br/>If the older language-learning platforms have weaknesses, so does AI-powered language learning. Users are reporting that chatbots are well versed in widely spoken European languages, but quality degrades for languages that are underrepresented online or that have different writing systems. Many of the AI language-learning apps are available for a limited set of languages.<br/>Even in common languages, the chatbots make errors - sometimes even inventing words. One problem is that they deliver text so confidently, it would be easy for a relatively new learner to take what they say as correct.<br/>Emily M Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington in the US, has concerns, \"What kind of biases and inappropriate ways of talking about other people might they be learning from the chatbot?\" Other ethical issues, such as data privacy, may also be neglected.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Still, Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 believes that there will be an enormous market for such technologies. And like a number of language learners, she points out that GPT-4, available with a paid subscription to ChatGPT, has made astonishing strides on accuracy.<br/>Though many teachers disagree, she believes, \"It's just a matter of time when artificial intelligence will replace us as teachers of foreign languages.\"<br/>While that may sound extreme, \"teachers will still have an important role as mentors and facilitators, particularly with beginner learners and older people since teachers have a strong understanding of the individual learning styles, language needs, and goals of each student.\"<br/>It will be key for language teachers to assess the added value of AI and their role in relation to it, as more sophisticated self-directed learning becomes possible. As Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 advises, \"Technology is here to stay, and we have to face it and reconsider our teaching methods and assessments.\" <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The service, which offers shipping perks, access to streaming movies and more, costs $139 a year or $14.99 monthly in the US and \u00a395 per year in the UK. <br/>The FTC said Amazon used website designs that pushed customers into agreeing to enrol in Prime and have the subscription automatically renew as they were making purchases. <br/>The company attempted to make it difficult for users to opt out of auto-enrolment because \"those changes would also negatively affect Amazon's bottom line\", the agency alleged in the complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle. <br/>It also said Amazon put customers seeking to cancel through a cumbersome \"four-page, six-click, fifteen option\" process, which the FTC said was known internally as \"Iliad\" in a nod to the Greek epic about the \"long, arduous Trojan War\". <br/>Though Amazon altered the cancellation process shortly before the lawsuit was filed, the FTC said the company's tactics broke laws aimed at protecting shoppers.<br/>\"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said.<br/>The FTC is seeking a court order to force Amazon to change its practices, as well as financial penalties in an unspecified amount.<br/>Amazon said it had been in the middle of discussing the issues with the agency when the lawsuit was filed without notice. <br/>\"The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,\" the company said. <br/>The FTC has repeatedly warned online firms against using \"dark patterns\" to manipulate shoppers.<br/>It had been investigating Amazon's Prime programme since 2021.<br/>It said the company had attempted to delay the probe on multiple occasions, including by refusing to deliver documents in a timely manner. <br/>Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Insider Intelligence analyst said the FTC was \"making an example of Amazon\".<br/>\"It's quite common for companies to make it more difficult to cancel an account than it is to create one,\" she said.<br/>Ms Khan, who was appointed to her post by President Joe Biden, made her name critiquing US competition policy related to Amazon.<br/>She has promised to move more aggressively to police online shopping and the power of America's tech giants. <br/>The lawsuit marks the third action from the FTC involving Amazon in recent weeks.<br/>The company agreed to pay $25m last month to settle charges it had violated child privacy laws by keeping recordings children made on Alexa. <br/>It agreed to pay another $5.8m to resolve claims that Ring, the doorbell company Amazon purchased in 2018, had violated privacy protections by giving staff unrestricted access to customer videos and failing to implement precautions against hackers. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

We just don't have it. We are an old group and have never deceived anyone, if we say that we do not have information, then we do not have it,\" the hackers claimed.<br/>Zellis would only refer us to its previous statement, which said: \"We can confirm that a small number of our customers have been impacted by this global issue and we are actively working to support them.\"<br/>The company says that as soon as it became aware of the hack it took immediate action and disconnected the computer server on which the MOVEit software was installed.<br/>The firm says it has brought in an expert external security team to help it respond to the attack and has notified the relevant UK data authorities. <br/>Cyber-security experts are puzzled by Clop's claims which further muddy an already complex situation.<br/>Threat researcher Brett Callow, from Emsisoft, said Clop could be covering up the fact it stole the data as part of a sale deal with another hacking group.<br/>But Clop claimed \"we didn't sell anything to other hackers\".<br/>Other experts say there are many possibilities. <br/>\"Clop has no real reason to say they don't have the data,\" said SOS Intelligence boss Amir Had\u017eipasi\u0107 .<br/>\"If they are telling the truth then it makes me think that some other hackers may have got in and stolen the data before Clop and if Clop don't have the data then this situation is less predictable. The files are going to end up somewhere on the darkweb via another hacking group,\" he added.<br/>The hack was first announced on 31 May by Progress Software, the makers of MOVEit.<br/>The criminals found a way to break into MOVEit and were then able to use that access to get into the databases of potentially hundreds of other companies.<br/>Since the initial MOVEit disclosure, however, researchers have found many security issues within the software which means it is possible that the data was stolen in a different way by a different group.<br/>On Friday, the US announced a $10m reward for \"information linking the Clop gang or any other malicious cyber -ctors targeting US critical infrastructure to a foreign government\".<br/>Hacker gang Clop publishes victim names on dark web<br/>What action can those caught up in mass hacks take?<br/>BBC, BA and Boots among victims of mass payroll hack<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

A huge margin of users voted for r/pics to \"only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy\", with 37,331 votes for and -2,239 votes against. Other subreddits saw similar results.<br/>And it isn't just John Oliver that Reddit has to contend with.<br/>Other subreddits are similarly remaining active while changing their communities to fit within Reddit's rules, with r/iPhone now dedicated to \"dashing images\" of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, and moderators of r/scams approving content deliberately slowly, taking up to 14 days to review a post rather than a few minutes.<br/>Reddit communities go dark in protest at changes<br/>Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave<br/>Social media platform Reddit files to go public<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that.

It is a well-trodden and often profitable process.<br/>\"Once Clop names companies to its data leak site, the group will start its rounds of negotiations with affected organisations, demanding ransom payments in order to avoid their data being breached, said Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest.<br/>Mr Morgan says the hackers will hope that the victims make contact and set a deadline of how long they have before their data is made public. <br/>Clop has been known to demand ransoms of hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars but police forces around the world discourage victims from paying as it fuels these criminal gangs.<br/>The MOVEit hack was first disclosed on 31 May when US company Progress Software said hackers had found a way to break into its MOVEit Transfer tool. <br/> MOVEit is software designed to move sensitive files securely and is popular around the world with most of its customers in the US.<br/>Progress Software said it alerted its customers as soon as the hack was discovered and quickly released a downloadable security update.<br/>But the criminals were already able to use their access to get into the databases of potentially hundreds of other companies.<br/>Payroll services provider Zellis, which is based in the UK, was a MOVEit user which was subsequently breached.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will do the same for clients with electric cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\". He added: \"And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it\".<br/>It has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. <br/>Prof LeCun told the BBC: \"This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently\". But work would change because we have \"no idea\" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.<br/>Intelligent computers would create \"a new renaissance for humanity\" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.<br/>Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.<br/>He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe \"they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive\". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, <br/>Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

I think the AI risks are more that people will be discriminated [against], they will not be seen as who they are.<br/>\"If it's a bank using it to decide whether I can get a mortgage or not, or if it's social services on your municipality, then you want to make sure that you're not being discriminated [against] because of your gender or your colour or your postal code,\" she said. <br/>On Tuesday, Ireland's data protection authority said it had put Google's planned EU roll-out of its AI chatbot Bard on hold. <br/>It said it had been informed by Google that its ChatGPT competitor would be introduced in the EU this week, but was yet to receive details or information showing how the firm had identified and minimised data protection risks to prospective users.<br/>Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said the DPC was seeking the information \"as a matter of urgency\" and had raised further data protection enquiries about it with Google.<br/>Ms Vestager, who is the European Commission's executive vice president, said AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\".<br/>She insisted a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries should be prioritised before getting more jurisdictions, such as China, on board.<br/>\"Let's start working on a UN approach. But we shouldn't hold our breath,\" she said. <br/>\"We should do what we can here and now.\"<br/>Ms Vestager is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>The current draft of the AI Act seeks to categorise applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>High-risk AI systems include those that are used to evaluate credit scores or access to loans and housing. This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it. No-one can make sure that everyone is on board,\" she said, pointing out that a pause could be used by some as an opportunity to get ahead of competitors. <br/>\"What I think is important is that every developer knows that everyone has signed up for the same guardrails so that no-one takes excessive risks.\"<br/>The European Parliament's proposals for the AI Act seek to restrict the use of biometric identification systems and indiscriminate collection of user data from social media or CCTV footage for purposes such as facial recognition systems.<br/>However, Ms Vestager said: \"We want to put in strict guardrails so that it's not used in real-time, but only in specific circumstances where you're looking for a missing child or there's a terrorist fleeing.<br/>Before the AI Act can become finalised as the world's first rulebook on the use and development of AI systems, the EU's three branches of power: the Commission, Parliament and Council will all have to agree on its final version.<br/>It is not expected to come into effect before 2025. <br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It lets Spotify, YouTube and BBC iPlayer suggest what you might want to play next, and helps Facebook and Twitter decide which social media posts to show users.<br/>AI lets Amazon analyse customers' buying habits to recommend future purchases - and the firm is also using the technology to crack down on fake reviews. <br/>Two powerful AI-driven applications or apps which have become very high profile in recent months are ChatGPT and Snapchat My AI. <br/>They are examples of what is called \"generative\" AI. <br/>This uses the patterns and structures it identifies in vast quantities of source data to generate new and original content which feels like it has been created by a human. <br/>The AI is coupled with a computer programme known as a chatbot, which \"talks\" to human users via text. <br/>The apps can answer questions, tell stories and write computer code. <br/>But both programmes sometimes generate incorrect answers for users, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.<br/>With few rules currently in place governing how AI is used, experts have warned that its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted. <br/>In May, Geoffrey Hinton, widely considered to be one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, quit his job at Google, warning that AI chatbots could soon be more intelligent than humans.<br/>Later that month, the US-based Center for AI Safety published a statement supported by dozens of leading tech specialists. <br/>They argue AI could be used to generate misinformation that could destabilise society. In the worst-case scenario, they say machines might become so intelligent that they take over, leading to the extinction of humanity.<br/>However, the EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern. <br/>In particular she is concerned about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications, adding there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence elections.<br/>Others, including tech pioneer Martha Lane Fox, say we shouldn't get what she calls \"too hysterical\" about AI, urging a more sensible conversation about its capabilities.<br/>Governments around the world are wrestling with how to regulate AI. <br/>Members of the European Parliament have just voted in favour of the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which will put in place a strict legal framework for AI, which companies would need to follow. <br/>Margrethe Vestager says \"guardrails\" are needed to counter the biggest risks posed by AI. <br/>The legislation - which is expected to come into effect in 2025 - categorises applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>Higher-risk systems like those used to evaluate credit scores or decide access to housing would face the strictest controls. <br/>These rules will not apply in the UK, where the government set out its vision for the future of AI in March. <br/>It ruled out setting up a dedicated AI regulator, and said instead that existing bodies would be responsible for its oversight.<br/>But Ms Vestager says that AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\", and wants to build a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries. <br/>US lawmakers have also expressed concern about whether the existing voluntary codes are up to the job.  <br/>Meanwhile, China intends to make companies notify users whenever an AI algorithm is being used.<br/>AI has the potential to revolutionise the world of work, but this raises questions about which roles it might displace. <br/>A recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe, as certain tasks and job functions become automated. That equates to a quarter of all the work humans currently do in the US and Europe. <br/>The report highlighted a number of industries and roles that could be affected, including administrative jobs, legal work, architecture, and management.<br/>But it also identified huge potential benefits for many sectors, and predicted that AI could lead to a 7% increase in global GDP. <br/>Some areas of medicine and science are already taking advantage of AI, with doctors using the technology to help spot breast cancers, and scientists using it to develop new antibiotics. <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

In December, revenue reportedly fell by 40% compared to a year earlier.<br/>For advertisers to return, they need to know what to expect in terms of user content and engagement, Mr Wang said.<br/>\"She is definitely someone who can balance out Elon and go toe-to-toe with him as he respects her,\" he added.<br/>Since buying Twitter last year for $44bn (\u00a335bn), Mr Musk had been under pressure to find someone to lead the firm so that he could focus on his other businesses, which include electric carmaker Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX.<br/>On 12 May, Mr Musk, who recently reclaimed the title of the world's richest person, announced that Ms Yaccarino would succeed him as the chief executive of Twitter in six weeks time.<br/>However, she started the role earlier than expected, just days after the resignation of the firm's head of trust and safety.<br/>Ms Yaccarino is credited with helping to steer media giant NBCUniversal through upheaval in the industry caused by changing technology.<br/>In her former role, she overhauled the company's advertising sales business and was behind the 2020 launch of its advert-supported streaming platform Peacock.<br/>She now oversees business operations at Twitter, which has been struggling to make money, while Mr Musk continues as the company's executive chairman and chief technology officer.<br/>\"We believe Linda has a solid vision for Twitter with a lot of wood to chop that can be turned around,\" Daniel Ives from Wedbush Securities said.<br/>\"This is a great first step and she knows the task ahead for Twitter to monetise the platform which remains the golden goose.\"<br/>Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?<br/>Linda Yaccarino replaces Elon Musk as Twitter boss<br/>Tesla boss Musk on first China trip in three years<br/>Musk brain chip firm's human study approved<br/>Top Twitter engineer quits day after DeSantis launch<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example... The situation was such that we could not even put our employees on the ground in the country out of fear of what the government might do to them.\"<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.<br/>The European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\". <br/>This week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.  <br/>Former UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders. <br/>\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter. These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country <br/>But there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:<br/>\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.<br/>There are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:<br/>But what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?<br/>The European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product. <br/>Companies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover. <br/>But can developers predict or control how their product might be used?<br/>So far, AI has been largely self-policed.<br/>The big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>But will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?<br/>You can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.<br/>And Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations. <br/>\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.<br/>Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\". <br/>It can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".<br/>Chatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.<br/>And in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.<br/>But others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.  <br/>ChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.<br/>Now, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams. <br/>The capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.<br/>And two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm. <br/>The Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 -  \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says. <br/>She is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

If a child successfully found a Pok\u00e9mon then a computerised animation of the creature would appear on their handset's screen, superimposed on top of the actual view through the phone's camera.<br/>It proved irresistible to millions and millions of young users. But are adults equally impressed by the use of AR?<br/>Since Pok\u00e9mon Go's success, a growing number of consumer brands are continuing to embrace AR, such as Coca-Cola and US whiskey Jack Daniels. You use your phone camera to scan a QR code on the can or bottle label, and an animation or video pops up on your screen.<br/>Does this use of AR remain a novelty, a gimmick that most people ignore, or does it actually increase consumer engagement and sales?<br/>In 2021, US soft drink firm Jones Soda introduced its first AR campaign, which it called Reel Labels. If you scan an image on the bottle labels then it transforms into a short video.<br/>To create the videos the firm partnered with an initial 15 so-called influencers, including a skateboarder, a breakdancer, and a BMX bike rider. Since then the firm's customers have been able to send in their own videos to be featured. <br/>And last year Jones Soda worked with music labels Sub Pop and Hardly Art to promote videos from more than a dozen new bands.<br/>\"A brand's packaging is so much more than a container for a product,\" says Bohb Blair, Jones Soda's chief marketing officer. \"It's now an opportunity to make a consumer's moment with your product special.<br/>\"Content is a great way to do that, and AR is a fun and convenient distribution vehicle.\"<br/>Another drinks business that has used AR to connect with the music industry is Estonian milk brand Tere Piim. In 2019 it joined with the Eurovision Song Contest to enable customers to see mini digital animations of that year's entrants perform on their kitchen counters and tables. All they had to do was scan a label on the milk cartons.<br/>The AR technology was provided by Latvian software firm Overly. \"Although you may doubt the compatibility at first glance, milk and a song contest make a good cross-marketing duo,\" says Overly's chief executive Ainars Klavins.<br/>\"In this instance, a traditional milk carton became a new medium for broadcasting Eurovision songs. It inspired consumers who may not be existing viewers to explore the contestant line-up and choose their favourites.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>He adds that consumers, especially younger ones, are ready to engage with brands \"in the augmented reality realm\".<br/>While you'd expect those involved in helping firms create AR to sing its praises, what do independent experts think?<br/>Stuart Duff is a leading business psychologist, who studies how firms can best connect with consumers. He says that AR can help products seem more \"interesting, engaging and memorable\".<br/>\"Research has highlighted that using AR not only captures our attention more quickly but also increases the likelihood of committing information to memory. So while AR may seem like a gimmick, it offers a genuine alternative approach to lodging brands in our psyche.\"<br/>Jenny Stanley is managing director of Appetite Creative, a Madrid-based tech and marketing firm that helps consumer businesses create AR labels.<br/>She says that a product's label is already an example of \"extremely targeted marketing\", whose effectiveness only increases further when AR content is added.<br/>\"It's not only impactful, but also cost effective. The average cost per digital advertising click is \u00a31.50, whereas a click or scan on packaging is technically free, giving brands a compelling reason to use connected packaging.\"<br/>Yet, as Mr Klavins of Overly cautions, content is key. And by that he means that what the AR offers has to be interesting and engaging.<br/>\"The key point here is that quality content for augmented reality is vital. I always say that AR content should either inspire, educate or entertain. It has to do at least one of those things to transform from a novelty tech into a strategic tool that drives business value.\"<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

That creates a force - called the Lorentz force - which acts on the sea water and propels the craft along.<br/>Without propellers or a drive shaft churning up the water, a working MHD drive could provide fast and completely silent travel.<br/>Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades and the original concept dates back to the 1960s.<br/>In 1992, the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation built Yamato-1, a 30m-long ship that tested a MHD drive.<br/>However, the drive was so heavy that the Yamato-1 could only manage to plod along at a speed of 6.6 knots. It also used up a lot of energy.<br/>But researchers say the project proved such a drive could work and provided useful data.<br/>\"Authentic information on defects and weak points, together with what should be made... when we carry out a Yamato-2 in the future,\" says Hiromitsu Kitagawa, visiting research fellow at the Ocean Policy Research Institute, of which the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation is now part.<br/>The Yamato project showed that much more powerful magnets would be needed, plus more robust electrodes - the parts of the drive which make contact with the water.<br/>According to Ms Swithenbank, the first of these problems may well be easily solvable now, with a new generation of magnets, developed by the nuclear fusion industry.<br/>Fusion is the reaction which powers stars. But to make it happen here on earth often requires extremely powerful magnets to contain swirling clouds of burning hot plasma.<br/>The force generated by these new magnets has been likened to double the pressure at the bottom of the deepest ocean trench.<br/>While more powerful magnets are now available, the second problem, how to protect the electrodes, still needs work.<br/>Metal corrodes when placed in seawater and an electrical current accelerates that process. Some types of magnetic field have the same corrosive effect.<br/>On the Yamato-1 it was found that electrodes were losing around 3% of their mass per year.<br/>Jeffrey Long, a research chemist at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), is a battery specialist, and is expecting to take part in the Darpa programme, along with colleague Zachary Neale.<br/>\"If you have ever placed paper clips in a cup of salt water connected to a 9-volt battery, you'd notice the water turns colour because the metal is corroding,\" he says.<br/>\"Essentially, we want electrodes that don't corrode, while still supporting the high electrical current density required for effective operation.\"<br/>However, improvements in coatings by the fuel cell and battery industries in recent years mean this problem may well now be solvable.<br/>While these are important advances, other problems remain.<br/>Passing a current across seawater breaks the hydrogen-oxygen bond, creating gas bubbles on the electrodes which creates resistance and reduces the efficiency of the MHD.<br/>Potential solutions will have to be tested, including gas-diffusing electrodes created by the fuel cell industry. Other techniques sweep away the bubbles before they build up.<br/>Finally, there's the issue of erosion, with collapsing bubbles creating pitting. \"It's like having sandpaper on your electrode,\" says Ms Swithenbank. Here too, though, work in other industries is showing promise.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>If the Darpa team can overcome the problems, the advantages will be enormous.<br/>Without moving parts, MHD drives should need much less maintenance than existing propulsion systems.<br/>\"But the real reason everybody's interested in it is that, because there's no moving parts, it's also much quieter,\" says Ms Swithenbank. \"There's no question that for national defence, that's a huge advantage.\"<br/>A quiet system, without dangerous propellers thrashing around, could be better for wildlife as well.<br/>Work on the project will begin in earnest next spring, with a two-year programme to develop materials - in particular, electrode materials - followed by an 18-month period to design, manufacture and test the drive. <br/>The aim is to produce a prototype MHD drive that could propel a small ship, but that could be scaled up to propel a container ship or a military vessel. <br/>The drive would also have to demonstrate an energy efficiency that could match existing propeller systems.<br/>\"Do I see this being used in commercial ships in the next five years? No. But it's absolutely possible in the future,\" say Ms Swithenbank.<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

I have never seen anything so horrible and bleak in my life,\" said Stephen Brotherstone.<br/>He and David Lawrence are the authors of Scarred for Life - a series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.<br/>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it \"wrecked\" his head.<br/>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.<br/>\"I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much.\"<br/>Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had \"looked really special\" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.<br/>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama's impact.<br/>\"We said 'wow if we can pull this off it'll be great,' but I didn't have a clue that it held that much of a punch.\"<br/>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.<br/>\"There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room,\" the actor recalled.<br/>\"People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. <br/>\"People say it is the most scary thing they've ever seen in their life and remains so to this day.\"<br/>Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR.<br/>Lawrence and Brotherstone are currently working on a third volume of their series, which looks at the Cold War and includes a chapter on Threads.<br/>\"I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,\" said Lawrence.<br/>\"You've got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you've got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there's every nightmare you've ever had on screen.\"<br/>Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990.<br/>\"It wasn't a question of if they pressed the button, but when are they going to press the button,\" he said.<br/>Jimmy, played by Dinsdale, and Ruth, played by Karen Meagher, have just learnt that Ruth is expecting a baby as the film opens.<br/>The growing tensions between East and West appear on TV and newspapers as Sheffield's residents go about their daily lives, ignoring the looming threat.<br/>\"There's the build-up to war, but you don't see it you, just hear about it in the background as they are discussing what to have for tea,\" Lawrence said.<br/>\"They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think.\"<br/>For Dinsdale, it was a \"fantastic\" piece of writing by Hines.<br/>\"They are everyman and everywoman, they are just normal people with normal lives, there's nothing special about them and this very special event happens to them and it just draws you in.\"<br/>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.<br/>\"Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up,\" he said.<br/>\"It is very 70s, 80s Play for Today, but I think it works in its favour because it was so British.<br/>\"That was a house that looked like mine, there's Woolworths getting vaporised, it really struck home.\"<br/>The final parts of the film follow the characters as they struggle through the nuclear winter in the aftermath of the blasts.<br/>\"It is watching everyone die and it is watching society collapse forever. <br/>\"It makes the point we are never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other,\" Brotherstone said.<br/>For the actors and crew it was \"a ball\" to make, according to Dinsdale.<br/>\"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever.\"<br/>To him though, Threads remains a \"seminal\" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.<br/>\"It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created,\" he said.<br/>\"It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.<br/>\"I am very proud of it.\"<br/>Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Shells struck the house, she says.<br/>There's emotion in her voice as she explains what the building used to be like. <br/>An old photo she sends via WhatsApp shows a large property with balconies and a pond in the front garden. Images taken after the attack capture the soot-stained, crumbling walls left by the assault.<br/>But Mrs Pylypenko and her family now have a new home in the garden of their old one - a factory-made house that was assembled in just a few days last autumn.<br/>The building, a donation to the family, was one of the first homes of its kind built by Ukrainian firm HOMErs, which says its designs could benefit millions of refugees and people still in Ukraine who have lost their properties in the conflict. <br/>HOMErs, previously known as Tera Monada, has a range of modular houses, made from standardised factory-made units that slot together quickly to achieve the desired final design. <br/>Given the extent of damage in Ukraine, any reconstruction efforts will have to be both fast and cost-effective. In March, the World Bank estimated that it could take $411bn (\u00a3323bn) to rebuild the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has, in the past, put the figure at $1tn.<br/>\"There are about 200 destroyed houses in my community,\" says Mrs Pylypenko. \"Modular houses are absolutely important for us.\"<br/>Her new property is significantly smaller than her old one, she notes. But it is the only such building in her village and accommodates six, including Mrs Pylypenko's 10-month old granddaughter. Her daughter, who was pregnant at the time of the Russian attack on the village last year, was brought to Poland by volunteers where she gave birth.<br/>Lots of Ukrainians, sadly, know this predicament, says HOMErs co-founder Alex Stepura.<br/>\"In our own company, so many of our people lost their accommodations, their houses, their apartments,\" he says, pointing out how makeshift shipping container homes have become a common sight in the country during the past year or so.<br/>In order to provide a more appropriate solution, Mr Stepura and his colleagues have developed modular homes that are comprised of multiple three-by-three metre units. An entire house as well as furniture and white goods can be flat-packed and loaded on a single lorry, he says.<br/>To date, the company has supplied around 50 homes to families in Ukraine, a spokesman for HOMErs says. In a video shared by the firm, factory workers slot a wall section into a foundation piece and rotate a lever downwards, locking the two tightly together, demonstrating the ease of construction.<br/>HOMErs' Kyiv factory is currently producing around 10 homes per month, according to Mr Stepura's business partner Chris Baxter, a British investor. But the pair are hoping to raise roughly \u20ac5m (\u00a34.2m) to build a new factory in Slovakia, which would boost production to a couple of hundred homes per month, or so.<br/>Mr Stepura has decades of experience in engineering and robotics. His companies produce vending machines and drones, for example. Some of those drones are currently deployed on reconnaissance missions for the Ukrainian military, he adds.<br/>The modular homes should be high-tech but also intuitive and easy to use - the architectural equivalent of a new smartphone, he suggests.<br/>It must be said that there's nothing new about this idea. Modular homes been around for decades and many companies, including Ikea, have invested in the concept. Mr Baxter argues that the HOMErs modules will attain a good balance of quality and affordability. <br/>One grid-connected, fully furnished, three-module home costs $18,000 (\u00a314,000), with additional modules priced at $6,000. The designs might offer a good solution for Ukrainian refugees currently living abroad who hope one day to return home, suggests Mr Baxter.<br/>\"Those houses can be packed up and moved together with the people to repopulate the country as quickly as possible without having to wait for all of this construction to take place,\" he says.<br/>Such a thing is possible in theory, though \"little tested\" says Gemma Burgess at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research.<br/>That said, rebuilding towns and cities with modular properties could be a smart way to go, she adds.<br/>\"In Ukraine, if you're trying to build large volumes of housing, it might be a much cheaper, more efficient way to do it.\"<br/>There are other ventures in Ukraine using the latest technology to help communities rebuild after shelling or missile strikes. Take the 3D-printed school in Lviv, which is currently undergoing a second phase of construction. Or the prefabricated concrete building panels developed by Ukrainian firm Well-being ConTech.<br/>All such efforts ought to avoid repeating the rush to build properties - often of low standard - that followed the Second World War in countries including the UK, adds Dr Burgess: \"Quality and sustainability is going to be key.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Stepura emphasises his commitment to high quality design and accurate manufacturing. Mr Baxter is taking delivery of one of the modular homes himself, where he will live while his UK house is renovated in the coming months. He points out that his version will come with pre-installed solar panels on the roof. <br/>The modular homes also feature 200mm-thick insulation in their walls - roughly twice the UK standard.<br/>Mrs Pylypenko praises the facilities that came with her new house: an electric stove, a fridge, dishwasher and washing machine.

It will also look at potential earnings when deciding if a degree offers enough value.<br/>Nearly three-in-10 graduates do not progress into highly-skilled jobs or further study 15 months after graduating, according to the OfS. <br/>The OfS already has the power to investigate and sanction universities which offer degrees falling below minimum performance thresholds - but the new rules would require the regulator to limit student numbers for those courses.<br/>The current thresholds for full-time students doing a first degree are for: <br/>Universities UK said the UK had the highest completion rates of any OECD country and overall satisfaction rates were high. <br/>\"However, it is right that the regulatory framework is there as a backstop to protect student interests in the very small proportion of instances where quality needs to be improved,\" a spokeswoman said. <br/>Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the announcement was \"an attack on the aspirations of young people\". <br/>Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said the prime minister was \"out of ideas\" and had \"dug up a policy the Conservatives announced and then unannounced twice over\".<br/>She said: \"Universities don't want this. It's a cap on aspiration, making it harder for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go on to further study.\"<br/>BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said some are asking why the courses are not being scrapped altogether if they are such bad value for money.<br/>Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Education Minister Robert Halfon said putting limits on underperforming degrees will mean those courses \"will then improve\". <br/>\"Students will be able to make informed choices,\" he said. \"If a course has poor outcomes they might choose to do another course at university, they may still decide to do that course but will have the recruitment limits on it.\"<br/>He called Labour's accusation that it was an attack on aspirations \"nonsense\". <br/>\"The Labour party has been obsessed with quantity over quality and had been party of poor standards in education,\" he said. <br/>The idea originated in a 2018 review set up under then-Prime Minister Theresa May. The same review also suggested that more money needed to be pumped into education and that tuition fees needed to be cut - but these are not being implemented.<br/>The new pledge comes ahead of three by-elections in Conservative-held seats on Thursday.<br/>The government also announced it would reduce the maximum fees universities can charge for classroom-based foundation-year courses, from \u00a39,250 to \u00a35,760. In 2021/22, 29,080 students were studying a foundation degree.<br/>Foundation year courses are designed to help prepare students for degrees with specific entry requirements or knowledge, such as medicine and veterinary sciences. <br/>However, the government said research suggested too many people were encouraged to take a foundation year in some subjects like business, where it was not necessary. <br/>University Alliance, which represents professional and technical universities, said cutting fees for foundation year courses was \"disappointingly regressive\" and \"makes them financially unviable to deliver\". <br/>Chief executive Vanessa Wilson said: \"Disadvantaged students and the 'Covid generation' will lose out if this provision is reduced or lost.\"<br/>She added that the government had chosen \"to berate one of the few UK sectors which is genuinely world-leading\". <br/>Mr Sunak said: \"The UK is home to some of the best universities in the world and studying for a degree can be immensely rewarding. <br/>\"But too many young people are being sold a false dream and end up doing a poor-quality course at the taxpayers' expense that doesn't offer the prospect of a decent job at the end of it.\"<br/>Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: \"These new measures will crack down on higher education providers that continue to offer poor quality courses and send a clear signal that we will not allow students to be sold a false promise.\"<br/>University student complaints hit another record high<br/>'Dumbed down' courses 'take advantage' of students<br/>How much will university cost me?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It also warned that cost-cutting and inaccurate modelling of future demand could mean new hospitals are too small.<br/>The health department remained \"firmly committed\" to delivering the England building pledge, a spokesperson said.<br/>But Labour called the report \"damning\".<br/>The hospitals plan was a Conservative manifesto commitment during the December 2019 election campaign, and it was made policy the following year. <br/>When the health department officially set out the plan in October 2020, eight hospital construction projects already under way were not included in the target. But recent government statements about building 40 new hospitals include these eight projects, referred to as \"legacy hospitals\". <br/>And in May, the government changed the scope of the scheme to include hospitals in urgent need of repairs, including five judged to be at risk of collapse because of crumbling concrete infrastructure.<br/>Now the National Audit Office has analysed the plans and found that, by the definition set out in 2020, the target will be missed, and only 32 will be built in time. The NAO said the government has used a \"broad\" definition of \"new\", which includes refurbishment of existing buildings as well as completely new hospitals.<br/>The 32 that will be built in time include 24 from the original new hospitals programme, five that were added in May, and three new mental health hospitals. <br/>It said a further eight do not count towards the original definition of \"new\" because they were already under way when the commitment was made.<br/>Questions have been asked for some time about whether the programme is on track and it is significant that the watchdog has now ruled that, judged by the original template, it is not.<br/>In May, a BBC News investigation found that building work had not started on 33 of the projects. <br/>The NAO said staff shortages mean a planned design for a standardised hospital has been delayed until May 2024.<br/>It also warned that a push to meet the target at the lowest possible cost - combined with optimistic forecasts about how much care will be outside hospitals in the future - could result in new hospitals that are too small.<br/>The government had failed to achieve good value for money, the NAO said, as it called for a review of the underlying assumptions behind the plans to make sure the new hospitals are fit for purpose.<br/>Health Secretary Steve Barclay had already told MPs in May that some of the original group included in the new hospitals programme might not be completed by 2030.<br/>He made the admission as he updated the department's building plans to deal with hospitals built with a lightweight concrete that was used in the 1980s and is now judged to be unsafe.<br/>But he restated the commitment to deliver 40 new hospitals by the end of the decade.<br/>Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said the programme included \"innovative plans\" to improve efficiency and quality. But there are important lessons to ensure future major projects were affordable, transparent and delivered on time, he said.<br/>Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, urged the government to \"shift gears\" to get the hospitals built and warned that costs had \"spiralled due to high inflation\".<br/>He said many NHS trusts were \"deeply disappointed\" by delays and said the government \"could have better managed expectations about the funding available, given the uncertainty involved and the impact of inflation\".<br/>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the \"utterly damning report demolishes the government's claims to be building 40 'new hospitals'\".<br/>She called on the health secretary to make an urgent statement in Parliament addressing its findings, saying \"the public deserves answers\".<br/>Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The Conservatives have overpromised, under-delivered, and they've been found out. <br/>\"Meanwhile patients are being treated in outdated, crumbling hospitals.\"<br/>A health department spokesperson said: \"The NAO's report acknowledges that despite changes to the original programme, 40 new hospitals are still expected to be delivered by 2030 and praises the programme's innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, deliver efficiencies and improve quality.<br/>\"We remain firmly committed to delivering these hospitals, which are now expected to be backed by over \u00a320 billion of investment, helping to cut waiting lists so people can get the treatment they need quicker.<br/>\"Three new hospitals have already opened and more will open this year so patients and staff can benefit from major new hospital buildings, equipped with the latest technology.\" <br/>Work yet to start on 33 of 40 new hospitals<br/>Ministers set out plan to train and keep more NHS staff<br/>NHS waiting lists hit record high in England<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

They as good as broke our public services, they've created a situation in which wages have been stagnant for many, many years and they need to sort out this mess.\"<br/>Public sector workers including teachers, police and doctors have been offered pay rises of between 5% and 7%, with junior doctors in England in line for 6%. <br/>Four education unions said the deal would allow them to end their pay disputes and that they would advise members to accept the offer. <br/>However, junior doctors in England have asked for a 35% rise to make up for years of below-inflation increases. <br/>Their latest walkout, which lasts five days, runs until Tuesday. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Starmer: We would negotiate and settle pay dispute<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the pay offer is \"final\" and a \"fair deal\" for workers and taxpayers, adding that the government was supporting the NHS with record funding. <br/>A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \"The Conservatives' reckless mismanagement of the economy has driven our public services into the ground.<br/>\"Liberal Democrats would invest in our NHS, schools and local services, to give people a fair deal and get our economy back on the right track.\"<br/>Sir Keir also confirmed his party would not change the two-child benefit cap, which generally restricts tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in a family.<br/>He had previously supported scrapping the cap before he was Labour leader. <br/>He would not commit to unfreezing housing benefit, saying the party would set out its policy before the election. <br/>Momentum, the left-wing campaign group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn when he was Labour leader, said fixing the \"mess\" left by the Conservatives \"requires real ambition\", \"real investment in our decaying infrastructure\" and \"an end to the scourge of low pay\". <br/>It described the two-child benefit cap as \"a heinous policy\" and called for it to be scrapped. <br/>Mick Lynch, head of the RMT union, which is not affiliated to Labour, said many people could not \"spot the difference\" between Labour and the Conservatives.<br/>\"He's got to show that he's on the side of working people and progressive politics, and I don't think we're seeing that,\" he told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. <br/>Sir Keir was also challenged over his commitment to combatting climate change,after the party rowed back on a pledge to invest \u00a328bn a year in green industries if it wins power. <br/>Instead the party says it will ramp up investment over time, reaching \u00a328bn a year after 2027, arguing it needs to be responsible with the public finances. <br/>The Labour leader insisted he still had \"a massive agenda when it comes to climate change\" and that the party was committed to its aim of generating all electricity without using fossil fuels by 2030. <br/>\"It's the outcome that matters\u2026 the funding isn't the sole issue,\" he added. <br/>Be bolder, Unite union leader urges Starmer<br/>Kuenssberg: What could go wrong for Keir Starmer?<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The Asia Pacific is going to be responsible for at least 50% of global growth that we're expecting between now and 2035.\"<br/>The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.<br/>As it announced the signing of the deal, the government said CPTPP-owned businesses employed about 400,000 people across the UK.<br/>It also said that CPTPP companies \"punch above their weight economically\", as while they account for 0.3% of all businesses in the UK, they generate 6.1% of total turnover.<br/>Business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the deal was \"good news for UK businesses to enter or upscale their trade in these markets\".<br/>\"We see particular relevance for small- and medium-sized businesses in reduced costs to import components from member countries to use in manufactured goods for export,\" said William Bain, the BCC's head of trade policy.<br/>However, there have been some doubts expressed. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC trade union body, said the pact was \"bad for workers at home and abroad\".<br/>\"Once again, Conservative ministers have turned a blind eye to egregious human and workers' rights abuses in their pursuit of trade deals,\" he said.<br/>Concern has also been expressed over how the UK intends to make sure that environmental and animal welfare standards are met.<br/>The chair of the John Lewis Partnership, Dame Sharon White, told the Laura Kuenssberg programme that she would like to hear more on the impact on British farmers.<br/>She said she would want to be sure that \"we're not undercutting British farmers, we are not undercutting great animal welfare standards in this country that we've had for many, many years\".<br/>\"I think that matters to many people.\"<br/>Overall, she said that while signing the CPTPP was \"obviously a positive\u2026 I don't think it's going to be a gangbusters substantive shift\".<br/>Questioned on why the UK has not yet signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, Ms Badenoch said that was due to the change in government.<br/>\"Yes, it was expected that we would sign an FTA with the US, but that was with a different president.  You cannot force a country to do something if its administration changes.\"<br/>On the issue of whether China should be allowed to join the CPTPP, Ms Badenoch said that was \"one of the things that we have been discussing\".<br/>However, when pressed on whether the UK should veto China's membership, as some have suggested, she said: \"When you join a club, the very first thing you don't do is tell the other club members who should be or shouldn't be allowed to join.\"<br/>UK agrees to join Asia's trade club - but what is it?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Green New Deal,\" it read.<br/>Sir Keir assured the activists he would meet them to discuss their demands, as they were hastily ushered off stage.<br/>More than a week on, the meeting still has not happened and now activists from the group are lining up fresh attempts to grab his attention.<br/>On Friday, activists staged sit-outs outside the constituency offices of Sir Keir, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and deputy leader Angela Rayner. They plan to continue these protests until Labour's annual party conference in October, and are not ruling out further disruption - including interrupting speeches - if Sir Keir fails to meet their demands.<br/>\"We're escalating our campaign against Labour now, because we want to influence their manifesto,\" says Hannah Martin, co-director of Green New Deal Rising.<br/>\"We want what they offer to voters to be something bold.\"<br/>Labour says it is already offering voters something bold - a plan to turn Britain into a \"clean energy superpower\".<br/>The plan involves creating a publicly owned energy company, insulating millions of homes, and using a national wealth fund to build green industries.<br/>\"Labour is the only party with a long-term mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower to cut bills, create jobs, provide energy security, and tackle the climate emergency,\" a Labour spokesperson said.<br/>The BBC has been told Green New Deal Rising has been offered a meeting with party officials, but has shown no interest.<br/>Instead, the group appears to have its sights set on Sir Keir and those at the top of the party. With no time for a chat in Gillingham, the wait for a meeting goes on.<br/>\"We were removed from the building,\" says Sophia Coningham, one of the activists involved in the Gillingham stunt.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Climate change protesters interrupt Sir Keir Starmer speech calling for a \"green new deal right now\"<br/>She says they gatecrashed the speech to remind Sir Keir that, \"to really stand up for young people, they need to commit to a green new deal\".<br/>\"There's a feeling that Labour is backsliding,\" says Ms Coningham, an 18-year-old who has just finished her A-levels.<br/>So what is a green new deal?<br/>Campaigners say it's a set of policy proposals to address the root causes of climate change while promoting a more sustainable model of economic growth. It harks back to the New Deal economic programme of 1930s US president Franklin D Roosevelt, and more recently, it's an idea that's been revived and modernised by Democratic politicians in the United States.<br/>It's been fiercely opposed by Republicans there. Donald Trump cast the Green New Deal as a socialist \"takeover\" when he was in the White House. <br/>Back in the UK, the idea has been floating around for more than a decade, with campaign groups and left-wing MPs - including Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband - calling for different flavours of a green new deal.<br/>For the Conservatives, what they see as the economic dangers of funding such green policies through borrowing have been deployed as a political attack line against Labour.<br/>By the time Green New Deal Rising emerged in 2021, the notion of an economic approach centred on clean energy had entered the political mainstream.<br/>Even so, since its launch, the group of about 500 organisers and young climate activists has been lobbying Labour and claims its campaigning has influenced the party's energy policies.<br/>Now it is trying to push Labour to go even further.<br/>\"Part of why we took action last week was that we want to see a future government that's committed to the green new deal,\" says Ms Martin. \"We're not going to be silent.\"<br/>In a campaign targeted at Labour, Green New Deal Rising has put five demands to the party. One Labour source argues that two of the five demands - \"expand public ownership\" and \"tax wealth now\" - are not related to green policies.<br/>The other three demands include creating more green jobs, setting up a national nature service, and making polluting companies pay.<br/>\"What they're asking for isn't radical,\" says Labour MP Clive Lewis. \"If you look at the science, and what that's showing us on climate change, then their asks are quite mild.\"<br/>He describes recent briefings against activists as \"attempts by some close to the [Labour] leadership to put some distance between them and the climate movement\".<br/>With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accusing Sir Keir of being in the pocket of \"eco-zealots\", some senior Labour figures have begun lashing out at climate protesters, with the Labour leader himself branding Just Stop Oil \"arrogant\".<br/>Mr Lewis says he hopes activists from Green New Deal Rising have \"done everything to engage with Labour MPs\" before resorting to disruptive tactics.<br/>\"If they feel they have no option but to do this, then that's their prerogative,\" he says. \"The danger is that this pushes politicians into a corner where they might react in a negative way. Politicians are human.\"<br/>If disruptive tactics became more commonplace, it's possible a more antagonistic relationship could develop between Labour and climate activists. <br/>That could risk alienating some younger voters, as Ms Coningham explains.<br/>\"I think Labour has to earn my vote and that means signing up to our demands,\" she says. \"Labour need to stop taking young people's votes for granted.\"<br/>Voters from younger generations who care about the climate are a big constituency and one that Labour will want to win over. As things stands, a more radical Labour plan on energy and climate seems unlikely, given the financial discipline the party has been signalling.<br/>But with the Labour manifesto yet to be completed, there is still time for minds to be changed - and a meeting or two perhaps.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Why has Labour U-turned on its green pledge?<br/>Sir Keir Starmer sets out Labour's green energy strategy<br/>Two dead after 'emergency' on Crimea bridge<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

This can happen, for example, when an MP dies or resigns.<br/>These by-elections are the result of three MPs stepping down in the wake of separate controversies.  <br/>Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, announced he would resign his seat after he was handed a report from a committee of MPs investigating whether he lied to Parliament about Partygate - the series of Covid lockdown parties in Downing Street. Those MPs recommended a tough punishment that could have led to him facing a by-election.<br/>Nigel Adams, MP for Selby and Ainsty, was a close ally of Mr Johnson and announced he would be stepping down a day later. His move came amid controversy over Mr Johnson's resignation honours list, on which Mr Adams did not appear. <br/>The third by-election in Somerton and Frome came about because its former MP, David Warburton, resigned after admitting taking cocaine. Mr Warburton has also been accused of making unwanted advances towards two women, which led to his suspension from the Conservative Party in April last year. A re-investigation has been ordered into the allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denies. <br/>You can read a list of all the candidates in Selby and Ainsty,Somerton and Frome, and Uxbridge and South Ruislip by following the links.<br/>The mood among Conservative MPs going into these by-elections is low. Expectations lean towards losing all three contests.<br/>Despite this, there is little appetite for yet another leadership challenge, BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley says. <br/>But three defeats would re-ignite the debate about what is going wrong for the Tory Party and how to fix it.<br/>With sustained, large leads in national opinion polls, Labour wants to show it is on course to win the next general election and has enough momentum to take seats from the Conservatives in by-elections.<br/>Sir Keir Starmer's party has particularly targeted Uxbridge and South Ruislip, and Selby and Ainsty. <br/>But in Somerton and Frome, the Liberal Democrats were well ahead of Labour in the 2019 general election, and are expected to be the main challengers. <br/>Sir Ed Davey's party will be looking to build on a series of by-election victories since 2021, when it has overturned big Tory majorities in Chesham and Amersham, North Shropshire, and Tiverton and Honiton. <br/>Could the Conservatives lose five by-elections?<br/>Selby and Ainsty by-election candidates confirmed<br/>Candidates named for Somerton by-election contest<br/>Uxbridge by-election full candidate list revealed<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Opposition sources speculate there could be as many as 30 government defeats by the time the bill bounces back to MPs in the autumn.<br/>The end of term is often a moment for internal matters, and on Wednesday MPs will debate a significant tightening of the rules for all-party parliamentary groups. <br/>There are hundreds of these cross-party organisations of MPs and peers, on topics ranging from diseases to sports, to cycling and beer.  <br/>Some are little more than social organisations, others have serious influence on policy and legislation - a good recent example is the APPG on Autism, under the late Dame Cheryl Gillan, which saw a private member's bill passed and then pushed ministers for action to help people with autism. <br/>The concern is that some APPGs may act as a conduit for outside interests, including foreign governments, to influence Parliament or the UK government. <br/>So new rules are being proposed to sharpen MPs' responsibility for the running of APPGs, with the focus on those groups receiving financial benefits. <br/>Those APPGs will be required to register them, and the new rules would ban foreign governments from financing the secretariats of APPGs (MPs who serve as officers of an APPG will be expected to exercise due diligence in checking where their funding comes from).<br/>In the Lords, some of those who received peerages in Boris Johnson's resignation honours list will take their seats, starting with his former political secretary Ben Gascoigne and former London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey when the Lords sits on Tuesday.<br/>On Thursday, it will be the turn of former Conservative Party political director Ross Kempsell, and Kulveer Ranger, who was Mr Johnson's director of transport policy when he was mayor of London.<br/>Finally, with the end of term in sight, committee action is concentrated on Monday and Tuesday, and there are some important select committee reports to watch out for. <br/>On Tuesday, the Public Accounts Committee reports on the awarding of Covid contracts to PPE Medpro, following a Commons vote last year calling on the government to release correspondence, documents and advice to the committee. <br/>And then there's the publication of the Defence Select Committee's six-month inquiry into the UK's defence procurement system, which was led by Conservative former minister and sub-committee chair Mark Francois. <br/>Having watched some of the hearings, it's hard to imagine they're going to conclude that all's well, and Mr Francois is an experienced parliamentary guerrilla, who can be expected to follow up their findings with continued pressure on ministers - watch out for an intervention at PMQs if Mr Speaker gives him the chance. <br/>Elsewhere, the Transport Committee has re-opened its call for evidence for its inquiry into accessible transport, after train operating companies announced plans to close over 300 ticket offices across the rail network. <br/>Commons: (14:30) Education Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following at 15:30.<br/>Main debate: MPs respond to Lords amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill - where peers are still pressing nine issues, including child detention, protection for LGBT refugees, safe and legal routes for asylum seekers, and more. There will also be ping-pong on the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill - where the main outstanding issue is on the consultation required before minimum service levels are set. There will be an hour set aside for each bill.<br/>Westminster Hall: (16:30) MPs consider a petition urging the government to give teaching assistants a pay rise.<br/>Committees: Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16.00) ends its inquiry into financial reporting and audit in local authorities, with questions to local government minister Lee Rowley. With more councils in effect going bankrupt, they will ask whether there is an auditing crisis in England's councils and examine the future role of the Auditing, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA).<br/>Lords: (14:30) It's the last of four days of report stage debate on the Online Safety Bill. No votes are expected. There's also a slot to allow peers to consider the latest Commons amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill.<br/>Commons: It's Foreign Office Questions at 11:30. The DUP's Jim Shannon will present a ten-minute rule bill to require a report on increasing the income threshold for the high-income Child Benefit Charge in line with inflation. Labour's Richard Burgon will present a bill to ban MPs from receiving financial or other benefits from oil and gas companies. This will happen without debate, but there's an interesting sense of a marker going down. <br/>Main debate: Further consideration of more Lords amendments to assorted bills, including the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, where the government lost votes on immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with the proposed new mechanism for investigating historic crimes, and on minimum investigation standards. Peers are not scheduled to respond to any changes made by the Commons until September.  <br/>Committees: Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs (10.00) looks at the government's new smartphone-based public warning system with its siren-like emergency alerts, after the nationwide test in April failed to reach an estimated 7 per cent of compatible devices.<br/>The Lords Communications Committee (14:30) questions BBC Director-General Tim Davie and acting chair Dame Elan Closs Stephens on BBC leadership. As they delicately put it: \"In light of recent events, what concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the BBC's governance arrangements, and how it is addressing these?\"<br/>Lords: (14:30) It's day three of seven of report stage debate on the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill, with votes expected on the devolution of bus services, an attempt to scrap the proposed new Infrastructure Levy (over concerns that it will not do enough to provide affordable housing), and a new clause on the governance of national parks from Conservative peer Lord Randall.<br/>Peers are also preparing for a long night processing Commons amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill, with restaurants and bars opening late, and hot snacks available until half an hour after the close of business. <br/>Commons: (11:30) Science, Innovation and Technology Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time.<br/>Main debate: More ping-pong with the Lords, followed by a debate on proposed new rules for all-party parliamentary groups (see above).<br/>Committees: Health (10.00) continues its future cancer inquiry with evidence on the new cutting-edge technologies that could boost earlier cancer diagnosis, including the NHS-Galleri blood test, which could change cancer screening. Home Affairs (10.00) concludes its inquiry into human trafficking with evidence from safeguarding minister Sara Dines on how potential victims of trafficking and modern slavery are supported.<br/>Lords: (15:00) It's day five of five of report stage debate on the Online Safety Bill. If the schedule holds and peers complete report consideration today, the bill will have its third reading immediately after they return from their summer recess in early September. There's also another slot available for consideration of Commons amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill.<br/>Commons: (09:30) Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission (the administrative body of the House), the Public Accounts Commission, the Restoration and Renewal Client Board (which represents MPs and peers' views in the mega-project to revamp Parliament's main buildings) and the Electoral Commission. <br/>Then comes the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda, from the Leader of the House - this time setting out what MPs will be debating when they return after recess.<br/>Main debate: It's the Sir David Amess summer adjournment debate - the traditional end of term debate, in which any MP can raise any subject they choose, named in honour of the murdered veteran MP.<br/>Lords: (11:00) Day four of seven of report stage on the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill.

I've spent well over seven years with three phones by my bed.\" <br/>He suggested in the interview that he would continue to call for higher defence spending, something he has campaigned for throughout his time in the role.<br/>It comes weeks after Mr Wallace said he was no longer in the running to be the next secretary general of Nato, a role he was widely reported to be seeking. <br/>The announcement that Jens Stoltenberg would be continuing in the job effectively ended his hopes of becoming the next head of the military bloc.<br/>Mr Wallace has played a vocal role in supporting Ukraine, including overseeing the transfer of weapons and vehicles to its army.<br/>His position as defence secretary when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw his profile increase at home and abroad.<br/>Mr Wallace has served longer in the role than any Conservative defence secretary before him, but told the Sunday Times he was conscious of the impact the job has had on his family.<br/>Mr Wallace told the newspaper: \"While I am proud to have worked with so many amazing people and helped contribute to protecting this great country, the cost of putting that ahead of my family is something I am very sad about.\"<br/>Before entering politics as a member of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Mr Wallace served in the Army as an Officer in the Scots Guards. <br/>He was first elected to the Commons in 2005, and previously served as a minister in the Northern Ireland department and in the Home Office.<br/>What is next for him is unclear.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ben Wallace says he will not be next Nato chief<br/>Ben Wallace: We need to invest in defence properly<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

There had been years of vicious infighting, and agonies over antisemitism. <br/>By any measure, restoring the party to a credible political organisation is an enormous accomplishment. <br/>Without question, Sir Keir has been helped by the Conservatives' rolling series of crises - the chaos of Boris Johnson's downfall, the market meltdown of Liz Truss' several dozens of days in office, and now the profound problems in the economy. <br/>But even with the much more ordered regime of Rishi Sunak, Labour has managed to stay significantly ahead in the polls, making important advances in local elections, and soon to be tested again in a flurry of by-elections you can read about here. <br/>As a result of a solid and sustained opinion poll lead, Labour is thinking not just about how to win anymore, but in detail about what they would do if they get there. <br/>Sir Keir is the first to warn of complacency, repeatedly telling his team to fight \"like they are five points behind\". <br/>But there is no question he is mulling over how he would govern. <br/>\"He is thinking, I want to be ready and I want to be a good prime minister,\" says an ally. <br/>Another source tells me he is already using a red box system, like a prime minister would. <br/>\"Everything goes in by late afternoon with a hard deadline and he spends his evenings poring over papers, ideas, drafts, or submissions\", all dealt with by the morning. <br/>But it may be more than a year still until he has the chance to swap the bag that holds his papers for a real government red box. And there is still an awful lot that could go wrong. <br/>Sensing the opportunity and worrying it could go south is \"scary as hell\", says a shadow minister. <br/>There is a widespread awareness that Labour's massive lead now is likely to narrow as a general election comes closer. <br/>The Tories \"aren't dead\", says one shadow minister and their party HQ has one of the most successful campaign fighting records in the Western world.  <br/>And the first rule of politics is always, learn to count. <br/>A whopping national poll lead does not automatically translate into winning many more seats in a general election, as one Labour MP in a tightly-fought constituency worries - \"The biggest danger is that you rack up big majorities and don't seal the deal with enough of the seats\". <br/>Sir Keir's team can't change the fact that Labour fell so far behind in 2019 that winning an overall majority isn't just climbing a mountain, more scaling the Himalayas. They also of course, like any political organisation, can't control unforeseen events that can shape how voters make decisions.<br/>Not much however is without risk, even issues that ought to be within Starmer's control. <br/>First, one source half jokes what could go wrong is \"The Labour Party\"! <br/>The danger is \"it loses discipline and focus and makes unforced errors\", they tell me. <br/>\"It's been 20 years since we won a general election\", they add, and the party simply doesn't have the habit. <br/>A shadow minister says \"we have to hold our nerve\" and not make any mistakes, or give into pressure from the left of the party. <br/>The leadership has been accused of control freakery, trying to suppress the left, expelling party members unfairly. <br/>But a source says the danger of disputes with the left is \"way down the risk register\", the focus has to be on potential voters. <br/>One shadow minister believes Sir Keir thinks \"I can't be in government and dependent on these people\".<br/>The logic goes that battles with the left over who gets to run as a Labour MP now are well worth having to avoid having an awkward squad that could make life difficult in Parliament later. Particularly if Labour has to try to run the country as a minority government or with a tiny majority.<br/>The leadership's most central strategy is one of the reasons why there are grumbles on the left - and that is risky too. <br/>As we heard from Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves last week, and Sir Keir is likely to argue in our interview on Sunday morning, Labour has put watching the pennies strictly at the top of its list. <br/>With the economy in serious trouble, they share some of the ethos of the current government, however uncomfortable that might feel, that now is not the time for huge spending or huge tax cuts. <br/>That discipline means the party has dropped or watered down some promises that activists loved - the plan for free university tuition in England, delaying big spending proposals for green projects. <br/>No-one is getting promises from Rachel Reeves' cheque book, as we talked about last week.<br/>It has had an effect on the leader's reputation. <br/>One union leader says Starmer has \"had the blame for shifts in policy that have made him look a bit shifty\". <br/>And there is concern that all the talk of keeping a lid on spending on what Keir Starmer once described as \"good Labour things\" will lead voters to wonder what Labour really would offer. <br/>Another senior figure tells me: \"The economy is on its knees - sitting there saying, we are very sensible, who is going to listen to that?\"<br/>There is also a question of the political argument being made.<br/>Keir Starmer and his team have made the case for many years that the deep roots of many of the country's problems relate to the austerity of the coalition years, when George Osborne kept strict limits on spending. <br/>But if Labour's plan does not include filling in the holes financially to undo that damage, does that stack up? <br/>One of his MPs, not from the far left of the party, ponders \"it is pretty hard to criticise this government without acknowledging the damage that austerity has caused, and then not say you would spend more\u2026 no-one really believes that he wouldn't spend more\".  As Labour approaches its National Policy Forum next week, an important powwow with activists and unions, calls for more ambition, like from the leader of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, may become familiar.  <br/>The leadership's answer? <br/>Stressing the importance of reforming and improving public services, and getting the economy growing without spending billions extra and certainly not borrowing without good reason. <br/>Labour's top team is stuck like glue to the idea that they have to show they would keep a tight grip on public spending, almost as if they are traumatised by past elections when the Conservatives have run the attack that they would splash the cash. <br/>A senior figure suggests the leadership is \"very nervous about making any wrong moves on the economy\". <br/>But those at the top believe the messiness of the past few months, particularly the rising cost of mortgages, make discipline even more important. <br/>One shadow minister says: \"The mortgage stuff hits homeowners in places like Stevenage and Luton, swing voters, who are looking for people who are serious on the economy.\"<br/>But insiders acknowledge turning discipline into electoral excitement might not be easy. Making promises about abstract reform doesn't necessarily get voters running to the polling booths. <br/>As Parliament packs up for the summer, there is no question that Sir Keir Starmer has cause to be confident. His party is well ahead, but risk is all around. <br/>There are traps to avoid, big decisions to take, many thousands of miles of campaigning still to go.  <br/>With less time to play football, the Labour leader now tries to stay in a hotel with a gym, to run on a treadmill. <br/>After more than three years in the job, even having clocked up many successes, he knows the journey to the job he craves in Number 10 is still a marathon, not a sprint. <br/>Follow Laura on Twitter<br/>Two dead after 'emergency' on Crimea bridge<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It is expected to be towed to Portland in the coming days.<br/>The BBC's west of England correspondent Dan Johnson has been to see how people on the island are reacting to this new and controversial government policy. <br/>\"They think Portland's a dumping ground,\" Charles Richards says. <br/>\"They've dumped it here because they think we don't matter and they think we won't make a fuss. Portland has been treated with contempt.\"<br/>The 78-year-old has lived his entire life on the island.<br/>We settle on his garden wall overlooking the port where he worked for the Ministry of Defence (MoD), packing missiles. It seems everyone here is connected to the military or the prison service.<br/>\"Portland has always been exploited,\" he continues. <br/>\"The stone firms exploited the land and dug great holes in it. The MoD exploited it to make fortifications and naval bases. The government used it for prisoners. We've had people dumped on us for a long time.\"<br/>Portland is one of those places on the edge, an extremity of England dangling from the Dorset coast by the fine thread of Chesil beach. <br/>I notice a sign in a neighbour's window: \"Keep Portland weird.\" <br/>It only takes 10 minutes to drive from end to end, but it is not insular and there's a sense this rugged, weather-beaten landscape bears more than its fair share of our national weight.<br/>Between the quarries that sent bright, white stone to face Buckingham Palace and St Paul's Cathedral sits His Majesty's Prison The Verne, home to 580 sex offenders - recently reported to include Gary Glitter. Then there's HMP Portland with another 500 inmates.<br/>Completing an unholy trinity of incarceration used to be the prison ship HMP Weare - a \"temporary measure\" to ease overcrowding that lasted eight years. Its 400 prisoners put the proportion of the island's population held behind bars then at 11%. <br/>Now another barge is heading for the same spot. It is the flagship of the government's latest plan to \"stop the boats\" and deter dangerous channel crossings. <br/>Dorset Council is receiving \u00a31.7m over the planned 18-month duration of the vessel's stay in the port - based on \u00a33,500 per bed space, with a further \u00a3377,000 available to fund support and activities its residents. <br/>Although Councillor Laura Beddow says the authority had \"serious concerns\" and believes Portland is the wrong place to site a barge, she admits: \"We are in a position where we have statutory services we must provide.\"<br/>The Home Office claims the vessel will ease the pressure on the asylum system.<br/>However, it has amassed opposition from a wide range of voices, here and beyond, and there is still hope a legal challenge could be mounted.<br/>\"People are worried about these young blokes,\" Mr Richards says.<br/>\"What are they going to be doing? Wandering about? We don't know what they'll get up to, where they're going to go, or who they're going to mix with. Are they going to be involved in drug dealing? It's something we don't need.\"<br/>I hear the same questions between the clanking bowls on the green at Victoria Gardens. <br/>\"Yes, they have to go somewhere,\" Kathy Smith agrees.<br/>\"But for a barge to come here\u2026 our infrastructure on the island is very difficult. We've got one road on, one road off. We have problems getting doctors' appointments as it is - will they get priority?\"<br/>The same concerns are echoed on protest banners, amplified in Facebook groups and aired during a fiery public meeting. <br/>Representatives of the town and county councils, the local NHS and Dorset Police face angry residents, joined on a temperamental video link by officials from the Home Office.<br/>One lady fears for the safety of women and girls. Another worries about conditions for those on board. There are questions about mental health support for the migrants, their spiritual wellbeing and how free they will be to come and go. <br/>Is this really cheaper than using hotels? What about security? And who should be guarded from who? <br/>Some reckon the drab accommodation block will put off tourists. Everyone - local officials included - are enraged by the lack of consultation. <br/>There are not many answers or much detail. The man from the Home Office describes an \"emergency situation\", saying the asylum seekers have all passed initial assessment and been checked against police and immigration databases. <br/>He talks about devising \"activities for those on board that help occupy their time productively\". There's derision. \"You're a liar and a coward,\" one man shouts.<br/>Then the discussion turns to the state of Portland's public services. \"It can take four weeks to see a doctor,\" a woman complains. There is no dentist and the pharmacy's overrun, the meeting hears. <br/>Some feel anti-social behaviour is beyond control already - the island has more lighthouses than police officers.<br/>The officials seem stunned. They promise more information and improved services but then they admit that all 500 men will have to be registered with GPs in the area. <br/>It is too much for one chap who bellows: \"If we go to our health centre and it is clogged up with asylum seekers there will be a kick back, because we are fed up to the back teeth. You can't even give us proper healthcare now. It's disgusting and you should be ashamed.\"<br/>In amongst these concerns are hints of prejudice and flashes of racism. Some want to make much broader points.<br/>\"These people are not refugees,\" another man shouts. <br/>\"They're not coming from a war-torn country, they are economic migrants.\" <br/>Ms Beddow suggests comments about immigration policy need to be directed to the government. <br/>As the chair struggles to wrap up the debate another man shouts one final comment: \"Where is your duty of care to us? We should come first.\"<br/>It is an awkward collision of central policy and local experience. It reveals a powerful sense of a community feeling forgotten, with emotions stirred by the very thing - the barge - designed to reassure voters that asylum seekers are not living in taxpayer-funded luxury.<br/>Back on the bowling green, Tim Munro, a former mayor of Portland, sums it up for me: \"We really don't want the nightmare scenario to come true, that we have lots of young men looking for things to do around the island.\" <br/>I question why his presumption is so negative.<br/>\"They can't work,\" he says. \"And clearly they're not going to sit on a boat in Portland Harbour all the time so what are they going to do? I don't know, so I can only imagine the bad things that might happen.\"<br/>Mr Munro reminds me the island accommodated thousands of young men when the Navy ran the port - \"boozing and doing what young men do,\" he says. But he cites longstanding maritime connections and the military police as reassuring counterbalances. <br/>Among the ironies mounting up on the island is the abandoned ruin of a former Navy accommodation block bearing down on us, opposite the port. <br/>A plan to house 750 asylum seekers there was rejected 20 years ago. <br/>I remind Mr Munro of the thousands of visitors during the Olympics, when Portland hosted the sailing.<br/>\"Those people shopped in Waitrose, came from Bath, travelled by train, took their rubbish home - they were all very civilised and nice people,\" he says.<br/>\"That's who comes to watch sailing at the Olympics. That's not what we've got now. We hope they'll turn out to be those lovely, nice people that don't impact very much on the local community. The only concern is the unknown, that's all.\"<br/>Stand Up To Racism is running its own campaign - \"Refugees welcome here: No to the prison barge,\" urging protestors to focus on the policy not the people. <br/>Carralyn Parkes is a labour councillor on Portland Town Council, currently serving as mayor. <br/>\"Our opposition has never been about asylum seekers,\" she says. <br/>\"These people will be treated with kindness, courtesy and respect and we will do everything in our power to make them feel welcome. <br/>\"It really isn't about being a Nimby (not in my back yard). <br/>\"It's about the accommodation being offered which is wholly unsuitable for people with complex needs. It's barbarous and inhumane.\" <br/>The town council has been clear in its opposition but also its powerlessness to resist.<br/>Back on the garden wall, Mr Richards describes the leaflet posted through his letterbox a few weeks ago, reminding residents the Navy still occasionally uses the port as a back-up berth for nuclear submarines. <br/>The sobering emergency plan informs everyone within a mile they will be handed iodine tablets if something goes wrong. <br/>\"Portland is a strange place,\" he concludes.<br/>\"A lot of weird things go on here.\"<br/>He tells me he is \"not a proper Portlander\" because - even though he was born here - his parents were incomers or \"kimberlin\". <br/>And now there are 500 more kimberlin - the as-yet unknown asylum seekers - who are voiceless and destined for the shelter of Portland's harbour with a storm raging around them.<br/>Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

For households who pay their bills by direct debit, the support was given automatically through monthly payments from October to March.<br/>But people who live off-grid, on narrow boats, travellers, people in park homes and some tenants and people on heat networks, did not automatically receive the support, because they did not have an energy provider. <br/>The government set up the Alternative Funding scheme for the over 900,000 households in those categories. It also applied to people living in care homes, who are charged for energy costs in their bills.<br/>But only 141,000 bill-payers managed to apply for and receive the subsidy before the scheme closed on 31 May. <br/>There remain 750,000 eligible households who have missed out on the \u00a3400 support payment.<br/>PHD student Sheree Smith said she spent more time at university than at her flat so she didn't have to pay higher energy bills.<br/>She told BBC Breakfast: \"I was really hoping that \u00a3400 would have helped me to weather the storm so I could stay in my flat, but ultimately it didn't come in time. <br/>\"I ended up having to return to my parents.\"<br/>Mr MacNeil, a former SNP member, who now sits as an independent and chairs Parliament's energy security and net zero committee, said the scheme should be improved and extended so that people could claim the subsidy they were entitled to.<br/>\"A lot of these will be vulnerable people who are particularly suffering the bite of the energy price spike and government should be moving heaven and earth almost, to make sure these people are getting the money,\" Mr MacNeil said in an interview with the BBC's Money Box programme.<br/>In his role as chair of the parliamentary committee, Mr MacNeil is due to question Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Grant Shapps in September. Mr MacNeil said he would ask him to relaunch the scheme and make it easier to use, since \"clearly delivery has failed\".<br/>Some applicants criticised the scheme for being too complex or not recognising their circumstances. Others said their applications were repeatedly rejected, despite being eligible.<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter, covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill.<br/>\"We're now seeing costs fall even further with wholesale energy prices down by over two thirds since their peak.\"<br/>You can hear more on this story on the Money Box podcast after broadcast.<br/>Follow Money Box or Dan on Twitter.<br/>More than 700,000 miss out on energy bill support<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

If they push those ideas, politicians tend to move when they speak to voters.\"  <br/>Her over-arching criticism is that Labour's leadership is not setting out a distinctive enough alternative to the government, and feels too constrained by the state of the economy.<br/>She argued that \"we need be as bold as the 1945 Labour government\" which created the NHS. \"There wasn't much money about then, I can tell you,\" she said. <br/>The next Labour government could leave a lasting legacy, she suggested. <br/>\"People will say they remember when energy companies were privatised and when they paid massive bills, and it was a Labour government that stopped all that.\"  <br/>The Labour leadership would argue that unless the party is trusted on the economy, many of the things trade unions want - like increased employment rights - simply won't happen.<br/>Its strategists also believe that it has to be seen to be moving away from Corbyn-era policies to win back voters who abandoned the party in 2019.<br/>But Ms Graham told me that abiding strictly by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves's \"fiscal rules\" had led to \"inertia\", and people were beginning to ask: \"What's the difference?\" between government and opposition.<br/>\"If Labour are saying what's happening now is awful, and it is absolutely awful, they have to come out with solutions to that.\"<br/>While Labour is criticising the number of children in poverty, its shadow ministers have been told they can't commit, for example, to provide free school meals for all primary children, because that would be a spending commitment. <br/>Ms Graham said the party must \"talk about what they can do to change Britain. People want something to vote for.\"<br/>She told her members this week that maintaining Unite's financial link to Labour would give her \"maximum leverage\" with the party.<br/>But so far she hasn't moved policy on energy and steel. So by guaranteeing funds to Sir Keir Starmer, wasn't she actually reducing her bargaining power?<br/>\"The affiliation fee is what you pay to be part of the club. But most of the money we gave Labour traditionally was outside the affiliation fee,\" she said. <br/>For example, the union donated an additional \u00a33m to Labour before the last election. <br/>But Ms Graham warned there were \"no blank cheques\".<br/>\"I want to see some movement if we are going to give what we usually give...

It says nearly 300m e-cigarettes (disposable and otherwise) were sold in the UK over the last year. <br/>Elfbar and Lost Mary, which are made by the same Chinese firm, Shenzhen Imiracle Technology Co, made up more than half that number. That is an increase of more than four times compared to their sales the year before. <br/>Councillor David Fothergill, chairman of the LGA\u2019s Community Wellbeing Board, said: \u201cDisposable vapes are fundamentally flawed in their design and inherently unsustainable products, meaning an outright ban will prove more effective than attempts to recycle more vapes.\u201d<br/>Councils are not against vaping altogether as they believe vapes are less harmful than tobacco and can help smokers to quit.<br/>John Dunne, director general of the UK Vaping Industry Association, said that the \u201clow price, accessibility and ease of use\u201d of disposable products had helped bring UK smoking rates to an \"all-time low\u201d.<br/>\u201cThe vape industry is working hard to minimise its environmental impact, but this is mainly a consumer education issue about how to dispose of used vapes, which overall are evidenced to be highly recyclable,\" he said.<br/>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Disposables have been around for well over a decade and provide a low priced accessible product that helps smokers to quit smoking tobacco.\".<br/>A blanket ban could see \u201cpotentially deadly\u201d black market products flood the UK, Mr Dunne warned.<br/>Selling vapes and e-cigarettes to under 18s is illegal in the UK.<br/>Lancashire County Council director of public health Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said vaping had originally been seen as a way to curtail the harm caused by tobacco, but said there was a marketing problem.<br/>He told BBC Breakfast the advertising was \"unvetted and unscrupulous\".<br/>Councils are also worried that disposable varieties with \u201cfruity and bubble gum flavours, and colourful child-friendly packaging\u201d could appeal to under-age vapers, and called for restrictions on their display and marketing, similar to those used for conventional tobacco.<br/>The anti-smoking charity ASH said it did not support a ban, as it would \"turbo-charge\" illegal sales, increasing the risk that children would be able to buy them. It favours higher taxes on disposables and stronger controls on import and sales, deputy chief executive Hazel Cheeseman said.<br/>A spokeswoman for Elfbar said the firm is working on developing a \"comprehensive programme\" to safeguard and protect children.<br/>\"Simply calling for a ban on single use vapes will do nothing to tackle these issues,\" she said.<br/>\"The illicit market will simply fill the void with products that are unlicensed and unregulated containing substances that potentially pose a health risk.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said it was also concerned about the use of vaping products, particularly among young people. Earlier this year it launched a consultation looking into the environmental and health impacts of vaping, and is considering responses.<br/>\u201cWe strongly encourage all consumers to consider the environment and dispose of electrical waste, including by making use of take-back schemes at participating retailers,\u201d the spokesperson said.<br/>In Scotland, Lorna Slater, Minister for Circular Economy, said in June that single use vapes had become a \"big problem - for our environment, local communities and young people,\u201d and promised to announce new plans in the autumn. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Millions of vapes littered in Scotland, says report<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>New measures to crack down on illegal teen vaping<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Yes, they are high by historic standards too.<br/>So how is this being paid for?<br/>Ministers have been scrabbling about looking for money within existing budgets. The additional cost of these plans is around \u00a32bn.<br/>About half of that, they hope, will be raised by cranking up the cost of visas and the surcharge that migrants have to pay to use the NHS.<br/>What about the other half, the best part of a billion pounds?<br/>This is the chunk being looked for by what are described by those in government as \"underspends and reallocations.\"<br/>They are not keen on using the word cuts.<br/>Whatever the word you use, what this amounts to is money that had been allocated to one pot, being taken out of it and put into the pay pots.<br/>The government, just like the rest of us, can't spend the same pound twice.<br/>And so the priority has still to be decided. So, what won't be happening because of these pay rises that might otherwise have happened?<br/>Officials haven't given many examples, even though the process of moving money around has been completed.<br/>Two of the examples offered are a freeze on civil servant recruitment in the Ministry of Defence and offering fewer traineeships in the civil service.<br/>And where are Labour in all this? <br/>It is striking that Keir Starmer did not directly criticise the government's announcement. They are offers for workers and unions to consider and he had little to add, he said.<br/>The big question now is what difference will these pay offers make?

To be able to talk to somebody face-on, to be able to smile at somebody, is something I haven't done for several years.\"<br/>Disappearing Dentists<br/>Some people are going to extraordinary measure to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer<br/>Ensuring that everyone who needs an NHS dentist is able to access one within a reasonable timeframe and a reasonable distance, is one of the key recommendations in the report.<br/>Other recommendations include:<br/>\"We are concerned this will be too little too late for those dentists who have already left the NHS,\" the report says. <br/>It adds the current dental contract, which pays dentists for batches or courses of treatments delivered rather than for every single item or procedure, such as a check-up or a filling, is not fit for purpose.<br/>The system of paying NHS \"units of dental activity\" (UDAs) can be a disincentive to dentists seeing new patients, including those who have higher levels of disease and require more time to treat, the report warns.<br/>For example, under UDAs, a course of treatment resulting in just one filling might attract the same fee as one containing five fillings, a root treatment and an extraction. <br/>The British Dental Association says workload backlogs, made worse by Covid, will take many years to clear. <br/>Some dental practices are struggling to deliver their NHS contractual commitments, often simply as a result of being unable to fill vacancies, the association claims.<br/>The government says it recently announced a 40% increase in dentistry training places and has made changes \"so dental therapists and hygienists can deliver more treatments\". <br/>\"We invest more than \u00a33bn a year in dentistry and have already increased the funding practices receive for high needs patients to encourage dentists to provide more NHS treatments,\" said a spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care. <br/>It says the NHS dental contract has been reformed to encourage more dentists to provide NHS treatments and to allow dental therapists and hygienists to offer extra services. <br/>The government also said it would set out further measures \"to improve access shortly\". <br/>Louise Ansari from Healthwatch England said: \"Ultimately, only a fundamental and fully resourced dental contract reform can tackle these deep-seated problems, and we call on the government to publish its dental recovery plan urgently.\"<br/>Are you struggling to find an NHS dentist?

Ambulance workers, nurses, physiotherapists and porters will also get a one-off sum of at least \u00a31,655. <br/>The prime minister ruled out funding the increases through extra borrowing or increasing taxes. <br/>Mr Sunak said pay awards in the education department would be fully funded, but did not set out how this would be achieved.<br/>Schools minister Nick Gibb promised there would be no cuts in \"front-line services\" in schools or colleges.  <br/>Rising prices have prompted industrial action across much of the public sector, with workers calling for pay rises matching or exceeding the rate of inflation which currently stands at 8.7%. <br/>But with the education unions welcoming the government's offer, parents and pupils could see an end to strikes which have impacted schools across England over the past year. <br/>On Thursday, junior doctors in England began a five day walkout, after their calls for a 35% pay increase were rejected.<br/>The government has been resistant to offering above-inflation pay rises warning it would further fuel inflation. <br/>Responding to Mr Sunak's announcement, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"By accepting the pay review body recommendations and then not funding them the government is putting its departments between a rock and hard place - they now have to choose between paying workers a half-decent salary or cutting services in already underfunded public services.\"<br/>TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said union members would take \"comfort\" from the fact that the prime minister had accepted the pay review bodies' recommendations. <br/>\"The question will be - is he able to deliver pay rises in a way that won't have a negative impact on services. Our members will have a long look at that - they won't want to see Peter robbed to pay Paul.<br/>Mr Sunak said his offer was \"final\" and further industrial action would not change that decision, stressing: \"There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year's settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.\"<br/>Speaking at the Unite union's policy conference in Brighton, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the pay offers would be \"subject to negotiation\" and he would \"not wade into that\".<br/>He said there was no \"magic wand that could wave away the need for economic stability\", but added: \"If Labour can not break the suffocating hold of low wages we will have failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Visa application fees and the immigration health surcharge are going up \"significantly\" to raise money, Rishi Sunak says.<br/>Almost half of public sector workers are covered by pay review bodies, including police and prison officers, the armed forces, doctors, dentists and teachers.<br/>The pay review bodies are made up of economists and experts in human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector, and are appointed by the relevant government department.<br/>Their recommendations are not legally binding, meaning the government can choose to reject or partially ignore the advice, but it is usually accepted.<br/>What do you think about the Prime Minister's announcement on public sector pay?

There are workers who will be working harder and for longer, and communities which will see services cut.\" <br/>She said existing Unite strike action would continue too.<br/>Earlier this year, the biggest public sector union, Unison, accepted an NHS pay offer and the Royal College of Nursing failed to get the turnout it needed in a strike ballot to continue pursuing its industrial action.<br/>But Unite's health service staff - including ambulance crews - voted narrowly to reject their offer. <br/>Ms Graham suggested a harder line was paying off: \"Today in the Yorkshire Ambulance Service, we won a one-off payment that members were told they wouldn't get.<br/>\"So I will be fighting for those workers until they get the pay rise they deserve. I think there will be a new wave of strikes in the NHS.\"<br/>She said Unite's research unit had calculated that \u00a3400m in total had been won for members through industrial action in the last two years.<br/>Asked if that meant this would embolden her to impose the misery of even more strikes on the public, she replied that the public were also workers - and the lesson people should learn amid a cost of living crisis was to join a union.<br/>She denied pay increases were fuelling inflation, and suggested that \"rampant profiteering\" and \"greedflation\" were partly to blame, with the UK's top 350 companies enjoying an average increase in profit margins of 89%.<br/>She suggested an extension of the existing windfall tax on oil and gas companies could easily cover fully-funded pay increases in the public sector, and said she was \"disappointed\" that the Labour leadership wasn't being bolder and more ambitious.<br/>Speaking at the Unite conference earlier in the day, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer would not commit a future Labour government to specific percentage increases in public sector pay, and said he would not \"wade into\" current pay negotiations.<br/>But more generally, he said a future Labour government would be seen as a failure if it didn't tackle the scourge of low pay.<br/>As for the private sector, Ms Graham has her sights on winning further pay claims.<br/>She has employed a team of people who look at company accounts to calculate if pay increases can be afforded.<br/>If current negotiations on pay aren't fruitful, she said a new wave of strike ballots would be held in September and October.<br/>The teaching unions in England are now recommending that their members end their battle over pay, but a new era of peace in industrial relations appears to be a long way off.<br/>As Ms Graham put it: \"This is a marathon, not a sprint.\"<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Record pay rises fuel fresh inflation fears<br/>Teachers' strikes: When, where and why?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

That means the prime minister would still have the power to sign off sanctions, and hire and fire members of his cabinet team, as is currently the case.<br/>But Ms Rayner said the \"strong processes in place\" would mean the prime minister would find it \"impossible\" not to take the action recommended.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took office promising to lead with \"integrity, professionalism and accountability\", and appointed Sir Laurie Magnus as his independent ethics adviser.<br/>The Conservative Party said Labour wanted to \"outsource ethics to a body of unelected bureaucrats chosen by Keir Starmer, instead of trusting Parliament to hold ministers to account\".<br/>\"It's unsurprising to see that Angela Rayner doesn't trust the leader of her own party to oversee ethics in Whitehall,\" a Conservative spokesperson said.<br/>Gray cleared to work for Labour amid Tory anger<br/>Benton tells how MPs get round hospitality rules<br/>New MPs' code of conduct to tighten lobbying rules<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Under usual parliamentary procedure, the House of Lords can require MPs to reconsider bills but cannot force the government to accept changes. <br/>But it raises the prospect of another clash between ministers and Tory backbenchers over contested aspects of the legislation.<br/>The bill, backed by MPs in March, is central to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's high-profile pledge to \"stop\" small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>It would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.<br/>The government says it is committed to its plan to remove migrants to Rwanda, despite the Court of Appeal ruling it was unlawful. It has already said it will appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.<br/>There has been concern about how children will be treated under the new migration bill, as well as accusations that existing UK regulations to prevent modern slavery would be undermined.<br/>Although the legal duty to deport migrants would not apply to under-18s the bill would give ministers new powers to deport them in certain circumstances detain them for extended periods. <br/>It would also extend the limit on how long children could be detained before apply for bail from three days to eight. A previous version of the bill proposed allowing children to be detained without the ability to apply for bail for up to 28 days.<br/>The government argues detention powers are necessary to ensure migrants destined for removal do not \"disappear into the community\" - and says no one would be held longer than is \"absolutely necessary\" to ensure they are deported.<br/>It adds that there is also an over-arching legal duty to ensure the length of detention is \"reasonable\", adding that leaving the UK voluntarily will \"always be an option for all\".<br/>Ahead of the vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the Home Office offered to reintroduce a 72-hour time limit on the detention of pregnant women.<br/>Amendments passed by the House of Lords would also mean a 72-hour time limit on the detention of unaccompanied children. Detention of accompanied children will be limited to 96 hours under proposals approved by peers - which could be extended to a maximum of seven days if approved by a minister.<br/>The government had previously watered down its child detention plans in the face of a rebellion by backbench Conservative MPs.<br/>In other votes on Wednesday, the Lords voted to reinsert a ban on deportations of LGBT migrants to 10 mainly African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria and Kenya - with a specific ban on trans men and women being deported to Brazil.

On Wednesday, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage hit a fresh 15 year high of 6.7%, according to Moneyfacts, the financial information service.<br/>The Bank of England said in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report that as fixed-rate mortgage deals expire and people renew their loans, mortgage repayments will go up.<br/>More than two million households will pay between \u00a3200 and \u00a3499 more per month by the end of 2026, it warned.<br/>A further one million mortgage holders will see their monthly payments rise by at least \u00a3500.<br/>In the shorter term, the average household coming off a fixed rate deal in the second half of 2023 will have to pay about \u00a3220 more a month if they refinanced at current rates.<br/>Craig Johnston, 38, from Sheffield, told BBC News that his mortgage would effectively double from \u00a3679 per month in 2021 to \u00a31,209 from the end of September.<br/>It means he will have to make sacrifices \"across the board\" in terms of what he can spend - and what he can save.<br/>\"It's not great,\" Mr Johnston. \"I'm not particularly happy about it at all. I'd rather the money be in my pocket rather than someone else's pocket.\"<br/>He said he was unsure how raising rates is helping people. <br/>\"For all of us - homeowners, taxpayers, people paying rent - I just don't see how it's going to be better,\" he said, adding: \"It just seems to be like 'put the interest rates up and we'll see what happens'. I don't get the logic.\"<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in June that the Bank has \"no alternative\" but to raise rates.<br/>But the Labour party's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the high mortgage repayments demonstrate \"the painful hit on families from the Tory mortgage bombshell\".<br/>The theory behind raising interest rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow, people end up spending less. If they buy fewer things, the rate of rising prices should slow.<br/>However, the Bank has been criticised for not acting quickly enough to bring inflation under control.<br/>Most mortgages taken out in recent years have been at a fixed rate of two or five years which means there is a lag in terms of when recent rate rises will hit households. <br/>About 4.5 million homes have had to pay more in mortgage repayments since late 2021, and higher rates will hit the vast majority of the rest by the end of 2026.<br/>Higher rates mean households and firms cut back on spending, \"worsening the economic environment, and increases the risk that they will default on loans\", the Bank said.<br/>However, banks have to support households having difficulty with repayments, reducing the risk of defaults, the bank said.<br/>Stricter lending rules since 2014 have also helped by limiting the amount of mortgage debt, the Bank said.<br/>Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, said a \"much stronger\" employment market was \"helping a lot in terms of the stress that households are seeing\".<br/>The rate of UK unemployment has ticked higher but at 4% remains relatively low.<br/>But he added that wage rises, which are linked to a strong labour market, are helping to keep inflation high.<br/>The Bank of England said that \"although the proportion of income that UK households overall spend on mortgage payments is expected to rise\", it expects it to remain below peaks seen during the global financial crisis and in the early 1990s. <br/>It added: \"UK banks are in a strong position to support customers who are facing payment difficulties. This should mean lower defaults than in previous periods in which borrowers have been under pressure.\"<br/>It said that, so far, the UK has been \"resilient\" to rapidly rising interest rates.<br/>The Bank of England's report also showed the result of a \"stress test\" on the UK's eight biggest banks and building societies to see if they could withstand catastrophic economic conditions.<br/>These include house prices falling by 31%, the unemployment rate increasing to 8.5% and inflation rising to 17%.<br/>The banks and building societies that have been tested include: Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, NatWest, Santander UK, Standard Chartered, Nationwide Building Society and Virgin Money.<br/>How is your mortgage affected by rising interest rates?

The email stressed: \"The vetting is impartial and purely evidence-based.\" <br/>Mr Kaszeta insisted he would have spoken only about his areas of expertise - chemical, biological and radiological weapons and warfare - and would not have tackled policy matters. <br/>He described the withdrawal of his invitation as an \"outrage against free speech\". <br/>On Wednesday, he published a letter from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), an MoD agency which organised the conference, offering him its \"sincere apologies\" for an \"error\". <br/>\"The decision was incorrectly taken following informal checks of your social media posts,\" the letter said, blaming a \"misapplication\" of Cabinet Office guidance applying only to Cabinet Office staff events.<br/>\"DSTL would not rescind an invitation of a speaker on the basis that the speaker had criticised government policy. <br/>\"DSTL has always welcomed individuals to the CWD Conference who provide constructive challenge to UK Government policy.\"  <br/>A review was now being carried out of DSTL processes for event management, it added.  <br/>Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster constituency Edward Lucas, where Mr Kaszeta lives, had highlighted his case. <br/>He also said bigger questions remained. \"This belated apology just digs an even bigger hole for the government.

government's asylum reforms as MPs overturned changes made by the House of Lords to the Illegal Migration Bill.<br/>Former PM Theresa May was among more than a dozen Tories arguing for a different approach from ministers.<br/>But their calls did not stop MPs voting to reject revisions peers had made to the bill in the Lords.<br/>The bill is central to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>The Illegal Migration Bill seeks to deter people from making the crossing by toughening up the rules and conditions around seeking asylum.<br/>As it was debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Sunak said he was \"throwing absolutely everything\" at tackling Channel crossings.<br/>But the passage of the bill has not been easy, with peers voting for 20 changes and campaigners calling on MPs to reject the government's proposals.<br/>The amendments voted for by the Lords have been overturned by MPs in a series of 18 votes, although ahead of the debate, the Home Office offered several concessions, including on time limits for the detention of children and pregnant women.<br/>The bill now heads to the Lords again, for peers to consider the changes made by MPs.<br/>In a Commons debate, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick accused peers of \"wrecking\" the government's asylum reforms by trying to make amendments.<br/>Mr Jenrick said it was \"vital\" that the bill was passed quickly and described amendments made by the Lords as being \"riddled with exceptions and get-out clauses\".<br/>The government's concessions were not enough to win the backing of some Tory MPs, who raised concerns over how the bill treats unaccompanied children and the victims of modern slavery.<br/>Mrs May said the bill \"will consign more people to slavery\", adding she would have to \"persist in disagreeing with the government\" on this issue.<br/>The former prime minister told MPs: \"I know that ministers have said this bill will enable more perpetrators to be stopped, but on modern slavery I genuinely believe it will do the opposite.<br/>\"It will enable more slave-drivers to operate and make money out of human misery.\"<br/>She was among 16 Conservatives who voted against the government's rejection of protections for people claiming to be victims of modern slavery. <br/>There were also rebellions from Conservative MPs connected to the limits and conditions of detaining unaccompanied children.<br/>One of the rebels, former Conservative minister Tim Loughton, said the \"assurances that we were promised have not materialised or, if they have, I am afraid nobody understands them\".<br/>He complained about the timing of the concessions and said \"more work needs to be done\" on scrutinising the bill before it becomes law.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Robert Jenrick says cartoons in an asylum reception centre were painted over as they were not \"age appropriate\" for teenagers.<br/>One of the most controversial aspects of the bill would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove migrants arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.<br/>Stephen Kinnock, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said the government's Rwanda plan was \"fundamentally flawed\", and he accused Mr Jenrick of \"pettiness\" for painting over Mickey Mouse cartoons in an immigration centre.<br/>Mr Kinnock said the bill would \"only make a terrible situation worse\" by increasing the asylum backlog, and \"ensure people smugglers are laughing all the way to the bank\".<br/>With Parliament due to break for summer at the end of next week, the bill faces a prolonged stand-off between peers and the government during so-called parliamentary ping-pong, when legislation is batted between the Lords and Commons until agreement on the wording can be reached.<br/>The latest figures show more than 13,000 migrants have made the crossing so far this year, including more than 1,600 in the last four days.<br/>The government's efforts to curb the number of small boats crossing the Channel have been hampered in Parliament and the courts.<br/>A plan to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Dorset has been delayed.<br/>And the government's policy of sending migrants to Rwanda is set for a legal battle in the Supreme Court.<br/>On Monday, a senior Home Office official confirmed the department was paying to keep nearly 5,000 beds empty across the country, in case a sudden influx of migrants caused overcrowding at detention centres. <br/>The government has stressed it remains committed to its plan to remove migrants to Rwanda, and has said it will challenge a Court of Appeal ruling last week that this was unlawful.<br/>Lords back Archbishop's plan for refugee

These are interim payments for those in urgent need, which are then repaid monthly.<br/>It uses machine learning, a widely-used form of artificial intelligence (AI), to analyse historical benefits data to predict how likely a new claim is to be fraudulent or incorrect.<br/>Claims scored as risky are then referred to civil servants to investigate, with payments put on hold until the referral has been dealt with.<br/>In its annual accounts last week, the DWP disclosed plans to pilot \"similar\" models to review cases in four areas with high overpayment rates, including undeclared earnings from self-employment and incorrect housing costs. <br/>A date for the full deployment of the models has not been given by the department.<br/>The department says it continually monitors the algorithms to guard against the \"inherent risk\" of unintended bias, and says caseworkers are not told when cases have been flagged by the model.<br/>But campaign group Privacy International said it had \"ongoing concerns\" over a \"persistent lack of transparency\" over how it was being used.<br/>The group told the BBC the DWP had failed to provide \"substantive information\" about the tools it is using.<br/>It added that an outside body should be handed an oversight role, given the \"well-documented serious risks to fundamental rights\" from decisions informed by algorithms.<br/>Child Poverty Action Group said it was alarmed by plans for greater use of machine learning, adding \"key flaws\" in DWP's digitalisation approach had not yet been addressed.<br/>\"Expanding the technology while ignoring calls for transparency and rigorous monitoring of and protections against bias will risk serious harm to vulnerable families,\" added chief executive Alison Garnham.<br/>Gareth Davies, the boss of the National Audit Office, the UK's spending watchdog, has also urged the department to publish details of any potential bias in its machine learning tools to \"improve public confidence\" in the systems.<br/>In his statement on the accounts, he said the DWP had conceded that its ability to test for unfairness relating to protected characteristics - such as age, race and disability - was \"currently limited\".<br/>This was partly because claimants did not always respond to optional questions on their background, but also because certain information had been taken out of its systems for security reasons, he wrote.<br/>The department says it is taking steps to integrate the data in its systems soon, and has committed to reporting to MPs annually on how AI-powered tools are affecting different groups of claimants. <br/>It also argues it faces a \"challenge\" in balancing calls for more transparency with a desire not to \"tip off\" potential fraudsters by revealing too much information about how it identifies potential fraud.<br/>The department is expected to respond to the NAO's recommendations later in the year.<br/>Labour has also backed the use of AI to tackle fraud, with shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth saying it could help tackle criminals \"taking the taxpayer for a ride\".<br/>In a speech on Tuesday to the Social Market Foundation, he added that the department's use of the technology had yet to be \"properly scaled\". <br/>The party says it is committed to safeguards to prevent bias in the use of algorithms, although it is yet to set out detailed proposals.<br/>UK must be more open on use of AI, say campaigners<br/>Public sector urged to be open about algorithm use<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Israel sees it antisemitic and has supported moves by other governments to outlaw such boycotts by public bodies. The issue is highly controversial, often sparking rows and protest among rival groups supportive of Israel or the Palestinians. <br/>In a sign of deep unease within the Foreign Office over the impact of the bill as drafted, a letter sent from a senior official in Mr Cleverly's office to Downing Street on 12 May warned of damaging consequences for the UK if the legislation went ahead in its current form.<br/>It suggests Moscow would use it to show the UK did not uphold the international rules-based system and was therefore \"being hypocritical in our treatment of 'annexed territory'\" in relation to Britain's condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  <br/>Foreign Office lawyers advised a clause in the bill \"would significantly increase the risk of the UK being in breach of our commitments under [United Nations Security Council Resolution] 2334.\" <br/>This appears to contradict Levelling Up Minister Felicity Buchan, who told MPs at the end of the debate on the bill: \"The government's view is that the bill is compliant with UN Security Council resolution 2334.\"<br/>A United Nations Security Council resolution, or UNSCR for short, is a formal commitment made by member states of the UN's Security Council. <br/>The council is currently chaired by the UK, and is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. <br/>The UN Security Council resolution 2334, passed in 2016, sees Israeli settlements in the occupied territories as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a \"major obstacle\" to peace.  It also calls on countries \"in their relevant dealings\" to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies. <br/>The Foreign Office lawyers warned that the bill could breach this commitment because it does not distinguish between boycotts against Israel and those against settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and Golan Heights.<br/>Officials said such a breach of the resolution \"would provide ammunition to Russia in its attempt to undermine our narrative that its invasion of Ukraine is in violation of the UN charter and a number of Security Council resolutions\" and that Russia was likely to accuse the UK of being \"hypocritical\".<br/>The letter adds: \"Russia (and to an extent China, with an eye on Taiwan) would likely seize any opportunity to challenge the legitimacy of our voice on responsible multilateralism.<br/>\"In this context, the foreign secretary believes that the legislation, as drafted, will create difficult handling issues\u2026 and that Moscow will use it against us.\"<br/>It says while Mr Cleverly noted the BDS Movement is \"divisive\", the official said he recommended removing the specific references to Israel and the occupied territories from the face of the bill. <br/>It adds that the prime minister decided in December 2023 to include Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories in the bill.<br/>The bill gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the restrictions - meaning public bodies would be allowed to introduce their own sanctions, campaigns and boycotts against them.<br/>For example, the government intends Russia and Belarus to be exempted.<br/>Public bodies would also not be barred from complying with UK-wide sanctions. <br/>But the bill specifically singles out Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights saying they cannot be made exempt - so public bodies could not boycott them without a further law change. <br/>In doing so it groups the three together, which critics argue undermines the UK's foreign policy position by suggesting boycotting Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Golan Heights would be the same as boycotting Israel - despite the illegality of the former two under international law.<br/>Longstanding UK government policy calls for an end to Israel's military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories as part of a negotiated \"two-state solution\".<br/>The UK has for decades endorsed the position of international law, under which Israeli settlements are seen as illegal - although Israel disputes this - and sees their expansion as an \"obstacle to peace\".<br/>This has received criticism from some Tory MPs as well as Labour. The bill passed its first stage in the Commons last week, with two Conservative MPs voting against it.<br/>On 3 July, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Alicia Kearns, asked Michael Gove in the House of Commons if any diplomatic posts had \"specifically advised the government\" that the bill could contravene our UN security council resolutions. <br/>Mr Gove responded saying: \"I know of no such advice.\" <br/>Conservative MP William Wragg also asked him if he had read the \"write-round\" from the Foreign Office advising against this clause and asking if he had spoken to the foreign secretary about it. <br/>Mr Gove said: \"Every minister supports the bill, and quite rightly\", despite the concerns that had been raised on behalf of Mr Cleverly in the Foreign Office letter to Downing Street.<br/>In a subsequent letter to Ms Kearns, Mr Gove said: \"In line with the longstanding principle of collective agreement, the government's position was agreed by the FCDO [Foreign Office], as indeed it was by all government departments.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"The Economic Activity Bill is compliant with international law and our obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 2334.<br/>\"Public bodies should not be pursuing their own foreign policy agenda and the bill will ensure that the UK speaks with one voice internationally.\"<br/>Backlash over bill banning boycotts of Israel goods<br/>Israeli military launches major operation in Jenin<br/>The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained<br/>US declares Israel boycott group BDS anti-Semitic<br/>Germany labels Israel boycott anti-Semitic<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

This will only end in further disputes that are entirely avoidable.\"<br/>Asked if the government had any plans to introduce tax cuts, Ms Atkins said: \"We do not have the headroom at the moment to look at tax cuts.  <br/>\"But as soon as we can, as soon as we have taken the measures that we are taking to reduce inflation, then we will be able to start having those conversations.\"  <br/>Appearing on the same programme, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would \"not play fast and loose\" with the nation's finances, if it returned to power after the next general election. <br/>She said she was confident the party could meet its pledge to borrow money to fund green policies - but only if it didn't conflict with her fiscal rules. <br/>In 2021, Ms Reeves had promised to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year up to 2030, on projects such as offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries.<br/>However, earlier this year she watered down the plans, saying instead that a Labour government would ramp up investment over time, aiming to reach \u00a328bn a year after 2027. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves: UK needs to get a grip on its debt<br/>Asked if she would fulfil the pledge, Ms Reeves said she was \"confident\" but added that it was subject to her limits on spending.<br/>\"Debt is now the same size as our whole economy - we've got to get a grip of that,\" she said. <br/>The shadow chancellor insisted that Labour's spending plans were \"not on the same track\" as the Conservatives, pointing to her policy to scrap the non-dom tax status as an example of how her party differed from the government. <br/>Nicola Headlam, a chief economist at Red Flag Alert, a business intelligence company, told BBC Radio Five Live that \"bearing down\" on public sector workers and not meeting the recommendations of the pay review bodies was not the answer because other people in the workforce earn more. <br/>\"If you're a public sector worker, you're paying a mortgage, you've still got to pay the prices you see in the supermarkets. <br/>\"You've got a triple impact on you - thunder, lightning and rain and there are some other people with a larger umbrella who are still stoking inflation.<br/>\"We're starting to run out of good choices and it's because of a lack of growth in the economy, because of this inflation we seem to be unable to get a handle on, because of rising interest rates.

And the second is, as we set out in our national security review, China represents the largest state-based threat to economic security. <br/>\"So it's not a surprise that we should look carefully at Chinese transactions. But equally, we look across the board.\"<br/>Chinese firms have been targeted by regulators around the world in the last few years amid concerns that the Chinese state might use them for spying purposes.<br/>Prominent examples include telecoms giant Huawei, which was banned in 2020 from the UK's 5G mobile networks - a decision mirrored by other countries. <br/>Last year, Chinese-owned social media app TikTok was banned on UK government devices as part of a security review. <br/>In the report, Mr Dowden said the National Security and Investment Act was meant to be \"light touch\", incentivising investment in the UK, while also protecting national security \"in an increasingly volatile world\".<br/>He told the BBC that by blocking or imposing remedies on deals, foreign investors would have more confidence to invest in Britain \"because they know it's safe\". <br/>\"But at the same time, we cannot find ourselves in a situation where we totally decouple from an economy like China's, it's not in our national interest in terms of jobs and prosperity,\" he said.<br/>\"What we have to do is de-risk that engagement.

They've had massive increases in the cost of that debt,\" he said.<br/>However, he said the committee, which would also be questioning water companies on Wednesday, wanted to know where the debt came from. <br/>Sir Robert believed the firm was taking money out in the form of debt payments, instead of dividends. \"Our suspicion is that a lot of this debt is with these very funds that own the shares,\" he said. <br/>The committee chairman said the MPs would want to know: \"Have Ofwat been asleep at the wheel or have they just not had the powers to inquire into some of the finance structures?\"<br/>Ofwat's appearance on Wednesday will be the second appearance in as many weeks in front of politicians. Last week its chief executive David Black gave evidence to the Lords' business committee when he denied the watchdog had failed to regulate the industry well.<br/>But he admitted there were \"hard lessons to learn\" and that he had been \"angered\" by excessive chief executive pay in the industry.<br/>Thames Water is not the only water company in the spotlight. The management of Southern Water is also up for scrutiny. <br/>\"It does seem rather reckless,\" Sir Robert said. \"Southern Water's credit rating has been downgraded yet again. The owners of these companies are having put to put money in yet again. My worry is the money that we're paying as water users will be going to service that debt, rather than what we want to see, which is paying to clean up our rivers and improve sewage treatment.\"<br/>However, the chair of the select committee argued a return to nationalisation was not the answer: \"I can remember when water investment was way back in the queue behind hospitals and education and to be fair, we have seen massive investment in improving our infrastructure.<br/>\"The general problem with pollution is when it rains. Many older houses have the water from their roofs going straight into the sewer, which massively overloads the system, and that's something that can be addressed with storm-water tanks. It can also be addressed by people putting in water bowsers or catching the grey water and using that to flush their toilets.\"<br/>Thames Water, which is due to publish its annual results on Monday, said it would be making no comment.<br/>In a statement to the BBC on Sunday Ofwat said: \"Thames Water need to develop a robust and credible plan to turn around the business and transform its performance for customers and the environment. For a long time, we have been pushing them to improve their financial resilience, including to cut debt. We will continue to safeguard customers' interests as they do that.\"<br/>The BBC has also approached Southern Water for comment. <br/>Water firms planning to raise bills, says regulator<br/>Thames Water needs 'substantial' sums of money<br/>Why is sewage pumped into rivers and the sea?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

For households who pay their bills by direct debit, the support was given through monthly payments from October to March.<br/>However, for those with non-conventional energy set-ups the government launched the \u00a3400 Energy Bill Support Scheme Alternative Funding earlier this year.<br/>BBC Verify analysis of data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero shows that of the more than 200,000 applications made under the scheme:<br/>Matt Cole from the charity, the Fuel Bank Foundation, said it was disappointing that so many people had missed out and believed it was down to a number of factors.<br/>\"The launch of the scheme in spring this year rather before winter when it was needed most, the reliance on families self-identifying that they were eligible rather than them automatically receiving it, and the somewhat complex process to claim help will all have contributed.\"<br/>The government said it had spent more than \u00a350m \"supporting 130,000 households without a domestic energy supplier\".<br/>This data suggests just over \u00a3300m of the possible \u00a3360m in Great Britain had not been claimed before the deadline.<br/>People who thought they were eligible needed to apply on the government website or call a helpline, which is what Mark, who lives on his narrowboat, did.<br/>\"A lot of people [on canal boats] tried to put an application through for claiming for it [but] we hit a barrier when it said: 'Do you live in a marina or are you off grid?'<br/>\"The minute you clicked 'off grid' you went through to a box that said 'you are not eligible at this time'.\"<br/>Mark uses three and a half bags of coal for his multi-fuel stove each week in winter. He had been paying around \u00a39 per bag but last winter the price nearly doubled.<br/>\"[The \u00a3400 payment] would've been a great help. That money's had to come from somewhere so it's had to come out of the rest of my budgeting or my savings.<br/>\"It would've made my winter a bit easier, maybe I could have spent a bit more money on the grandkids.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter, covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill.<br/>\"We're now seeing costs fall even further with wholesale energy prices down by over two thirds since their peak.<br/>\"We are urging councils to process applications and complete final checks as quickly as possible to ensure all those eligible receive the support they need.\"<br/>The government said anyone who did not apply before the deadline should visit its Help for Households page.<br/>Carol lives on a park home site south east of Runcorn. She says the application process was simple, but she was forced to apply three or four times because she kept getting rejected.<br/>\"We got refused, I don't know how many times. I kept going, I wouldn't give up. Because I thought, 'Why should I give up?' I've worked all my life, I've paid into the system.<br/>\"[The \u00a3400] was very important because 99.9% of people on these sites are all retired and a lot of them only have a basic pension, or maybe a bit of a top-up pension.<br/>\"But it's not going very far because food's gone up, petrol's gone up, so the \u00a3400 was absolutely a godsend.\"<br/>Park homes were the largest single group seeking the \u00a3400 support, with 47,400 households out of the 203,580 who applied.<br/>Tenants in private accommodation had the highest rejection and cancellation rates, with 47% of applications from this group being stopped. Applications were rejected if people had already received support, made a duplicate application or were not eligible.<br/>The Office for National Statistics estimated that about 137,000 care home residents in England pay for some or all of their care, and these were eligible to apply for the support.<br/>There were just under 22,000 applications from households in care homes across Great Britain.<br/>In a similar scheme for Northern Ireland, 28,000 households were eligible for \u00a3600 worth of support, totalling around \u00a316.8m.<br/>There were just over 8,000 applications in Northern Ireland from those without a domestic electricity supply, with just over 4,000 already paid by 1 June 2023 and 160 awaiting payment.<br/>Of the rest, just over 2,700 were cancelled or rejected and just over 1,000 were still being worked on. This means almost 23,000 Northern Ireland households may have missed out on an estimated \u00a313.6m.<br/>You can hear more on this story on the Money Box podcast.<br/>Follow Money Box or Dan on Twitter.<br/>Here are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips:<br/>What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?<br/>'Forgotten' residents to get \u00a3400 energy rebate<br/>Tricky \u00a3400 energy rebate cases cause anxiety<br/>Details of \u00a3400 energy bill discount revealed<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

This means they can explode at a later date, killing or injuring people.<br/>Neither the US, Ukraine or Russia are signatories of the international treaty - the Convention on Cluster Munitions - banning the use or stockpiling of them over the indiscriminate damage they can inflict on civilian populations.<br/>Speaking to reporters in Selby, Yorkshire, on Saturday, Mr Sunak said the UK is \"signatory to a convention which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use\".<br/>\"We will continue to do our part to support Ukraine against Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, but we've done that by providing heavy battle tanks and most recently long-range weapons, and hopefully all countries can continue to support Ukraine,\" he added.<br/>\"Russia's act of barbarism is causing untold suffering to millions of people.\"<br/>Mr Sunak is due to meet with Mr Biden in London on Monday, ahead of a Nato summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Tuesday.<br/>Rishi Sunak spoke carefully when asked for his response to the US now giving cluster munition to Ukraine. <br/>He didn't criticise the US's decision but did point out that the Convention discourages use of the bombs. <br/>The UK is the second largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine - only behind the US. <br/>As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, so too are the responses of Kyiv's allies - on this issue the US and UK have gone in different directions. <br/>Mr Biden justified supplying the weapons by saying the \"Ukrainians are running out of ammunition\". <br/>Speaking to CNN in an interview due to air on Sunday, he said it had taken \"a while to be convinced\" to make the \"very difficult decision\" to send them.<br/>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the \"timely\" move to deliver the bombs.<br/>Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his troops would not use them in urban areas to avoid risking civilian lives, adding \"these are our people, they are Ukrainians we have a duty to protect\".<br/>But Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles has said her government's position is that cluster bombs should not be used for the \"legitimate defence of Ukraine\".<br/>Germany, which has also signed the convention, said it would not provide them to Ukraine but that it understands the American position.<br/>In a statement, the Canadian government said it does not support the use of the weapons and emphasised its commitment to \"putting an end to the effects cluster munitions have on civilians - particularly children\".<br/>Human Rights Watch said both sides had used the weapons in the war, causing \"numerous deaths and serious injuries to civilians\".<br/>These comments were echoed by Amnesty International, who said cluster munitions pose \"a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended\".<br/>The UN human rights office has also been critical, calling for their use to \"stop immediately\". <br/>Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the military alliance takes no position on cluster munitions.<br/>Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the UK's defence select committee, urged the US to \"reconsider\" its decision - which he said was the \"wrong call and will alienate international goodwill\".<br/>\"Their use leaves deadly unexploded ordnance over the battlefield, killing and injuring civilians long after the war is over,\" the Conservative MP added. <br/>Russia described the US decision as an \"act of desperation\" in the face of the \"failure of the much-touted Ukrainian counteroffensive\".<br/>US allies troubled by cluster bombs to Ukraine<br/>Biden defends sending cluster bombs to Ukraine<br/>Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

We calculate there would need to be 3% on average [extra] funding for schools in order to do that.\"<br/>Asked whether she feared the government could overrule the pay review body, Dr Bousted said: \"Unfortunately I think that's entirely possible. We hope that that's not the case.\"<br/>The NEU is balloting for further strike action in the autumn, which could involve co-ordinated strikes with three other education unions.<br/>Dr Bousted said autumn strike action would not happen if a fully-funded 6.5% rise was offered, saying it was \"in the government's hands\".<br/>Most state school teachers in England had a 5% pay rise for the year 2022-23. <br/>The NEU wants teachers to have an above-inflation pay increase, plus extra money to ensure any pay rises do not come from schools' existing budgets. <br/>After intensive talks, the government offered an additional one-off payment of \u00a31,000. It also offered a rise for most teachers next year of 4.3%, with starting salaries reaching \u00a330,000. <br/>The Department for Education described it as a \"fair and reasonable offer\", and said schools would receive an extra \u00a32.3bn over the next two years.<br/>All four unions involved in the dispute rejected the offer. <br/>Almost 40,000 full-time working-age teachers left the profession last year - the highest level since records began in 2010 - according to government data released last month.<br/>However, overall the number of teachers has increased by 2,800 to 468,400, because more teachers have entered the profession.<br/>Are you a teacher with a view on the strike?

They will also discuss providing more weapons and ammunition. <br/>On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved. <br/>But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war. <br/>Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said no final decision had been made on the language of the final communiqu\u00e9, but added: \"I am absolutely certain that we will have unity and a strong message on Ukraine.\"<br/>But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join Nato. The news was welcomed by the US and Germany, as well as Sweden itself.<br/>Turkey had spent months blocking Stockholm's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's \"legitimate security concerns\".<br/>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.<br/>Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. <br/>And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target. <br/>Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. <br/>The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine. <br/>Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West. <br/>As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy. <br/>So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors. <br/>The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. \"The right to consult is not insignificant,\" said one official.<br/>But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance. <br/>Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine \"will\" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022. <br/>Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.<br/>Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.<br/>Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.  <br/>One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades. <br/>But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance. <br/>The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership. <br/>Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: \"The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.\"<br/>But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military. <br/>Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining. <br/>Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is Nato and when will Ukraine join?<br/>Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons?<br/>Poland strengthens Belarus border over Wagner fears<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

(It is using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure, which tracks the price of a typical basket of goods).<br/>Many people expected inflation to fall quickly anyway.<br/>However, inflation is stubbornly high in the UK and remained at 8.7% between April and May.<br/>Analysts are divided about whether the government's goal will be achieved.<br/>When will we know? Inflation figures for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 17 January 2024.<br/>Downing Street said the pledge to \"grow the economy\" will be met if the economy is bigger in October to December 2023 than it was during the previous quarter (July to September).<br/>It is using GDP (or Gross Domestic Product), a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals.<br/>This would not normally be seen as a difficult pledge, because the UK's economy is usually growing.<br/>But there has not been a lot of growth recently and the UK economy is still smaller than it was before the pandemic.<br/>The pledge to grow the economy is made more difficult by the government's promise to halve inflation.<br/>The Bank of England has been putting up interest rates in an attempt to reduce spending and stop prices rising so quickly.<br/>However, this slows economic growth.<br/>When will we know? GDP for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 13 February 2024.<br/>When governments talk about debt falling, they almost always mean as a proportion of GDP.<br/>The idea is that debt is falling if it is growing more slowly than the economy.<br/>But debt is above 100% of GDP for the first time since 1961.<br/>And if Mr Sunak does not achieve his second priority of growing the economy, then cutting debt becomes even harder.<br/>The deadline for this pledge is not clear.<br/>In the Budget in March, the government claimed to be on track because the independent Office for Budget Responsibility - which checks the health of the economy - forecast that debt as a proportion of GDP would fall in 2027-28.<br/>But what it actually said was that it would rise from 88.9% in 2022 to 94.8% in 2026-27, before falling slightly to 94.6% in 2027-28. And it issued some stark warnings about the sustainability of UK debt.<br/>When will we know? The next debt forecasts will accompany the 2023 Autumn Statement. <br/>Mr Sunak said: \"NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly.\"<br/>His pledge only refers to waiting lists in England, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own health systems.<br/>However, the overall number of patients waiting for treatment in England rose from 7.42 million in April, to 7.47 million in May.<br/>Mr Sunak has claimed that he is cutting waiting lists, but that is only true of certain lists. <br/>The number of people waiting more than 18 months, for example, fell between April and May.<br/>The NHS target is to see people within 18 weeks for non-urgent consultant-led treatment.<br/>We asked Downing Street when the prime minister aims to have waiting lists falling. <br/>It pointed us towards the plan for tackling the backlog of elective care (care planned in advance), which said the overall waiting list was expected to be falling by about March 2024.  <br/>When will we know?: Waiting list figures are usually published on the second Thursday of each month. <br/>The final priority was to set out a plan to stop the small boats which bring people across the English Channel.<br/>The prime minister proposed to do that by passing a new law. The government hopes to pass its Illegal Migration Bill before the end of July.<br/>Mr Sunak has said that his plan to tackle small boat crossings is \"starting to work\".<br/>However, most arrivals cross the Channel in the summer months, so numbers could rise or remain high.<br/>When will we know?

The Deposit Return Scheme has been sent for recycling.<br/>A ban on alcohol advertising has been scotched; Highly Protected Marine Areas have sunk beneath the waves.<br/>In quite a few of these cases, Mr Yousaf may have been left with little choice.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Five things to know about Scotland's new first minister Humza Yousaf<br/>Questions abounded over how the care service would work and be paid for; the recycling plans were beset with issues including a stand-off with the UK government. <br/>The no-fishing zones had prompted a backbench rebellion spearheaded by Ms Forbes and former minister Fergus Ewing, who acted out the fury of coastal communities by shredding a consultation document in the chamber.<br/>But Mr Yousaf will also feel he has acted decisively to rip up the more controversial items left in his in-tray by Ms Sturgeon. <br/>Comprehensive changes have been made to the government's agenda in a short space of time.<br/>He has also moved to reset a number of relationships with groups which felt neglected by the previous administration.<br/>The first was with business groups, in part via the reboot on alcohol advertising and recycling. There is talk of reforming business rates, and a \"new deal\" with the private sector.<br/>He also signed a new pact with local government which is known as the Verity House Agreement.<br/>Although there is always furious spin around the figures, councils have borne the brunt of budget cuts in recent years.<br/>Mr Yousaf has promised a new \"fiscal framework\" between town halls and the administration in Edinburgh, along with \"improved engagement on budgetary matters\".<br/>Fine words - but they will need to be backed up with hard cash if that relationship is to truly improve.<br/>Has Mr Yousaf also reset relations between the SNP and its leadership?<br/>He has certainly tried to run his government out of a bigger tent. <br/>Ms Sturgeon was famous for keeping a very tight circle of advisors who micromanaged most aspects of policy.<br/>Mr Yousaf meanwhile has actively sought to push decisions and responsibility out to his ministers.<br/>His initial policy prospectus featured each cabinet secretary outlining their goals and duties in their own words, introduced with the words \"I commit that by 2026, I will have...\".<br/>That may give them more autonomy to make decisions to deliver on these targets, but on the flip side it likely means they will have to carry the can for any issues in their portfolio.<br/>The departure of several of Ms Sturgeon's top team from government means there is now an assortment of big names with big views on the back benches - which range along a spectrum of loyalty.<br/>The likes of John Swinney can be relied upon for unswerving support, while Fergus Ewing has ranged off into almost outright rebellion.<br/>MSPs with views differing from those of the leadership tended to be quite shy about airing them publicly when Ms Sturgeon was in charge, but that is no longer the case.<br/>A broader debate over the SNP's core policy - independence - has also flourished under Mr Yousaf.<br/>He has sought to establish himself as the \"first activist\", getting out on the doorsteps regularly - but he also carried responsibility for setting the course of the main pro-independence party.<br/>Ms Sturgeon generally sought to keep the membership marching along to the beat of a strategy she herself had drawn up.<br/>By contrast, Mr Yousaf's big speech to the SNP's independence convention last month instead embraced just about every possible plan.<br/>There are elements within the party which variously favour a gradual build-up of support; continued efforts to secure a referendum; forcing the issue via an election result; and doubling down on public events like marches.<br/>Mr Yousaf's approach is to encourage all of them. Perhaps that will serve to keep them all happy for now, but he may need to swing firmly behind one particular strategy come the party's autumn conference - which unlike the convention is a decision-making event where members get a vote.<br/>Ms Sturgeon kept the SNP together as an election-winning machine by corralling pro-independence figures from right across the political spectrum behind one tightly-controlled central vision.<br/>It remains to be seen whether her successor's more relaxed approach encourages healthy debate - or furious infighting.<br/>Looking ahead, one thing Mr Yousaf has retained from the Sturgeon era is her deal with the Greens.<br/>That was underlined when he stood up in the chamber to defend Green minister Lorna Slater from a confidence vote tabled by the Tories.<br/>That may have helped smooth over the fact that several totems of the Bute House Agreement - like HMPAs - have been ditched.<br/>The Greens will also hope to wield influence from within the big tent as Mr Yousaf draws up his own policy plans.<br/>He will spend the summer recess preparing his own Programme for Government - the things he is actually doing, rather than cancelling.<br/>However, budgets remain tight. New finance secretary Shona Robison has already warned of a \u00a31bn shortfall next year, and that could double within four years.<br/>So he may need to be pragmatic and cut his cloth. There is already talk of a retreat from \"universalism\", in particular when it comes to free school meals in secondary schools.<br/>Beyond that, a September court date has been set for the first round of the showdown with the UK government over their move to block Holyrood's gender reforms.<br/>Whoever loses will likely appeal to the Inner House, and eventually to the Supreme Court, so an issue which the government had hoped to put to bed by passing reforms could well follow Mr Yousaf right up to the next set of elections.<br/>And there is the small matter of that SNP conference, where Mr Yousaf has promised to bring forward the results of a party governance review as well as a finalised independence strategy.<br/>Yousaf confirmed as Scotland's new first minister<br/>Who is Scotland's new first minister, Humza Yousaf?

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Three former offenders who have turned their lives around delivered some home truths to the peers this week.<br/>\"You can't tell someone to stop having a drink, if you have never had a drink. The problem is there are a lot of people in probation who have not been drug dealers, have never been in front of a magistrate.\"<br/>DeQeon credits the transformation that has taken place in his life to a probation officer, a woman he describes as his \"guardian angel\", who saw potential in him and went the extra mile to help him realise it.<br/>\"My other probation officers after Louise were not as good. I feel like a lot of them had no life experience. They are academics, they have not been in the real world,\" he told the committee.<br/>They had a \"tick box\" mentality, he explained, and did not \"get\" the challenges someone from a tough background like his faced. <br/>It was a message echoed by Caroline and Ayesha, who were also giving evidence about their experiences of the probation service.<br/>DeQeon told the peers: \"People like me need to be in probation because it would change the system. It would make the system a lot better. We wouldn't be sitting here talking about the situation if there was people like us being probation officers.\"<br/>But why stop at the probation service?<br/>\"Not a lot of people sitting on this panel have been on the other side of the system, have they?\" asked DeQeon. <br/>\"The problem is that if we had, we wouldn't be here,\" replied Labour peer and former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett.<br/>\"You could be... you've got to have life experience!\" DeQeon responded.<br/>The three witnesses had all served community sentences, where low-level offenders are ordered to do unpaid work and have drug, alcohol or mental health treatment instead of going to prison.<br/>They are now \"lived experience\" advisers with charity Revolving Doors, which campaigns for more community sentences and an end to prison sentences of 12 months or less in England and Wales, like in Scotland.<br/>The probation service - which has struggled with its workload in recent months - is key to making community sentences work.<br/>Last month, Kim Thornden-Edwards, head of the service in England, told the Lords committee new investment going into alcohol and drug treatment programmes was a potential \"game changer\". <br/>She also acknowledged problems with pre-sentence reports - the all-important advice given to judges and magistrates on how to deal with offenders. A new, simpler form was about to be rolled out, she told the peers. Individually-tailored treatment orders were also coming down the track, she said.<br/>The three former offenders told the committee pre-sentence reports were often out of date and did not have any input from the offenders themselves - and that some of the court-ordered programmes did not make a lot of sense.<br/>Ayesha, a recovering addict, suggested drug treatment orders should be dropped in favour of a more \"holistic\" approach. She said she had gone into a treatment centre only after her community sentence had ended, with little input from probation. <br/>She also spoke movingly of her ambition to go to university to study criminology, and her fear that despite all her efforts her criminal record would still be held against her.<br/>The Ministry of Justice says it is keen to set an example to other employers when it comes to giving a chance to ex-offenders. <br/>A spokesperson said: \"We know finding work is one of the surest ways for prison leavers to stay on the straight and narrow, which is why our Going Forward into Employment (GFIE) scheme provides employment opportunities for ex-offenders - helping to cut crime and protect the public.\"<br/>People with criminal records can apply for jobs with the probation service - and the wider Ministry of Justice - through the GFIE scheme.<br/>But the scheme does not include the role of probation officer.<br/>There is nothing to stop people with criminal convictions applying to be a probation officer \"in the usual way\", the MoJ says, and having a conviction will not necessarily count against them.<br/>But those with experience of the system say they will face a lengthy vetting process and there is no record of how many ex-offenders, if any, have ever been successful.<br/>Some ex-offenders work as volunteer \"peer mentors\", using their own experience of the criminal justice system to offer guidance and support to those struggling to cope with it.<br/>Caroline, who overcame problems with alcohol and mental health, told the Lords committee about her work with the NHS Liaison and Diversion service, which supports vulnerable people when they first come into contact with the criminal justice system.<br/>She said she was keen to work for the probation service in a similar role.<br/>\"However, due to my criminal record I have been pushed back several times. And it's so frustrating because I have come such a long, long way, but because of something that happened years ago when I wasn't very well, they are like 'nah'.

He was adopted by Eric Blair - better known by his pen name of George Orwell. <br/>Orwell's novel 1984 was the origin of the popular understanding of \"Big Brother\" and \"Room 101\".<br/>Mr Blair told BBC Politics East: \"He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>With Russia calling the war in Ukraine a \"special military operation\" and with many supporters of former US president Donald Trump believing his falsehood that he won the last election, many people see 1984 as more relevant than ever, Mr Taylor said.<br/>Asked about how his father would react if he came back today, Mr Blair said: \"Has it changed from the world of 1984 and Animal Farm? It's been the same for a millennia. I suppose it will be the same in another 100 years' time.<br/>\"He would have a certain sense of deja vu. He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>He added: \"My father was a great patriot. A great defender of his country and he was also a critic of both sides of the political debate. He would criticise both left and right.\" <br/>Prof Jean Seaton, official historian of the BBC, said Orwell was still incredibly important.<br/>\"We live in a world with surveillance, facial recognition. 1984 is about the capacity of authoritarian regimes like Russia, China, to make you believe what is not true,\" she said.<br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>An award-winning writer and critic, Mr Taylor's new biography \"Orwell: The New Life\" is the first to reveal insights about Orwell from newly uncovered letters to Eleanor Collings and Brenda Salkend, who had become part of his life when he lived in Southwold, Suffolk.<br/>\"These two caches of new material, letters he'd written to Suffolk girlfriends in the 1930s, don't just tell us about the relationship with the two women, they tell us about all kinds of things,\" said Mr Taylor.<br/>\"They tell us about what he was reading, his politics and where he was, geographical information.\"<br/>He added: \"In terms of improving our understanding of Orwell's work, I suspect his letters to Eleanor reminiscing about their country walks at Southwold may have inspired similar passages describing Winston's affair with Julia in 1984.\"<br/>While in Southwold, Orwell wrote the 1935 novel A Clergyman's Daughter, which is set in a fictionalised version of the town.<br/>Mr Taylor said: \"I think Southwold and its ambience and its values were an awful lot of the things Orwell felt he was rebelling against.<br/>\"On the other side, he had a very traditional nature. Somebody said of him, he was a conservative in everything but politics.<br/>\"I have a feeling there were certain aspects of Southwold he found very congenial.\"<br/>The newly discovered letters were bought by Mr Blair and donated to the Orwell Archive at University College London.<br/>Mr Blair said: \"I thought I better make an offer to secure the letters for posterity.<br/>\"I was interested that my father maintained his correspondence with Brenda Salkend for a great number of years. He always seemed to hold out a candle for all his girlfriends, certainly these two, as far as I can see.\"<br/>BBC Politics East will broadcast on Sunday, 2 July at 10:00 BST on BBC One andavailable after broadcast on BBC iPlayer.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

That decision could itself be challenged at the Supreme Court.<br/>The five-year trial - announced in April 2022 - would see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there.<br/>They may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda. If not, they can apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\". <br/>The government says the plan will deter people arriving in the UK through \"illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods\", such as on small boats which cross the English Channel.  <br/>More than 45,700 people used this route to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.<br/>Small-boat crossings decreased slightly in the first few months of 2023 but numbers could rise again in the summer. <br/>No asylum seeker has actually been sent to Rwanda so far. The first flight was scheduled to go in June 2022, but was cancelled after legal challenges.<br/>In June 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned an earlier ruling by the High Court that the Rwanda plan was lawful.<br/>The judges ruled that the east African nation is not a safe third country because of \"deficiencies\" in its asylum system which mean that some claimants could be sent back to their home countries, where they might face persecution. <br/>It said that \"unless and until\" those deficiencies are corrected, removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful.<br/>The ruling also said that the Rwanda policy breaches Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment. <br/>It was not a unanimous decision. Two judges agreed to reverse the High Court decision but a third did not. <br/>The judges said their decision does not imply a view about the \"political merits\" of the policy. <br/>Asylum Aid, the charity which brought the case against the government, said the judgement was a \"vindication of the importance of the rule of law and basic fairness when fundamental rights are at stake\". <br/>The UN's refugee agency, which advised the court on matters of international refugee law during the appeal, also welcomed the ruling, and urged the UK government to \"pursue other measures\" instead.<br/>But Home Secretary Suella Braverman called the judgment \"disappointing\", and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the government will seek permission to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.<br/>While legal proceedings continue, flights still cannot take off for Rwanda. <br/>The UK government previously said \"anyone entering the UK illegally\" after 1 January 2022 could be sent, with no limit on numbers.<br/>Rwanda says it can process 1,000 asylum seekers during the trial period, but has capacity for more. <br/>Under the deal, Rwanda can also ask the UK to take in some of its most vulnerable refugees.  <br/>But in October 2022, Privilege Style - the airline which was scheduled to take asylum seekers to Rwanda - withdrew from its Home Office contract, after a campaign by refugee charities. <br/>At the time the Guardian reported that two other airlines which had previously conducted deportation flights had also ruled out participation in the Rwanda scheme. <br/>So far the UK has paid the Rwandan government \u00a3140m for the scheme but it has not provided an overall cost. <br/>An economic-impact assessment prepared for the government's Illegal Migration Bill estimated that removing each individual to a third country, such as Rwanda, would cost \u00a363,000 more than keeping them in the UK. <br/>That figure is the difference between the total cost of removing an individual - estimated to be \u00a3169,000 - and the \u00a3106,000 spent on housing support if they remain in the UK.<br/>The \u00a3169,000 total includes a payment to the third country of around \u00a3105,000 per person, as well as \u00a322,000 for flights.<br/>The Home Office said no cost would be incurred if the policy deterred an individual from entering the UK illegally. <br/>But it said it was \"uncertain\" how many people would be deterred because the policy was \"novel and untested\".<br/>The UK's asylum system costs \u00a33bn a year. Almost \u00a37m a day is spent on hotel accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. <br/>Critics say the daily cost is so high because of the time taken to decide on applications, and a ban on asylum seekers working while waiting for confirmation of their status.<br/>The UN Refugee Agency defines an asylum seeker as someone who has applied for shelter and protection in another country. <br/>A refugee is a person who has fled conflict or persecution in their own country. <br/>The legal rights of refugees are protected by international law. However, it is up to host countries to decide whether an asylum seeker is granted refugee status. <br/>In 2022, the UK received more than 89,000 asylum applications, the highest number for 20 years. Of these, more than 23,800 people and their dependants were granted a form of protection. <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

If people spend less in businesses, what does that mean for jobs? If people end up out of work, what does that mean for the government's welfare bill? And, therefore, for that third priority of the prime minister's: reducing national debt.  <br/>The increased cost of borrowing from high interest rates can also disincentivise investment in business, which can also lead to lower economic growth. <br/>The tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse.<br/>So what is in the government's power?<br/>One quick lever the government can pull is taxes. <br/>Raising taxes is another way to stop groups of people from spending more. <br/>But that's an unpalatable political choice too. <br/>Mr Sunak has previously made it clear, and pledged in the past, that he wants to cut - not raise - taxes before the next election. <br/>Some Tory MPs have been repeatedly calling for tax cuts. <br/>Governments can also reduce spending. <br/>While we do hear ministers talk about making \"efficiencies\", departments talking about making cuts is - again - an unpalatable narrative ahead of an election. <br/>Mr Sunak has said, for now, that he wants to make sure government is \"responsible\" with borrowing. <br/>Another quick lever would be price controls - the government setting limits on price increases. <br/>Mr Sunak says ministers are \"looking at\" supermarkets to make sure they are behaving responsibly, for example. <br/>But Number 10 have been clear they are not introducing price caps and any such schemes would be at retailers' discretion. <br/>The governor of the Bank of England has suggested workers shouldn't ask for excessive pay rises. <br/>The government has also been very reluctant to hike public sector wages, especially if funded by more borrowing. <br/>Both argue giving people more money in their pockets could fuel inflation: if people's wages keep up with rising prices, they can buy the same things, so demand (and prices) remain similar. <br/>In blunter terms - their strategy of reducing inflation by reducing demand means people need to be able to afford less.  <br/>This argument has led to strikes in multiple sectors, with unions arguing this is unfair for workers. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Sunak makes five pledges on the NHS, economy and migrants<br/>This is also a tricky balancing act here for the economy. <br/>If people can afford less: what does that mean for growing the economy? And jobs? <br/>Potentially putting people out of work has a government price tag too. <br/>So what about pushing supply up, rather than demand down, to lower prices? <br/>Supply-side reforms are, in simple terms, decisions that could make industries more productive to increase the supply of goods and services - and grow the economy too. <br/>Free-market examples include things like cutting business taxes, regulation, red tape, or even certain worker protections or welfare benefits. Or increasing migration for certain sectors. <br/>State-intervention examples could be building more houses, investing in infrastructure, or investing in homegrown energy supplies like nuclear power or renewables.  <br/>Clearly, any of these involve political choices too. <br/>But they also take time to come into effect. <br/>The government - and Labour - have ruled out direct support to help people with mortgages, saying this would fuel inflation - and instead point to existing benefits for the most vulnerable.<br/>Ministers are continuing to point to interest rates as the solution, though most are reluctant to admit that involves a lot of pain for it to work. <br/>It's important to remember when the government says it can't do something that what they're usually referring to is a choice. <br/>Each choice comes with its own shade of political thorniness, and potentially means trading the prime minister's priorities off against each other.<br/>UK inflation shock: This is really grim<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

As the party in government, the Conservatives bear the most responsibility for this.<br/>The Greens aren't entirely off the hook, though. Their decisions to oppose some solar farms shape our energy system, and give the impression that local objections have more weight than national missions.<br/>Frank Adlington-Stringer is one Green councillor who has opposed a solar farm in the past.<br/>In 2021, before he was elected to North East Derbyshire Council, Mr Adlington-Stringer wrote an article explaining why he could not support a solar farm in the county.<br/>He said \"the loss of green space\" and the restriction of \"already limited habitats\" were among his main concerns.<br/>In the end, the application was rejected by government planning inspectors. At the time, one local Green councillor said \"younger generations are very concerned about the effects of climate change, and might see things differently\".<br/>In this case, at least, Mr Adlington-Stringer, 25, did not. He says while he is open to solar farms, he believes such projects should not be a \"priority\".<br/>\"We shouldn't be exchanging green energy for green spaces,\" he says.<br/>Julia Hilton is another Green councillor who campaigned against a solar farm in Hastings, before she was elected in 2021.<br/>Although it didn't have any councillors at the time, the local Green Party rallied against proposed solar panels within agricultural fields in Hastings Country Park.<br/>The Labour-led council then abandoned the project after the government's environmental adviser, Natural England, said the scheme \"would result in significant landscape and visual impacts\".<br/>The label of NIMBY - an acronym for \"not in my backyard\" - is sometimes applied to those do not want something visually unappealing to be built near their home.<br/>Ms Hilton, now the Green group leader on Hastings Borough Council, bristles at the suggestion of the \"NIMBY argument\" in these circumstances.<br/>The proposed site, she says, was \"not compatible with a solar farm, which would industrialise this very precious landscape habitat\".<br/>Whatever the merits of individual solar proposals, the optics of Green politicians objecting to renewable energy have thrown up awkward questions for the party's leadership.<br/>Green Party of England and Wales co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, insists Greens \"see an important role for solar farms as part of the mix\".<br/>\"It's not about being ideological,\" he tells the BBC. \"The [solar] application has to be considered on its merits.\"<br/>He denies solar farms are a political problem for his party, and says there are Greens supporting them in Oxfordshire, Lancaster and Kent.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's a plea we hear a lot from the Green Party, which has been campaigning to make solar panels mandatory on the roofs of all suitable new homes.<br/>But will rooftops alone really fill our solar-shaped hole?<br/>Simon Evans, the deputy editor of Carbon Brief, says \"restricting cheap, utility-scale solar\" would make the challenge of net zero \"even more difficult\".<br/>The government's energy security strategy talks of expanding UK solar capacity to 70GW by 2035. \"It would not be possible to build that much solar capacity on the UK's rooftops,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>In a report, the government's climate adviser estimated a maximum potential of 37GW on rooftops. \"Even if it were possible to reach 70GW of solar on the UK's rooftops, it would be significantly more expensive to do so,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>This kind of assessment has not stopped some Greens and other parties standing in the way of solar farms in Suffolk.<br/>Earlier this year, two Green councillors sided with four Tories on Mid-Suffolk Council to block a solar farm near Somersham. And on the Suffolk-Cambridgeshire border, a plan to build one of Europe's largest solar farms - with the potential to power 172,000 homes - has been met with fierce resistance.<br/>Andrew Stringer - the first Green district councillor to be elected in Suffolk in 2003 - says the proposed Sunnica Energy Farm is a \"symptom of a wider problem\".<br/>He blames the Conservatives for failing to legislate to put more solar on roofs. A solar farm has to \"make sense\", he says, adding if it doesn't, and a Green councillor can't reconcile their opposition with their party's national policy, \"we embrace that\".<br/>\"It's called democracy,\" he says.<br/>Democracy served the party well in May's local elections, with the Greens making records gains, notably in some rural areas with a history of voting Conservative. This pivot to the countryside has expanded the party's base beyond its core voters in urban areas.<br/>The party has built \"a potentially unstable coalition, requiring some degree of hypocrisy, like their NIMBY stance\", said Dr James Dennison, a political scientist.<br/>On solar farms, the Greens \"are in danger of letting this narrative of hypocrisy spread and more so than for other parties given their environmental ideology,\" said Dr James Dennison, an expert on the party.<br/>\"This would hurt their national performance more than local.\"<br/>As the Greens seek to add parliamentary seats to their council ones, is there a temptation to a focus on wooing the type of rural voters who dislike the idea of solar farms?<br/>\"We put across our values for the local elections just gone and people came behind them very strongly, including in Suffolk and many rural areas around the country,\" says Mr Ramsay, who's eyeing up a seat in the Suffolk countryside.<br/>\"It will be the same at the general election.\"<br/>How UK Greens are learning from overseas allies<br/>Too late to save planet, says Green Party founder<br/>Labour hints at solar panel policy for new builds<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

And are those who wanted to remain still reeling?<br/>One of the most memorable images of the night the UK voted to remove itself from the EU came from Sunderland. An overjoyed woman dressed in a once-familiar red Vote Leave T-shirt, thrust on to a man's shoulders, raising her arms in jubilation.<br/>At around a quarter past midnight, on 24 June, 2016, the city became the first to declare it wanted out: 61.3% Leave and 38.7% Remain.<br/>It took another four years before Brexit actually happened, but would those who voted for it do so again?<br/>\"I would 100% vote leave,\" said Keith Rowe, who lives near the city's marina.<br/>\"I basically voted leave for my two daughters and my new granddaughter - for maximising their opportunities.\"<br/>Keith remembers when the UK joined the then European Economic Community in 1973, when he was a boy.<br/>\"It brought a lot of positives,\" he said.<br/>\"They brought a lot of health and safety legislations and helped employment law for workers but I think over the last 10 to 15 years we saw a lot of policies that were enforced on the United Kingdom.\"<br/>He thinks the referendum was \"predominantly a vote for change\". <br/>\"We were given a whole spiel of negatives but generally most people who voted for leave were quite positive types who wanted to maximise the opportunities of Brexit.<br/>\"You were labelled as thick if you were a leaver. I've got a science degree, I'm not thick. I can read around a subject like most people and work it out for myself.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Brexit: How did we get here?<br/>He highlighted \"two major benefits\" of leaving the EU: The UK's response to the Covid-19 vaccine and coming out of the Common Agricultural Policy.<br/>\"I know there have been negatives. We've seen some short-term employment issues in the hospitality industry and travel but generally it's a bit more paperwork, they can still come,\" he added.<br/>\"In Sunderland we've seen a massive, massive incoming of migrant workers, good workers, coming mainly to things like our NHS. <br/>\"In 20 years I'd love to see how people look back and we can turn around and tell the Remainers \"I told you so\".\"<br/>Sunderland was not alone in the north-east of England when it came to backing leave.<br/>In the North East of England, Newcastle was alone in supporting Remain, with a 1% margin.<br/>James and Janet Sheerin, who live in the city, proudly fly an EU flag outside their home. In one of the windows sits a flashing neon sign bearing the words \"Brexit has failed\".<br/>\"We have had so many people, complete strangers, call at the front door and say thank you for flying the flag,\" said Janet.<br/>The city narrowly voted to stay within the EU, the results declared live as the clock struck midnight: 50.7% remain, 49.3% leave. <br/>\"I had a bet on the result and I won,\" said James.<br/>\"There was a lot of disquiet with Europe but really it was disquiet with Westminster and what was going on there.<br/>\"Most of my life I've lived in Europe, I'm a European person, we've travelled in Europe and it seemed good for us and good for the country.<br/>\"I couldn't understand why people would want to leave. Well I could, but I didn't agree with the reasons.\"<br/>Janet voted remain so the UK did not become \"alone and isolated\".<br/>\"I thought it was awful the way that the Brexit vote made people who had been working here, living here, contributing here for many, many years - we made them feel unwanted and unwelcome,\" she said.<br/>\"And we've sent so many of them back to Europe. So many doctors and nurses. We don't have enough vegetable and fruit pickers in our fields we don't have enough HGV drivers. It's really damaged the economy and I cannot think of a single good reasons for leaving the EU.\" <br/>The couple take a long pause when asked if they feel there have been any positives to Brexit.<br/>\"No,\" said Janet.<br/>\"I'm trying hard to think about it,\" said James.<br/>He highlights the many new friends the couple have made who have come together for \"a common cause\".<br/>\"We can't continue as a little island on our own doing trade with people the other side of the world,\" he added.<br/>\"We're not going away and we won't go away until we rejoin the EU.\"<br/>Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

We were disrespected and manipulated.\" <br/>Like Ms Msezane, he was recruited last year by an agent in his home country via an advertisement on social media, and had to pay for his own airfare and visa before being put to work on fruit farms in the south of England.<br/>Ms Msezane, who is from Johannesburg, is now a care worker for an English local authority.<br/>She told the BBC she was treated with respect in her new role, in sharp contrast to her experience last year as a seasonal agricultural worker, picking and packing strawberries for British supermarkets.<br/>\"I could not have thought that the conditions I found in 2022, in the United Kingdom, were what I found. It was beyond shocking.<br/>\"I'd spent close to, almost, \u00a32,500 equivalent. There is no way I am going home at that point. I am here to make money. That's essentially it. So you get to work.\"<br/>She had to pay rent to live in a caravan with six people of different nationalities, both men and women, who had a single shower and fridge between them.<br/>\"My country is going through a lot economically. People need work. So I would never say to people not to come on the seasonal worker visa,\" she told the BBC.<br/>\"Everyone who was on the scheme with me was able to support their families in different ways.\"<br/>But she added: \"You need to be aware that you are coming into a country where you don't have as many rights as a worker as you do in South Africa. So that can be challenging.\"<br/>Vadim Sardov, from Kazakhstan, said conditions on his farm were so bad several people had decided to leave and work illegally instead.<br/>Seasonal workers were not asking for \"five star hotels\", he told the committee, but \"employers must provide proper living and working conditions\".<br/>Emiliano Mellino, a journalist for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, who has written a series of articles on the treatment of migrant workers, told the Lords committee some workers had been subjected to bullying and abuse.<br/>He said many take out loans to cover the costs of coming to the UK, and they also had to pay rent of up to \u00a380 a week for their accommodation, which meant they were reluctant to speak out for fear of losing their job.<br/>The government's official policy is to train British workers to fill the 50,000 seasonal jobs on British farms currently carried out by migrant workers.<br/>Before the UK left EU, most of these casual workers came from Europe.<br/>When the current seasonal workers visa scheme was launched in 2019, it had a quota of just 2,500 places a year, with most coming from Russia and Ukraine.<br/>It was expanded to 38,000 visas in 2022, following pressure from the farming industry, who had been forced to leave crops unpicked.<br/>The net was cast to a wider range of nationalities, including South Africa and central Asian countries like Kazakhstan.<br/>The scheme is due to run until 2024, with debate raging in government over whether it should be expanded to keep food costs down and help tame inflation.<br/>The government has authorised only a small number of recruitment companies, known as \"scheme operators\", to arrange seasonal worker visas. <br/>Farmers must hire their overseas workers through those companies and must demonstrate that they are actively trying to recruit UK-based workers as well. <br/>Scheme operators also have explicit duties to look after workers' welfare and make sure they are paid properly.<br/>At an earlier committee hearing, in April this year, farmer Mike Newey said it was a \"myth\" that seasonal fruit picking was a low skilled, poorly paid job with bad accommodation.<br/>\"Our seasonal workers are paid a minimum of \u00a310.42, the national living wage, and often earn \u00a315 to \u00a320 an hour when they are on piece-work rates. It is good pay. They have subsidised accommodation on the farm.\"<br/>He added: \"We should be proud of giving people from other countries a leg up.

He stresses that he's as dedicated to independence as anyone in the SNP, but he believes that patience is required.<br/>He's urged fellow members to focus on convincing more undecided voters to support independence, which he believes will create \"overwhelming\" pressure on the UK government to grant a second referendum.<br/>But others feel another referendum won't happen, and that brings us to option two. This involves using elections to secure independence.<br/>It's a tactic that's gained prominence in SNP circles in recent years. <br/>Towards the end of her leadership, Nicola Sturgeon floated the idea of running an election as a \"de facto\" referendum.<br/>The concept is fairly simple: the SNP would contest an election (or elections) insisting that a vote for them is a vote for independence. This could be stated in the opening line of a manifesto.<br/>Ash Regan, who ran to replace Nicola Sturgeon earlier this year, backs this approach.<br/>She believes the SNP could even team up with other pro-independence parties, meaning that more than 50% of the vote combined would lead to independence.<br/>She thinks it's time to move away from relying on the referendum path, saying \"we've been thinking of it as the gold standard, but in fact it's the ballot box that's the gold standard route\".<br/>But there are potential weaknesses with this option.<br/>Why would the UK government agree to this? Would the international community recognise it? <br/>Most advocates of such a Plan B feel that Westminster intransigence on a second referendum means that a radical alternative is needed.<br/>But others fear it won't deliver independence and would alienate the middle-ground of Scottish politics.<br/>Option three involves taking to the streets - mass demonstrations calling for independence. <br/>Perhaps this option should be seen as complementing others, rather than being a route to independence in itself. <br/>The cross-party All Under One Banner movement will march from Stirling to Bannockburn at the very same time the SNP gathers in Dundee.<br/>As a party member, Patrick McCarthy could have attended the convention. But he worries the SNP is simply \"talking to themselves\" . <br/>He'll be \"speaking to the mass movement\" by organising the march instead.<br/>He says \"the hearts and minds and belief in independence is the thing that's going to get us over the line\".<br/>The first minister will set out his preferred route to independence at Saturday's convention.<br/>Humza Yousaf wants to drive up overall support, but he's also said that elections must be used to advance the cause of independence.<br/>This convention won't rubber-stamp any strategy. That would have to come at the SNP's autumn conference.<br/>There are political risks for Humza Yousaf in this weekend's convention.<br/>It could highlight splits within his party. And it exposes him to accusations that he's prioritising the constitution over day-to-day problems.<br/>But, given that independence is his party's fundamental aim, it's important for him to show party members that he's formulating a plan to achieve the ultimate goal.<br/>The SNP may emerge closer to defining their strategy on independence, but making that a reality feels a harder task for the party right now.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Two years before the Brexit referendum, Clacton-on-Sea saw its MP defect to Brexit-supporting UKIP. How do people in the resort feel about it all now?<br/>The Tendring area of Essex - which includes the seaside town of Clacton - recorded one of the highest leave votes in England in the 2016 referendum. Almost 70% of people voted out - and turnout was 74.5%.<br/>Clacton was considered by many to be the beating heart of Brexit after its Conservative MP Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP in 2014. In 2015, 22 UKIP councillors were elected on to the district council.<br/>But what do people in the resort feel about Brexit today?<br/>\"I voted to leave, but I wish I hadn't,\" says Clacton resident Jill Ayling, 76. <br/>\"We didn't know the whole truth, did we? We were supposed to get money for the National Health Service, but to my mind it hasn't happened.  <br/>\"If I had to vote again, I'd vote to stay.\"<br/>She believes people were swayed by the political arguments at the time but it will have a lasting effect on younger generations. <br/>\"For younger people, it has altered dramatically for them. Things have changed,\" she says.<br/>Billy Ball, 42, the managing director of Clacton Pier, did not want to reveal how he voted in the 2016 referendum.<br/>\"The biggest challenge for hospitality and the seaside as a whole - and Clacton Pier - has been how the Eastern European labour took the decision to move home,\" he says.<br/>\"We've never really recovered from that. The British don't see hospitality as a long-term career path.<br/>\"It is an older demographic in Clacton and perhaps there's some idealism, with people thinking standing on our own two feet was a good thing. <br/>\"We were one of the country's only UKIP areas but it was probably all a bit of a flash in the pan. <br/>\"People tend to have forgotten why the resulting problems exist.\" <br/>Jason Smedley, 53, has lived in Clacton for 15 years and owns a number of businesses, including the Royal Hotel.<br/>He did not vote in the referendum.<br/>\"In all of my businesses, I can't see any difference,\" he says. \"Covid is the only thing that's had an impact here and around the country.\"<br/>He says he took the strong Brexit sentiment in Clacton with \"a pinch of salt\".<br/>\"I had a look at the main points and how it would affect me as a business and thought - actually, it doesn't - either way,\" he says.<br/>\"I was waiting to see this catastrophic failure of everything in the country.\"<br/>His view is echoed by the hotel's general manager, Victoria Hart. The 23-year-old was too young to vote in the 2016 ballot. <br/>\"It hasn't affected us at all,\" she says, \"especially people my age and my friends here in Clacton, we don't talk about it. <br/>\"Covid is the only thing that has severely impacted my life.\" <br/>Ryan Richards, 22, says he feels \"left out\" as he too was unable to vote in the referendum.<br/>\"We should have stayed with the EU,\" he says. <br/>\"With the trade routes and the way prices are going up now, it's becoming impossible for people my age even to get a home, let alone anything else - I blame Brexit for that.<br/>\"When it all happened we were under the age - I couldn't vote. <br/>\"I can understand why they want to make their their own trade routes without having to rely on someone, but they should have at least gone to young people, who are going or be majorly affected by it all. <br/>\"I feel left out.\"<br/>\"I don't think you can tell if it has worked, because of the pandemic and the trouble we've had with the government keeping changing, there hasn't been a time when you can say there's been a smooth period,\" says Ronald Oudnie.<br/>The 74-year-old voted for Brexit.<br/>\"You've got to wait until you've got a government that's been in for a few years, that it's been stable and able to sort things out.   <br/>\"I can remember when we actually joined the EU. We didn't sign up to a lot of things then that they brought in after, it was more like an economic thing. <br/>\"But they implemented laws on us when we should be implementing our own laws, it's as simple as that.\"<br/>Peter Lenard, 79, voted to stay in the EU.<br/>\"It's been a disaster, Brexit,\" he says.<br/>\"We were all promised we were going to put so much money into the NHS and I honestly think if you were to ask a lot of people today who voted out, I think a lot would change their mind.\"<br/>He says there is an element of \"I told you so\".  <br/>\"All my friends say the same,\" he says.<br/>\"I voted out because of Brussels, I was fed up of having to answer to them for every single thing, no for any other reason,\" says Beverley Banks.   <br/>\"I was hoping a lot of Europe was going to do the same and then we could form again and do it differently. <br/>\"It didn't happen. The Ukraine war didn't help, but everything is so much more expensive.\"<br/>Her friend Rosalie Pope says: \"I knew it was a bad idea, and it was.<br/>\"I travel internationally for business all the time and didn't want the rigmarole - so I voted 'in'.\" <br/>Small business owner Neil Stock, 55, is a former Conservative leader of Tendring District Council. <br/>\"How you judge whether that's been a success or a failure, or good or bad, or wrong or right, is down to your own independent view of the world,\" he says. <br/>\"If you were going to and from Europe on a regular basis I should imagine it's been quite irksome. <br/>\"But for most people it hasn't even touched the sides. I don't regret voting leave at all. If you reran the referendum, despite the opinion polls you'd get a very similar result. <br/>\"People who never vote came out and wielded the pencil in the ballot box and said 'I want to leave'. The decision was made on a whole raft of emotions, including sovereignty.<br/>\"We live in a post-Brexit world. It doesn't mean the world ended in 2016.\"<br/>The government has previously said it was \"making the most of Brexit freedoms\".<br/>\"The government is making the most of our Brexit freedoms to grow the economy, including ambitious financial services sector reforms which will unlock over \u00a3100bn of investment, and we are reviewing EU-derived rules in other critical growth sectors this year,\" said a spokesperson.<br/>Question Time is hosting a special debate from Clacton on BBC One from 22:40 BST.<br/>Photography by Martin Giles<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.  <br/>Some, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.<br/>Singling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills. <br/>More than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU. <br/>Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit. <br/>But the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.<br/>Most of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes. <br/>But in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.<br/>So while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.<br/>But here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU. <br/>And official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.<br/>However, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.  <br/>The remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic. <br/>The government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.<br/>But meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros. <br/>Every consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343. <br/>The changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.<br/>Meanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform. <br/>That is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages. <br/>Such employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers. <br/>Then there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum. <br/>Economists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.  <br/>But with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost. But that takes time. <br/>The current inflation shock is truly global. But those escalating bills in the UK may come with a Brexit surcharge on top - just when households and businesses feel they can least cope. <br/>Bread to loo roll: UK prices compared to Europe<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

We we were told he was talking about the first three months of 2023, when UK food price inflation was 18% and Sweden, Germany and Portugal were all over 20%.<br/>The reason UK food inflation is so high has been the focus of a recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis. The ONS is responsible for calculating the UK's inflation figures.<br/>It identified three main reasons behind the price rises:<br/>The good news is that global wholesale food prices (that's the amount producers charge for their produce) have been falling. However, it generally takes time for that to feed through to supermarket prices, so customers have to wait before their bills stop rising.<br/>The ONS says one reason the UK's prices have been rising faster for longer could be down to a reliance on food imports. This suggests European countries that grow more of their own food have seen smaller food prices increases.<br/>The next set of UK inflation figures - covering the year to May - will be published on Wednesday.<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one.

This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rachel Reeves says Labour will now \"ramp up\" its plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on green industries<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years. Last year, voters elected a Conservative mayor - even though the council itself is Labour.<br/>Commissioners have reported good progress at Sandwell and are \"optimistic\" about Liverpool - both areas where the incumbent party's vote has held up.<br/>Progress at Slough on the other hand has \"been very slow\", according to the commissioners, while Thurrock had another commissioner appointed in March after the government said it was \"continuing to fail in its best value duty\".<br/>So perhaps we can conclude that voters do pay attention to local issues - and are prepared to punish failed administrations at the ballot box.<br/>The people paying the price for a bankrupt council<br/>Commissioners will oversee troubled council<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Let me explain. <br/>The inquiry's chair Baroness Hallett is demanding unredacted WhatsApp messages and notebooks from Boris Johnson.<br/>They cover the period of the pandemic when he was prime minister and making key decisions.<br/>She is adamant that it is her job to decide what is and isn't relevant to her inquiry.<br/>The government disagrees - and speaking to people close to the process, I don't think they're going to back down. <br/>They argue that they need to protect the privacy of ministers and others. They say they will not send information that is \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry.<br/>Insiders have told the BBC they will send relevant messages - for example, WhatsApp conversations that led to a policy decision. They would not send messages involving personal conversations. <br/>But they think that decision is for the government - and its lawyers - to make.<br/>So who is going to win?<br/>The more likely answer seems to be the Covid inquiry.<br/>It has legal powers to compel people to produce documents. It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. It's his job is to look at constitutional issues like this. <br/>He told me: \"If the inquiry requests documents and info - then whoever it has asked should comply.\"<br/>He said this included the government.                             <br/>Caroline Nokes - another select committee chair - said Baroness Hallett was unlikely to roll over and there would be \"less pain for the government if they hand [the messages] over quickly\".<br/>Former Conservative health secretary Matt Hancock is among those who have made clear they are happy to share unredacted messages in full.<br/>Boris Johnson's allies have also made clear he is happy to send more information - and he says he has given his WhatsApp messages and notebooks in full to the Cabinet Office.<br/>He has also said he will bypass the Cabinet Office by providing WhatsApps dating from April 2021 onwards directly to the inquiry. <br/>So where does this leave the government? <br/>Potentially in a tricky place. <br/>It has now launched a legal battle with the inquiry looking into how it functioned during a public health crisis that changed all of our lives. <br/>If it loses, that would be an embarrassing defeat. Questions would be asked about using public money to fight the case. <br/>If it wins, it's quite possible the Covid inquiry will be seriously undermined. <br/>Will bereaved families who have demanded full transparency accept this? Where would such a ruling leave inquiry chair Baroness Hallett, who has made her position clear? <br/>Cabinet minister Mel Stride has questioned the need for \"irrelevant\" documents to be provided to the inquiry - saying they would not add value.<br/>He told the BBC the government would be \"robust and open and candid\" in its dealings with the inquiry.<br/>But he drew a distinction with information that was \"unambiguously, entirely irrelevant\".<br/>He added: \"It seems to me to request lots and lots of that kind of data is not something which is adding any value\". <br/>With the government and the inquiry now locked in a legal battle, this row looks set to drag on.<br/>Covid inquiry demands release of Johnson WhatsApps<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled.<br/>Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration<br/>Legal migration is too high, says Rishi Sunak<br/>Who is allowed to come to live in the UK?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

For MPs from the party, the data on voting intention highlights their thin support among younger generations.<br/>A YouGov poll found only 21% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they voted Conservative at the last general election in 2019, compared to 67% in the over-70s category.<br/>In recent polling, done at this month's local elections, only 8% of the 18 to 24 group said they would vote Conservative.<br/>\"For the 29 to 49-year-olds, that figure was 10%,\" Mr Hancock tells the event.<br/>That 10% figure, Mr Hancock says, \"is catastrophic for the electability of the Conservative Party, not just now, but for a decade\".<br/>\"We need to have credible policies that address the issues that younger people care about,\" he says.<br/>As a TikTok enthusiast with 184,000 followers on the platform, Mr Hancock claims to have an antenna for what young people are looking for in politics.<br/>Curbing climate change, providing more affordable housing, and technological innovation are what young people care about - not some \"divisive culture war\", Mr Hancock says.<br/>Even though he's been suspended as a Tory MP over his appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity, Mr Hancock is well received here.<br/>But does his analysis really reflect the hopes and fears of younger generations?<br/>At the event, we speak to five people under the age of 30, and tellingly, all of them say housing is their biggest worry.<br/>Eve Redmond, a 23-year-old renter who recently moved to London, says: \"I don't think I'll get on the property ladder in the next 10 to 15 years.<br/>\"I do think housing is a particularly important political issue for young people under the age of 30, millennials like me.\"<br/>Joe Lynch, the 18-year-old chairman of Romford Young Conservatives, agrees.<br/>\"We need more affordable housing,\" he says. \"If we can do that as a party, more young people can flock to us.\"<br/>He says the creeping Americanisation of British politics has damaged the Conservative brand.<br/>Some young people, he says, \"think we're all Make American Great Again lunatics, but that's not the case at all\".<br/>The perception among young people of being \"the nasty party\" troubles Nathan Stone, 20.<br/>He says the war against woke - a term that has come to symbolise conservative resistance to social changes - has been \"taken to the extremes\" lately.<br/>He says some of the ideas expressed at this week's National Conservatism Conference - an event organised by a right-wing American think tank - are \"not really going to appeal to younger people\".<br/>In his comments, Mr Hancock savages the \"Conservative Corbynistas\" in his party, who \"preach the same sort of cancel culture and virtue signalling that they say that they abhor on the left\".<br/>\"Looking at what's going on at other conferences, sometimes it felt like 'I'm a Conservative get me out of here',\" he says.<br/>With Mr Hancock standing down as an MP at the next election, he soon will be out of there. And yet, he still believes the liberal wing of his party has the answers to today's political questions.<br/>They will need answers if they are to bridge the generational gulfs exposed at recent general elections. In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now. I'm not a Conservative MP. It's just like, be normal, like the people who we represent.

For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods and companies pay tax on their profits.<br/>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens.<br/>But if it can't, it needs to either raise taxes, cut spending or borrow. <br/>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.<br/>So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which they hope will help the economy.<br/>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.<br/>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. <br/>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.<br/>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. <br/>The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called \"quantitative easing\".<br/>The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. <br/>For instance, when people submit tax returns in January, they often pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, so the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. <br/>So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date.<br/>In the 2022-23 financial year, the government borrowed \u00a3134.1bn. That was about \u00a312bn higher than the previous year.<br/>In May, the government borrowed \u00a320bn, which was the second-highest borrowing figure for May since records began in 1993.<br/>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about \u00a32.57tn.<br/>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.<br/>That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. <br/>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level.<br/>But in relation to the size of the economy, today's debt is still low compared with much of the last century, as shown above, and also compared with some other leading economies. <br/>The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. <br/>That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s. But it is more noticeable now that interest rates have been rising. <br/>Two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: \u00a320bn in June and \u00a318bn in December. The third largest amount came in April 2023, when interest payments hit \u00a39.8bn.<br/>In May 2023, debt interest was \u00a37.7bn.<br/>During the last financial year, the government spent \u00a3111bn on debt interest - more than it spent on education. <br/>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  <br/>Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.<br/>The government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. <br/>In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. <br/>The OBR says debt could rise to more than 300% of GDP by 2070. <br/>It also says climate change poses a \"significant\" risk to government finances. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?<br/>Responding to the OBR report, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government would take \"difficult but responsible\" decisions on the public finances.<br/>He previously blamed the \"twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine\" for driving up government costs.<br/>The chancellor has set a target of getting underlying debt to fall in five years' time.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises.<br/>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.<br/>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. <br/>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. <br/>It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  <br/>Two dead after 'emergency' on Crimea bridge<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The lift off was greeted with cheers and loud applause from the crowds and the scientists.<br/>The BBC's Arunoday Mukharji, who was at the launch site, said there were roars of \"Bharat Mata ki jai [Victory to mother India]\" from every corner of the hall. <br/>\"Chandrayaan-3 has begun its journey towards the Moon,\" Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said in his first comments following the successful lift off. \"Our launch vehicle has put the Chandrayaan on the precise orbit around the Earth.\" Isro tweeted that \"the health of the spacecraft is normal\".<br/>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Chandrayaan-3 had \"scripted a new chapter in India's space odyssey\". <br/>\"It soars high, elevating the dreams and ambitions of every Indian. This momentous achievement is a testament to our scientists' relentless dedication. I salute their spirit and ingenuity!\" he wrote on Twitter.<br/>The third in India's programme of lunar exploration, Chandrayaan-3 is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions. <br/>It comes 13 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which carried out \"the first and most detailed search for water on the lunar surface and established the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime\", said Mylswamy Annadurai, project director of Chandrayaan-1.<br/>Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful. Its orbiter continues to circle and study the Moon even today, but the lander-rover failed to make a soft landing and crashed during touchdown. It was because of \"a last-minute glitch in the braking system\", explained Mr Annadurai.<br/>Mr Somanath has said they have carefully studied the data from the last crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches.<br/>Chandrayaan-3, which weighs 3,900kg and cost 6.1bn rupees ($75m; \u00a358m), has the \"same goals\" as its predecessor - to ensure a soft-landing on the Moon's surface, he added. <br/>The lander (called Vikram, after the founder of Isro) weighs about 1,500kg and carries within its belly the 26kg rover which is named Pragyaan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom. <br/>After Friday's lift-off, the craft will take about 15 to 20 days to enter the Moon's orbit. Scientists will then start reducing the rocket's speed over the next few weeks to bring it to a point which will allow a soft landing for Vikram. <br/>If all goes to plan, the six-wheeled rover will then eject and roam around the rocks and craters on Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.<br/>\"The rover is carrying five instruments which will focus on finding out about the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface. I'm hoping we'll find something new,\" Mr Somanath told Mirror Now.<br/>The south pole of the Moon is still largely unexplored - the surface area that remains in shadow there is much larger than that of the Moon's north pole, which means there is a possibility of water in areas that are permanently shadowed. Chandrayaan-1 was the first to discover water on the Moon in 2008, near the south pole.<br/>\"We have more scientific interest in this spot because the equatorial region, which is safe for landing, has already been reached and a lot of data is available for that,\" Mr Somanath said. <br/>\"If we want to make a significant scientific discovery, we have to go to a new area such as the south pole, but it has higher risks of landing.\"<br/>Mr Somanath adds data from Chandrayaan-2 crash has been \"collected and analysed\" and it has helped fix all the errors in the latest mission.<br/>\"The orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 has been providing lots of very high-resolution images of the spot where we want to land and that data has been well studied so we know how many boulders and craters are there and we have widened the domain of landing for a better possibility.\"  <br/>The landing, Mr Annadurai said, would have to be \"absolutely precise\" to coincide with the start of a lunar day (a day on the Moon equals 14 days on Earth) because the batteries of the lander and the rover would need sunlight to be able to charge and function.<br/>The Moon mission, Mr Annadurai says, was thought up in the early 2000s as an exciting project to attract talent at a time of the IT boom in India, as most technology graduates wanted to join the software industry.<br/>\"The success of Chandrayaan-1 helped on that count. The space programme became a matter of pride for India and it's now considered very prestigious to work for Isro.\"<br/>But the larger goal of India's space programme, Mr Annadurai says, \"encompasses science and technology and the future of humanity\". <br/>India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon that's often described as a gateway to deep space.<br/>\"If we want to develop the Moon as an outpost, a gateway to deep space, then we need to carry out many more explorations to see what sort of habitat would we be able to build there with the locally-available material and how will we carry supplies to our people there,\" Mr Annadurai says.<br/>\"So the ultimate goal for India's probes is that one day when the Moon - separated by 360,000km of space - will become an extended continent of Earth, we will not be a passive spectator, but have an active, protected life in that continent and we need to continue to work towards that.\" <br/>And a successful Chandrayaan-3 will be a significant step in that direction.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

This is an outflow of material from a protostar called VLA1623.<br/>Very young stars - their age measured in mere thousands of years - will pull hydrogen gas and dust on to themselves as they grow. But the dynamics involved mean some of this material will also get ejected outwards to crash into, and light up, the nearby environment.<br/>VLA1623 is one such nascent star. It's buried deep within the outflow and is invisible to Webb's infrared eyes. We know it's there, however, because telescopes sensitive at radio wavelengths have seen it. <br/>They've also detected two or three other similar protostars in the immediate vicinity that are likely contributing to the outflow's contortions.<br/>Once you realise what's going on in the image around VLA1623, you can then pick out similar flows elsewhere in the Webb vista. There are a great many, which just illustrates how productive this region of space is.<br/>JWST is a joint project of Nasa and the European (Esa) and Canadian (CSA) space agencies.<br/>It was launched on 25 December, 2021, but engineers needed six months to set up the observatory and test all its systems.<br/>It was on 12 July, 2022, that we were shown the first colour images.<br/>Webb's key goal is to trace the very first stars to shine in the Universe more than 13.5bn years ago, and already it has demonstrated that galaxies of stars assembled much earlier, and matured much more quickly, than anyone had previously thought possible.<br/>The telescope has other objectives, too, one of which is to show us the detail of how stars are created and how they spawn planets. And it's for this reason that Rho Ophiuchi is a fascinating target for the most powerful observatory in space.<br/>\"There's so much going on in this spectacular picture, as young stars splash vibrant colours across the clouds of gas and dust from which they're being born,\" commented Prof Mark McCaughrean, Esa's senior advisor for science & exploration.<br/>\"Much of the bright red emission comes from jets of shocked molecular gas flowing at high speed from an invisible protostar, VLA1623, a star so young that many Stone Age cave paintings pre-date it. <br/>\"JWST is not only going to revolutionise our view of how galaxies were born in the early universe, but also how stars and planets are being made today, much closer to home in our own Milky Way,\" the astronomer told BBC News.<br/>To underline just what a marvel Webb is, the below image of the Rho Ophiuchi complex was acquired by Nasa's now retired Spitzer space telescope. Spitzer, like Webb, was sensitive to infrared light. It was a very capable facility, but with a primary mirror just 85cm in diameter, it could never have achieved the kind of detail we now see with Webb's 6.5m primary mirror.<br/>You can re-read the BBC's coverage of the release of Webb's first colour images on 12 July, 2022, by clicking here.<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They have been doing this since the lab was founded in 2011, just months after a devastating tsunami flooded the reactors, causing a radiation leak. <br/>Except Ms Kimura is not a scientist - and neither are any of the women who run the non-profit lab, whose name Tarachine is derived from the term for \"mother\" in old Japanese. Shaken after the tsunami, Ms Kimura says locals started the lab to find out what was safe to feed their children because it was hard to come by information on the risks of radiation. So they asked technical experts to train them on how to test for radioactive substances and log the readings, raised funds and began educating themselves. <br/>It was the decision of a shattered community that never thought an accident at the nuclear power plant was possible. Now, 12 years on, they again find themselves struggling to trust the Japanese government as it insists it's safe to release treated radioactive water from the plant into the Pacific Ocean. <br/>Earlier this month, Japan received the green light to start pumping more than a million tonnes - about the same volume as 500 Olympic-size pools - of the treated water that has been used to cool the melted reactors. It has accumulated in more than a 1,000 tanks and now, as they reach capacity, it needs to go somewhere. <br/>Japan's nuclear regulator has given Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (Tepco), which runs the plant, the go-ahead. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi said the watchdog's two-year review found that the plan complies with international standards and the treated water will have \"a negligible radiological impact on people and the environment\". Neighbouring South Korea too delivered a similar assessment, despite sticking to a ban on some Japanese food imports. China and Hong Kong have announced similar bans. <br/>But the people who live in and around Fukushima are not convinced.<br/>\"We still don't know the extent to which the contaminated water has been treated. That's why we oppose the release,\" Ms Kimura says, adding that many local families are worried about the discharge of the treated water.<br/>Tepco has been filtering the water to remove more than 60 radioactive substances, but the water will not be entirely radiation-free. It will have tritium and carbon-14, radioactive isotopes of hydrogen and carbon respectively that cannot be easily removed from water. But experts say they are not a danger unless consumed in large quantities because they emit very low levels of radiation. That's also why before the filtered water is released it will go through another phase of treatment where it's diluted with seawater to reduce the remaining substances' concentrations. <br/>Japan's government has said that by the end of the filtration and testing process, the treated water will be no different than the water released by nuclear plants around the world.  <br/>But the facts are up against fear in Fukushima, where the reminders of the \"invisible enemy\" - as many here call radiation - are constant. <br/>After the disaster the government declared a 30km (22 miles) exclusion area around the plant, evacuating more than 150,000 people. Although a lot has changed, whole neighbourhoods are still empty and greenery covers the roofs and windows of long-abandoned homes. Signs on storefronts have faded away but metal barriers and yellow tape warning people to keep out remain on the narrow, deserted streets.  <br/>Even the Tarachine lab is proof of how much the community fears the \"invisible enemy\", despite assurances to the contrary.  <br/>In the main lab, one volunteer is chopping cabbage before taking it to be measured for gamma radiation, and another is treating water before the sample is tested. In the hallway there are bags of soil and dust from vacuum cleaners that have been used in homes nearby. At the back of the room, food samples are dried before they're tested for radiation. On the walls, there are charts and maps of the nuclear plant and the sea around it, with markings in various colours to show the degree of radiation and how far it has travelled. <br/>The women collect samples but they also test material sent to them by local people. \"Some families brought us acorns [to test],\" Ms Kimura said.  \"In Japan we make spinning tops from acorns with toothpicks. The government wouldn't think to check that. We were asked by some mothers to measure the radiation levels at their local park.\" <br/>The lab measures all sorts of samples for radioactive substances such as strontium-90, tritium and caesium-134 and 137, tracking their levels over the years.   <br/>\"We upload all our findings on our website so anybody can find it,\" Ms Kimura says. \"We have been able to confirm that radioactive substances have decreased gradually in the food we measure. If they release the water, it's ultimately undoing the power of nature that brought it to this level.\"   <br/>She sees the contentious plan as a big step backwards. She says there are still \"lingering emotional wounds\" from the 2011 disaster and this decision is reopening them. <br/>The plan - in the works for two years now - is a necessary step in the lengthy and costly clean-up, experts say. For the plant to be decommissioned, the radioactive debris inside the melted reactors must be removed. And to do that, they must first discharge the water that has been used to cool the reactors since a tsunami crippled the plant in 2011. <br/>In March, Tepco's boss Akira Ono told the Associated Press that they're only now beginning to fully comprehend the damage inside the reactors. The most pressing task, he said, was to safely start releasing the water to clear the area around the plant. They also need to make room for more water because the melted debris needs to be cooled throughout.  <br/>\"The real problem is not the actual physical effect of the radiation. It's our fear of it,\" says molecular pathology expert Gerry Thomas, who worked with Japanese scientists on radiation research and advised the IAEA as well. <br/>She says the science was lost among warring nuclear activists soon after the disaster, and to reassure a shocked and terrified population, the government went to great lengths to show they were taking all the necessary precautions. <br/>\"The politicians are trying to prove they're cautious and, you know, they're looking after everybody. But actually, the message that people receive is, well, this stuff must be really, really dangerous.\"<br/>And now the fear - and the lack of trust - is proving hard to shake off. <br/>Worse, it's also affecting livelihoods. Fishermen say that discharging the treated water will tarnish the reputation of their catch, driving prices and already struggling businesses down. They say the industry here never recovered fully since the disaster and is still dependent on government subsidies. <br/>Inside the nuclear plant, Tepco official Kazuo Yamanaka points to two fish tanks - one where flatfish swim in regular sea water, and another where they are in water with the same radiation levels as that which will be pumped into the ocean. He says the fish are closely monitored - while there is a rise in tritium levels inside them at first, it plateaus and then the fish flush it out of their system once they're back in standard sea water.  <br/>\"I am a radiation expert, so I know that tritium has very little effect on the human body and living organisms,\" he said. \"We are all concerned about the same thing - radiation - and that is why we are so anxious. I hope that these data and images will help to reassure people a little. <br/>Toru Takahashi, whose family has been fishing for three generations, is far from reassured: \"We're against it. We're already seeing the negative effects. We've seen contractors who say they won't buy Fukushima products.\"<br/>For him, this is personal. Giving up the family business is not an option, he says, as he supervises port staff who unload buckets of fish to wash and make ready for auction and then the market. <br/>He says it's a fraction of the business they had before the 2011 disaster: \"We are still at 300 million yen [a year], including all the small boats. Before, we made around 700 million yen [\u00a33.9m; $5.1m].\"  <br/>He fears it might get worse once the water is released, given the import bans already announced by China and South Korea. <br/>When asked if sound science is enough to overcome these concerns, Mr Yamanaka admitted that \"we cannot control the reputation, no matter how nicely we dress it up\", adding that \"we believe our efforts will one day settle these arguments\". <br/>\"I know we've lost the trust of the people - it'll take time to get it back.\"  <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

That creates a force - called the Lorentz force - which acts on the sea water and propels the craft along.<br/>Without propellers or a drive shaft churning up the water, a working MHD drive could provide fast and completely silent travel.<br/>Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades and the original concept dates back to the 1960s.<br/>In 1992, the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation built Yamato-1, a 30m-long ship that tested a MHD drive.<br/>However, the drive was so heavy that the Yamato-1 could only manage to plod along at a speed of 6.6 knots. It also used up a lot of energy.<br/>But researchers say the project proved such a drive could work and provided useful data.<br/>\"Authentic information on defects and weak points, together with what should be made... when we carry out a Yamato-2 in the future,\" says Hiromitsu Kitagawa, visiting research fellow at the Ocean Policy Research Institute, of which the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation is now part.<br/>The Yamato project showed that much more powerful magnets would be needed, plus more robust electrodes - the parts of the drive which make contact with the water.<br/>According to Ms Swithenbank, the first of these problems may well be easily solvable now, with a new generation of magnets, developed by the nuclear fusion industry.<br/>Fusion is the reaction which powers stars. But to make it happen here on earth often requires extremely powerful magnets to contain swirling clouds of burning hot plasma.<br/>The force generated by these new magnets has been likened to double the pressure at the bottom of the deepest ocean trench.<br/>While more powerful magnets are now available, the second problem, how to protect the electrodes, still needs work.<br/>Metal corrodes when placed in seawater and an electrical current accelerates that process. Some types of magnetic field have the same corrosive effect.<br/>On the Yamato-1 it was found that electrodes were losing around 3% of their mass per year.<br/>Jeffrey Long, a research chemist at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), is a battery specialist, and is expecting to take part in the Darpa programme, along with colleague Zachary Neale.<br/>\"If you have ever placed paper clips in a cup of salt water connected to a 9-volt battery, you'd notice the water turns colour because the metal is corroding,\" he says.<br/>\"Essentially, we want electrodes that don't corrode, while still supporting the high electrical current density required for effective operation.\"<br/>However, improvements in coatings by the fuel cell and battery industries in recent years mean this problem may well now be solvable.<br/>While these are important advances, other problems remain.<br/>Passing a current across seawater breaks the hydrogen-oxygen bond, creating gas bubbles on the electrodes which creates resistance and reduces the efficiency of the MHD.<br/>Potential solutions will have to be tested, including gas-diffusing electrodes created by the fuel cell industry.

Hemlock, however, is far from our only green neighbour that poses a risk.<br/>The Bucklesham hemlock's days are numbered.<br/>First reported to Suffolk County Council in June by parish council chairman David Brinkley, the authority has pledged to close the road and remove the offending plant.<br/>In his call to action, Mr Brinkley says delays to the plant's removal \"put children's lives at stake\", with them needing to go into the road to avoid it.<br/>Head teacher Rachael Rudge has similar concerns.<br/>\"To walk on the roads because the path isn't safe because of all the hemlock and vegetation overgrowing, they're being put in this really difficult and unsafe position,\" she says.<br/>But according to Prof Iain Barr, of the University of East Anglia, the removal of the hemlock leaves a further 28,000 still dotted around the UK.<br/>Prof Barr, a professor of field ecology, tells the BBC about a number of other dangerous plants sitting in plain sight and why some pose such a threat.<br/>The giant hogweed - Heracleum mantegazzianum - is not to be messed with, says Prof Barr.<br/>It is one of more than 100 toxic plants found in the UK and listed as potentially harmful by the Royal Horticultural Society.<br/>\"If you touch it and your body reacts to it, it can cause a reaction and makes you very susceptible to sunburn,\" Prof Barr says. \"You don't want to come into contact with any part of it.\"<br/>The toxic sap of the plant, which grows near canals and rivers, can cause burns, blisters and scarring to those who touch it.<br/>The plant, a close relative of cow parsley, has white flowers, thick bristly stems and can grow more than 16ft (5m) tall. <br/>Native to Central Asia, it was introduced into Britain in 1893 as an ornamental plant, but \"escaped from domestication\".<br/>Toxic components in the leaves, stems, roots, flowers and seeds can be transferred to skin by touch. <br/>It is often confused with its native relative, the common hogweed.<br/>\"That's also toxic,\" says Prof Barr. \"But less so.\"<br/>A staple favourite for a shadier spot in the garden, the much-loved foxglove's floral beauty comes with a dark side.<br/>Foxglove - digitalis - is a source of digitoxin, a glycoside in the drug digitalis, which has been used as a heart stimulant since 1785. <br/>It is also well-known for its toxicity in all parts of the plant. <br/>Consuming the leaves can cause oral and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. <br/>In severe cases, symptoms can include visual disturbances, plus heart and kidney problems.<br/>\"People should just stand back and admire it,\" says Prof Barr. <br/>\"Don't eat it,\" says Prof Barr.<br/>Deadly nightshade is one of the UK's most poisonous plants and just a couple of berries, which contain tropane alkaloids, would be enough to kill a person. <br/>\"It is part of the tomato family,\" says Prof Barr. \"It can be found in woodlands, though it is not quite as common as it used to be.\"<br/>The Solanaceae family is a vast one with more than 2,500 members including tomatoes, potatoes, chillies, aubergines, peppers, tobacco, deadly nightshade and henbane.<br/>Despite its deadly potential, the nerve-gas antidote atropine sulphate can be extracted from it.<br/>\"The hemlock water dropwort is very, very common around the [Norfolk and Suffolk] Broads,\" says Prof Barr. \"It is also very toxic.\"<br/>Also known as the \"poison parsnip\", hemlock water dropwort - Oenanthe crocata - is one of the most poisonous plants native to the UK.<br/>Both hemlock and hemlock water dropwort are part of the carrot family, but live in different habitats and have different toxins.<br/>The tubers, stems and leaves all contain a poisonous and powerful convulsant called oenanthotoxin, which targets the central nervous system.<br/>Hemlock on the other hand contains five alkaloids - coniine, conhydrine, pseudoconhydrine, methyl-coniine and ethyl-piperidine - which cause violent vomiting and paralysis of the nervous system.<br/>Toxic plant related deaths are very rare in the UK - but they do happen. The Office for National Statistics found six people died from the \"toxic effect of ingested plants\" in 2016..<br/>But how do plants become so toxic that they can kill people?<br/>\"It is all to do with chemistry and evolution,\" says Dr Barr. \"Plants have developed toxins to avoid being eaten.<br/>\"So a plant that is slightly more toxic to a grazing animal than the ones next to it has a slight advantage.<br/>\"Over time, this process leads to a point where certain plants can become very toxic to certain species.\"<br/>The majority of the UK's native toxic plants evolved their toxins to deter huge creatures like woolly mammoths or 2m (6ft 6in) tall aurochs, rather than us humans, he said.<br/>\"If an aurochs or mammoth overgrazed, then the plant alkaloids would make it not feel very well,\" he says. <br/>\"It was not designed to kill them, just to make them unwell and to stop eating.\"<br/>Plant toxins certainly did not develop, he says, to prevent children from walking to school.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Scientists say the new scanning method could revolutionise medical research.<br/>Cancer Research UK said the new scanning technique had \"a wealth of potential\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Scanning a transparent mouse to reveal the body in unprecedented detail<br/>The researchers say the method reveals far greater detail than existing scanning techniques. In one of the first applications the team has detected cancerous tumours in the first stages of formation.<br/>Prof Ert\u00fcrk says this is important because cancer drugs have to be shown to eliminate tumours in mice before being tested on humans. <br/>\"MRI and PET scans would show you only big tumours. Ours show tumours at the single cell, which they absolutely can't\".<br/>\"Current drugs extend life by a few years and then the cancer comes back. This is because the development process never included eliminating those tiny tumours, which were never visible.\"<br/>Normally lab mice are given cancer and scanned with conventional scans to see how the tumour has progressed. They are then treated with the cancer drug being tested and then scanned again to see what if any difference the treatment has had.<br/>Prof Ert\u00fcrk's scanning method can only be used on dead mice, to give a picture of how much cancer has progressed, or potentially, whether a treatment has worked. He made mice transparent after they were given cancer and then scanned them using his new technique. Only a few mice would need to be made transparent to test the effectiveness of the drug.<br/>Dr Rupal Mistry, research information manager at Cancer Research UK, said:<br/>\"This exciting and unique scanning technique has a wealth of potential for building our knowledge of how our bodies work and what goes wrong in diseases like cancer. <br/>\"While researchers will only be able to use the technique to examine the bodies of deceased mice, it could tell us a lot about how cancer develops at the early stages of the disease. Being able to visualise tumours in the context of the entire body will also give researchers a greater understanding of the impact of different drugs and treatment.<br/>\"Advances in technology like this are essential to driving progress and will hopefully lead to new ways to detect, treat and prevent cancer.\"<br/>The cancer application, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is just one of hundreds if not thousands to which the new scanning technique can be used to improve medical studies. It can enable researchers to see things they have never seen before.<br/>Mouse studies are often the starting point for learning about processes in the human body. But the new technique can be used on any animals. It could also be used to make human tissues and organs transparent, though it is unlikely to be used to make an entire human body transparent in the near future because there would be no medical advances that could be made from it at this stage.<br/>Creation of the transparent mouse involves removing all the fats and pigment from its corpse, using a chemical process. It ends up looking like a clear plastic toy, which is ever so slightly bendy. Its organs and nerves are all still inside it - but near invisible.<br/>While Prof Ert\u00fcrk's developed the process to make a mouse transparent five years ago, the scanning technique makes the most of it.<br/>He has found a way of adding other chemicals known as antibodies to highlight the parts of the mouse he is interested in studying under a microscope. Different antibodies stick to different types of tissue and so highlight whatever the researchers are interested in looking at.<br/>As well as highlighting cancerous areas, Prof Ert\u00fcrk's team has produced a suite of videos which enable researchers to fly through the mouse's nervous system, gut or lymph system. <br/>The scans have several advantages over what is available now.<br/>First, the researchers can study diseases in the context of the entire body, which gives them a much greater understanding of the impact of different drugs and treatments.<br/>The 3D images are also stored online, so researchers studying different parts of the animal or wanting to do the same experiment can draw from a library, rather than having to use another mouse. Prof Ert\u00fcrk believes that the technique could reduce lab animal use tenfold. <br/>Dr Nana-Jane Chipampe, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, is excited at the prospect of using the new scanning technique to study how cells develop in the human body. Currently she has to slice up tissues into very thin sections to study them under a microscope. Soon she will be able to see details in 3D.<br/>\"I can't wait to get my hands on it!\" she told me enthusiastically.<br/>\"It has the potential to identify new tissues, cells and diseases which will really help us understand the development of diseases.\"<br/>Her team leader, Prof Muzlifah Haniffa, is producing an online map or atlas of every cell in the human body. She says the new scanning technique will be useful for all kinds of medical research. <br/>\"Without a doubt, it will accelerate the pace of medical research,\" she said. \"Combining these cutting-edge technologies and building the human cell atlas will no doubt completely revolutionise medicine.\"<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Very hot. And we are only a few weeks into summer.<br/>Nearly a third of Americans - over 113 million people - are under some form of heat advisory, the US National Weather Service said. <br/>Across the US, temperatures are shattering decades-long record highs. In El Paso, Texas, temperatures have soared to above 37C - triple-digits Fahrenheit - for 27 consecutive days, overtaking a record last set in 1994.  <br/>In the UK, the June heat didn't just break all-time records, it smashed them. It was 0.9C hotter than the previous record, set back in 1940. That is a huge margin.<br/>There is a similar story of unprecedented hot weather in North Africa, the Middle East and Asia.<br/>No surprise, then, that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather forecasts said that globally, June was the hottest on record.<br/>And the heat has not eased. The three hottest days ever recorded were in the past week, according to the EU climate and weather service, Copernicus.<br/>The average world temperature hit 16.89C on Monday 3 July and topped 17C for the first time on 4 July, with an average global temperature of 17.04C. <br/>Provisional figures suggest that was exceeded on 5 July when temperatures reached 17.05C.<br/>These highs are in line with what climate models predicted, says Prof Richard Betts, climate scientist at the Met Office and University of Exeter.<br/>\"We should not be at all surprised with the high global temperatures,\" he says. \"This is all a stark reminder of what we've known for a long time, and we will see ever more extremes until we stop building up more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\"<br/>When we think about how hot it is, we tend to think about the air temperature, because that's what we experience in our daily lives.   <br/>But most of the heat stored near the surface of the Earth is not in the atmosphere, but in the oceans. And we've been seeing some record ocean temperatures this spring and summer.  <br/>The North Atlantic, for example, is currently experiencing the highest surface water temperatures ever recorded.<br/>That marine heatwave has been particularly pronounced around the coasts of the UK, where some areas have experienced temperatures as much as 5C above what you would normally expect for this time of year.<br/>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has labelled it a Category 4 heatwave. The designation is rarely used outside of the tropics and denotes \"extreme\" heat.<br/>\"Such anomalous temperatures in this part of the North Atlantic are unheard of,\" says Daniela Schmidt, a professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.<br/>At the same time, an El Ni\u00f1o is developing in the tropical Pacific.  <br/>El Ni\u00f1o is a recurring weather pattern caused when warm waters rise to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean.<br/>With both the Atlantic and the Pacific experiencing heatwaves, it is perhaps not surprising that global sea surface temperatures for both April and May were the highest ever recorded in Met Office data that goes all the way back to 1850.<br/>If the seas are warmer than usual, you can expect higher air temperatures too, says Tim Lenton, professor of climate change at Exeter University.<br/>Most of the extra heat trapped by the build-up of greenhouse gases has gone into warming the surface ocean, he explains. That extra heat tends to get mixed downwards towards the deeper ocean, but movements in oceans currents - like El Ni\u00f1o - can bring it back to the surface.<br/>\"When that happens, a lot of that heat gets released into the atmosphere,\" says Prof Lenton, \"driving up air temperatures.\"<br/>It's easy to think of this exceptionally hot weather as unusual, but the depressing truth is that climate change means it is now normal to experience record-breaking temperatures.  <br/>Greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase year on year. The rate of growth has slowed slightly, but energy-related CO2 emissions were still up almost 1% last year, according to the International Energy Agency, a global energy watchdog.<br/>And the higher the global temperature, the higher the risk of heatwaves, says Friederike Otto, a climatologist at the Grantham Institute of Climate Change at Imperial College London.<br/>\"These heatwaves are not only more frequent, but also hotter and longer than they would have been without global warming,\" she says.<br/>Experts are already predicting that the developing El Ni\u00f1o is likely to make 2023 the world's hottest year.<br/>They fear it is likely to temporarily push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>And that is just the start. Unless we make dramatic reductions to greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures will continue to rise.<br/>The Met Office said this week that record June temperatures this year were made twice as likely because of man-made climate change. <br/>These rising temperatures are already driving fundamental and almost certainly irreversible changes in ecosystems across the world.<br/>The record June temperatures in the UK helped cause unprecedented deaths of fish in rivers and canals, for example.  <br/>We cannot know what impact the current marine heatwave will have on the UK, cautions Prof Schmidt of the University of Bristol, because we have never seen one this intense before. <br/>\"In other regions, around Australia, in the Mediterranean, entire ecosystems changed, kelp forests disappeared, and seabirds and whales starved,\" she says.<br/>The world is effectively in a race. <br/>It is clear we are speeding towards an ever hotter and more chaotic climate future, but we do have the technologies and tools to cut our emissions.<br/>The question now is whether we can do so rapidly enough to slow the climate juggernaut and keep the impacts of global warming within manageable boundaries.<br/>World records hottest day for third time in a week<br/>Are wildfires in the US getting worse?<br/>Two dead after 'emergency' on Crimea bridge<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>In June, scientists declared that El Ni\u00f1o conditions were present. This means that additional heat is now welling up to the surface of the Pacific ocean, pushing up the global temperature. <br/>\"The average global surface air temperature reaching 17C for the first time since we have reliable records available is a significant symbolic milestone in our warming world,\" said climate researcher Leon Simons.<br/>\"Now that the warmer phase of El Ni\u00f1o is starting we can expect a lot more daily, monthly and annual records breaking in the next 1.5 years.\"<br/>Monday's record temperature comes as the month of June was also confirmed as the hottest June in the global record. <br/>Average temperatures across the planet were 1.46C above the average in the period between 1850 and 1900.<br/>The impact of high temperatures is also being felt at the world's extremes.

CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. <br/>These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.<br/>Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.<br/>Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100. <br/>To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.<br/>However, the UN now wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called \"the growing climate disaster\".<br/>Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as \"offsetting\".<br/>Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.<br/>One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.<br/>Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.<br/>To help reach net zero by 2050, the UK has made a series of ambitious pledges including:<br/>The government released an updated net zero strategy in March, but many climate experts criticised the announcement for lacking significant new policies or extra investment. <br/>The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards net zero by 2050. <br/>But despite the new strategy, the government's independent climate advisers now say they are \"markedly\" less confident than a year ago that the UK will meet the 2050 target. <br/>While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.<br/>This could include:<br/>Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.<br/>China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - aims for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions aren't fully developed, but its renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly.<br/>The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies. <br/>The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.<br/>India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.<br/>There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.<br/>For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself. <br/>But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. <br/>There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. <br/>But some climate scientists worry this could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their fossil fuel usage, by taking advantage of a switch to cleaner fuels in poorer countries which may have happened anyway.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

He questioned whether it was a \"genuine threat\" as well as the effectiveness of measures proposed by climate change activists in the face of growing emissions from China.  <br/>The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence has found that world temperatures are rising because of human activity, leading to rapid climate change and threatening every aspect of human life.<br/>But while Mr Pe\u00f1a's statements conflict with that scientific evidence, this clip appears to have been edited and re-uploaded by other users from different TikTok accounts dozens of times, racking up more than nine million views in the process. <br/>Under new community guidelines unveiled by TikTok last April, content that \"undermines well-established scientific consensus\" on climate change will not be allowed on the platform. <br/>And yet, the clip depicting Mr Pe\u00f1a is far from an isolated occurrence: the BBC identified 365 different videos in English denying the existence of man-made climate change.  <br/>TikTok itself deems climate change denial to be \"harmful misinformation\". Using tools available to any TikTok user, we reported those videos to the platform under that category. We then waited for at least a day to find out whether they would be taken down. <br/>The company did not remove almost 95% of the posts we flagged up - videos that, having been watched almost 30 million times, appeared to be attracting significant attention. <br/>In a statement to the BBC, TikTok said it is working \"to empower informed climate discussions\", and that it is working with fact-checkers to tackle misinformation. <br/>The company also pointed out that, when users search for videos about climate change, they are being shown a link to a United Nations website on the topic. <br/>But the video of Mr Pe\u00f1a demonstrates how \"bad arguments can spread really fast on TikTok\", says Roshan Salgado D'Arcy, a science communicator who uses social media to debunk viral videos that contain false claims about climate change. <br/>\"There are no real checks and balances to make sure that the information is accurate.\"<br/>The problem is not exclusive to English-speaking TikTok either: BBC Monitoring found dozens of other climate change-denying videos in Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian. <br/>\"As a member of the public on social media, it must be very easy to get the wrong idea about how certain we are about climate change,\" says Dr Doug McNeall, a scientist from the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.<br/>\"Misinformation can really damage our discussion about what to do about climate change.\" <br/>TikTok is aware of the problem - which is why, to mark Earth month in April, it announced it would begin actively removing content that contradicts basic climate science. <br/>In a blog post published at the time, it listed as examples of rule-breaking content posts \"denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it\". <br/>But the reach of videos like those featuring Mr Pe\u00f1a raises questions about how successfully this new policy is being enforced. <br/>\"Rules become irrelevant, if they're not applied consistently, accurately and fairly,\" says Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a UK counter-extremism think tank.<br/>Ms King said this emboldens people to try \"to game the system even more, because they know they can ultimately act with impunity\". <br/>Paul Scully MP, the minister for technology and the digital economy, told the BBC that the government's proposed Online Safety Bill would guarantee that the responsibility of social media platforms to tackle disinformation was \"taken seriously\".<br/>After we shared the findings of our investigation with TikTok, 65 accounts that had been posting wrong information about climate change in breach of the platform's guidelines were permanently removed.  <br/>The company also removed most of the remaining videos that were still online - including several that featured Dan Pe\u00f1a's 2017 talk.  <br/>However, at the time of writing, several copies of the clip featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a describing climate change as the \"greatest fraud\" can still be found on the app. <br/>At the Met Office, Dr McNeall welcomes TikTok's efforts against misinformation, but he questions whether this is a battle the company can win. <br/>\"As a scientist I'm happy to be challenged,\" he says. <br/>\"Maybe we should focus on promoting good climate science information, rather than just removing the content that we perhaps don't like.\"  <br/>The 'ninjas' fighting climate denial on Twitter<br/>A band of volunteers is keeping climate denial off Wikipedia<br/>Two dead after 'emergency' on Crimea bridge<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\"<br/>Warning of 'very high' wildfire risk for Scotland<br/>Caution urged over countryside fire risks<br/>Fire service warning over disposable barbecues<br/>Highland wildfire could be largest ever in UK<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Now astronomers may soon be able to watch it happen.<br/>These distortions are happening all the time, all across the Universe.<br/>One of the groups that made the discovery is the European Pulsar Timing Array Consortium (EPTA), led by Prof Michael Kramer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn. <br/>He told BBC News that the discovery had the potential to change astronomers' ideas about the cosmos forever.<br/>\"It could tell us if Einstein's theory of gravity is wrong; it may tell us about what dark matter and dark energy, the mysterious stuff that makes up the bulk of the Universe, really is; and it could give us a new window into new theories of physics.\"<br/>Further study might give new insights into the role supermassive black holes play in the evolution of all galaxies.<br/>Dr Rebecca Bowler, of Manchester University, told BBC News that researchers believe there to be gigantic black holes at the heart of all galaxies and that that they grow over billions of years. But so far that has all been theoretical.<br/>\"We know supermassive black holes are there, we just don't know how they got there. One possibility is that smaller black holes merge, but there has been little observational evidence for this. <br/>\"But with these new observations we could see such a merger for the first time. And that directly will tell us how the most massive black holes form,\" she said.<br/>The observations were made by studying signals from dead stars called pulsars. These rotate and send out bursts of radio signals at extremely precise intervals. <br/>But researchers, which include astronomers from the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire and from Birmingham University, have found that these signals are reaching Earth ever so slightly faster or slower than they should be. And they say the time distortion is consistent with gravitational waves created by the merger of supermassive black holes across the Universe.<br/>Dr Stanislav Babak from Laboratory APC at CNRS, France, said  gravitational waves carried information about ''some of the best-kept secrets of the Universe\".<br/>The newly found gravitational waves are different to the ones detected to date. Those earlier waves are caused by much smaller, star-sized black holes crashing into each other. <br/>The type described in the latest research are thought to be from black holes that are hundreds of millions of times more massive, spiralling in on each other as they get ever closer.<br/>Their gravitational upheaval is so powerful that it distorts time and space - a process that can continue for billions of years until the supermassive black holes finally merge.<br/>The gravitational waves scientists have discovered previously can be thought of as brief rumbles, whereas the new ones are akin to  a background hum that is around us all the time. <br/>Their next step is to take more readings and combine observations. As further progress is made, another goal is to be able to uncover individual pairs of supermassive black holes - assuming they are the source.<br/>It's possible the gravitational waves could also be caused by other exciting phenomena, such as the very first black holes ever created, or exotic structures called cosmic strings, both of which can be thought of as seeds from which the Universe grew.<br/>Gravity is a constant force in our everyday lives. If you let go of a cup it falls and smashes on the ground each time you do so. But in space gravity does not stay the same. It can change if there is a sudden and catastrophic event - such as the collision of black holes.<br/>The event is so cataclysmic that space and time itself is distorted and ripples are sent across the Universe - as happens when a pebble is dropped in a pond. <br/>In the case of gravitational waves, everything in the Universe - the stars, planets and even us - are the water. Everything gets squeezed and stretched and then squashed and flattened ever so slightly as the ripples pass over us. And just like in a pond, the ripples quickly get smaller and disappear. <br/>Gravitational waves from the merger of star-sized black holes were directly detected for the first time in 2015. Very sensitive laser systems measured the ripples produced in the end moments before the collision.<br/>For the type of waves coming from the spiralling supermassive black holes, the pulsar approach is picking up the ripples produced in the billions of years before the final union. <br/>This is akin to a continuous stream of pebbles being thrown into the pond. And because the mergers are happening all across space, the signal comes across as a cacophony.<br/>The EPTA has combined results with a consortium in India (InPTA) and published their study results in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. <br/>Three other separate, competing research groups, from North America (NANOGrav), Australia (PPTA) and China (CPTA), have published similar assessments, sparking huge excitement across the physics and astronomy community. <br/>Scientists must first confirm their observations. None of the research groups have data that passes the gold standard of less than one in a million chance of error, which is generally required for conclusive proof - although combined, the various teams' results are certainly compelling. <br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The dam acted as a flood defence to places downstream, mainly to the south and south-west.<br/>BBC Verify monitored the four canal entrances using satellite imagery, and by 15 June, all had become disconnected as the reservoir water level kept dropping.<br/>Further images reveal the reservoir, which previously held 18 cubic kilometres of water, had dried up significantly.<br/>Shallower parts of the reservoir were exposed first, revealing some of the original shape of the Dnipro River prior to the dam's construction in 1956.<br/>Images show the canals still contain water further away from the reservoir. It is unclear how long it will take for them to run dry.<br/>Before the war, about 5,840 sq km (2,255 sq miles) of cropland on both sides of the Dnipro river could potentially be serviced by the canals, with more than half the area reliant on irrigation systems. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>These areas yielded about two million tonnes of grain and oil seeds in 2021, according to the Ukrainian government.<br/>Many areas downstream of the reservoir were initially flooded after the dam was destroyed, but the long-term issue facing food production will be the loss of water supply due to extensive canal systems drying up, according to Inbal Becker-Reshef, program director at NASA Harvest, a consortium researching global food security.<br/>\"[The canals] primarily irrigate summer planted crops\u2026 like corn, soy beans, some sunflower. But they also irrigate some wheat, which is a winter crop, and then a lot of vegetables and fruit like melons,\" she said. <br/>While some crops can be fed by rain alone, a dry canal system can leave farmland vulnerable to drought. This also has consequences for drinking water.<br/>Dr Becker-Reshef said canals can start to fill in with silt if left dry, reducing their effectiveness, and the longer they are left in this condition, the worse they will become.<br/>Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator for the UN, previously told the BBC there would be a \"huge impact on global food security\" as a result of the destruction of the dam, describing the area as \"a breadbasket not only for Ukraine but also for the world\".<br/>Ukraine is a major exporter of sunflower, maize, wheat and barley. The war has caused global supply issues, particularly threatened in Middle Eastern and African countries, which rely heavily on Ukrainian grain.<br/>Rebuilding the dam seems to be one of the only long-term solutions to restore water security to the area.<br/>\"Now the water level has dropped, the water simply does not reach the [canal] systems. To raise it, we need to rebuild the dam,\" according to Mykola Solskyi, Ukraine's Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.<br/>Experts warn the area is at greater risk of both drought and flooding, because the dam helped regulate extreme highs and lows in water levels.<br/>\"There's now a whole downstream catchment of the river that is not controlled,\" said Jaap Flikweert, a flood and coastal management advisor at engineering consultancy Royal HaskoningDHV. \"In the wetter periods flood waves will just come through.\"<br/>Unless the dam is repaired, or extensive flood defences put in place, Mr Flikweert said some areas may prove unsuitable for settlement because they lie so close to river level.<br/>\"I expect those tens of thousands of people who were evacuated will have to stay away for a while as long as those solutions are not in place. It is difficult to see people coming back to those communities in this situation.\"<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Dam destruction devastates vast Ukraine farmland<br/>Drinking water crisis after dam breach - Zelensky<br/>What is the Ukraine grain deal?<br/>Harvest<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It's almost like there's a storyline written for you,\" she adds. <br/>Spraggan, who was 20 at the time, says the contestants were immediately put under huge pressure. <br/>\"From the very first stage that message was reiterated and reiterated and reiterated to the point where that's all you believe - [that] 'this is the biggest opportunity of my life,'\" she says.<br/>Now 31, she says she has never since experienced a situation where \"somebody completely takes the reins of my life\". <br/>\"If I had experienced that again, as a normal human being, I would have said that I would have been in an abusive relationship.\" <br/>Spraggan details her experiences on the show in her new memoir, Process: Finding My Way Through, including the sexual assault. <br/>It happened at a hotel where she and her fellow contestant - the broadcaster Rylan Clark - had been moved to, away from the others. <br/>They had initially been staying at the luxury Corinthia Hotel in central London, where Spraggan says they were guarded by 24-hour security. <br/>She says the show's producers told her the hotel had asked the pair to leave because they were \"causing too much trouble\". Headlines had branded them \"party animals\". <br/>\"So Rylan and I always sort of were under the impression that we were removed, because that supported the narrative,\" Spraggan says. <br/>The pair were not given additional security at the new hotel, she adds.<br/>If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, please visit BBC Action Line.<br/>The night they were moved, Spraggan attended Rylan's birthday party at a club in Mayfair. <br/>Spraggan says she can't remember what happened that night and has pieced together the incident through information from the police and others. <br/>She knows she was not conscious - because she had been drinking alcohol at the party - when she was escorted back to the hotel by a member of the production team. <br/>\"The hotel porter that had offered his help to get me up to bed\u2026 got a key card, let himself into my room and raped me,\" she explains. <br/>In 2013, Soby John pleaded guilty to the attack and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. <br/>Rylan was the first person Spraggan told about what happened. \"He was unbelievable,\" she says, describing him as \"an angel\". <br/>Spraggan says being examined by police for evidence was \"one of the worst experiences\" of her life. But she also knew that the show - which turned unknowns into singing stars - was the biggest opportunity of her life, and the fourth live show was due to be filmed the following day. <br/>\"It was like, this extraordinary thing's happened. The police are here, I've just had this examination. And people still asking me, 'What do you want to do? What do you want to do?' And I was like, 'I want to carry on with the show.' <br/>\"It kind of shows you what kind of world you are in, in what kind of mindset you are in, to not be able to really measure what has happened, and what you should do now.\" <br/>Lucy says the day after the attack she was put in another hotel room, with a security guard outside. <br/>\"I remember sort of having to peel myself away from jumping off the balcony. Like having to consciously do that.\" <br/>She decided to leave the show after week three of the competition. But she wasn't voted out by the public or the show's judges - she realised that mentally she couldn't continue. <br/>To explain why she had left, ITV announced that she was ill. Spraggan says she feels she had to go along with the narrative at the time, but says she is now relieved she can tell the truth.<br/>Spraggan felt like she didn't get enough support in the aftermath of the attack - and in the following years her mental health deteriorated considerably and she abused alcohol and drugs. She has now been sober for nearly four years. <br/>Fremantle said: \"Whilst we believed throughout that we were doing our best to support Lucy, as Lucy thinks we could have done more, we must therefore recognise this. For everything Lucy has suffered, we are extremely sorry.\" <br/>The star is now calling for all production and broadcast companies to better consider employees' and participants' mental health - by setting aside a portion of their budgets to invest in mental wellbeing services. <br/>\"I don't want to destroy anything. I want to build a better infrastructure,\" she says. <br/>\"We need these shows, because there's a thriving community of talented people who just don't have the funds and the opportunity to get there.\" <br/>X Factor's creator, Simon Cowell was not a judge in 2012 because he was in America launching X Factor US.  Spraggan says she was ready to give him \"a piece of my mind\" when he called her, after she had contacted his people to say she was writing her book. <br/>She says he said, \"Lucy, before you or I say anything else, the first thing I need to tell you is that I am sorry.\" <br/>Spraggan reflects: \"It makes me emotional because no-one else said sorry. And all it took was this one man to treat me like a human being, 11 years later.\" <br/>In 2021, Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, announced changes to its Broadcasting Code to better protect people made vulnerable by their participation in TV shows. The changes were introduced after suicides involving contestants from Love Island and The Jeremy Kyle Show in 2018 and 2019. <br/>Earlier this year, the BBC and ITV announced they were joining forces to recruit more registered psychologists to support TV programmes in their duty of care to contributors. <br/>\"My voice is extremely inconvenient for a lot of people. I've been petrified of telling the truth, because I'll lose what I have,\" Spraggan says. <br/>\"If I have to be the first person who says 'I'm actually not scared to stand up against you [the industry]', I will. And hopefully it inspires other people to be a little bit braver too.\" <br/>In a statement,  ITV said it had \"the deepest compassion for Lucy\".  It said the production companies, Fremantle and Syco, were primarily responsible for the duty of care towards all of its programme contributors. <br/>But it added it \"is committed to having in place\u2026 robust oversight procedures, to [ensure] that independent producers employ the correct processes to protect the mental health and welfare of participants\".<br/>X Factor star reveals sexual assault during filming<br/>Katie Waissel says she was 'ridiculed' on X Factor<br/>X Factor star welcomes new help for TV contestants<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

One of the most exclusive bags, some styles cost many tens of thousands of dollars and have waiting lists of months, if not years.<br/>The style became a fashion hit and has spawned several imitations - but in 2006, Birkin told the Guardian: \"I love it, but I lug so much stuff around in it that I believe it is part of the reason I have tendonitis.\"<br/>Birkin campaigned for numerous causes throughout her life - including asking Herm\u00e8s to drop her name from its product in 2015 over animal welfare concerns.<br/>Prior to moving to France and meeting Gainsbourg, Birkin was married to the British composer John Barry until the late 1960s. <br/>Their daughter, Kate Barry, was a fashion photographer who worked for Vogue and died in 2013 at the age of 46.<br/>Birkin has a third daughter - the musician, model and actress Lou Doillon - from her 1980s relationship with French film director Jacques Doillon.<br/>Birkin's acting credits included films such as the 1966 classic Blow Up, Death on the Nile (1978) and Evil Under the Sun (1982).<br/>She released a self-penned album in 2002 called Arabesque and a collection of live recordings in 2009 under the title Jane at the Palace.<br/>Menna Rawlings, the British ambassador to France, paid tribute to her on Twitter, describing her as \"the most French of British artists\".<br/>She was treated for leukaemia in the late 1990s and it was reported in September 2021 that she had suffered a stroke, forcing her to cancel a planned appearance at an American film festival.<br/>Jane Birkin: Artist and style icon's life in pictures<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

He soon became intrigued by \"these little rats sprayed everywhere.... and more and more of Banksy's street pieces just started to reveal themselves\".<br/>But as with many Banksy fans, it wasn't just the artwork itself - and its social commentary - that fascinated Peak. He was also drawn in by the artist's mystique, and the huge effort involved in producing graffiti undercover at speed to avoid both being identified and arrested by the police.<br/>\"There's a great line in his latest show which I think is something like: 'Monet had light, Hockney had colour and I've got police response time,'\" Peak says.<br/>Over the years, various news outlets have reported that they know who Banksy is, and in 2017, DJ Goldie referred to Banksy as a man called Rob in an interview.<br/>While rumours abound, his real identity has never been revealed. But have we gone beyond needing to know who he actually is?<br/>Peak says Banksy's anonymity \"lets him keep doing the campaigning stuff he does unfettered\" which, along with loyalty, probably stops the few in the know from letting the cat out of the bag.<br/>\"Being free to act in the way that he does, that's super valuable.\"<br/>In fact, very few people who know Banksy have spoken publicly about him at all.<br/>For the podcast, Peak spent a year getting to know gallerist Steph Warren, who worked with Banksy at his print house Pictures on Walls in Shoreditch in the early Noughties when she was in her early 20s.<br/>Once Peak had gained her trust, Warren opened up to him about her experiences, having declined to sign a non-disclosure agreement when she worked at the print house. She has never talked publicly before.<br/>So what was it like working with Banksy and his crew during those heady early days in a working-class area which would soon go on to become hipsterville?<br/>\"It was exciting,\" Warren tells me.<br/>\"The office was very DIY, you know, very punk. When I started there I was the packing girl and I was licking the stamps to go on the tubes to send the prints out, then carting them down to Old Street post office. It was very exciting because it felt like I could be involved with helping it grow.\"<br/>She then went on to organise the pop-up exhibition and store, Santa's Ghetto, which then became an annual event.<br/>Banksy was furtive to a degree even within the company and, in the podcast, Warren gives the impression that he's something of an observer, an outsider looking in.<br/>\"He was quite reserved,\" she says. \"You could tell that he had a lot going on in his head. <br/>\"And I hate to use the word genius because I wouldn't want to call him a genius! But he's a very clever man. [He had] a lot of philosophies and concepts that I just didn't understand at the time, but through his work, I have been able to learn.\"<br/>Warren says she was asked by Banksy in the office one day to pose for what would become his now famous mural Sweeping It Under the Carpet, which depicted a maid at work. She definitely has a look of Warren. There have also been claims attributed to Banksy that he based it on a hotel maid in Los Angeles.<br/>The stencil, which was said to be a comment on the Western world ignoring global issues, appeared on a wall in north London in 2006.<br/>But behind the scenes, things were beginning to fall apart for Warren as she became addicted to heroin, something she says was part of the art scene for some at the time and that she was introduced to while working there.<br/>\"There are lots of jobs where, to a certain extent, a certain level of alcoholism or substance misuse is accepted,\" Warren says.<br/>In the podcast, she claims Banksy was \"horrified\" when he found out and took her for a walk to talk about it but she denied she was taking the drug when he asked.<br/>Warren says heroin also enabled her to block out the grief she was going through after the death of her BMX biker boyfriend in an accident back in her home town of Hastings, not long before she moved to London.<br/>In the podcast, she explains that she then fell out with Banksy after not being available for the last Banksy concept store, Santa's Ghetto, in London in 2006.<br/>It got out of hand on its first day with hundreds of people fighting to get in, in the hope of buying one of the artist's limited prints. Warren had arranged the morning off, but said Banksy was uncharacteristically \"fuming\" with her because she wasn't there to manage the queue. <br/>In hindsight, she says: \"I should have been there, I wasn't exactly a model employee, I was on heroin.\" <br/>Soon after, Warren and Pictures on Walls parted company. <br/>While she does takes responsibility for her choices, she feels that Pictures on Walls could have offered to put her through a drug rehabilitation programme.<br/>But the drama still wasn't over. <br/>Warren was accused in the press the following year of fraudulently producing Banksy prints and selling them on, something she has always vehemently denied. When she wanted to defend herself publicly, she claims Banksy's PR, Jo Brooks, cautioned her against the move and that they tried to get her to sign  an NDA. Warren says she refused.<br/>Members of the local art fraternity defended her and Pictures on Walls then did their own swift investigation.<br/>They found that there was no evidence of any fraud and Warren was exonerated but as Peak says: \"By that point, of course, the damage had definitely been done.\"<br/>After leaving Pictures on Walls, Warren set up her own gallery, Stella Dore, in the Truman Brewery on Brick Lane. It folded a couple of years later, which Warren says was largely due to the global financial crisis and her addiction. However, she says being a woman in a male-dominated industry, alongside the false accusations, didn't help.<br/>\"As a woman, you're always disadvantaged anyway. And like in any industry, if there's rumours around your name, then it's an extra reason for people not to use your services.\"<br/>Jo Brooks PR and Pictures on Walls were both contacted twice for a response by Peak but neither got back to him. (Pictures on Walls' shop closed in 2018 but it is still listed at Companies House and is the controlling entity of Pest Control Office, Banksy's current company which authenticates his works).<br/>Warren later returned to the south coast, entered rehab and successfully re-launched Stella Dore in 2018 in St Leonards, again working with street artists.<br/>\"It's a fantastic community here,\" she says.<br/>\"They really have embraced me and looked after me. I've been able to build myself back up here.\"<br/>Given her time working with Banksy ended on a somewhat sour note, how does she feel about him now, looking back?<br/>\"I think what he's achieved is phenomenal and I'm just cross with myself because I wish I'd had a better head on my shoulders back then, you know, to really work for him properly. I think that he's a real force for good overall. Even if my personal experience isn't quite that.\"<br/>The Banksy Story will be available on BBC Sounds as a boxset from Monday 17 July. The 10 episodes will also be broadcast individually on week days at 13:45 on BBC Radio 4 from the same date.<br/>Banksy to stage first solo exhibition in 14 years<br/>Ukraine's Banksy stamps depict Putin being thrown<br/>Signed Banksy Colston Four T-shirt raises \u00a312k<br/>Two dead after new 'attack' on Crimea bridge<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

BBC News examined more than 40 online stories, as well as print editions of the Sun and other papers, to look at how the media - including the BBC itself - handled the most complex aspects of the story.<br/>It all began with a story in the Sun last Friday, a story that featured a very important phrase. <br/>The paper said that a high-profile BBC presenter had given a young person \"more than \u00a335,000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images\".<br/>Wording to this effect was used at least seven times online over the next three days, out of dozens of articles published on the subject by the Sun.<br/>That line rang alarm bells among readers and the media, partly because it hinted at criminality.<br/>It suggested the man - who we now know is Edwards - may have committed a criminal offence, if such images were sent before the teenager was 18.<br/>Other outlets including the Sunday Times and BBC News made that connection explicitly, and it was one factor that fuelled the story. <br/>It is worth saying Edwards has not yet addressed this, or any of the further claims that emerged during the past week. In her statement on Wednesday, his wife Vicky Flind said he would respond to the allegations when he is well enough. He will stay in hospital for the \"foreseeable future\" after recent events triggered a \"serious\" mental health episode, she said.<br/>On Sunday evening, in an editorial, the Sun began to refer to \"contact\" between the pair having started when the young person was 17, but did not specify what the nature of that contact was. <br/>The last time the Sun used the key phrase with the direct allegation (that the young person had been paid for \"sordid images\" since they were 17) online was on Monday evening. <br/>This was when it reported on a letter from the young person's lawyer to the BBC denying the substance of the Sun's story, and their parents' response, which formed the basis of a story in the following day's paper. This print story also repeated the phrase.<br/>The publication of this letter, which was adamant that \"nothing unlawful\" had taken place, might have changed the equation. <br/>For example, after this an online Sun editorial on Tuesday evening made no mention of the age the payments started or what the money was for. On Wednesday the paper stated the young person was 17 when they first received money, but did not say it was for explicit images.<br/>The Sun has said the story was \"always squarely in the public interest\".<br/>Its statement on Wednesday, after Edwards was named by his wife, said its original story did not allege criminality and further added that connection was only made by other outlets.  <br/>\"From the outset, we have reported a story about two very concerned and frustrated parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and payments from him that fuelled the drug habit of a young person.\" it said. <br/>That initial story did not explicitly mention criminality but, if the details within it were correct, then it suggested the presenter had broken the law.<br/>The paper also followed up comments in the Sunday Times from former chief crown prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who said that the presenter could potentially be charged with sexual exploitation under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.<br/>Its resulting story was headlined: \"Top BBC star who 'paid child for sex pictures' could be charged by cops and face years in prison, expert says.\"<br/>The Sun was approached for this story but did not wish to comment further, referring BBC News to its statement issued on Wednesday.<br/>While its first story reported claims from the young person's mother, it is not clear whether the Sun had seen evidence proving the allegations before publishing.<br/>Did Sun journalists see and verify bank statements allegedly containing payments from the star, or the so-called \"sleazy\" messages?<br/>Or were they relying on the family member's word? The paper said family members had signed a sworn affidavit when sharing their story.<br/>It is not clear what the Sun meant by this, as an affidavit is a document overseen by a solicitor for use in legal action.<br/>On Monday, in response to the young person's denial, the Sun said in a statement that it had seen evidence supporting their family's concerns.<br/>A dossier of evidence has reportedly been passed by the family to the BBC, but BBC News has not seen its content, nor any of the Sun's evidence.<br/>Backed up by a legal affidavit or not, this account was to be firmly challenged by the young person at the heart of the allegations.<br/>The letter from the young person's lawyer,  sent to the BBC on Monday evening, called the allegations \"rubbish\" and said \"nothing inappropriate or unlawful\" had taken place. <br/>Furthermore, it said the young person had sent a denial to the paper on Friday evening via WhatsApp, saying their mother's account was \"totally wrong and there was no truth to it\", but the \"inappropriate\" article was still published.<br/>But if the paper received a denial, many asked why it was not published, as is routine journalistic practice?<br/>With the young person's lawyers dismissing the claims, and no response yet from the unnamed presenter, eyes were on the BBC and police to investigate.<br/>On Monday, the BBC met the Metropolitan Police, who advised it to pause its investigation while police made enquiries. <br/>Meanwhile, the Sun had published an interview with the parents who said the BBC were liars and that they had told the BBC about the presenter's contact with the young person. <br/>The BBC has published a timeline of events and director general Tim Davie has said it is handling the situation \"responsibly and judicially\".<br/>The parents also told the Sun they had referred the matter to a police force, who told them there was no criminal case to answer. <br/>We now know two forces have concluded there was no evidence of criminality. <br/>South Wales Police - who the young person's parents first approached in April - said the allegation related to \"the welfare of an adult\", as opposed to a child. <br/>On Wednesday evening the Metropolitan Police said there was no information to indicate a criminal offence and they would take no further action.<br/>Media critics were quick to point out that this cast the story - and the balance between public interest in publishing the allegations and the presenter's right to privacy - in a very different light. <br/>Jacqui Hames, a board member of press campaign group Hacked Off, said a \"suggestion of criminality... screamed out\" at readers day after day.<br/>In the Sun's statement later that evening, reiterating that it did not initially allege criminality, it said its claims \"were always very serious\".<br/>Former Sky News anchor Adam Boulton called the question of illegality \"a side issue\".<br/>\"The issue is behaviour that many people would - potentially if it's true - disapprove of,\" he told Newsnight.<br/>Meanwhile, in the wake of the Sun's story, journalists began investigating the presenter and further allegations about his behaviour began to emerge. <br/>BBC News told the story of one young person who claimed they were placed under repeated pressure to meet the presenter after first being contacted anonymously by him on a dating app. They said they received abusive and menacing messages from Mr Edwards that left them frightened after they hinted online they might reveal his name.<br/>Separately, the Sun said the presenter broke Covid lockdown rules to meet a 23-year-old who he had contacted on a dating site.<br/>The paper also published messages it claimed were from the star to a 17-year-old on Instagram, including love heart emojis. <br/>Shortly after Edwards was named by his wife, BBC News reported that three current and former employees claimed Edwards had sent messages that made them uncomfortable.<br/>These alleged interactions raise questions about whether there was an abuse of power, and whether it would be acceptable behaviour for one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters and someone the nation is asked to trust during coverage of both the daily news and major national events.<br/>The Sun said the young person's parents only approached the paper after taking their concerns to the BBC. <br/>In mid-May, they spoke to the BBC customer services team, who passed them to the corporate investigations unit, which investigates alleged criminal and illicit activity involving BBC staff. <br/>We don't know exactly what these allegations were - the BBC has said they were \"very serious\" but not illegal, and different to those reported by the Sun. <br/>The investigations unit sent the parents one email and tried to phone them once in the subsequent seven weeks. <br/>Was that a sufficient response to a \"very serious\" complaint about one of the BBC's biggest names?<br/>\"That's a fair question,\" Mr Davie, director general, said when asked on BBC Radio 4.<br/>He also promised to \"immediately\" review how quickly \"red flags\" are raised internally after such complaints.<br/>The BBC has also said no executive directors were made aware until the Sun approached the corporation late last week.<br/>Some have questioned why the BBC did not discuss the allegations with Edwards earlier and give him a chance to respond - he was only made aware of the claims last Thursday. But Mr Davie has said: \"You don't take that complaint directly to the presenter unless it has been verified.\"<br/>The decision to air fresh claims of inappropriate messages from BBC colleagues - on the day of Edwards' wife's statement - has also been criticised. The Sun said it would not publish any further allegations. <br/>Sir Craig Oliver, former editor of the BBC News at Ten - the programme Edwards has fronted for so long - said the corporation's journalists had mostly done a good job, but \"in the desire to make sure that they look like they're covering this in a fair and impartial way, they perhaps have gone too far\".<br/>Edwards' wife made clear the impact of the days of fevered reporting and speculation on her family - and that will be a weighty factor as the debate develops about the balance between publishing in the public interest versus the right to privacy.<br/>Her statement \"acted like a dash of cold water to the face of all journalists\", Sir Craig told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. <br/>\"I think both the BBC and the Sun are now looking at themselves and asking themselves questions about: is it possible in a frenzied environment where there are so many different elements coming together and it's making people's heads spin... can you, in that environment, have a duty of care to the person involved? And can you allow due process to take place?\"<br/>Former ITN editor-in-chief Stewart Purvis said it raised questions around when it is legitimate to report on the private life of a high-profile individual. <br/>But Mark Damazer, a former controller of BBC Radio 4 and Radio 7, said on Thursday that BBC News journalists had used \"reasonable judgement\" to cover the story as they would any other. <br/>BBC News was willing to \"try and give the BBC an extremely good kicking, especially the boss class\", he said - because it did not want to be accused of being \"soft\" on the wider BBC.<br/>BBC resumes Edwards inquiry as no criminality found<br/>Timeline: How Huw Edwards allegations unfolded<br/>Who is Huw Edwards?<br/>'This is such dramatic news' - Katie Razzall<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Yanks go home! And take your miserable grungewear and your self-obsessed slacker bands with you.<br/>\"We don't want plaid. We want crimplene, glamour, wit, and irony. It's time to bring on the Home Guard. These, Kurt, are the boys who will stop your little game: Suede, Saint Etienne, Pulp, Denim and the Auteurs. Bands with pride!\"<br/>It was a rallying call, for sure, but the movement didn't burst into life straight away - perhaps because, in addition to Britpop, Maconie insisted on calling these bands \"The Crimplenests\".<br/>Suede were first out of the traps, releasing their searing debut album in 1993, all glam guitars and sexual androgyny. <br/>But the scene really came together a year later. In the space of two weeks, Blur released Parklife, Oasis put out their debut single, Supersonic, and Pulp issued their breakthrough album His 'N' Hers.<br/>For the next few years, indie bands ruled the charts like they never had before. By 1996, all five of the best album nominees at the Brit Awards had a connection to the scene. <br/>Oasis won with their blockbuster second album, What's The Story (Morning Glory), but the competition was just as worthy - Pulp's Different Class, Blur's The Great Escape, Paul Weller's Stanley Road and Radiohead's The Bends (Radiohead always sat slightly apart from Britpop, partly because they spent so much time touring in the US, their eyes on a much bigger prize than the British charts).<br/>That same year, the Blur v Oasis chart battle made the BBC News, in an era where rock music only got on to the bulletins if someone had died; and two million people applied for tickets to see Oasis play at Knebworth. <br/>Britpop dominated the musical landscape so definitively that bands felt bulletproof.<br/>\"I suppose I felt like I could walk out into traffic and cars would bounce off me,\" recalled Blur's Graham Coxon. \"I probably tried it.\"<br/>Then, almost as soon as it arrived, Britpop fizzled out.<br/>In a new BBC Sounds series, The Rise And Fall of Britpop, Jarvis Cocker explains where it all went wrong.<br/>\"[Britpop] had this euphoria of thinking, 'Yeah, we're the snotty kids and we're finally getting to go centre stage,\" he says. <br/>\"Then everybody was drinking too much and getting a hangover - and then, of course, people don't want to buy records by hungover people. <br/>\"Then the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams appeared and they did some of the same things, but without the grumpiness. <br/>\"The record-buying public - and I don't blame them at all - just thought, all right, let's get rid of these misery guts. And so that was the end of it.\"<br/>His analysis bears weight. As Britpop matured, a sense of ennui and depression kicked in. <br/>Pulp's own This Is Hardcore was written about mid-life oblivion and the inevitability of death. Blur's self-titled 1997 album favoured lo-fi American guitar sounds over the colour-by-numbers vibrancy of Tracy Jacks and Country House. Oasis's Be Here Now was, in Noel Gallagher's own words, \"the sound of a bunch of guys, on coke, in the studio, not giving an [expletive].\"<br/>\"Broken bands make broken records,\" says Steve Lamacq, who co-hosts the Britpop series with Jo Whiley, recreating their influential partnership on Radio 1's Evening Session in the 1990s.<br/>The broadcaster recalls the experience of Elastica, whose debut album was released on Deceptive - a label he set up in 1993, <br/>\"They were like the Backstreet Kids of pop really, they were cheeky and sarcastic and cool and very credible. And their debut album was one of the best records of that era. <br/>\"But from day one, they were always in demand. Everybody wanted a piece of them. They become one of the very few British bands to find some sort of success in the States. Then you fast forward two years and they are absolutely knackered, mentally and physically.<br/>\"There was no let-up and at that point, they were probably running on adrenaline. And when the adrenaline ran out, they were fuelled by anything that might keep them going. And I think in short, it just, it stops being fun, really. But even when it stops being fun, the demands on you, they don't stop.\"<br/>He details how sessions for the band's second album were \"painfully slow\" with members failing to turn up for recording sessions, often for weeks at a time.<br/>When the record arrived, it was called The Menace - and the material was infinitely darker and more haunting than the bubblegum brightness of their debut.<br/>\"I really felt for them,\" says Lamacq, \"because despite all the people who were trying to direct them, they got absolutely lost.<br/>\"And they weren't the only ones because that level of success, and its subsequent pressures led to this rash of, if not cynical records, then albums that bare the soul of people who'd been in the music industry washing machine, and felt like they were being hung out to dry.\"<br/>Damon Albarn found himself in a similar position.<br/>\"I had a sort of a strange episode when I was walking under the the A12,\" he says on the podcast. \"Suddenly it looks like everything you've ever dreamed of is going to come true and I had a real... call it a panic attack or something like that. <br/>\"That reverberated for many years really. It was quite difficult thing to live with, especially as everything ramped up. I found it difficult, if I'm honest.\"<br/>For many of its biggest stars. then, the Britpop party was over. But Whiley says the movement had an important legacy.<br/>\"There genuinely weren't many female bands [around] but I think the women who were there made a lasting impact on other girls who were listening to the radio and realising that they could actually get themselves a guitar, they could begin to make music... and I think that's really, really important.\"<br/>Whiley says it would be impossible to replicate Britpop today, as the music industry is too fractured to coalesce around any one particular sound.<br/>\"The whole model has completely changed and record labels lost a lot of control, so maybe it was the last hurrah.\"<br/>But speaking on the podcast, Noel Gallagher says Britpop \"was kind of absorbed back into the system\" and recycled by the major record labels.<br/>\"After what became known as Britpop, you end up with bands like Busted with the Les Paul [guitars] and all that. <br/>\"They're kind of rocking, they kind of play their own instruments, but it's just pure trash pop music.\"<br/>The first four episodes of The Rise And Fall Of Britpop are available now on BBC Sounds.

It grossed $2.8m (\u00a32.17m) in its opening weekend alone - the highest debut for an animated film in the country. <br/>That might not come as a surprise, given the popularity in India of Spider-Man - one of the few characters from the West's comic book universe to make an impact in a country where pop culture is largely dominated by the Hindi film industry. <br/>The superhero's films have been among the top-grossing Hollywood films in India since 2007, spawning numerous local knock-offs. This includes a love song, whose funny lyrics - \"Spider-Man, tune churaya mere dil ka chain\" (Spider-Man, Spider-Man, you stole my heart) - have earned a cult status in the country.<br/>But the latest film is a lot more special because it features an Indian version of the superhero for the first time ever. <br/>Meet Pavitr Prabhakar, a messy teen who guards the streets of Mumbattan - a mashup of Manhattan and Mumbai. His name is a play on Peter Parker, the teen behind the original Spider-Man mask. <br/>Pavitr is among the five different spider stars - all from alternate realties but connected through their shared powers - who team up with teen hero Miles Morales to stop a wily supervillain. <br/>Pavitr's depiction has been praised by fans across the world, especially Indians who've been won over by his exuberant personality.  <br/>Some have fallen in love with the tropical, curvy art-style for the Mumbattan sequence of the film - an homage to the Indrajal Comics from 1970s, an Indian imprint known for publishing stories about the Phantom and Mandrake the Magician in regional languages.<br/>Others have praised the way the film bands together characters of different backgrounds to create a first-of-its-kind multi-ethnic team of superheroes. <br/>\"First Marvel gave us first black Spider-Man, Miles Morales and now we have Pavitr. The story is trying to touch on an exciting idea: that anyone can be Spider-Man,\" says Mrityunjoy Pal, an ardent comic fan. <br/>While Pavitr is new to many viewers in India and abroad, his origin story goes back decades, a time when the superhero scene in the country was confined to a niche community of comic book enthusiasts. <br/>The character made his first appearance in Spider-Man: India #1 in 2004 - a comic book which sold over a million copies in a run that lasted four issues. <br/>The comic book sticks to Spider-Man's universal premise of a friendly neighbourhood superhero. <br/>Like any teenage boy with competing priorities, Pavitr struggles to balance homework with his hero work. At school, he is mercilessly bullied - but at night, he transforms into a crime-fighting superhero who swings past skyscrapers with superhuman speed. He dons the mask to protect the one he loves, and for that he must keep his identity a secret. <br/>But Pavitr's story also comes with a special Indian twist. He is a chai-sipping, dhoti-wearing superhero who gets his powers from a yogi - a mystic guru - and not from a radioactive spider bite. <br/>Instead of being smitten with Mary Jane, the girl-next-door, Pavitr has a crush on his classmate Meera Jain. And unlike Peter Parker, who is bullied in school for being a \"bookworm\", Pavitr is a scholarship student from a small village who is ridiculed for his appearance. <br/>He is an \"Indian Spider-Man\" made by Indian creators. That is what Sharad Devarajan and his co-creators Jeevan Kang and Suresh Seetharaman said when they first conceptualised Pavitr in 2003.<br/>\"We chose to play on the larger social allegory of having Pavitr be a village boy who feels out of touch with the Mumbai elite because it was reflective of what we saw in 2004 when big cities seemed to be moving at light speed while many of the people in rural India felt completely separated,\" Mr Devarajan told the BBC. <br/>The Spider-Verse introduced audiences to a cast of diverse Spider-people from different race and gender backgrounds: Morales, who is of African and Puerto Rican heritage; Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Man who is of Mexican descent; Jessica Drew, Marvel's first pregnant superhero; and Hobie Brown's Spider-Punk who is of African descent.<br/>But back in 2004, reimagining an icon such as Spider-Man was a lot more challenging, especially for an Indian audience who, Mr Devarajan explains, had seen images of the character but did not know his story and had not read any comics about him. <br/>India has always had a vast appetite for comic books - which are a common sight at grocery stores, newspaper sellers and railway platforms. They have been made popular by visual retellings of mythological stories in Amar Chitra Katha, and weekly children's magazines like Twinkle and Champak.<br/>\"There has been a tremendous interest in history and mythology, and most of our comic books and books fall in those two genres,\" says Jatin Varma, founder of Comic-Con India.<br/>But the country's appetite for superheroes is more recent. Some of this could be because the space has traditionally been dominated by heroes of Indian cinema. These films offer a spectacle with bombastic storylines that see male leads dodging bullets, jumping off rooftops and fighting dozens of goons to save the day. <br/>\"Our aim was to simply turn an international hero into a local icon,\" Mr Devarajan said. \"A relatable guy who swings from the Gateway of India over city streets in Mumbai and celebrates Diwali with his aunt.\"<br/>Twenty years on, Pavitr is doing exactly that - and more. <br/>In the film, he ditches the white dhoti for a more stylish blue one - which he pairs with a funky suit decorated with intricate Indian motifs, and a cool hard-part haircut. <br/>Even his character - which in Mr Devarajan's words \"represented the more traditional and simple family value system of Indians\" - undergoes certain modifications. <br/>Unlike Miles, who is worn down by the anxiety of his powers, Pavitr is unshakably optimistic as he swings through the chaotic vistas of Mumbattan with cool remove. <br/>His self-assured and confident side drives the plot on several occasions. During a tour of Mumbattan, he says: \"This is where the British stole all our stuff.\" <br/>He even makes fun of Miles for requesting \"chai tea\" (which is like saying he'd like a cup of \"tea tea\"), and quips: \"Would I ask you for a coffee-coffee, with room for cream-cream?\" <br/>In an interview with Variety magazine, Kemp Power, one of the film's three directors, said the team \"literally re-broke Pavitr's sequence and reimagined his character\" mid-production, after some animators of Indian descent working on the film felt that Pavitr needed to be more authentic. <br/>\"It really spoke to the spirit of collaboration on this movie,\" he said. <br/>Mr Varma says even though the film caters primarily to an audience outside of India, the cultural elements do not feel lazy or stereotypical. \"And the fact that this Indian Spider-Man was part of arguably one of the best Spidey movies, made it even better.\"<br/>Mr Devarajan says the film \"changed the costume, but the heart, character and unique Indianess of Pavitr remain the same.\"<br/>He hopes this is just the beginning for Pavitr's growth as a character in the Marvel world.<br/>\"It only took 20 years for Pavitr to jump from that comic we created and onto the big screen,\" he says. <br/>\"Hopefully it won't take another 20 before we see the live action version.

It was so important to him that it wasn't changed from how he finished it.<br/>\"But we could not resist authorising this project: the time is right; the people doing it are fantastic; and Strangelove should be brought to a new and younger audience. I am sure Stanley would have approved it too.\"<br/>Daughter Katharina Kubrick added: \"The subject matter of this film is particularly relevant again in our prevailing political climate.<br/>\"People often laugh when they would rather cry, and this is exactly how the film, and now the play, handles the possibility of the ultimate destruction of life on Earth; certainly, an important topic amongst many, to concentrate the mind.\"<br/>The late director's family also granted access to Kubrick's archive, in which Iannucci said he had found papers relating to the film including \"some discarded scenes, first drafts [and] moments that they were going to shoot and then decided not to\".<br/>He added: \"There are little shards of ideas there, and one or two of them have developed into full-scale new moments and new scenes in the final [play].\"<br/>Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb - to use its full title - was released two years after the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.<br/>Foley said it's not hard to see \"the relevance to the idea of a type of Cold War between the West and Russia\" today.<br/>\"That's sadly come very much back into our lives,\" he said. \"You don't have to look very far to understand a kind of relevance about the potential for nuclear conflict, given what's going on with the invasion of Ukraine and everything that Putin is saying.\"<br/>Iannucci added: \"Not just with the war in Ukraine, but also the whole apocalyptic sense of global warming and so on - it feels like a very relevant reassertion of the message that, this is the madness staring at us if we don't do anything about it.<br/>\"And currently, we aren't doing anything about it. So the outcome is not good.<br/>\"But if you can leave the theatre with that message and a smile, then all the better.\"<br/>The pair have decided to keep the story set in the 60s, and Iannucci said it would feel both \"retro\" in its setting, and up-to-date with some of his trademark dialogue.<br/>\"It's got one foot in the 60s and one foot in the present day,\" he said.<br/>Foley added: \"There's something about how the men of that era behave in the film, and there was a specificity around the Cuban missile crisis and all of those things.<br/>\"And the look of it is great, so we quickly decided we're going to keep it in that period and let the obvious resonances just echo.\"<br/>The film famously starred Peter Sellers in three main roles - the titular German scientist, a British officer who discovers a US general has unilaterally ordered a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and the American president who must attempt to avert all-out annihilation.<br/>The stage version is now seeking a star to play multiple roles - albeit without the luxury of the time Sellers had to change costumes and make-up.<br/>\"They've got to be a great comic actor, of which we have very many,\" said Foley, who is artistic director of the Birmingham Rep. \"They've got to be of that shape-shifting kind of quality. They've got to want it.<br/>\"It's going to be a really tough gig. I'm sure some people, when we approach them, are going to go, 'No way, I'm not going to be compared with Peter Sellers in those roles.'<br/>\"But there will be someone who has the appetite and skill and talent and sees the opportunity to do it in their own way.\"<br/>In Dr Strangelove, many of those holding great power over millions of lives are depicted as often actually being inept, ridiculous, reckless or unhinged. That's a strand of political satire that Iannucci picked up in his work like The Thick of It, US version Veep, and 2017 black comedy The Death of Stalin.<br/>\"It's these individuals who are very human and very fallible, and yet on whose word and actions ride the fate of, in Stalin's case millions, and in Dr Strangelove's case humanity,\" he said.<br/>The writer and director is now also working on another theatre project about Boris Johnson and his role in the pandemic and Partygate, although full details have not yet been announced.<br/>\"Rather than trying to do a TV exploration of what's happening now, doing something live on stage feels like just the right moment to do it,\" Iannucci said of that play.<br/>\"Also, in the last three years, we've been so enclosed in our homes because of the lockdown, and have got addicted to our screens, so actually going out and seeing something live and in the flesh is all the more exciting.

This is one of those times.\"<br/>Speaking ahead of the London premiere, where several of Oppenheimer's stars left the red carpet early to strike, he explained: \"It's very important to bear in mind that there are people who have been out of work for months now, as part of the writers strike, and with the actors potentially joining - a lot of people are going to suffer.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: How the Hollywood strike affects you in 75 seconds<br/>Despite the row in California, British-born Nolan has no current plans to work more in the UK, his home country, as he prefers to be \"on the real locations\" where his films are set.<br/>\"The UK has wonderful film studios,\" he explained. \"It's a great place to come to shoot a film if you're going to be on sound stages.\"<br/>Oppenheimer tells the story of J Robert Oppenheimer, the enigmatic Manhattan Project scientist, who had a leading role in developing the atomic bomb that made him a \"destroyer of worlds\".<br/>He \"gave us the power to destroy ourselves and that had never happened before\", Nolan said.<br/>Commissioned by the US Government during World War II, and believing themselves in a nuclear race with the Nazis over who would create the bomb first, in 1945 scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico detonated a test bomb, codenamed Trinity.  <br/>Their invention was then used, controversially, to end the war, dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to devastating effect.<br/>The film is an exploration not just of Oppenheimer's story, but of the \"incredible decision\" the scientists took on that first occasion.  <br/>\"There's a possibility that when you push that button, you might destroy the entire world,\" Nolan told the BBC.<br/>\"And yet they went ahead and they pushed it. How could you make that decision? How could you take that on yourself?\"<br/>Another existential threat to civilization is AI, which is also part of the Hollywood strike and makes the Oppenheimer movie more timely.<br/>\"One of the interesting things about putting this film out is it's coming at a time when there are a lot of new technologies that people start to worry about the unintended consequences,\" he said.<br/>\"When you talk to leaders in the field of AI, as I do from time to time, they see this moment right now as their Oppenheimer moment. They're looking to his story to say, 'what are our responsibilities? How can we deal with the potential unintended consequences?' Sadly, for them, there are no easy answers.\"<br/>Nolan is one of a rare number of Hollywood directors.  His films - Interstellar, the Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception amongst them - are both blockbusters and arthouse fare; critically acclaimed and, Tenet aside, which was released during the pandemic, box office successes.<br/>\"I make the films that I really want to go to the cinema and sit down with my popcorn and watch\" he says.  \"I started making films when I was a kid.  I made Super 8 films from when I was seven or eight years old and I've never stopped\".<br/>He's a champion of the big screen who, famously, left Warner Bros for rival Universal to make Oppenheimer.<br/>Nolan's known for wanting his films to feel authentic rather than computer-generated.  <br/>There was even a rumour doing the rounds on the internet that he had set off a real atomic bomb in New Mexico for Oppenheimer.  <br/>\"We recreated the circumstances of it,\" he said, \"obviously not using an atomic weapon.  What we're trying to portray is this moment of absolute beauty and absolute terror.<br/>\"This is the moment that really changed the world.\"<br/>Actors' strike to hit production of major films<br/>The Black Mirror plot about AI that worries actors<br/>Stars walk Oppenheimer red carpet - then leave<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Director Nolan criticises Warner's streaming plans<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

She was 54.<br/>Her last public appearance was two days before her death, at the Golden Globes. <br/>At the time of Presley's death, local officials said first responders had been dispatched to her home in Calabasas, where they found her in cardiac arrest. <br/>On Thursday, the medical examiner's office ruled that she died of natural causes and said that the cardiac arrest was caused by a \"small bowel obstruction\".<br/>This occurs when the small intestine is blocked, sometimes as a result of colon cancer, medication or adhesions (scar tissue) that form after surgeries. Some conditions that inflame intestines can also lead to small bowel obstructions. <br/>In Presley's case, the report found that the adhesions were caused by weight-loss surgery, known as bariatric surgery, that she underwent several years ago. <br/>\"This is a known long-term complication of this type of surgery,\" the medical examiner's report noted. <br/>Dr Angelique Campen, an emergency room physician at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, told the BBC's US partner, CBS, that deaths from small bowel obstructions are rare. <br/>In many cases, patients in such cases experience significant pain and would probably be admitted to hospital. <br/>Presley, a singer and songwriter, was ultimately buried next to her son Benjamin Keough, who killed himself in 2020. <br/>After her death, her mother, Priscilla Presley, filed a legal challenge to the will's validity, arguing that she was unaware of a 2016 amendment that had ousted her as a trustee overseeing Lisa Marie's estate. <br/>Instead, the amendment named Benjamin Keough and a daughter, Riley, as co-trustees.

Miyazaki himself was given the Academy's Honorary Award in 2014. <br/>How Do You Live (Kimitachi wa Do Ikiru ka) takes its title from the 1937 novel by Genzaburo Yoshino, but its story is a wholly original one, penned by Miyazaki.<br/>The film is set in Japan during World War Two and centres around a young boy named Mahito whose mother is killed in a fire. <br/>Shortly thereafter his father, who works in a factory producing fighter planes, marries his late wife's younger sister Natsuko, and moves the family to her large ancestral home in the countryside.<br/>Mahito, who is resentful of Natsuko for taking his mother's place, begins to explore the area around the house and discovers a mysterious tower which he is told not to enter. <br/>He also encounters a grey heron that can speak (as seen on the film's poster) who claims Mahito's mother is in fact alive and in the tower waiting to be rescued. Mahito dismisses this claim, but when his new stepmother disappears into the tower he decides to rescue her. <br/>Once he enters, he is transported into an alternate world full of magic where his quest brings him into contact with new friends and enemies alike. <br/>The film is full of Miyazaki's signature obsessions, quirks and thematic concerns. There are the usual visual treats, like cute yet eerie creatures, great-looking food and gravity-defying flights of fancy - primarily hand-drawn and moving with the fluidity and sense of weight that mark the master animator's work. <br/>Thematically, as in films like Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away, How Do You Live is a coming-of-age tale in which a child must overcome his selfishness and learn to live for others.<br/>How Do You Live also echoes the director's own biography. Miyazaki's father, like Mahito's, worked for a firm that produced parts for fighter planes, and his own family also evacuated from the city to the countryside during the war. Miyazaki also had a deep bond with his own mother, who was said to have had a large influence on his work and the strong female characters in his films.<br/>How Do You Live has not had the same level of release-day buzz as might be expected for a new release from a director of Miyazaki's fame. There have been no trailers or TV spots, and the lone hint as to what the film might be about has come via a single enigmatic poster. <br/>This anti-PR push is a deliberate strategy on the part of Studio Ghibli president and How Do You Live producer Toshio Suzuki, who told a prominent Japanese magazine in June: \"I thought giving out too much information would reduce audience interest.\"<br/>A Friday afternoon review of several cinemas in Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's major entertainment districts, showed early morning and evening screenings nearly sold out, but many seats available for afternoon and late night showings. <br/>Anecdotally, many friends I have surveyed over the past week had no idea a new Miyazaki film was set for this weekend. Box office numbers released once the weekend is over will tell a more complete story, but the strategy may be to start slow and build the audience over the coming weeks through word of mouth. <br/>Miyazaki has threatened to retire from feature filmmaking numerous times, most notably in 2013 after the release of his film The Wind Rises. It didn't stick: the director began work on How Do You Live in 2016. <br/>With production on this film taking seven years, and considering the director's age (he turned 82 in January) however, How Do You Live is ostensibly his final feature film.<br/>While Miyazaki's legacy is assured, the future of Studio Ghibli is less clear. The studio, founded to produce films by Miyazaki and Takahata, has made several attempts to pass the baton to the next generation over the years with mixed success. <br/>One potential successor, Yoshifumi Kondo, who directed the studio's well-received Whisper of the Heart in 1995, died shortly after aged 47. Miyazaki's son Goro has directed three films at the studio, including the recent computer-animated Earwig and the Witch, but his films have not received the same level of financial or critical success as his father's.<br/>President Toshio Suzuki has announced that Ghibli is planning its next film, and the studio has recently expanded into ventures like Ghibli Park, a distinctly un-Disney-like theme park in Nagoya, Japan. (At the screening of How Do You Live I attended, I was handed a file folder advertising the park upon entering the theatre.)<br/>In the decade since Miyazaki's first retirement, directors like Makoto Shinkai (Your Name) and Mamoru Hosoda (Belle) have had huge domestic box office success with their own original anime IPs, while in 2020 a feature adaptation of the manga Demon Slayer surpassed Spirited Away to become Japan's highest-grossing film of all time. Regardless of what happens to Ghibli itself, Miyazaki's ultimate legacy may be helping to establish animated films as Japan's best-loved form of entertainment.<br/>Matt Schley is an independent film and anime reviewer based in Japan<br/>Hayao Miyazaki: Japan's godfather of animation?<br/>The dark relevance of a Japanese war anime<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But studio executives have said their demands are unreasonable, leaving Tinseltown at an impasse.<br/>Here's why Hollywood is on strike. <br/>There are three major players involved in the negotiations. <br/>The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union speaks for more than 160,000 members who include actors, stunt co-ordinators, voiceover artists and background actors. <br/>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) is a union that represents writers in film, television, radio and online. <br/>And the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) represents major film studios like Disney and Paramount, American television networks like Fox and NBC, and streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. <br/>Talks broke down for several reasons. Let's walk through a few of them. <br/>The advent of streaming has reshaped the way the world consumes TV and films, but it's also changed how actors are paid.<br/>Typically, actors and writers are paid upfront for their work, but many maintain their income through residuals, steady compensation based on re-runs of TV shows and films. When shows were syndicated across ad-supported networks, residual cheques could sustain veteran actors, like SAG president Fran Drescher, throughout their careers. <br/>But streaming has changed that. Both actors and writers say their residuals have plummeted and it is destroying their livelihoods. <br/>Michael Patrick Lane has been acting in Hollywood for more than a decade. But he told BBC News he's made as little as $300 (\u00a3229) in residuals for five episodes of television. After paying for acting classes, agents and managers Mr Lane said he barely takes home $20,000 (\u00a315,200) a year. <br/>\"Even though I'm a consistent working actor, for the most part, these last few years, I can't take care of my family,\" he said, adding that it's delayed his plan to have kids. <br/>SAG-AFTRA says members are striking for more equitable division of the profits from movies and television. But according to the AMPTP, SAG negotiators chose to forego \"the highest percentage increase in minimums in 35 years\" in favour of going on strike. <br/>\"The AMPTP presented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases,\" the studio bosses said. \"The Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: How the Hollywood strike affects you in 75 seconds<br/>Maya Gilbert-Dunbar is a dual member of SAG and the Writers Guild who is now running for SAG-AFTRA president. She said the majority of members in the SAG union barely make above minimum wage. <br/>\"The bulk of our membership are career background actors,\" she said. \"These people are barely making $150 (\u00a3114) a day.\" <br/>For many actors, joining SAG-AFTRA is also the only pathway to health insurance. But Ms Dunbar estimates only 15% of the union's 160,000 members make the required $26,000 a year to qualify for healthcare coverage. What's more, she said \"elder\" actors are kicked off the insurance plan after they turn 65. <br/>AMPTP says it has proposed \"substantial increases in pension and health contribution caps\". <br/>While countless blockbusters warned of the dangers of AI, few could have predicted it would lead to Hollywood's first major strike in decades. <br/>The AMPTP says it offered SAG a \"ground-breaking AI proposal which protects performers' digital likenesses, including a requirement for performers' consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance\".<br/>But at the press conference announcing the strike, SAG's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, explained why the union flatly rejected the idea.  <br/>\"They proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day's pay, and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity, in any project they want with no consent and with no compensation.\"<br/>\"So if you think that's a ground-breaking proposal, I suggest you think again.\"<br/>For now at least, both sides seem firmly dug in. A strike often means that neither side is willing to negotiate, and it could take time for both unions to return to the table. The last time both writers and actors manned the picket line, the strike lasted 10 weeks and was led by then-actor Ronald Reagan. <br/>The writers' strike is already in its third month with no end in sight.<br/>While the strikes last, don't expect to see Hollywood stars at film premieres, festivals, conventions or red carpets. Union rules prohibit actors from taking any work, including promotion or publicity for projects. <br/>\"A strike isn't the end, it's the beginning, unfortunately,\" Ms Dunbar said, adding that she hopes that in the end both parties can agree on a suitable contract. <br/>\"We're going to strike, people can't work, [but] you have to secure a deal that justifies doing this. And that's what I hope happens,\" she said.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The famous faces out and about on the picket line supporting the Hollywood strike<br/>Strike impacts films and shows beyond Hollywood<br/>Hollywood strike could last until end of the year<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Kreiz began working on it when he became CEO of Mattel in 2018 and he remains executive producer. <br/>Barbie and Ken are played by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, with Greta Gerwig directing.<br/>Kreiz acknowledges there is some risk in giving Barbie the Hollywood treatment, working with directors and writers who have their own creative ideas.<br/>There is \"humour and self-deprecation\" in the film, he says (not least on his part, as he is played by Will Ferrell, a controlling and slightly stuffy CEO).<br/>It's clear even from the trailer that Barbie is the butt of jokes. <br/>If you're being generous, she is portrayed as na\u00efve and innocent. If you aren't, she's shallow and superficial, obsessed with appearance and unable to comprehend the meaning of sex, death - or life without high heels.<br/>Barbie's \"Dreamland\" is a pink utopia, divorced from reality.<br/>\"This movie has been 64 years in the making (Barbie launched in 1959),\" says Kreiz, \"but it represents how the culture sees Barbie today.\"<br/>Barbie remains Mattel's biggest-selling brand, making the company more than \u00a31bn ($1.5bn) annually. Its other brands include Hot Wheels, Masters of the Universe, Monster High, Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine.<br/>Kreiz argues Mattel's other brands also have the potential to be turned into successful spin-offs.<br/>\"The devil works hard but Barbie's marketing team is working harder,\" according to marketing expert Mike Buonaiuto, author of Founder Therapy, who admires the inventive advertising the team behind the film has been up to, including the Airbnb listing of a Barbie Dreamhouse. <br/>\"But let's be honest,\" Buonaiuto points out, \"the opportunity for the Mattel universe is vastly different to Marvel's, and whilst Barbie is being powered by millennial nostalgia collaborations, try and do the same for Thomas the Tank Engine or Hot Wheels and you probably won't get the same result. <br/>\"The depth of world-building Mattel can pull from isn't competition for Marvel's.\"<br/>But the recent collapse of Toys R Us shows why toymakers like Mattel need to diversify beyond the sale of physical products, adds Buonaiuto.<br/>Barbie was first introduced in America in 1959, developed by Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel. <br/>Before Barbie, dolls typically took the form of babies, so children could play at being a nurturing parent. However, Barbies encouraged children to play at being adolescents, imagining their future selves through the dolls.<br/>As the original TV adverts that ran during Mickey Mouse Club told children: \"Someday I'm going to be exactly like you.\"<br/>This proved alluring and good business. More than a billion Barbie dolls had been sold by the early 1990s.<br/>But there have also been questions about what exactly Barbie dolls teach children, especially around body image. <br/>The original Barbie design was extremely skinny and the messaging reinforced unhealthy ideas. One infamous slumber party set created in the mid-1960s featured bathroom scales fixed at 110 pounds (50kg) and a dieting book that advised: \"Don't eat\".<br/>Another talking Barbie created in the early 1990s had the doll saying, \"Math class is tough.\" Mattel later apologised.  <br/>These issues continued to affect people's perception of the brand and arguably lay behind a dip in popularity around a decade ago.<br/>Mattel has learned lessons and is now keeping up with the times, says Kreiz.<br/>\"Barbie is a flag carrier for diversity and inclusivity,\" he says, \"with more than 170 different Barbie types in terms of body shape and skin colour, and Barbie has more than 200 careers, so girls can explore their potential in different ways.\"<br/>Barbie has recently brought out dolls with disabilities, prosthetic limbs, and one with Down's Syndrome. <br/>The \"classic, traditional Barbie\" is less than half of the business now, says Kreiz.<br/>That new commitment to diversity is reflected in the cast of the film, while the classic Barbie, who is the central character, is gently mocked.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Kreiz also points out that Mattel is restructuring the company to move with the times.<br/>Now it simply divides its products into categories (like dolls, vehicles and pre-school), rather than having teams devoted to separate boys' and girls' products. This is despite the fact that many shops still divide toys by gender, with pink aisles for girls who want to be princesses, and blue ones for boys who like dinosaurs and construction sets.<br/>The Barbie film is part of Kreiz's masterplan to position Mattel as a \"talent magnet\", working with people like film directors to try different things with its well-known creations.<br/>\"People who buy our products aren't just consumers,\" says Kreiz. \"They are fans, who have an emotional relationship to the products.

The union was once led by former US President Ronald Reagan, then best known as a swashbuckling cowboy from cheesy movies. <br/>And less than 24 hours into the guild's campaign against Hollywood's streaming giants, its current leader, Fran Drescher, has caught public attention with a fiery speech from her base in Los Angeles. <br/>Branding corporations including Netflix, Disney and Paramount as \"disgusting\", she accused the streaming powerhouses of \"losing money left and right\", all the while \"giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs\".<br/>The speech, which quickly went viral, is emblematic of the wider labour fissures playing out across the world. She accused executives of making \"Wall Street and greed their priority\" while ignoring the \"essential contributors that make the machine run\". <br/>While the grievances aired by Drescher may be recognisable, the 65-year-old's rise to union leadership is anything but traditional. <br/>She was born in the Queens borough of New York City to a Jewish family in 1957. <br/>And while attending Hillcrest High School in the city, she met Peter Marc Jacobson who she went on to marry in 1977, aged just 21. <br/>In 2010 she recalled that when the pair married they were \"just kids and didn't know who we truly were. We went through a lot together\". Nonetheless, he would soon become her chief artistic collaborator. <br/>Her first break in Hollywood was a minor role in the smash hit Saturday Night Fever, which starred John Travolta. <br/>The brief cameo role, in which she played a dancer at a club, saw her deliver the line \"So, are you as good in bed as you are on the dance floor?\" to the Hollywood legend. <br/>She soon found success with a series of roles in films, including the critically acclaimed This is Spinal Tap, where she played publicist Bobbi Flekman, before landing a co-starring role in the short-lived sitcom Princesses. <br/>But she achieved fame as the creator and star of The Nanny, a US sitcom in which she portrayed Jewish fashionista Fran Fine, who becomes a nanny to a rich British family. <br/>The show, which she produced and co-wrote with Jacobsen, ran on the CBS network from 1993 to 1999 and earned her two Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations. <br/>In 1999, Drescher and Jacobsen divorced and he subsequently came out as gay. <br/>But the pair continued their creative relationship, penning the sitcom Happily Divorced, in which she starred as an actress coming to terms with the revelation that her husband is gay. <br/>Drescher, a cancer survivor, wrote a novel, Cancer Schmancer, in which she discussed her experience receiving treatment for the illness and the eight years of misdiagnosis that preceded it. She subsequently founded an organisation of the same name, which lobbies for healthcare reform. <br/>Drescher has been politically active throughout her career. In 2008, she endorsed then Senator Hilary Clinton for president and briefly considered a run to replace Ms Clinton as senator for New York before deciding against it. <br/>And she has long expressed opinions to the political left, frequently captioning photos with phrases like \"Capitalism has become another word for Ruling Class Elite!\"<br/>In a 2017 interview with Vulture, she described herself as an \"anti-capitalist\", noting that she was not \"anti-making-money\", but that it must be \"calibrated within the spectrum of what's a true value\". <br/>Her political activism ultimately saw her launch a campaign to lead the SAG. In 2021 she won a vicious election against actor Matthew Modine to become president of the guild. <br/>The pair represented different factions of the union and the race became so bitter that Modine accused Drescher of spreading lies about him. <br/>According to Deadline Hollywood, Modine said after the election: \"I'm ashamed of Fran Drescher, I'm disappointed. But she'll be judged by the people in the world after she's gone, or by whatever God she worships.\"<br/>Divisions in the union were so widespread that after the Hollywood Writers union voted to strike earlier this year, studio executives reportedly dismissed any possibility that actors would have the resolve to go through with their own strike action.  <br/>But since her election, Drescher has proven to be a steady hand at the head of the union, and has overseen an end to the infighting that previously characterised it. Before taking office, she pledged to end what she called \"dysfunctional division in this union\".<br/>The call for strike action was ultimately endorsed by 97.9% of voting members, and Membership First - the opposition faction that supported Modine in the 2021 election - recently endorsed her re-election. <br/>And as she gears up for what promises to be a tough fight with streaming executives, Drescher has shown a willingness to combine her political role with the dramatic flair that made her name. <br/>\"They [the studios]  stand on the wrong side of history at this very moment,\" she told reporters on Thursday as she announced the strike. <br/>And jabbing her finger towards the camera, she said: \"We stand in solidarity in unprecedented unity.

The deepest dive wins,\" says the film's trailer. \"You've gotta swim the length of a 70-storey skyscraper.\"<br/>But it adds ominously: \"Freediving is an extreme sport - and extreme sports have extreme consequences.\"<br/>The most dangerous part of the dive is when the swimmer returns to the surface, when they can succumb to so-called \"shallow water blackout\" just metres from fresh air.<br/>It's disturbing seeing footage of swimmers blacking out and being pulled out of the water by the safety divers, who sometimes have to revive them with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. <br/>The safety diver meets the swimmer as they ascend, watching them closely, primed to pull them upwards if they start to lose consciousness.<br/>No-one is immune from freediving's dangers, and the film has some heart-stopping moments. You get the sense that something terrible could happen at any time. <br/>We are told about champion freediver Natalia Molchanova, presumed dead after diving in Ibiza in 2015. She sadly didn't resurface after a recreational dive, and it's believed she was caught in underwater currents.<br/>The Deepest Breath's director Laura McGann became \"hooked\" on making the film after her interest was sparked by a news story about Irish freediver Stephen Keenan.<br/>\"I didn't know anything about freediving. I love the sea and go swimming all year round,\" McGann says at June's Sheffield Documentary Festival.<br/>\"I started to look online and saw beautiful videos and short films about freedivers, and it made me feel something I had really never felt before.\"<br/>McGann wanted to explore how the intrepid Keenan fell in love with diving, while he was living in Dahab, Egypt. He became an instructor and safety freediver - one of the experienced divers on hand to help during freediving competitions.<br/>She was also very interested in how he worked with Italian freediver Alessia Zecchini in her bid to become a world champion, making her childhood dream a reality. <br/>Their relationship deepens throughout the film, which takes the viewer on an emotional journey.<br/>McGann also talks about what it feels like to watch freediving footage.<br/>While it's undoubtedly beautiful to see someone descend silently into the ocean's depths, watching the film does make you very aware of your own ability to inhale.<br/>McGann says the same happened to her.<br/>\"I was doing what many of you may have done in the first couple of minutes of this film - I was holding my breath, to try to figure out 'how are they doing this?'\" she adds.<br/>\"I counted how many times I'd have to let go of the breath and breathe in.\"<br/>The director's research for her film began in lockdown, during the Coronavirus pandemic.<br/>\"I started to speak to people, and to learn more about Stephen and Alessia,\" she says, revealing her surprise when she realised she lived close to Stephen's Dad, Peter, in Ireland. <br/>Peter gave her 14 hours of audio interviews with his son, which McGann was able to listen to, and use for the film.<br/>\"I fell in love with Steven and gradually got to know Alessia more, it was just an instant connection that I felt, with the story,\" McGann explains.<br/>The film uses actual footage and some reconstruction to tell Zecchini and Keenan's story, as they build up to her attempt to set a new world freediving record.  <br/>Zecchini has to master her mind as well as her body, learning to meditate and calm her thoughts before she enters the water.<br/>We also see them at Dahab's notorious Blue Hole in Egypt, which has a terrifying-looking 25m-long tunnel, 55m below the Red Sea. It is nicknamed the \"divers' cemetery\".<br/>McGann wasn't there at the time, but she tells their story chronologically, using footage from the diving community, who documented events on a variety of cameras. <br/>She explains that in order to film someone freediving, the camera person also needs to be a freediver, to \"come up at their speed\", and capture the whole dive on film.<br/>\"It was important it was real, it was raw, so there were images there shot on a GoPro camera, on 4K\u2026 on an iPhone,\" she says.<br/>\"You wouldn't [usually] use that, but it's [recorded] the moment - so you put it in.\"<br/>McGann tells the BBC it was hard at times to stay detached, given how close she felt to her subjects. <br/>\"You certainly don't stay detached, you fall in love with the story, the people in it,\" she says. \"But it's important to be able to recognise that, and recognise you have a role here - to best tell the story.\"<br/>She adds that the documentary did not gloss over any negative aspects of its participants' behaviour.<br/>\"Alessia doesn't always behave wonderfully\u2026 and it was a little bit awkward, but... she watched it, she accepted it.\"<br/>Producer Sarah Thomson adds: \"It's to Laura's credit that she has such intimate relationships with the people that you see, and was able to get them to sit down for interviews.\" <br/>She says they have also hosted special screenings with the freediving community to \"give them a chance to see this together\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Freediver Adam Drzazga reveals the training and relaxation exercises required to hold his breath for more than six minutes<br/>The film has been well received, having been screened at Sundance Film Festival in January. <br/>Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan wrote back in March: \"The Deepest Breath is a nerve-shredding experience. McGann's astute assemblage captures the liquid danger of the dark depths.... Awards will surely come calling.<br/>\"Technically, it's just about flawless. Although The Deepest Breath is due for release on Netflix later on this year, it's one of the ultimate big-screen experiences that is worth seeking out should the chance arise.\"<br/>Guy Lodge from Variety added: \"The world can probably be divided into two camps of people: those who will watch The Deepest Breath, a heart-pumping documentary on the extreme sport of freediving, and understand the dangerous pull of the big blue, and those for whom it might be the most nightmarish vicarious trip into the ocean since Jaws.\"  <br/>Allow YouTube content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Meanwhile, the third Paddington movie, Paddington in Peru, was meant to start work later this month but producers may now need to stock up on marmalade sandwiches for the time being.<br/>Among the productions in the UK that could be affected is Deadpool 3, starring Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who were recently pictured suited and booted for their roles. The third instalment of the Marvel antihero film franchise was due out in May 2024 but the strike could now change things.<br/>Fans may also have to wait longer for other eagerly-anticipated movies like Tim Burton's Beetlejuice sequel and a film adaptation of the musical Wicked.<br/>Beetlejuice 2, due out in September 2024 starring Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder and Jenna Ortega, had just started filming in Vermont this week when the strike was announced.<br/>But the big screen adaptation of Wicked, starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, has been filming in the UK for months.

Upcoming releases due to hold promotional events like press junkets and red-carpet premieres include Disney's Haunted Mansion (released 28 July), a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film (2 August),  Sir Kenneth Branagh's Agata Christie mystery A Haunting In Venice (15 September).<br/>While writing for these projects is likely to be completed, the strike by performers will bring a stop to a large proportion of production work and cause havoc with scheduling.<br/>The number of filming permits for feature films and television projects, including reality TV, in Los Angeles plunged 64% last week, compared to the same week in 2022, according to figures from FilmLA.<br/>Actors represented by SAG-AFTRA's sister union, Equity, in the UK must continue to work as normal - the Hollywood strike does not apply to them.<br/>Equity says \"a performer joining the strike (or refusing to cross a picket line) in the UK will have no protection against being dismissed or sued for breach of contract by the producer\".<br/>Even actors represented by both SAG-AFTRA and Equity may be required to work on projects being made in the UK, Equity said, due to UK employment laws.<br/>In terms of TV, Warner Bros Discovery previously boasted about the minimal disruption of the writers' strike to HBO projects like House of the Dragon series, filming in the UK, because scripts were complete.<br/>Nonetheless, the strike by performers who are members of SAG-AFTRA means many fully written screenplays are now likely to be left sitting unused.<br/>Series two of the Game of Thrones TV spin-off, with Matt Smith and Emma D'Arcy, could now face delays, as well as the second series of The Sandman, starring Tom Sturridge, and series four of Oscar-winner Gary Oldman's Slow Horses.<br/>It is believed side deals could be struck between guild performers and producers to enable certain projects to continue. <br/>In the US, other TV projects expected to be in production this summer include the second series of the Night Court reboot and Chicago Med, Fire and P.D. on NBC, NCIS and Young Sheldon on CBS, and Family Guy and The Simpsons on Fox.<br/>US networks have responded by expanding the amount of \"unscripted content\", like The Masked Singer, The Amazing Race, Survivor and Kitchen Nightmares, in their fall schedules.<br/>A number of TV series being filmed in the UK, including spy thriller The Day Of The Jackal, starring Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne, and Stephen Graham's boxing drama A Thousand Blows could also be affected.<br/>Work on other big shows like Stranger Things, The Last of Us, and Yellowjackets had already been parked due to the parallel writers' strike, as well as Saturday Night Live, but the actors' strike means they are now double parked.<br/>Forthcoming industry events, including the Emmy Awards and the Toronto, Telluride and Venice film festivals are likely to go ahead without any stars on display, if indeed they go ahead at all now.<br/>As sound stages across the US and other parts of the world fall quieter as a result of the Hollywood mega-strike, meetings between the guilds and entertainment industry representatives will take place.<br/>In 1980, during the last actors' strike, the walkout lasted 10 weeks as the two sides at an estimated cost of that walkout was put at about $100m (\u00a376m) by the industry, equivalent to about $370m today.<br/>The last time both writers and actors went on strike together was in 1960 - when writers downed tools for 21 weeks and actors stopped work for six.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Actor Fran Drescher: 'Shame on them'<br/>This time around negotiations could be even more protracted, with some actors urging their union to take a hard-line approach, according to industry bible Variety.<br/>For their part, Hollywood employers and producers said they were disappointed by SAG-AFTRA's decision, which they said dismissed a historic offer.<br/>Responding to the strike, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers said it was \"certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life\". <br/>\"The union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\"<br/>Actors' strike to hit production of major films<br/>Stars walk Oppenheimer red carpet - then leave<br/>Hollywood actors set to strike alongside writers<br/>The mega-strike that could take down Hollywood<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

A string of conspiratorial comments by the leading actor Jim Caviezel and the movie's themes have turned the film into another culture war flashpoint. <br/>Rolling Stone called Sound of Freedom a \"QAnon-tinged thriller\" - a reference to the sprawling conspiracy theory that says that Donald Trump is fighting an elite cabal of satanic paedophiles. <br/>That sort of biting coverage - the headline called it \"a superhero movie for dads with brainworms\" - was broadly reflective of reviews in left-leaning outlets, while right-wing publications took an altogether different line.  <br/>\"It's not 'paranoid' or 'QAnon adjacent' to bring much-needed attention to horrors that are all too real,\" wrote the conservative National Review. <br/>The idea that elite cabals of child sex traffickers lurk everywhere is a core QAnon idea. But the company behind the film denies it's fuelling conspiratorial thinking. <br/>\"Anyone who has seen this movie knows it has nothing to do with conspiracy theories,\" said Angel Studios president Jordan Harmon. \"It's about a man who did something brave.\"<br/>But those QAnon references are not entirely spurious. The film's star Caviezel has talked repeatedly about some of its more bizarre themes.<br/>Caviezel attended a QAnon-themed conference in 2021 and has appeared a number of times on Steve Bannon's podcast, recently calling QAnon \"a good thing\". <br/>Using the language of the movement, he warned that \"a big storm is coming\" and also referred to the \"mystical qualities\" of adrenochrome, a chemical that QAnon fans falsely believe is being harvested from the brains of child victims. <br/>\"On the one hand, Angel Studios is seeking to present this film as a mainstream movie, as an important story,\" said John Knefel, a senior writer at the left-wing media watchdog group Media Matters for America. \"The other key prong of this marketing blitz is Jim Caviezel absolutely embracing QAnon messaging and theories.\"<br/>\"I do think that this could very well serve as a template for mainstreaming far-right ideas under the guise of an easy popcorn blockbuster,\" he said.<br/>Operation Underground Railroad and Timothy Ballard have come under criticism for different issues in the past. Investigations by Vice News and others have accused the group of exaggerating their success in breaking up child sexual abuse rings. <br/>And the energy around conspiracy theories has the potential to distract from legitimate efforts to tackle a very real problem.<br/>\"Anti-trafficking groups have already said that QAnon hinders their efforts, and the film revolves around the baseless panic that vast trafficking rings are waiting to snatch up American kids,\" says Mike Rothschild, an expert on QAnon and author of The Storm is Upon Us. \"Trafficking is real but films like this obscure the real issue.\"<br/>\"The film is marketed to Q believers in much the same way as Q works, through fear of trafficking and appeals to emotion,\" he says.<br/>But Mr Ballard hit back at critics, telling Fox News that those citing conspiracy theories \"make zero connection to the actual story\".<br/>He told Fox: \"It's going to be very awkward when the mainstream media comes after these [trafficked] kids next and accuses them of being part of some conspiracy, when in fact they were rescued from a life of rape. It's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in the media perhaps.<br/>\"It tells a story based in truth\u2026 I think that the left, these media outlets, they don't want to have a discussion that this film is going to compel.\"<br/>Mr Ballard stepped away from OUR prior to the release of the film, the organisation said.<br/>Angel Studios has both denied links to QAnon and distanced itself from the remarks of the star of its surprise hit.<br/>\"Every actor has their opinions\" and many have said controversial things, said Mr Harmon, the studio president. <br/>\"For us it's not about that, it's about getting a message out there\u2026 right now, there's children who are suffering.\"<br/>Sound of Freedom had a long and somewhat tortured path to US movie theatres. Shot in 2018, it was bought by 21st Century Fox but shelved when that studio was bought by Disney, before being acquired by Angel - which is based not in Hollywood but Utah. <br/>The company said 7,000 investors stumped up a total of $5m (\u00a33.8m) earlier this year to market Sound of Freedom through social media posts and conventional advertising. And previous projects have created a pool of around 100,000 movie fans - Mr Harmon says most of them have a \"faith leaning\" - who spread word of the film.<br/>\"We built a grassroots movement,\" Mr Harmon said.<br/>The studio also encourages moviegoers to \"pay it forward\" - to buy and donate the price of admission as a way to support the film, and churches and conservative organisations have bought batches of tickets. <br/>The marketing material played heavily on concerns about real-world child trafficking. Mel Gibson endorsed the movie, and Caviezel shot a promotional clip in which he repeated a line from the film urging people to watch it: \"You can send the message that God's children are not for sale.\"<br/>After a week in theatres, Sound of Freedom has pulled in more than $40m. Last weekend it took nearly $20m according to IMDB, compared to $27m for the new Indiana Jones instalment and $33m for the top-grossing Insidious: The Red Door.<br/>In total Sound of Freedom has already made $40m compared to a budget of $14.5m.<br/>Outside the political debate, the movie has received a range of fairly positive reviews. Variety, the entertainment news site, called it a \"solidly made and disquieting thriller\" with \"a Christian undercurrent that occasionally becomes an overcurrent\". <br/>There's also more to come from Angel Studios. Mr Harmon said he hopes Sound of Freedom will remain in theatres for months, and the studio has multiple projects on the go. <br/>\"We've got a very large theatrical slate,\" he said. \"And our community is growing very quickly.\"<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

And it's doing so well, I'm seeing it everywhere.\"<br/>Another thing Ali thinks has helped the film are the posters, which people could edit themselves into and \"encouraged a lot of people to make their own\".<br/>He says Barbie's marketing campaign is a stark contrast to Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, which is released on the same day.<br/>And while lots of people are planning to watch both on 21 July - in what's been dubbed Barbenheimer - Ali says Oppenheimer has taken a more traditional approach.<br/>\"That's a movie about the man who helped create the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb,\" he says.<br/>\"So you can't sell toys off the back of that, you can't sell fishing rods and shirts and hats and whatever random stuff they might be selling - it's just the movie.\"<br/>Moshe Isaacian is a senior brand consultant who compiled a viral Twitter thread listing many of the Barbie marketing stunts and licencing deals.<br/>And if the campaign has felt like it's been going on for ages, he says the planning has been years in the works. <br/>Moshe, who's worked with Nike and Amazon, says many of the deals have been \"a year, two years in the making\" and that Mattel have been \"very good at being selective\".<br/>\"It doesn't just feel like the regular licencing deals,\" he says.<br/>\"It's more like [they're selling] Barbie's lifestyle plan now, like this is how Barbie would dress up, talk, the things she would eat, what kind of candles she would have in her house. <br/>\"These are things that mostly an older generation care about.\"<br/>Ali also thinks the film has an older, and wider, appeal than who the dolls are marketed at - partly because it's being directed by Little Women's Greta Gerwig.<br/>In one teaser clip Barbie asks her fellow dolls if they ever think about dying, and Ken asks Barbie if he can stay round her house - much to Barbie's bemusement. <br/>\"It doesn't feel to me like children will be watching a children's film. In fact, and this is just a guess, I suspect young children will be bamboozled by it.\"<br/>In contrast to the marketing side of things, there's also been a level of secrecy around the actual film itself.<br/>BBC News hasn't been able to watch it yet but the few reviews that are out there are largely positive.<br/>So, after months of build up - is the expensive advertising campaign going to pay off?<br/>\"I think the opening weekend for Barbie is going to be huge even if it ends up being badly reviewed, and I don't think it will be,\" Ali says. <br/>\"The excitement is at such fever pitch that it's guaranteed I think to have people in cinemas watching it, if only to see the big names.<br/>\"But also so they have their own thoughts on the thing that will be the discussion topic in pop culture for the summer.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Margot Robbie star-struck by Ekin-Su at Barbie premiere<br/>Feeling the 'Kenergy' on Barbie movie pink carpet<br/>Philippines to show Barbie movie but want map blurred<br/>Vietnam bans Barbie movie over South China Sea map<br/>Barbie with Down's syndrome on sale after criticism<br/>'Inclusive Barbies are a major step in my life'<br/>First Barbie doll with hearing aids is 'really important'<br/>Laverne Cox honoured as first transgender Barbie<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The multiple prize-winning author said \"the human body has an amazing capacity to heal. And so I'm fortunate to be well on that way\".<br/>The suspect, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail. <br/>When asked if he will attend the trial later this year, Rushdie said it depended on whether Matar changes his plea.<br/>\"A couple of thousand people saw [it happen]. I'm led to believe that [his plea] is just a holding play and that might well change. If I was his lawyer, I would advise him to do so.<br/>\"If he changes his plea to guilty then actually there's not a trial, there's just a sentencing, and it may well be that then my presence isn't required.<br/>\"I'm in two minds about it,\" he continued. \"There's one bit of me that actually wants to go and stand on the court and look at him and there's another bit of me that just can't be bothered.<br/>\"I don't have a very high opinion of him. And I think what is important to me now is that you're able to find life continuing. I'm more engaged with the business of, you know, getting on with it.\"<br/>Sir Salman is currently writing a book about the near-fatal stabbing incident as a means of processing what he has been through. He told the BBC it won't be more than a \"couple of hundred of pages\" long.<br/>\"There's this colossal elephant in the room and, until I deal with that, it is difficult to take seriously anything else,\" he added.<br/>In a pre-recorded virtual appearance at the Hay literary festival in the UK last month, the author told the audience \"it's not the easiest book in the world to write but it's something I need to get past in order to do anything else.\"<br/>\"That's the thing writers can do. They can outlast the thing that opposes them.\"<br/>The author, who received death threats from Iran in the 1980s after his novel The Satanic Verses was published, currently has residency in both the US and the UK. <br/>He told the BBC that in America he employs security on certain occasions and that the UK still offers him state protection \"like the good old days\".<br/>\"Writers don't have much power. We don't have armies,\" he told the BBC. \"What we have is the ability to write about the world, if we're any good, that might endure.\"<br/>Sir Salman said the world had changed dramatically since The Satanic Verses was released in 1988, but that the radicalisation of religion remains a threat to society.<br/>\"You've got to distinguish between people's private faith, which is kind of none of our business, really, and the politicisation of any religion... In America right now, you've got a highly weaponised version of Christianity, which was responsible in very large part for the reversal of Roe versus Wade, for the whole abortion debate.<br/>\"I'm not a religious person. I never have been, and came from a family that wasn't particularly religious and we did alright... It's not a thing I need for myself but if there are people who need it, that's their business, not mine, until it becomes politicised.<br/>\"When it becomes politicised, it becomes everybody's business, as all political things do. I think we just have to be clear about that distinction. <br/>\"So the kind of person who goes off and chooses violence, in my view, is not a representative of that religion but a representative of violence and has to be treated in that way.\"Salman Rushdie: The writer who emerged from hiding<br/>The Satanic Verses' depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and its references to religion were considered blasphemous and banned in multiple Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. The controversial novel also led to violent demonstrations in Pakistan and the disputed Kashmir region.<br/>Iran's then-leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa - or religious decree - calling for Sir Salman's assassination and placed a $3m (\u00a32.5m) bounty on the author's head. The fatwa remains active via a quasi-official religious foundation.<br/>As a result, Sir Salman was forced into hiding for nearly a decade and required an armed bodyguard due to the number of death threats he received. <br/>He has been largely absent from public life since the attack, with only a handful of media interviews and appearances at awards ceremonies and literary festivals.<br/>His latest book, Victory City, was finished just before last year's attack and was well-received by critics. It revolves around a young child in medieval India who has a divine encounter that changes the course of history.<br/>Sir Salman, who won the Booker Prize in 1981 for his second novel Midnight's Children, recently appeared in person to receive an outstanding achievement award in London for his body of work over the last fifty years.<br/>Earlier this year he also made a rare in-person appearance in New York to receive the Centenary Courage Award from the non-profit organisation PEN America where he served as president from 2004 to 2006.<br/>Sir Salman has long been an advocate for the freedom of expression and warned that it is coming under attack in the West.<br/>In his wide-ranging BBC interview, the novelist also paid tribute to Milan Kundera, author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, who has died aged 94 in Paris following a long illness.<br/>\"I've been thinking about him,\" Rushdie said. \"[Milan Kundera] talks about laughter as being the way to deal with atrocity. <br/>\"Of course, in his case, the atrocity he's thinking of is communism and so on. But I think it's not bad advice.\"<br/>Sir Salman, who has been married five times, named his second-born child after the Czech-born author. <br/>Listen to the full interview from Newshour on BBC Sounds<br/>Rushdie reveals he is writing again after attack<br/>Rushdie warns free expression is under threat<br/>Salman Rushdie says he's lucky following attack<br/>Salman Rushdie: The writer who emerged from hiding<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

It also warned that cost-cutting and inaccurate modelling of future demand could mean new hospitals are too small.<br/>The health department remained \"firmly committed\" to delivering the England building pledge, a spokesperson said.<br/>But Labour called the report \"damning\".<br/>The hospitals plan was a Conservative manifesto commitment during the December 2019 election campaign, and it was made policy the following year. <br/>When the health department officially set out the plan in October 2020, eight hospital construction projects already under way were not included in the target. But recent government statements about building 40 new hospitals include these eight projects, referred to as \"legacy hospitals\". <br/>And in May, the government changed the scope of the scheme to include hospitals in urgent need of repairs, including five judged to be at risk of collapse because of crumbling concrete infrastructure.<br/>Now the National Audit Office has analysed the plans and found that, by the definition set out in 2020, the target will be missed, and only 32 will be built in time. The NAO said the government has used a \"broad\" definition of \"new\", which includes refurbishment of existing buildings as well as completely new hospitals.<br/>The 32 that will be built in time include 24 from the original new hospitals programme, five that were added in May, and three new mental health hospitals. <br/>It said a further eight do not count towards the original definition of \"new\" because they were already under way when the commitment was made.<br/>Questions have been asked for some time about whether the programme is on track and it is significant that the watchdog has now ruled that, judged by the original template, it is not.<br/>In May, a BBC News investigation found that building work had not started on 33 of the projects. <br/>The NAO said staff shortages mean a planned design for a standardised hospital has been delayed until May 2024.<br/>It also warned that a push to meet the target at the lowest possible cost - combined with optimistic forecasts about how much care will be outside hospitals in the future - could result in new hospitals that are too small.<br/>The government had failed to achieve good value for money, the NAO said, as it called for a review of the underlying assumptions behind the plans to make sure the new hospitals are fit for purpose.<br/>Health Secretary Steve Barclay had already told MPs in May that some of the original group included in the new hospitals programme might not be completed by 2030.<br/>He made the admission as he updated the department's building plans to deal with hospitals built with a lightweight concrete that was used in the 1980s and is now judged to be unsafe.<br/>But he restated the commitment to deliver 40 new hospitals by the end of the decade.<br/>Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said the programme included \"innovative plans\" to improve efficiency and quality. But there are important lessons to ensure future major projects were affordable, transparent and delivered on time, he said.<br/>Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, urged the government to \"shift gears\" to get the hospitals built and warned that costs had \"spiralled due to high inflation\".<br/>He said many NHS trusts were \"deeply disappointed\" by delays and said the government \"could have better managed expectations about the funding available, given the uncertainty involved and the impact of inflation\".<br/>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the \"utterly damning report demolishes the government's claims to be building 40 'new hospitals'\".<br/>She called on the health secretary to make an urgent statement in Parliament addressing its findings, saying \"the public deserves answers\".<br/>Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The Conservatives have overpromised, under-delivered, and they've been found out. <br/>\"Meanwhile patients are being treated in outdated, crumbling hospitals.\"<br/>A health department spokesperson said: \"The NAO's report acknowledges that despite changes to the original programme, 40 new hospitals are still expected to be delivered by 2030 and praises the programme's innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, deliver efficiencies and improve quality.<br/>\"We remain firmly committed to delivering these hospitals, which are now expected to be backed by over \u00a320 billion of investment, helping to cut waiting lists so people can get the treatment they need quicker.<br/>\"Three new hospitals have already opened and more will open this year so patients and staff can benefit from major new hospital buildings, equipped with the latest technology.\" <br/>Work yet to start on 33 of 40 new hospitals<br/>Ministers set out plan to train and keep more NHS staff<br/>NHS waiting lists hit record high in England<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The government said it had acted on the BMA's request for pension reform, increasing the tax-free threshold on pensions contributions.<br/>Unlike junior doctors, consultants are not asking for full pay restoration in one go. Instead, they want the government to start at least giving pay rises that match inflation.<br/>During 2022, average NHS earnings exceeded \u00a3126,000 for consultants - this includes extra pay for additional hours and performance.<br/>Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA consultants committee, said the strikes were a last resort and that the union had \"been left with no choice\". <br/>He said the government was \"devaluing consultants' expertise\" and showing a \"lack of regard for the impact this is having on the NHS\".<br/>He said the pay body recommendation of a 6% pay rise showed \"the need to reform the pay review system\" and that the increase was a \"savage real-terms pay cut\".<br/>Dr Sharma warned of further strikes after August, saying consultants were \"in this for the long haul\". More than 85% of BMA members backed walkouts in a previous ballot.<br/>\"The future of the NHS depends on there being consultants within it, but attacks on their pay will drive them away - from the health service and from the country - with devastating consequences,\" he said.<br/>Are you a consultant with a view on the strike?

To be able to talk to somebody face-on, to be able to smile at somebody, is something I haven't done for several years.\"<br/>Disappearing Dentists<br/>Some people are going to extraordinary measure to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer<br/>Ensuring that everyone who needs an NHS dentist is able to access one within a reasonable timeframe and a reasonable distance, is one of the key recommendations in the report.<br/>Other recommendations include:<br/>\"We are concerned this will be too little too late for those dentists who have already left the NHS,\" the report says. <br/>It adds the current dental contract, which pays dentists for batches or courses of treatments delivered rather than for every single item or procedure, such as a check-up or a filling, is not fit for purpose.<br/>The system of paying NHS \"units of dental activity\" (UDAs) can be a disincentive to dentists seeing new patients, including those who have higher levels of disease and require more time to treat, the report warns.<br/>For example, under UDAs, a course of treatment resulting in just one filling might attract the same fee as one containing five fillings, a root treatment and an extraction. <br/>The British Dental Association says workload backlogs, made worse by Covid, will take many years to clear. <br/>Some dental practices are struggling to deliver their NHS contractual commitments, often simply as a result of being unable to fill vacancies, the association claims.<br/>The government says it recently announced a 40% increase in dentistry training places and has made changes \"so dental therapists and hygienists can deliver more treatments\". <br/>\"We invest more than \u00a33bn a year in dentistry and have already increased the funding practices receive for high needs patients to encourage dentists to provide more NHS treatments,\" said a spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care. <br/>It says the NHS dental contract has been reformed to encourage more dentists to provide NHS treatments and to allow dental therapists and hygienists to offer extra services. <br/>The government also said it would set out further measures \"to improve access shortly\". <br/>Louise Ansari from Healthwatch England said: \"Ultimately, only a fundamental and fully resourced dental contract reform can tackle these deep-seated problems, and we call on the government to publish its dental recovery plan urgently.\"<br/>Are you struggling to find an NHS dentist?

This has been completely discredited and the doctor who pushed the idea, Andrew Wakefield, was struck off the medical register.  <br/>But measles is one of the most contagious diseases around, and growing numbers of people are without protection. Scientists at the UKHSA and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have run the numbers to reach those predictions of tens of thousands of cases in the capital. <br/>This is a theoretical risk, rather than saying we are already at the start of a huge measles outbreak. There have been 128 cases so far this year, compared with 54 in the whole of 2022.<br/>But the latest risk assessment suggests the R number - if you remember from Covid that's the number of people an infected person gives the virus to - has exceeded, or is close to 1.0, which is the point where a virus can take off. <br/>The assessment also highlights 19 to 25-year-olds - who would have missed out at the peak of the autism scare - as being the most susceptible. There is heightened concern around university students. <br/>The UKHSA also says a large outbreak could put pressure on the NHS, with between 20% and 40% of infected people needing hospital care. <br/>\"Due to longstanding sub-optimal vaccine uptake there is now a very real risk of seeing big outbreaks in London,\" said Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA.<br/>\"Nobody wants to see their child or loved ones sick with measles, or put others who are more vulnerable, like babies, at risk. I urge those who have missed their MMR vaccines to catch up now.\"<br/>Measles vaccination rates have taken a knock around the world, as the Covid pandemic has disrupted normal healthcare. <br/>Outbreaks in South Asia and Africa also increase the risk of the virus being brought into the UK, where it can then take off. <br/>The NHS is launching catch-up programmes, and parents are encouraged to check their children are up-to-date with their vaccines. <br/>Measles usually starts as a cold and then is followed by a rash - but there can be serious complications for some. <br/>\"For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it,\" said Prof Beate Kampmann, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.<br/>\"To avoid deaths, serious cases and a community outbreak, 95% of the population needs to have been vaccinated against this infection, but our current coverage is well below this target.\"  <br/>Children in the UK should have a first dose of the MMR vaccine by their first birthday and the second dose by the time they are three-and-a-half years old.<br/>This protects them for life against measles and prevents spread of the virus to other people.<br/>Jane Clegg, Regional Chief Nurse for the NHS in London said: \"If you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch with your GP practice or local pharmacist for advice.

This decision largely centres on three studies suggesting a connection to a type of liver cancer. <br/>However, the \"possibly\" refers only to the strength of scientific evidence. If the evidence was strong, then aspartame would be in a higher category.<br/>Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said the \"evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough\" and \"this is really more a call to the research community\" to study the sweetener more. <br/>The cancer classifications frequently lead to misleading headlines. Alcohol and plutonium are in the same category (both are proven to cause cancer), but one is seriously more dangerous than the other. <br/>So a separate body - the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives - has the job of working out safe doses.<br/>It analysed the cancer risk as well as other issues such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but found \"no sufficient reason\" to alter the advice it has had since 1981.<br/>So the safe limits remain at 40 milligrams per kilogram of your body weight, per day. <br/>These aren't targets, they're the upper safety limits. But as the advice is based on body weight, it is easier for children to get close to the limit.<br/>Dr Branca said it was \"not a good practice\" to have a bottle of sweet fizzy drink on the table at family dinner time, as children risked being set up with a sweet tooth for life. <br/>He also stressed that large reviews of the evidence show sweeteners do not help people lose weight.<br/>So his advice is for everyone to shift to a less sweet diet - cutting both sugar and sweeteners - and for companies to produce foods that are less sweet, but still tasty.<br/>One of the big outstanding research questions is how might aspartame result in cancer (if indeed it does). The WHO reports show that aspartame itself is rapidly broken down in the gut into three other substances - phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol.<br/>But these are also the product of digesting a wide variety of other foods that are not linked with cancer. And the researchers concluded that aspartame is not directly making cancerous mutations in people's DNA. Raising levels of inflammation in the body is one possibility. <br/>Frances Hunt-Wood, secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association, said the work had \"once again reaffirmed aspartame's safety\".<br/>She added: \"Aspartame, like all low/no calorie sweeteners, when used as part of a balanced diet, provides consumers with choice to reduce sugar intake, a critical public health objective.\"<br/>There are some people who cannot safely consume aspartame. These are people with an inherited disease called phenylketonuria or PKU, who are born unable to metabolise the phenylalanine that is released as aspartame is broken down. <br/>Follow Jameson Twitter.<br/>Aspartame - is it a possible cause of cancer?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

In July that year, first-time mother Ms Mulcahy died from an infection caused by the same virus at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford.<br/>Ms Woods said that when, Ms Sampson's condition was not responding to antibiotics, the possibility of a viral infection should have been considered earlier.<br/>When Ms Mulcahy became ill six weeks later, medical teams were aware of Ms Sampson's death but did not start antiviral treatment at an early stage because the cause of her symptoms were not clear.<br/>The inquest has heard how Ms Sampson needed a blood transfusion because of injuries sustained during the operation. After two days, she asked to be discharged with her baby and went home with her mother despite being in a lot of pain.<br/>Her condition deteriorated and she was readmitted to the maternity ward a few days later. Doctors thought she was suffering from bacterial sepsis, a potentially very serious condition, and treated her with antibiotics.<br/>She was transferred to King's College Hospital in south London but her condition did not improve and she died on 22 May.<br/>Ms Mulcahy had her baby by Caesarean section on 26 June and developed a fever the following day - she was given antibiotics but did not improve.<br/>Doctors again thought she was suffering from sepsis and on 30 June she was transferred to intensive care, but medical teams were unable to save her and she died on the morning of 4 July.<br/>The coroner said deaths from herpes were incredibly rare. The virus, HSV-1 or herpes simplex is a common infection that can cause sores around the mouth or genitals, but if contracted after giving birth, it is \"a potentially fatal disease\" Ms Woods said.<br/>She said she would be writing to the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology to highlight the dangers of the condition in new mothers.<br/>She subsequently ruled out conclusions of unlawful killing and neglect, which lawyers for the women's families had argued for. The coroner is expected to give narrative conclusions for both Ms Sampson and Ms Mulcahy on 26 July.<br/>Speaking after the inquest, Ms Mulcahy's mother, Nicola Foster, said: \"The trust have been untruthful, dismissive, and members of the trust staff, including surgeons, doctors have behaved arrogantly, defensively, as if they are untouchable. <br/>\"Both families will always believe that the deaths of Kim and Sam were because of something they acquired whilst in hospital and we have no reason to believe otherwise.\"<br/>Ms Sampson's mother Yvette said her fight for answers, which has now been going on for five years, has left her unable to grieve properly. <br/>She said: \"It's consumed my life\u2026 It's been emotionally draining. It's changed me as a person. I'm a lot less trusting and still find it hard to comprehend how the hospital trust has acted in the way it has.\"<br/>A spokeswoman for East Kent Hospitals NHS said: \"We would like to express our sincere condolences to the families of Samantha Mulcahy and Kimberley Sampson. We are unable to comment further until the inquest has concluded.\"<br/>In March, the coroner accepted an application from the NHS trust to give anonymity to the surgeon common to both cases.<br/>The surgeon who operated on both women, who could not be named for legal reasons, previously told the hearing his hands were fully scrubbed, double gloved and he was wearing a mask during both procedures. He also said he had no lesions and was not infected but had not been tested for the virus.<br/>Ms Wood adjourned her decision over the anonymity until the hearing on 26 July. <br/>Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

In Athens, the Greek Red Cross has deployed teams to the Acropolis to look after visitors - saying many get nauseous and dizzy due to the heat. <br/>\"That is why with the leaflets we try to inform them where in the municipality of Athens there are places with air condition in order to go inside,\" said Marina Stamati, a representative for the organisation. <br/>Earlier this week, a man in his forties died from the heat after collapsing in northern Italy - while several visitors to the country have collapsed from heatstroke, including a British man outside the Colosseum in Rome. <br/>People have been advised to drink at least two litres of water a day and to avoid coffee and alcohol, which are dehydrating. <br/>Maria and Gloria, two Australian tourists on the streets of Rome, told the BBC they were \"really surprised\" by the heat and that they were trying not to go out in the middle of the day. <br/>Italian tourists Andrea Romano and Michele La Penna told the BBC their hometown of Potenza, in the Apennine mountains, has \"more humane temperatures\" than Rome.<br/>\"We need to start doing something about climate change. We need to be more responsible. The damage is already done. We need to do something about it. But not only the government\u2026 It all starts from people. Each of us needs to do something: use less plastic, don't use the AC, use electric cars,\" said Andrea.<br/>The Cerberus heatwave - named by the Italian Meteorological Society after the three-headed monster that features in Dante's Inferno - is expected to bring more extreme conditions in the next few days. <br/>Spain has been sweltering in temperatures of up to 45C (113F). The Andalusian regional government has started a telephone assistance service for people affected by the heat. <br/>On Thursday, the European Space Agency said temperatures could reach 48C on the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia: \"potentially the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Europe\".<br/>The UK's national weather service, the Met Office, earlier said it expected temperatures to peak on Friday. BBC Weather says large swathes of southern Europe could see temperatures in the low to mid 40s - and possibly higher. <br/>But as Cerberus dies out, Italian weather forecasters are warning that the next heatwave - dubbed Charon after the ferryman who delivered souls into the underworld in Greek mythology - will push temperatures back up towards 43C (109F) in Rome and a possible 47C (116F) on the island of Sardinia.<br/>It isn't just Europe that is hot. <br/>This summer has seen temperature records smashed in parts of Canada and the US as well as across a swathe of Asia including in India and China.<br/>Sea temperatures in the Atlantic have hit record highs while Antarctic sea ice is at the lowest extent ever recorded. <br/>And it is going to get hotter. <br/>A weather pattern called El Ni\u00f1o is developing in the tropical Pacific. It tends to drive up temperatures by around 0.2C on average.  <br/>That may not sound much but add in the roughly 1.1C that climate change has pushed average temperatures up by worldwide and we are nudging perilously close to the 1.5C threshold the world has agreed to try and keep global temperatures below. <br/>Let's set things in a historic context to give us some perspective. <br/>The first week of July is reckoned to have been the hottest week since records began.<br/>But scientists can use the bubbles of air trapped in ancient Antarctic ice to estimate temperatures going back more than a million years.<br/>That data suggests that that last week was the hottest week for some 125,000 years.<br/>It was a geological period known as the Eemian when there were hippopotamuses in the Thames and sea levels were reckoned to be some 5m (16.4ft) higher. <br/>A new study says 61,672 people died in Europe as a result of the heat last year. ISGlobal Institute in Barcelona - which researches global health - said Italy had the most deaths that could be attributable to the heat, with 18,010, while Spain had 11,324 and Germany 8,173.<br/>The fear is that the heat could cause many more deaths this summer. <br/>Cities in Spain with the highest risk of deaths caused by the heat are Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla, M\u00e1laga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca and Bilbao, according to ISGlobal's research.<br/>A heatwave is a period of hot weather where temperatures are higher than is expected for the time of year.<br/>Experts say periods of exceptionally hot weather are becoming more frequent and climate change means it is now normal to experience record-breaking temperatures.  <br/>At present there is no indication the heat in southern Europe will reach the UK any time soon - with the UK remaining in cooler, Atlantic air throughout next week, according to BBC Weather's Darren Bett.<br/>The UK is experiencing a July that has been slightly wetter than normal, with temperatures that feel rather low. But this is mostly in contrast to the weather in the UK in June, which was the warmest on record by a considerable margin - something which, according to the Met Office, bore the \"fingerprint of climate change\".<br/>The new normal - why this summer has been so very hot<br/>Ukraine behind new attack on Crimea bridge - Russian official<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Ambulance workers, nurses, physiotherapists and porters will also get a one-off sum of at least \u00a31,655. <br/>The prime minister ruled out funding the increases through extra borrowing or increasing taxes. <br/>Mr Sunak said pay awards in the education department would be fully funded, but did not set out how this would be achieved.<br/>Schools minister Nick Gibb promised there would be no cuts in \"front-line services\" in schools or colleges.  <br/>Rising prices have prompted industrial action across much of the public sector, with workers calling for pay rises matching or exceeding the rate of inflation which currently stands at 8.7%. <br/>But with the education unions welcoming the government's offer, parents and pupils could see an end to strikes which have impacted schools across England over the past year. <br/>On Thursday, junior doctors in England began a five day walkout, after their calls for a 35% pay increase were rejected.<br/>The government has been resistant to offering above-inflation pay rises warning it would further fuel inflation. <br/>Responding to Mr Sunak's announcement, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"By accepting the pay review body recommendations and then not funding them the government is putting its departments between a rock and hard place - they now have to choose between paying workers a half-decent salary or cutting services in already underfunded public services.\"<br/>TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said union members would take \"comfort\" from the fact that the prime minister had accepted the pay review bodies' recommendations. <br/>\"The question will be - is he able to deliver pay rises in a way that won't have a negative impact on services. Our members will have a long look at that - they won't want to see Peter robbed to pay Paul.<br/>Mr Sunak said his offer was \"final\" and further industrial action would not change that decision, stressing: \"There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year's settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.\"<br/>Speaking at the Unite union's policy conference in Brighton, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the pay offers would be \"subject to negotiation\" and he would \"not wade into that\".<br/>He said there was no \"magic wand that could wave away the need for economic stability\", but added: \"If Labour can not break the suffocating hold of low wages we will have failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Visa application fees and the immigration health surcharge are going up \"significantly\" to raise money, Rishi Sunak says.<br/>Almost half of public sector workers are covered by pay review bodies, including police and prison officers, the armed forces, doctors, dentists and teachers.<br/>The pay review bodies are made up of economists and experts in human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector, and are appointed by the relevant government department.<br/>Their recommendations are not legally binding, meaning the government can choose to reject or partially ignore the advice, but it is usually accepted.<br/>What do you think about the Prime Minister's announcement on public sector pay?

Wegovy is not yet available in the UK - but the prime minister has said GPs in England may soon start offering it to some patients, as well as specialist weight-management clinics.<br/>Ozempic is for people with diabetes to help control blood sugar as well as weight but contains a lower dose of the same medicine, semaglutide, as Wegovy. And with some people without diabetes buying the pre-filled pens to lose weight, there have been continuing global shortages.<br/>All medicines have potential side effects. For weight-loss drugs, which should be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, more common ones include:<br/>Depression or thoughts of suicide is listed in the product-information leaflet, which advises users: \"You should pay attention to any mental changes, especially sudden changes in your mood, behaviours, thoughts, or feelings. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any mental changes that are new, worse, or worry you.\"<br/>Prescribers are also advised to monitor for this. <br/>Manufacturer Novo Nordisk is working with the EMA and says patient safety is a top priority. A representative said: \"GLP-1 receptor agonists have been used to treat type-2 diabetes for more than 15 years and for treatment of obesity for eight years, including Novo Nordisk products such as semaglutide and liraglutide that have been in the UK market since 2018 and 2009 respectively. <br/>\"The safety data collected from large clinical-trial programmes and post-marketing surveillance have not demonstrated a causal association between semaglutide or liraglutide and suicidal and self-harming thoughts. <br/>\"Novo Nordisk is continuously performing surveillance of the data from ongoing clinical trials and real-world use of its products and collaborates closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety and adequate information to healthcare professionals. <br/>\"EMA continuously monitors for safety signals and so does Novo Nordisk. <br/>\"Novo Nordisk remains committed to ensuring patient safety.\"<br/>The UK's drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it was monitoring the situation.<br/>Dr Alison Cave, MHRA Chief Safety Officer, said: \"As part of our close monitoring, any emerging evidence is routinely considered alongside other sources of information, including suspected adverse drug reactions. We will communicate any new advice to healthcare professionals and patients if appropriate.<br/>\"If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm, please seek immediate medical assistance.<br/>\"We ask everyone to report any suspected side effects using our Yellow Card scheme website.\"<br/>If you have been affected by any of these issues, visit BBC Action Line, where you can find support.<br/>GPs set to offer weight-loss jab to reduce obesity<br/>Celebrity weight loss jab to be sold by chemists<br/>Are weight-loss injections the answer to obesity?<br/>European Medicines Agency<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

whose daughter Harriet was stillborn at the trust in 2016 - said the commitment to transparency was \"massive\".<br/>\"It's a bit of a shock to the system to be honest,\" Ms Hawkins said.<br/>\"For seven and a half years we have just been fighting to be heard.<br/>\"So for them to say they are going to take an open and honest approach is incredible really.<br/>\"Whether that happens is yet to be seen but it is certainly a step in the right direction.\"<br/>In a statement, the group representing parents said: \"We welcome today's pledge from the trust for a 'new honest and transparent relationship' with a sense of relief and optimism. <br/>\"For too long we have been fighting to be not just heard, but for action to be taken, and for there to be accountability. <br/>\"We deserve to learn who knew what and when, why it was allowed to continue; and how the trust avoided scrutiny for so long.\"<br/>Ms Ockenden's previous review in Shrewsbury and Telford, which also used the \"opt-out\" approach, included more than 95% of affected families. <br/>The Nottingham trust wrote to 1,377 families at the end of November and the end of January.<br/>The letters went to families who had experienced stillbirth, neonatal deaths, brain damage to the baby, harm to mothers or relatives of mothers who died.<br/>But only 360 families responded to these letters.<br/>In total, 28% of white women contacted responded, while for black and Asian women, the figures were 10% and 5% respectively.<br/>In Nottingham, only about 25% of families known to be affected have been included in the review.<br/>Ms Ockenden said: \"As it stands, with our 674 families who have joined the review, I can't say as the chair we have anywhere near a representative sample of the rich diversity that we know exists in Nottingham.<br/>\"There is significantly more work to do.\"<br/>Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Still, 5% of all Alzheimer's cases are in people under the age of 65.<br/>A much smaller number of people are affected in their 30s and 40s, usually because of a faulty gene passed down the generations.<br/>The only known risk factor for getting Alzheimer's at a young age is if close relatives also had early onset disease, and there is no known way of preventing it.<br/>The early onset form of the disease follows the same inexorable course as it does in older age - it affects memory, thinking skills and behaviour.<br/>Fiona Phillips mentioned she'd lived with months of brain fog before her diagnosis. <br/>Brain fog does not have a medical definition, but it is often used by people to describe a fuzzy head, poor concentration and struggling to think clearly or quickly.<br/>There is no proven way of stopping yourself from getting dementia, but you can tip the odds in your favour. <br/>Research estimates that one in three cases could be prevented by lifestyle changes, including:<br/>It is not completely clear why doing these things can help protect the brain. <br/>Do these lifestyle factors actually stop the process of dementia in the brain? Or do they prepare the brain for dementia by increasing the connections and flexibility of the brain so that, as neurones start to die, the brain can compensate for longer, and symptoms don't emerge?<br/>You can do everything recommended to try to prevent dementia and still develop it, or do nothing and be untouched by it.<br/>Yes, it can be - but that's not the whole story.<br/>Fiona Phillips has described how Alzheimer's \"decimated\" her family - and having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's increases your risk of developing the disease. <br/>But having relatives with the disease does not mean you are fated to develop it, and being in a family untouched by Alzheimer's does not mean you will be spared it either.<br/>She is taking part in trials of a drug called miridesap at University College Hospital in London. This involves injections in her stomach every day for a maximum of 12 months.<br/>The aim of the trial is to find out whether the drug, which removes a protein called SAP (serum amyloid P component) from the brain, can stop amyloid plaques from damaging brain cells.<br/>The researchers think this could be part of the process of the development of Alzheimer's disease. <br/>Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease have been recruited to the DESPIAD trial, which also includes tests on brain function.<br/>Yes.

Humans are increasingly encroaching upon their habitats, adding to the risk of new pandemics, so scientists are studying bats for any clues about how to prevent any new outbreaks.<br/>Dusk is the witching hour at Accra Zoo. It is the time that the captive colony of straw-coloured fruit bats begin to stir and the best time they can be tested for different pathogens. <br/>A team of scientists from the University of Ghana's veterinary school is here to analyse the bat droppings, or guano. <br/>They are involved in an international effort to predict the next pandemic and even in the extreme heat of Ghana's rainy season, they dress up in full PPE. They enter the enclosure and spread a white tarpaulin out on the ground.<br/>Lead scientist Dr Richard Suu-ire has studied bats for many years. He explains that PPE is needed \"to protect you from any infection you may pick up within the cage but also to protect the bats from getting anything from us. So it's protection both ways.\"<br/>Much remains a mystery about these animals - the only mammals that fly - and their extraordinary immune systems. Somehow bats can carry many viruses but don't seem to get sick themselves. <br/>Ghana has joined countries like Bangladesh and Australia as part of a global project called Bat OneHealth, which investigates how pathogens are transmitted from one species to another and what can be done to prevent so-called spillover events.<br/>In light of the Covid pandemic, the bat-borne viruses being focused on in this research include coronaviruses.<br/>Warning: This article contains a picture of dead animals which some people may find upsetting<br/>Dr Suu-ire explains that they are testing for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses in the bats. In humans, these viruses are more familiarly experienced as illnesses such as mumps, measles and respiratory tract infections. <br/>He describes the bats as \"reservoirs\" because they carry the infection without getting sick themselves.<br/>\"So we want to monitor and see what is going on.\"<br/>He says when they worked with the wild bat populations they did not detect Covid-19.<br/>Today, his team is also testing for superbugs in the bat droppings. The scientists have fed the bats pawpaw fruit and, once the bats have defecated on the tarpaulin, they take swabs of the bright orange droppings and store them in test tubes. <br/>The University of Ghana has been at the forefront of this new area of research, with this project being the first of its kind. However, there are still many gaps in scientific understanding. <br/>Ultimately, what they are trying to find out is whether there is any bacteria in the bat faeces which is resistant to antibiotics. <br/>Dr Suu-ire says: \"If there's any resistance we will then find out to which antibiotics they are developing resistance. In future we will try to isolate the resistant genes from these bacteria.\"<br/>This is not the only bat research going on at the University of Ghana. <br/>In the undergrowth of the university's botanical gardens, Dr Kofi Amponsah-Mensah is setting up a high green net, almost as if he is ready for a night-time game of badminton. <br/>These nets allow him to catch some bats temporarily which he then examines, measures and finally releases back into the wild. As an ecologist, he worries about how humans are increasingly encroaching into bat habitats.<br/>He points out that deforestation rates in Ghana are high, with a lot of mining destroying vegetation which is the bats' natural habitat. <br/>\"I think we are just using bats as scapegoats for areas where we have failed as people, because historically we didn't have a lot of these diseases emerging,\" he says.<br/>\"We are the ones encroaching into the bats' [habitat], you know, and messing around with the ecosystem. This obviously leads to more contact and then the likelihood of some of these diseases coming up.\"<br/>Any discussion of how humans interact with bats inevitably leads to the topic of bushmeat.  <br/>All kinds of animals are on sale at a bushmeat market down a disused railway line in central Accra. These markets are a pinch-point where wild animals, like bats, come into contact with people. This creates a risk these scientists want to get ahead of.<br/>It is certainly not a place for the faint-hearted. There are large rodent-type animals called grass cutters with long tails, and dead antelopes with their throats slashed - signs of the various ways in which they were hunted in the wild.<br/>The heat in the market is overwhelming as many of the women who work here are cooking on open stoves. In the corner of one stall, we see what looks like a saucepan lid full of shrivelled, straw-coloured fruit bats. According to Dr Amponsah-Mensah, they have been singed on a fire to remove the hair. <br/>Following the Covid pandemic, some experts have called for the banning of markets like these in case they help spread the viruses. Although Dr Amponsah-Mensah says he would not choose to eat bat himself, he feels conflicted about a total ban.<br/>He says that the trade in bushmeat is something that has been going on for thousands of years and that it's entrenched in people's cultures and histories, with many people preferring to eat bushmeat rather than beef or chicken. <br/>\"The trade is dominated mostly by women and for a lot of them, this is the only trade they know because it's been handed down from their grandparents to their mothers, and now they are in the trade as well,\" he says.<br/>\"So any attempt to ban bushmeat without really thinking about the complexity of the trade will really have serious implications.\" <br/>At the sterile high-security labs at the Noguchi Institute for Medical Research on the University of Ghana's campus, bat droppings from Accra Zoo will be analysed by Associate Professor of Virology Kofi Bonney. <br/>As he punches a secret code into an electronic keypad, he explains that these labs have negative air pressure to prevent any pathogens escaping.<br/>Since the pandemic, Prof Bonney and his team have found themselves busier than ever in the global effort to get ahead of any future virus outbreaks.<br/>Prof Bonney explains the growing relevance of the Bat OneHealth project: \"We should have the environment working together with the animals' sector and the human sector. We must set up systems that will pick up some of these viruses very early so that we can curtail the spread.<br/>\"Otherwise, once a virus inhabits the human system, it keeps circulating and there is a high tendency for the virus to change. As they change, they can develop the ability to become a more severe disease. So the best thing is for us to develop systems that can pick them up early.\"<br/>Experts worry that the frequency of zoonotic spillovers will increase with climate change. Humans and animals will be forced into ever closer contact as they both vie for resources such as water and even shade from the sun. <br/>Bats are already the focus of billions of dollars-worth of research - partly because of their unusual immune systems but also because they can fly such long distances. Understanding them better, as they are trying to do in Ghana, will be crucial to the planet's health.<br/>Bat scientists find new coronavirus evidence<br/>Infectious coronaviruses 'were in bats for decades'<br/>University of Ghana<br/>BatOneHealth<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But despite the prime minister's pledge there are still many questions.<br/>That answer is yes for recruitment, though with a caveat.  <br/>The plan is funded for the first five years but for 10 years after that there is an assumption that future governments will find the money to keep up with the required growth in training places. <br/>It is hard to believe a new administration would dilute NHS workforce growth and the training of thousands more doctors and nurses. <br/>But, never say never when it comes to public finances.  <br/>Expanding the number of clinical staff to the extent which is envisaged in the plan will eventually have a positive impact for patients - but retention will be a bigger ask. <br/>The plan's policies to improve morale and hang on to staff look a little vague. Recruitment will not achieve much if there is a continued exodus at the same rate as now.<br/>Recruit and retain have long been held up as the required twin-track approach for the NHS. <br/>Health think tanks and charities were queueing up to welcome the plan as it had adopted the policies called for by most experts.  <br/>Then again the enthusiasm must in part have been relief that at long last there was an NHS workforce plan after nothing comparable in the previous two decades. <br/>Modelling of future patient demand seems reasonable and health think tanks were invited to kick the tyres of the numbers. <br/>Productivity assumptions were included. Some of the medical Royal Colleges have noted the plan is ambitious and they want to see more detail.<br/>The idea of medical apprenticeships is radical with staff in other NHS jobs training to be doctors. <br/>But, the precise workings of this scheme will need time to work out.<br/>Pay is certainly the elephant in the room.  <br/>Most large organisations drawing up a workforce plan would have a section on appropriate remuneration to attract and motivate the best staff.  <br/>That is one thing NHS England can't do with its strategy. <br/>NHS pay is the preserve of the government and it is ministers who decide. Most of the NHS pay disputes have been settled but the doctors' campaign is far from over with further strikes planned. <br/>Health unions have long argued that the best way to hold on to staff is to raise wages at a time of acute cost of living pressures.  <br/>Senior management have had to stand on the side-lines of the argument and cope with the consequences of walkouts.<br/>In the short-term - no, when it comes to raising the number of doctors, nurses and other health staff.  <br/>It takes several years to train clinical professionals and the expansion of new places at medical schools and universities won't begin until the autumn of 2024. <br/>Implementation may be slowed if there are not enough experienced doctors and nurses to set aside time to run the training.<br/>Retention initiatives aimed at reducing the number of NHS staff quitting might make a bit of a difference over the next year or so. <br/>But, patients currently frustrated at not getting a GP appointment or are on a long waiting list for an operation probably won't notice.<br/>Planning the training of tens of thousands of health staff right through till beyond 2030 is admirable. <br/>There has been nothing comparable in recent years with only sporadic time-limited initiatives. <br/>But, what will the rest of the NHS look line by then? Will the service have kept up with the increasing burden of sickness linked to an ageing population? <br/>Will the public be willing to keep funding the NHS through taxation? Might payment for some services have been introduced? How much difference will technology and AI make? <br/>There is no long-term plan for investment in buildings and IT - in other words the hospitals and clinics where the new staff will work and the computers they will use. <br/>Perhaps the publication of a multi-year workforce plan will spur politicians to come up with broader strategies for health funding and reform over a decade or more.  <br/>But don't hold your breath.<br/>The NHS backlog: Who are the 7 million?<br/>NHS staff sickness hits record high in England<br/>NHS misses targets to tackle care backlogs<br/>NHS in England facing worst staffing crisis, MPs warn<br/>Ministers set out plan to train and keep more NHS staff<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

with death rates below historical averages. <br/>In the third year, death rates rose in many countries as they opened up again.<br/>Some of the largest rebounds we found were in countries like Germany, New Zealand and Norway, who had fared better in the first two years of the pandemic (and well overall). <br/>Norway had far fewer deaths than Sweden in the first year of the pandemic but over the three years the two countries look more similar. <br/>It is hard to read straight across from Scandinavian countries to the UK, cautions Prof Sridhar, arguing \"we'd never look like either Sweden or Norway\", and describing them as \"healthier, wealthier and more equal\" countries that are very different to the UK.  <br/>It would take many inquiries to tease apart the effect of all the possible reasons behind every nation's pandemic outcomes: preparedness, population health, lockdown timing and severity, social support, vaccine rollout and health care provision and others. <br/>But some argue that there are lessons for the UK that need to be learned even before we think about future pandemics. <br/>The UK's heavy pandemic death toll \"built on a decade of lacklustre performance on life expectancy\" says Veena Raleigh, of the King's Fund, a health think tank. She argues that government action to improve population health and turn that around has \"never been more urgent\".<br/>We collected data on deaths in five-year age groups and population estimates/projections from Eurostat, the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland, the Northern Ireland Statistics Research Agency, the Centre for Disease Control, United States Census Bureau and Stats NZ. <br/>We calculated the death rate in each age group and combined them to form an age-adjusted death rate using the 2013 European Standard Population. <br/>Some nations did not have the full set of age bands. For example, US figures used 10-year age bands between five and 24 and above 55. Broader age bands can exaggerate excess mortality figures like the ones we calculated, in the order of a percentage point.<br/>Additional journalism by Callum Thomson, Isabella Worth, Jana Tauschinski, Liana Bravo and Wesley Stephenson <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

But vaping's helped millions of people to ditch traditional cigarettes.<br/>It's widely considered less harmful than smoking tobacco - and the UK government endorses vapes as a quitting aid.<br/>But what do you do when you want to take the next step and quit completely?<br/>The main reason vaping gets you hooked is nicotine - the same ingredient that makes smokers crave cigarettes.<br/>It's thought to be pretty harmless on its own, but is powerfully addictive. That's why vaping isn't recommended for non-smokers.<br/>Nicotine creates new receptors in the brain when it enters the body, and you quickly come to associate it with feeling good.<br/>So when you stop getting it you'll feel cravings. These tend to be worse in the first three to four days after your last dose.<br/>According to the NHS, other withdrawal symptoms, like bad moods, are likely in the early stages of quitting.<br/>There's no firm answer to this - it varies for each person - but there are some things we do know.<br/>It's technically possible to go \"cold turkey\" and suddenly stop vaping. But most people find this very difficult.<br/>Experts, such as the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT), generally recommend some sort of gradual approach.<br/>One tip for vapers is to reduce the nicotine strength of their e-liquid in two to four-week stages, working down to 0% solutions.<br/>This can be trickier with disposable vapes, which tend to come in higher strengths.<br/>But zero-nicotine versions are available, and the NCSCT says using one alongside your regular vape can help.<br/>Failing that, a temporary switch to a tank-style vape, giving you access to different e-liquids, might be better. <br/>Other reduction strategies include:<br/>Another option is Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - patches, gum and sprays used instead of a vape.<br/>Nicotine pouches that go between the gum and lip are starting to appear on some shop shelves but these aren't currently recommended by the NHS.<br/>Like smoking, if you've been vaping a long time you're likely to have formed habits around it.<br/>Certain situations or times of day - triggers - will have got you used to reaching for your vape. <br/>This can be hard to snap out of, so it can help to figure out what they are.<br/>It's also a good idea to try and fill this time with something else to distract you, like exercise.<br/>If you are a former smoker, the NCSCT says it's worth keeping a vape on hand for emergencies.<br/>Because, if you do relapse, it's better than reaching for a cigarette.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>Free vapes to be handed out in anti-smoking drive<br/>Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Personally, everyone gave their all but the system was not fit for purpose, was it?\"<br/>Mr Hancock replied: \"That's absolutely right.\"<br/>The former health secretary added: \"I bear responsibility for all the things that happened, not only in my department, but also the agencies that reported to me as secretary of state.\"<br/>The inquiry also heard from the former health secretary that medicines for intensive care were \"within hours\" of running out at the peak of the pandemic. <br/>He added that the only reason they did not was because of work done in 2019 in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.<br/>Mr Hancock said he had to overrule initial advice not to quarantine people being brought back from Wuhan early in the pandemic, and that everybody in the Western world missed that lockdowns would be necessary.<br/>He also criticised the World Health Organization (WHO) for giving advice which \"stated that we should not have lockdowns\".<br/>He said it was \"madness\" but he had to \"overrule\" initial advice not to quarantine people coming in from China. <br/>He also blamed the WHO for having \"written into the international health regulations that you shouldn't close borders\".<br/>Because there was \"no such thing\" as mass contact tracing systems as the pandemic took hold, Mr Hancock said the inability to test people in large numbers was \"terrible\".<br/>He also used the word terrible to describe the government having no idea whether care homes had the right protections in place. <br/>He said the government didn't even know how many care home residents there were at the start of the pandemic.<br/>However, he said the responsibility for ensuring the social care sector was prepared for a pandemic fell to local authorities, and he \"didn't have the levers to act\". <br/>The former health secretary was also repeatedly asked about the recommendations from Exercise Cygnus, a three-day test run in October 2016 to find out how prepared the UK was for a influenza pandemic. <br/>It concluded that the UK's plan was not sufficient to \"cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic\".<br/>The inquiry has seen evidence that only eight of the 22 recommendations made after that exercise had been fully addressed by the time Covid hit, with work on the other 14, including preparing the social care sector, still ongoing. <br/>He described Exercise Cygnus as \"flawed in its central assumption\" that a pandemic was a disaster that needed to be \"cleaned up\" rather than something that needed to be stopped or contained in the first place. <br/>He said: \"The doctrinal flaw was the biggest by a long way because if we'd had a flu pandemic, we still would have had the problem of no plan in place for lockdown, no prep for how to do one, no work on what, how best to lock down with the least damage.<br/>\"I understand deeply the consequences of lockdown and the negative consequences for many, many people - many of which persist to this day.\"<br/>Mr Hancock said that some of that work on the Exercise Cygnus had been paused because of the need to prepare the country for a no-deal Brexit. <br/>But he said that he was \"not convinced\" that, even if all those recommendations had been addressed, the country would have been in a better place to deal with Covid. <br/>As a result, the UK was \"better prepared in terms of supply chains,\" but the \"overall impact\" was hard to judge.<br/>\"I'm afraid it's impossible to know,\" he added. <br/>When Mr Hancock first arrived at the inquiry, a widow showed him images of her husband, who died from Covid.<br/>Lorelei King, 69, was holding two A4 posters, which she showed to the former health secretary as he stepped out of a black Jaguar.<br/>One poster displayed an image of Mr Hancock with Mrs King's husband, Vincent Marzello, who died in a care home in March 2020, aged 72.<br/>\"You shook my husband's hand for your photo op,\" the photo was captioned. The other picture showed Mr Marzello's coffin.<br/>Mr Hancock didn't respond as he walked in to the building.<br/>Mrs King told journalists: \"Care homes became charnel houses because there was no testing, there was insufficient PPE, but, most disastrously, it's because they discharged people from hospitals without testing them.\"<br/>She called on Mr Hancock to \"tell the truth\" to the inquiry, adding: \"The bereaved families deserve that much.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-medical officer close to tears over Covid deaths<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

and asked for the protocol to be changed.<br/>He added that he didn't feel comfortable that someone \"a long way from front line\" could make such a decision, which would be better made by people closer to the situation on the ground, he added. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

He is due to give evidence on Thursday along with Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic.  <br/>At the same hearing, George Osborne said his spending cuts meant the UK was better able to cope with the pandemic. <br/>The former chancellor argued that without austerity Britain would have been \"more exposed\" and rejected claims his approach left the health and social care \"depleted\" ahead of the Covid pandemic. <br/>Last week Sir Michael Marmot, a professor of epidemiology at University College London told the inquiry that the UK had entered the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services. <br/>Asked by inquiry lawyer Kate Blackwell KC if he agreed with the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"Most certainly not, I completely reject that.\"<br/>He accepted more money could have been spent on the NHS, but said as chancellor he had to balance demands for resources from other public services.<br/>\"You can't just say we like public spending to be higher without explaining where you get money from,\" he told the inquiry.<br/>He said the public had elected the Conservatives to government in 2010 and 2015 knowing the party was planning to cut public spending. <br/>During the period, cuts were introduced in welfare spending, school building programs, local government, police, courts and prisons. There was also an overall squeeze on health spending. <br/>Mr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.<br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\" <br/>The British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\". <br/>On Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid. <br/>During the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown. <br/>He said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".<br/>\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.<br/>\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans. <br/>\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"<br/>Earlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics. <br/>He also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.<br/>Labour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-PM Cameron admits mistake over pandemic planning<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Covid inquiry criticises government evidence<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

it was something bigger than that,\" Mr Whitworth said.<br/>And by end of January, people in public health had been very clear it had been \"an impending wave that was coming to UK\".<br/>\"For those of us who had memories of Sars, the parallels were something that gave us shivers\", Mr Whitworth added.<br/>Asked about the dangers of a virus being leaked, deliberately or accidentally, from a laboratory, Cambridge University fellow in emerging infectious diseases Dr Charlotte Hammer said she was aware of four incidents involving the Sars virus. <br/>But when it came to controlling an outbreak once it had started to infect thousands of people, the virus's origins mattered \"very little\".<br/>What is the UK Covid-19 inquiry?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss, in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe, in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered -

where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me. He suggests that Donald Trump, who has indulged in conspiracy theories across a range of other issues, may in fact have been right to question this narrative. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"I mean, yes, you do have conspiracy theories. But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab? No.\"<br/>Some experts hope that Congress may now be able to uncover new information.  <br/>US scientists have collaborated closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there may yet be data held by government agencies or research archives that could prove useful.  <br/>Meanwhile the Chinese government of course pushes back at any and all suggestions that the virus came from China - via a market or a lab.  <br/>My own attempts to examine those possibilities led, at least in part, to my forcible departure from the country, under threat of legal action by the authorities in 2021.  <br/>State media accused me of \"stigmatising China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus\" and of having \"maliciously incited hostility from the international community to China.\" <br/>The question of Covid's origin is likely to remain shrouded in bitterness, acrimony and politics in both Washington and Beijing.<br/>The lack of information is both why President Biden ordered his intelligence agencies in 2021 to use \"every tool\" to look again for answers, and also why they're finding them so hard to come by. <br/>John's podcast on the hunt for the origin of Covid is coming soon on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4<br/>Covid origin likely China lab incident - FBI chief<br/>Covid origin studies say evidence points to market<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said. <br/>He added that the decision had been considered carefully for some time and made on the basis of careful analysis of data.<br/>But he warned the removal of the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. <br/>\"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.<br/>The World Health Organization first declared Covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in January 2020. <br/>This signalled the need for coordinated global action to protect people from the new virus. <br/>It will now be up to individual countries to continue to manage Covid in the way they think best.<br/>Vaccines were one of the major turning points in the pandemic. According to the WHO, 13 billion doses have been given, allowing many people to be protected from serious illness and death. <br/>But in many countries vaccines have not reached most of those in need. <br/>More than 765 million confirmed Covid infections have been recorded worldwide.<br/>The US and UK, like many other countries, have already talked about \"living with the virus\" and wound down many of the tests and social mixing rules. <br/>Dr Mike Ryan, from the WHO's health emergencies programme, said the emergency may have ended, but the threat is still there. <br/>\"We fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit and this is the history of pandemics,\" he said.<br/>\"It took decades for the final throes of the pandemic virus of 1918 to disappear. <br/>\"In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins.\"<br/>US to end Covid vaccine air travel requirements<br/>Covid whistleblower returns home to Wuhan after jail<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>\n                        Percent of people fully vaccinated\n                    <br/>\n                            Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive\n                        <br/>\n                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas.

Instead, people are reporting more cold and flu-like symptoms. <br/>They looked at original Omicron - known as BA.1 and BA.2 - that was spreading in March 2022. <br/>Since then, two fast-spreading new subvariants of Omicron called BA.4 and BA.5 have dominated, causing more new infections. <br/>An estimated 2.7 million people in the UK, or one in 25, are thought to have Covid. <br/>Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Zoe Health Study, said: \"Covid is still rampant in the population. <br/>\"Even if people have had a past infection and are fully vaccinated, people are still catching it. <br/>\"Although we all want to make the most of the good weather, people will need to decide for themselves whether going to large events, working from the office or using busy public transport is worth the risk.\"<br/>Both the Zoe study and the React-1 study had been funded by the government until recently. <br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron: How worried should we be?<br/>Covid infections hit 2.7 million in UK<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. <br/>If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. <br/>The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. <br/>How many people have had boosters so far?<br/>Covid map: Where are cases the highest?<br/>Russia blames new Crimea bridge attack on Ukraine<br/>Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US<br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>A simple guide to help you understand AI<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Nigeria's 'tax collectors': Menacing and mafia-like<br/>The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry<br/>The surprising truth behind the 'walking' statues of Easter Island.
