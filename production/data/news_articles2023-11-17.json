But if they aren't convinced of a government's creditworthiness, or if they are concerned its plans are risky, the interest rate they charge for that funding will go up. So governments want to convince them to lend at affordable rates. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "To do that the UK government sets some rules for themselves called fiscal rules. These rules currently include getting the annual deficit down to less than the equivalent of 3% of national income (or GDP) within five years. And secondly making sure that by then, the total debt amassed over the years is falling when measured as a proportion of GDP."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Breaching such rules can be costly: the big giveaway in Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-Budget of September 2022 led to a surge in borrowing rates (which also swelled mortgage rates). That's because of market concerns about the implications for inflation and the amount the government would have to borrow."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The fiscal rules are self-imposed, but it's the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that assesses if the government is meeting those rules. It produces two forecasts a year of how the economy might perform, based on technical models and assumptions about what will happen to things like energy prices for example."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Those models are used to predict what will happen to government finances. Forecasts are a best stab at what might happen in, what has of late been a particularly, uncertain world."}, {"type": "text", "text": "They'll differ from other economists' forecasts - but it's the OBR's ones that matter when it comes to assessing the government's projected finances in relation to the rules. A projected shortfall is often referred to as a black hole, any wiggle room is called headroom."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As Jeremy Hunt says higher interest rates have been deployed by the Bank of England to fight the recent stubborn bout of inflation. And that has vastly bumped up the government's borrowing costs. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "But higher inflation has also delivered the chancellor a boost in revenues from things like VAT and income tax. VAT is a percentage of an item's value, so when things go up in price, the government gets more tax."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Also as prices rise, there's pressure to put up wages, then workers get dragged into higher tax brackets - known as fiscal drag - which means the government collects more income tax. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "So economists reckon the chancellor could have over £10bn of headroom. But what matters is what the OBR thinks - and even headroom of this size would mean this chancellor has far less to 'play' with then many of his predecessors in relation to his rules. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Whether and how the government meets its rules, how it uses headroom, depends on its policy choices, the tax and spending plans aligned with its political priorities, as well as on how the economy is performing. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Those choices mean there are trade-offs, winners and losers. So it's not a case of the chancellor unable to 'afford' to do something or that he 'must' adopt a particular policy. For example, if he wanted to extend the freeze in fuel duty that would cost £4bn (as the OBR is obliged to assume that duty rises annually). If he didn't have headroom, he could offset that by raising taxes elsewhere or squeezing spending. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Even if the OBR agrees the chancellor has several billions of pounds of headroom, he may not opt to splash it right now. There is after all, a general election looming - and likely a spring Budget beforehand."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It might be considered more politically advantageous to dole out sweeteners to voters then. Moreover, if the economy suffers an unexpectedly sharp downturn in the meantime, that could wipe out some of that headroom - potentially leaving the chancellor in the embarrassing position of having to claw back cash to meet his rules."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Or, come the spring, there could actually be more headroom; which he may well choose to use up rather than leave as a generous gift to whoever is chancellor following the election. So instead, this Autumn Statement may focus on the key terms and longer-term measures, such as levelling up, boosting the supply of workers, tackling growth, that the government wants to use to frame its election strategy."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So a pre-Christmas spree seems unlikely, regardless of your wishlist.

As the food writer Fuchsia Dunlop explains in Invitation to a Banquet, sugar in Chinese cuisine is used 'as a general seasoning, like soy sauce and vinegar, perhaps to 'harmonise the flavour' of a stew or balance a sweet-and-sour dressing'. This was its role, too, along with other precious spices, in medieval England. In sweet and sour meat dishes a little sugar and raisins, spices and pepper set off the astringency of wine or vinegar; 'tart de bry'' (medieval brie tart) was seasoned with ginger, sugar, saffron and salt, whereas dishes of quince or cherry often relied on the fruit's natural sweetness alone. Later, as sugar imports from north Africa grew, so did sweet treats – suckets, marchpanes, breath-freshening confits – but only for wealthy adults such as the notoriously black-toothed Elizabeth I. These status symbols were far too costly to waste on children or workers."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Historians of sugar, beginning with Sidney Mintz's landmark 1980s study Sweetness and Power, have noticed that the way children and nations become addicted to sugar follows similar paths.

On the other hand, there have been plenty of appalled warnings about the health risks to children at home and the moral peril of enslaving people to produce sugar abroad. How, then, did the business of sugar come to exert so strong a hold on us all?"}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the early 17th century, when England asserted its colonial heft across what became known as the Sugar Islands of the Caribbean, it began to ship semi-processed sugar cane back to the British Isles as part of the shameful triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa and the Americas. Sugar became central to England's political project; a public-private partnership to support planters and augment wealth at home and power abroad. As supply and strategic importance increased, its supporters set out to change its image from an unhealthy but occasional treat to a food in its own right. Unlike the high-status treats of the previous centuries, this new 'food' was deemed particularly appropriate for the weakest members of the household – children and women."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Just as the food industry today commissions, funds or promotes 'research' that conveniently shows, for example, that ultra-processed foods are healthy, a similar fight began in the early 18th century. Doctors began to be anxious about how this increasingly consumed substance related to overeating and diabetes. We do not know if the physician Frederick Slare was paid by the sugar lobby, but the modus operandi of his A Vindication of Sugars (1715) is now wearily familiar: refute observations as 'common prejudices' and counter them with fake science. Sugar doesn't rot children's teeth, Slare said: to prove it, he rubbed his own teeth and gums with it for a few days. You only have to watch an infant greedily sucking down a sweetened pap (water mixed with flour or breadcrumbs) and making faces at the unsweetened one, he added, to know that it was a natural taste. Slare dedicated his book 'To the Ladies', who were (so he and many after him assumed), along with children, sugar's natural allies."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Further proof, for Slare, of sugar's health-giving virtues was that it made people very rich. The 'West Indian merchant' and others of lowly background brought home their new wealth, enriching the country as they 'purchas'd and do daily purchase great Estates', while the Grocer and his family would welcome his intervention, he argued, because sugar had made them 'rich and wealthy'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This was a foundational virtue for those men of letters (and occasionally women) who started to share new ideas through books on science, farming, economics, politics, gardening and cooking. They began to frame food production (principally beef and sugar) in terms of what the nation needed for its wealth, not what the body needed for its health. The ancient axiom that food was medicine started to be dismantled. Today this is made conspicuous by the number of medicines that are being prescribed to counteract the ill-health caused our high-sugar diet, the latest being drugs such as Ozempic."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As sugar imports trebled in the last decades of the 17th century and the prices fell, liberal thinkers struggled to reconcile children's appetites for new confits, cakes and sugary infant formula with the morally troubling origins of 'slave-grown sugar'. While John Locke rather feebly decided to 'leave that to the ladies', and Jean-Jacques Rousseau insisted that the duty of wives and daughters was to be sweetly subservient, Mary Wollstonecraft denounced the vicious triangle between the substance and what it stood for: slavery in the plantations and despotism in the domestic home. 'Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood? Is one half of the human species, like the poor African slaves, to be subject to prejudices that brutalise them?' she demanded in A Vindication of the Rights of Women."}, {"type": "text", "text": "What was the government's role? Beginning with the Royal African Company, established in 1660 by the Stuart royal family and London merchants to capture, enslave and sell people from West Africa to the Caribbean, Britain's ruling bodies have been heavily involved in the sugar trade. The governments of Britain's growing empire aimed to keep the powerful plantation owners on side. As Eric Williams famously argued, the slave trade (in 1807) and slavery within the British Empire (in 1834) were only abolished once the economic might of the sugar barons began to wane, thanks to the growing availability of alternative sources of sugar. Successive governments maintained the flow of cheap sugar into the country by a combination of taxation, subsidies, tariffs and international trade agreements. The sugar tax was repealed in 1874, partly due to a campaign (by sugar merchants among others) that the poor should fully benefit. This Victorian free-trade argument for sugar as a necessary food went unchallenged until the minor provocation of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy in 2018. Sugar was the fossil fuel of its day, oiling and speeding up the wheels of daily life until it became indispensable to the nation."}, {"type": "text", "text": "There was one key difference: our early adoption of fossil fuels did not come with the kind of moral and health warnings that sugar did. Abolitionists encouraged purchasers, particularly women, to boycott slave-grown sugar and children to abjure it. There was also a strong medical resistance to giving children any kind of sugar. The Northampton physician James Hart warned as early as 1633 that they must be protected from a substance that 'heateth the blood', 'rotteth the teeth' and caused bad breath. As for babies, Dr William Buchan noted in his groundbreaking 1769 book, Domestic Medicine: 'It entices them to take more than they ought to do, which makes them grow fat and bloated. It is pretty certain, if the food of children were quite plain, that they would never take more than enough.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "But, 'taking more than enough' was a necessary prerequisite for the economic health of the sugar barons and the refineries on British soil.

A new market was needed. Two 20th-century parallels suggest that markets can, indeed, be deliberately engineered. Fried chicken shops were designed to start shifting the extra meat suddenly available when an American businessman discovered that he could separate chickens into egg-layers and meat-producers in intensive battery farming methods. And the policy of free school milk in Britain's schools was initially designed to take care of the excess production once the Milk Marketing Boards established price guarantees in the 1930s."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Britain's rural poor traditionally survived on bread, cheese, oatmeal and beans, resorting to what were called 'bread riots' (but were closer to price-fixing negotiations) when these became exorbitant. From the early 19th century this began to change. As the English peasantry moved to industrial cities, the price of sugar fell, becoming affordable for the working poor. Hot, sweet tea turned a dull cold meal into a stimulating warm one; cheap jam and molasses or syrup on bread became the new staple. Breastfeeding for the poor began to decline as women had to swap cottage industry for factory work, and children fed on sweetened paps readily took to low-cost, instant highs."}, {"type": "text", "text": "After Buchan's death, his editor changed the advice of Domestic Medicine to recommend 'a little moist sugar' to sweeten the pap advised for babies. Henri Nestlé's instant baby formula of dried cow's milk, processed wheat flour and sugar, launched in 1867, found a ready market in Britain; Mrs Beeton advised sweetening 'farinaceous' (starchy) baby food. The idea that sweetened milk is good for both babies and commerce lives on today in the sickly milky liquids or semi-liquids such as fruit yoghurt and fromage frais marketed at the very young."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The notion of sugar as a treat or prop for women and children found a new rationale in poorer working families where protein (a kipper, a boiled egg, some bacon) was saved for the male breadwinner of the house. As treacle on porridge or cheap jam on bread, it helped these less palatable carbs slip down more easily. It plays the same role in ultra-processed food today, in which carbohydrates such as breakfast cereals or burger buns are loaded up with added sugars. Whole families kept going with sweetened tea. By the mid 19th century the nation was largely addicted to sugar; its economy ran on the people who ran on its empty calories."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Just before the first world war, Seebohm Rowntree and May Kendall interviewed working-class families about how they got by. Mrs Bell in Berkshire told them why she disapproved of jam for her six children. 'If they eat jam, it includes more bread – they eat more! If I cut a slice of bread and put margarine on it, maybe two slices will do; but if I put jam on it, it'll be: 'Mummy, give me another slice.' That's my conclusion about jam.' Like Dr Buchan before her, Mrs Bell was on to something. Sugar makes you eat more."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As with any addictive drug, the more sugar you consume, the more you want. We crave the sugar high – the dopamine hit. The marriage of caffeine and sugar is blessed by manufacturers because the bitterness of caffeine (in cola, chocolate or coffee, for example) masks the sweetness of the sugar. Manufacturers can smuggle more sugar past our taste receptors, to give an outsized sugar rush, which we want to return to again and again. Taste the feeling, as Coca-Cola says, with no irony whatsoever."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The second part to the mechanics of overconsumption is that the more you eat the more inured you become to its sweetness. Give sugar up for a few days, then have a few biscuits from a packet and it is likely that they will just taste … sweet. Once you stop being desensitised, the sweetness will dominate any other taste."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Whether by deliberate design or unforeseen consequence, over hundreds of years the sugar lobby has engineered a British – and American – palate that is hooked on the taste for sugar, a pattern that is being repeated throughout the world.

Much of the sugar we overconsume today is in the form of glucose (also called dextrose), maltose, fructose, corn syrup, all of which have been developed to hit that 'sweet spot' efficiently and cheaply. These form one of the three pillars of ultra-processed food, which depends on sugar's addictive qualities to drive consumers to eat more calories than they need – 500 per day more, according to an oft-quoted experiment."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Nor is there much doubt about the effectiveness of the social engineering that advertisers use to push sugar laden-products through television and social media advertising, product placement, packaging, or sponsored events. As most carers will be only too aware, much of this bombardment is aimed at children.

In which case he allowed Suella Braverman to continue stoking division and hatred before last Saturday's pro-Palestinian march. Not something I would want to boast about. But the resurrection of Big Dave was certainly a surprise. Not least because it rather implied that Sunak had searched through his database of 350 Conservative MPs and not found one capable of being foreign secretary. Cameron is having to be speedily elevated to the Lords to accommodate him in the cabinet. We don't yet know if he will have to pass the Lords appointment commission; if so, he may struggle to explain his involvement in the Greensill lobbying scandal. His return is being heralded as a win for the blue-wall centrist wing of the party – if by that, you mean the posh boys. Cameron was the architect of austerity and tax cuts for the rich. Not that centrist. His foreign policy may also be out of line with Sunak. He wanted to stay in the EU and he's a committed Sinophile. Still, Big Dave never held any position too tightly. That was part of his careless schtick. Let's just hope he doesn't go round the world suggesting a referendum in the Middle East. That would be bound to prolong the conflict.

The loss to Chelsea was almost heroic. Having gone 1-0 up early in the game, we then managed to have two players sent off and lost our best defender and midfielder to injury. I was following the Wolves game on the train on my way back from the wonderful Bridport literary festival. This game was more tragedy. Having been 1-0 up we looked like holding on for a bounceback win, only to concede twice in injury time. That was the sort of heartbreak we were inflicting on other teams earlier in the season. Weirdly though, the main feeling among my friends on Spurs chat groups is relief. The bad thing that we had all known was going to happen has now happened and we're through the other side.

I did watch several episodes last year – I got hooked in by having to write about Matt Hancock's ritual self-humiliation – but I suspect I'm not really the target market. This year Nigel Farage has been paid a reported £1.5m for his pre-Christmas stretch in the Australian jungle. Reality TV shows are a well-trodden route for desperate politicians to trouser some cash as they try to revive their public image. But it seldom if ever works. Did anyone say to themselves, 'That George Galloway, he's much nicer than I thought' after he appeared on Big Brother? Definitely not. If anything Galloway made himself ever more dislikable. Same with Edwina Currie, Nadine Dorries and Ann Widdecombe. All of whom appeared even weirder than imagined. As if all politicians are uniquely out of touch. Hancock most of all. The entitled, pompous neediness was hard to take. But Farage clearly thinks he can buck the trend. That his 'man of the people casual racism' will make him a hero to millions of viewers. That he will come back a TV legend who will be welcomed back into the Tory party as it lurches further to the right. And if it doesn't then at least he's got enough dosh to sort out a new bank account. But shame on ITV for giving him the money and shame on ITV for giving a platform to such a divisive political figure on one of its highest-rated evening entertainment shows. Where the extreme can be normalised. Obviously the best thing you could do would be to give the show a swerve this year. Hit ITV where it hurts most. In the ratings. Tank the ad revenue.

The group would meet up once a month, initially in person, latterly on Zoom, and would read one – sometimes two – pages each session. This means they spent considerably longer reading the novel than Joyce took to write it. He spent 17 years agonising over the 628-page text, including a four-year spell of writer's block, before dying less than two years after its publication in 1939.

Less the wiser than if I had attempted a theoretical physics paper on string theory. Maybe that was the effect Joyce had been hoping for all along. That he was creating an act of bewilderment. The subtext more a feeling than an idea. One in which no quarter was given. Not even an attempt to meet the reader halfway. I'm also fairly sure that a 28-year book group read wouldn't help me that much. Not least because my memory isn't that good. Even just a year in and I'd have forgotten how the book started and what I thought of it. Still, credit where credit's due to the Californians. It must have been an adventure. And remarkably no one appeared to die in the process. For me, I will stick with the new Terry Hayes, The Year of the Locust.

Instead, we're asked to leave them be, allowing them to naturally decompose over the winter into nutrient-rich organic matter that also shelters hibernating pollinators and other beneficial insects."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Done thoughtfully, leaving the leaves is one of the best ways to turn yard waste into free fertilizer, and that's good for your plants, the environment — and your wallet. But it's important to consider the types of leaves you're dealing with and where they're landing."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Whole leaves should not be allowed to remain on walkways, where they'll create a slipping hazard, or on the lawn, where they are likely to cause disease."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Although turf grasses can handle a light scattering of leaves, a thick layer would threaten their health. In areas that experience snow cover, moisture would become trapped between lawn and leaves, encouraging mold, mildew and fungal infections. In areas without snow, whole leaves would likely smother the lawn, and block moisture and sunlight from reaching the soil."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The solution many have arrived at is to shred the leaves using a mulching mower and allow the fragments to fall between grass blades, where they break down into a rich soil conditioner. I've recommended this myself before realizing that doing so risks shredding up hibernating insects and their larvae. We'll need those caterpillars (eventual moths and butterflies) and other pollinators come spring, and so will newly hatched birds, which survive solely on insects during their first weeks of life."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So, what to do?"}, {"type": "text", "text": "These days, I rake (or blow) leaves off the lawn and into garden beds and spread them to achieve a layer no more than 2 inches deep. To speed decomposition, sometimes I add an inch or so of homemade or well-sourced compost over the leaves. There's no need to till; just let it sit. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The leaves usually break down considerably by spring and almost entirely by summer. But if they appear matted (again, conditions vary), remove them before spring growth resumes."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Leaves also can be used to make leaf mold, a type of compost made entirely from leaves. Just pile them up in a corner of the yard, sprinkle with nitrogen fertilizer, and water the mound periodically to keep it from drying out. It may take a year or two, but the leaves will break down into a nutritious soil amendment that can be used as mulch or added to planting holes and containers."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Some leaves contain compounds that inhibit the growth of other plants. Black walnut is perhaps the most notorious of offenders, as a toxic chemical in its leaves called juglone adversely affects and sometimes even kills susceptible plants like Asiatic lilies, baptisia, columbines, peonies, hydrangeas, lilacs, petunias, apples, asparagus, cabbage, eggplant, peppers, tomatoes and potatoes."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Avoid mulching beds with especially thick or broad leaves, like those of oaks, because their slow decomposition rates could threaten to block sunlight and water from the soil and, by extension, plant roots. They can, however, be used in leaf mold piles if shredded, which isn't ideal but is better than setting them out with the trash, which wouldn't help insects, either."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fallen leaves are nature's mulch, meant to protect (and build) soil, insulate plant roots and shelter wildlife, as they do on the forest floor.

For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions.

The England team he joins is at a different stage to Chelsea, however. Until this week, England squads have not been picked with long-term ambitions in mind. Southgate is building towards the end of his reign and there has been a certain logic to him sticking with a core group of senior players before Euro 2024."}, {"type": "text", "text": "If the England manager has been accused of showing too much loyalty to some, namely Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips, he is able to offer continuity and consistency as a counter-argument. Also, with Southgate's contract expiring at the end of the Euros, it is completely up to him if the focus is only on the next seven to eight months. It is perhaps why Southgate has seemingly decided not to bring Raheem Sterling or James Ward-Prowse into the fold, despite their club form. If football reasons are the factor, it could be Southgate has already made his mind up."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It leaves Palmer as a curious case, called up at an interesting time. Southgate's decisions over the past year or so suggest it could already be too late for Palmer to make his England squad, given the established options ahead of him.

The visitors have lost all seven of their qualifying matches so far this campaign and Southgate is likely to offer chances to his fringe players, just as he did in the 1-0 win over Australia last month. Palmer could impress, but in an entirely different team to the one that he would need to show he can perform in to influence Southgate's thinking. The same could be said for Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It could be that Southgate finds more value from Friday night's match by going strong, with only a couple of changes from what would be his first-choice team. It would be a more useful environment for assessing Palmer, who has shown in his first two months with Chelsea to possess excellent temperament and ability, or Alexander-Arnold, who has long demonstrated how his quality in attacking areas can be used when England have the majority of possession, or even Lewis, who is clearly ahead of Phillips in the eyes of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But suddenly, a pair of largely meaningless qualifiers offer a possible glimpse of the future, and if Southgate has been hesitant to make too many sudden changes in recent months, Palmer now has the chance to accelerate one.

You might call it a 'slow-motion car crash' except that the moment of impact plays out, just offscreen, twice: firstly, through the eyes of a French moonlit dog walker, and then, again, in the backseat with Di and Dodi. It is the moment the show has been moving, inexorably, towards, and one that plays out while Charles (Dominic West), his parents (Imelda Staunton and Jonathan Pryce) and his young children, stand idle, then dumbstruck, in Balmoral."}, {"type": "text", "text": "If the past is a foreign country, as LP Hartley wrote, then the recent past is a much less foreign country. With Tony Blair in Downing Street, George Michael on the radio, and the young princes gabbing about Bond girls, the gulf between history and the present day has never felt more bridgeable. But it has also never felt more like tittle-tattle ('One would almost feel sorry for her,' the Queen announces, 'if one weren't so cross with her'). Indeed, even the show's signature theme music – a soaring string arrangement by Hans Zimmer, that felt so right as it ferried viewers through the post-war period – feels out of place when sandwiched between million-pound paparazzi photos being sold to the Daily Mirror, and shots of Camilla Parker Bowles blowing out the candles on an enormous birthday cake."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While Diana is given a saintlike aura through Debicki's well-honed performance, Dodi is, if not quite played for laughs, portrayed as a bland, nouveau riche man-child, trapped between his puppeteer father, Mou Mou, and the object of his, undoubted, affection. It is a process of humanisation not extended to Henri Paul, the driver who lost his life in the crash, or Dodi's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who was seriously injured. But the show routinely privileges gossip over emotional resonance: highly speculative conversations between Diana and Dodi are included – and drive the plot – whereas Charles breaks the news of Diana's death to the prince, in a scene we, the audience, are not permitted to overhear. This tabloid tone relegates Staunton's Queen to a side character, while Lesley Manville's Princess Margaret slips by entirely unnoticed."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The whole sequence of episodes give a sense of the show's creator, Peter Morgan, catching up with his roots. After all, it was his screenplay for the 2006 movie The Queen that sparked this new career as a royal Kremlinologist. That film trod the same ground as the series' fourth episode, 'Aftermath', and shares some of the symbolism. In The Queen, a stag on the Balmoral estate, spared by a merciful Helen Mirren, comes to represent the dwindling power of the monarchy; in this iteration, the creature – shot by Prince William (played, in convincing teen heartthrob mode, by newcomer Ed McVey) in his first 'blooding' – signifies a loss of innocence. The most obvious diversion from the previously trodden path is the parallel drawn between the tactile, available grief of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Salim Daw) and the icy reserve of the Windsors. 'I am their brother in sorrow,' Al-Fayed declares, but if there is fraternal feeling it is more of the smashed-on-a-dog-bowl variety. Instead, Charles's mercurial affections are exposed via the medium (no pun intended) of a post-mortem private jet powwow with his deceased ex-wife (Mou Mou is offered the same construct, with a suddenly sagacious Dodi). It is a device of incredible convenience, where subtlety would've been a more interesting choice."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But The Crown has always peddled in easy answers. Big, brassy metaphors for the decline of empire; foreshadowings of tragedy or triumph. This is no different. 'There are worse places to be trapped than a jewellery shop,' Dodi tells Diana, on a rough night out in Monte Carlo, offering a new twist on the tired 'gilded cage' metaphor. And when Diana laments her wish to move away and 'start afresh', Dodi asks her, 'California?' 'Exactly,' she replies, with the unavoidable flicker of Harry and Meghan in her eyes. Even a Scottish portrait photographer solemnly announcing, of the Queen, that 'we'll miss her terribly when she's gone', is fraught, now, with consequence. The show's dialogue, which, in its portentous tone has often flirted with hamminess, now feels tailored to the cynical purpose of gravitas."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While the shadow of death can offer creative tension, it also makes The Crown feel like an ailing project.

It's spent the past few years drifting out of its lucrative orbit, mind you; ever since 2019's cathartic crossover film Avengers: Endgame, the MCU has struggled to curry consistent interest in its ever-ballooning catalogue of films and TV series. The latest film, The Marvels, is a sequel to Captain Marvel, which grossed over $1.1bn globally. This follow-up has opened at just $47m (£38.4m) – the lowest opening weekend for any MCU film, losing even to 2008's execrable Incredible Hulk."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Marvels follows a slew of other recent MCU releases that have underperformed, both critically and commercially.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever made $859.2m – around half a billion dollars less than the original Black Panther. The streaming side, meanwhile, has fared even worse, with Disney+ series such as Loki, Hawkeye and Secret Invasion failing to make any impact on the wider cultural conversation. In a recent report on the 'crisis' at Marvel Studios, Variety's Tatiana Siegel runaway budgets – individual episodes of She-Hulk reportedly cost $25m apiece – an over-saturation of content, and the legal issues surrounding Jonathan Majors, the actor who'd been positioned as the franchise's big villain for the next few years. For these reasons and more, it's clear the MCU is in dark and uncharted waters. But reports of its impending demise are overstated.

But this kind of drastic spiral is unlikely to be how it works."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Given the relative failure of films such as The Marvels, they will almost certainly look to restrategise – to squeeze as many final pumps out of what was once their fat-uddered cash cow.

(For 2016's Captain America: Civil War, Downey Jr reportedly negotiated an additional bonus atop his supposed $40m base fee if his involvement meant the film outperformed the previous Downey-less Captain America – which it duly did, by around $400m.)"}, {"type": "text", "text": "To some extent, the decline of the MCU speaks to a possibility that many at Marvel Studios would be unwilling to countenance – that maybe the superhero craze has run its course.

It may be that viewers are losing interest in the very idea of superheroes. Film genres go in and out of fashion – musicals; westerns; romcoms. There's no reason this would be any different.

It is a process of humanisation not extended to Henri Paul, the driver who lost his life in the crash, or Dodi's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who was seriously injured. But the show routinely privileges gossip over emotional resonance: highly speculative conversations between Diana and Dodi are included – and drive the plot – whereas Charles breaks the news of Diana's death to the prince, in a scene we, the audience, are not permitted to overhear. This tabloid tone relegates Staunton's Queen to a side character, while Lesley Manville's Princess Margaret slips by entirely unnoticed."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The whole sequence of episodes give a sense of the show's creator, Peter Morgan, catching up with his roots. After all, it was his screenplay for the 2006 movie The Queen that sparked this new career as a royal Kremlinologist. That film trod the same ground as the series' fourth episode, 'Aftermath', and shares some of the symbolism. In The Queen, a stag on the Balmoral estate, spared by a merciful Helen Mirren, comes to represent the dwindling power of the monarchy; in this iteration, the creature – shot by Prince William (played, in convincing teen heartthrob mode, by newcomer Ed McVey) in his first 'blooding' – signifies a loss of innocence. The most obvious diversion from the previously trodden path is the parallel drawn between the tactile, available grief of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Salim Daw) and the icy reserve of the Windsors. 'I am their brother in sorrow,' Al-Fayed declares, but if there is fraternal feeling it is more of the smashed-on-a-dog-bowl variety. Instead, Charles's mercurial affections are exposed via the medium (no pun intended) of a post-mortem private jet powwow with his deceased ex-wife (Mou Mou is offered the same construct, with a suddenly sagacious Dodi). It is a device of incredible convenience, where subtlety would've been a more interesting choice."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But The Crown has always peddled in easy answers. Big, brassy metaphors for the decline of empire; foreshadowings of tragedy or triumph. This is no different. 'There are worse places to be trapped than a jewellery shop,' Dodi tells Diana, on a rough night out in Monte Carlo, offering a new twist on the tired 'gilded cage' metaphor. And when Diana laments her wish to move away and 'start afresh', Dodi asks her, 'California?' 'Exactly,' she replies, with the unavoidable flicker of Harry and Meghan in her eyes. Even a Scottish portrait photographer solemnly announcing, of the Queen, that 'we'll miss her terribly when she's gone', is fraught, now, with consequence. The show's dialogue, which, in its portentous tone has often flirted with hamminess, now feels tailored to the cynical purpose of gravitas."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While the shadow of death can offer creative tension, it also makes The Crown feel like an ailing project. 'You've taught us what it means to be British,' the ghost of Princess Diana tells the Queen (yes, you read that correctly). And The Crown, similarly, has taught the world what it meant to be British, in the 20th century. But it has also run out of road – run out of history to retread – and, on its last legs, has less to say than ever, about what it means to be British now."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Daniel Escale/Netflix"}]}, {"_id": "65578528472abfd6df0224ae", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/kelly-fisher-the-crown-dodi-fayed-diana-b2448272.html", "articleType": "text", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "None", "title": "The Crown: Meet Kelly Fisher, the model Dodi Fayed was 'engaged' to when he dated Princess Diana", "lead": "Season six of Netflix drama focuses on Diana's final months ", "author": "Isobel Lewis", "datePublished": {"$date": "2023-11-17T16:22:16.194Z"}, "dateScraped": {"$date": "2023-11-17T16:22:16.194Z"}, "dateUpdated": {"$date": "2023-11-17T16:22:16.194Z"}, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/09/13/newFile-6.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": [{"type": "text", "text": "The romance between Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed is set to take centre stage on The Crown season six, but many viewers may be unaware that Dodi was dating a model who claimed they were 'engaged' when he met the royal."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Netflix's historical drama is returning for its final outing in November, with the first part of season six arriving on Thursday (16 November).

This is the question asked in Todd Haynes's May December, the latest of the filmmaker's torrid, probing melodramas. It has a plot that could come straight from a prurient TV soap opera, but Haynes – best known for films such as Far from Heaven (2002) and Carol (2015) – comes at his material with an intensity that rekindles memories of some of Ingmar Bergman's most fraught and closely focused character studies. He also elicits superb performances from his two leads, Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Portman plays Elizabeth Berry, a movie star who travels to Savannah, Georgia, to research her new role. In her next film, she is going to play Gracie (Julianne Moore), a woman who, two decades before, was at the centre of a tabloid scandal after having an affair with a seventh-grader (that's to say a boy who was 13 years old)."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Gracie was arrested when the affair became public. She subsequently divorced her husband and married the boy, Joe (Charles Melton), who is more than 20 years her junior. They've since started a family, have children of their own who are college-age, and are now 'a beloved part of the community'. However, Elizabeth's arrival stirs up some very uncomfortable memories, as well as the lingering resentments that surround her."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Portman's character radiates bad faith. She pretends to be sympathetic toward Gracie when she is really just looking to exploit her. 'This is not a story,' Gracie explains at one stage. 'It's my f***ing life.' The Hollywood star interviews everybody she can, from Gracie's ex-husband, to the son from her first marriage. ('It ruined my life, of course,' the son tells her of his mother's illicit affair.) Elizabeth begins to dress like Gracie. She mimics everything about her, from her make-up to her way of talking."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Elizabeth is a chameleon-like figure whose true emotions are impossible to read. In one telling scene, she turns up at the school Gracie's children attend and speaks to the drama class. A student asks her about doing sex scenes on camera. She admits her ambivalence about such scenes. Sometimes she is pretending to enjoy them but, on other occasions, the reverse applies: she is pretending not to enjoy them when she actually does. Moore's Gracie, meanwhile, combines steeliness and vulnerability. She spends her days exuding cheerfulness and baking cakes that she sells to neighbours – but it doesn't take very much to reveal her insecurity and her selfishness."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Much of the pleasure of the film lies in its clash of styles. At certain moments, it is trashy and voyeuristic. At others, for example when Elizabeth and Gracie are alone together, it becomes closer to Bergman's Persona, with its famous shot in which the faces of the actor played by Liv Ullmann and her nurse Bibi Andersson seem to merge. Marcelo Zarvos's strident musical score adds to the jarring effect."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As the two women shadow each other, Haynes also devotes time to Joe, who is obsessed with caterpillars and butterflies. He is a friendly figure but is stunted emotionally. It's as if by marrying Gracie so young, he has skipped an entire part of his life and stumbled into middle age prematurely."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is never quite clear who is exploiting whom. Gracie has presumably invited Elizabeth into her family home because she is being paid for it. There wouldn't be any other reason for her to rake over such painful memories.

Elizabeth is a method actor, so relentlessly devoted to researching her new role that she seems to have lost any sense of compassion or ethical responsibility."}, {"type": "text", "text": "May December is a film without frills or special effects.

And, when the opportunity strikes, Oliver lets all hell break loose."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You may feel an ounce of pity for these people, but little more. They've grown up so walled off from the world that all they can do is observe Oliver with intense, anthropological fascination.

Fennell colourfully constructs these elite spaces, in which 'just f*** off and do History of Art' is a real insult, and where the truly, truly privileged own the smallest televisions. She knows how to pick her actors, too, though Pike is the absolute highlight – luminously awful, every sentence dripped with judgement."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Saltburn invites explicit comparisons to The Talented Mr Ripley and Brideshead Revisited, especially in the way it teases and toys with Oliver and Felix's sexual desires.

One scene involves bathwater, another grave dirt."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Yet there's another, more revealing reference hidden at the centre of the film's hedge maze: a statue of the Minotaur. Saltburn is a tale of hubris, and the half-bull, half-man monstrosity of ancient myth was a punishment by the gods for Crete's ungrateful riches, created through an act of perverse sexuality.

I am fortunate enough to have a sizeable sum to pass on that I have accumulated over the years, and would therefore like to gift £55,000 to my grandson (who is 17). What is the best means of ensuring the highest value is passed on directly to them and is also safeguarded against interest rates/cash erosion? Is there an optimum means of investing the money on their behalf? ER, Suffolk."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Answer: You are indeed fortunate, as is your grandson, to have this sizeable sum to pass on to them. As you suggest in your question, the key is to ensure the money is allocated appropriately – so your grandchild can make the most of this gift."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Your first consideration should be whether he has a pressing need for the funds. You say they are aged 17; will they need the funds for university or further education? If that is the case, it's best not to take too much risk. As interest rates are high now, it's worth exploring a fixed-rate deal for one year, and then potentially reassessing the situation. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "You may decide on a longer-term fixed rate instead – maybe they don't require the funds for two or three years – and you could lock in a good deal while deposit rates are still relatively high."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Remember too that, should you choose, you can gift the whole £55,000 sum to them today. If you live for another seven years, you will then avoid inheritance tax (IHT) for this amount should your overall estate be taxed. In the example above, once they reach 18, you could help direct them in terms of how best to think about this significant gift."}, {"type": "text", "text": "If he has no immediate need for the funds, or perhaps if you are keen that they are allocated for something specific such as a property deposit, it is better to invest the money and take some market risk with a view to targeting longer-term growth. This is considered the best way to avoid the impact that inflation has on money that is kept in cash which will struggle to preserve its value in real (net of inflation) terms."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Helpfully, your grandchild can quickly move a good chunk of the funds into a tax-free wrapper. A 17-year-old can take advantage of the rules which allow both Junior Isa (Jisa) allowance of £9,000 and cash Isa allowance of £20,000 to be used in the year they turn 18. The Jisa will be converted to an adult Isa at age 18 and the cash Isa can also then be transferred to a stocks and shares Isa to maximise the potential for growth."}, {"type": "text", "text": "A child cannot otherwise invest, therefore a simple bare trust – a general investment account held on their behalf – would need to be used before they can invest the funds directly themselves (or access the funds) at age 18.

In addition to the 20 per cent government boost they get from paying into a pension each year, it can help instil an important sense of discipline, with a quantifiable impact later in life (they will not be able to access their pension until age 57). Understandably, however, this can feel very intangible for a teenager to appreciate today, and for some it is also preferable to see the impact of their gift earlier in their lifetime."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Staying on the topic of pensions, you can make the potential outcome more tangible by highlighting some figures. Since they can pay up to 100 per cent of their earnings into a pension each year (up to the maximum of their annual allowance of £60,000), let's assume they can afford to put £20,000 of the £55,000 lump sum into a pension at age 18. If they then contribute £100 a month for 40 years (and supposing investment growth of 5 per cent a year, with no other assumptions), after this period they would have amassed over £2.3m."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This figure includes the pension uplift from the Government of 20 per cent each year, both on the initial £20,000 and the £1,200 yearly contribution – and it shows the power of long-term investing. If your grandchild instead waited another 10 years to start a pension, with the same assumptions, and now with only 30 years of savings instead of 40, they would have accrued just under £1.3m – over £1m less for a decade's hesitation."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In reality, few 18-year-olds are likely to be able to start saving regularly into a pension, but this example shows that a lump sum and £100 saved a month for an extended period can lead to a very meaningful outcome. Even if your grandchild is not working, they can contribute up to £3,600 a year into a pension with the government top-up."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In order to ensure any investment reaches its potential, we would encourage your grandchild to follow certain tried and tested practices. This includes using the tax wrappers we have highlighted, such as a pension or Isa to maximise tax-free growth, to have a diversified set of investments including stocks and bonds, and to stay invested for the duration rather than trying to time the market – as this column has raised before, there are enormous benefits to following these simple steps."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Lastly, when investing it's also crucial to monitor how much you pay in fees to have your investments managed – small differences compounded over time can be transformational and in your grandchild's case, they will have a multi-decade investment timeframe where lower fees will make a massive difference."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Time is a key factor in shaping your grandchild's future.

Both these films (and their corresponding books) came out just after Diana separated from Prince Charles in 1992, but before the divorce was finalised.

That said, next to Princess in Love, Her True Story might as well have been a documentary. In the latter film they barely bothered to make Julie Cox have even a passing resemblance to Diana, dressing her in dowdy jumpers and pearls and blowing out her hair.

She had been cast as the antithesis of Charles, who was not only bitter, buttoned-up and in love with someone else, but 13 years her senior – next to him, she was a picture of youthful naivety. This juxtaposition meant that the sense of her as an endlessly generous person didn't reflect well on him (what was the opposite of educating the world, as the story went, about the unnecessary stigma around Aids?) – but her presumed innocence also contributed to her image as someone vulnerable to exploitation. This narrative prevailed in tellings of her experiences within the family, and in her 1995 tell-all interview with the BBC's Martin Bashir when she was supposedly duped using fake documents into spilling her guts on her marriage, which was, at the time, still legally intact.

And those who were still alive could, unwittingly or not, stoke the fire. William and Harry, aged 15 and 12, attempted to cope with the death of their mother in public (Charles, Harry wrote in his 2023 memoir Spare, offered a pat on the leg in consolation) and the picture of them walking behind Diana's coffin at the funeral became a vessel into which to pour a nation's worth of grief. The Queen waited for five days to address the nation, and Buckingham Palace did not fly its flag at half-mast: the cold, unfeeling Firm began to look like a worthy villain. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the years that followed the car crash there were multiple on-screen tributes to Diana, including the 1998 movie Diana: A Tribute to the People's Princess, in which she was played by Amy Seccombe, and the 2006 conspiracy film The Murder of Princess Diana, in which a fictional American journalist (played by Jennifer Morrison) digs into the circumstances surrounding Diana's death (a review in The Hollywood Reporter said that 'the production values [were] about what you might expect from a film school project'). Genevieve O'Reilly played her in Diana: Last Days of a Princess in 2007, another TV movie purporting to be a 'semi-fictionalised' account of the final two months of her life that, as well as dramatised scenes, included real news footage and interviews. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "These attempts were soggy perhaps because they were unnecessary. Diana's spectre loomed over Britain; Camilla Parker-Bowles was known in most living rooms as a 'homewrecker'.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "By 2013, enough time had passed to have another stab. A $15m (£12m) big-screen film was released starring Naomi Watts, based on the last two years of Diana's life – her relationship with the heart surgeon Hasnat Khan (Naveen Andrews), her campaigning against land mines in Angola, her affair with Dodi Fayed and, ultimately, the crash. It was universally panned. In the reviews, Watts's performance came through as the film's saving grace, but while she certainly looked like Diana, and captured some of her mannerisms, her spirit just wasn't there. And it was that elusive 'spirit' that Britain so sorely missed.

Boomers loved her for her charm and Gen X for her charity, while millennials adored her for her style – a mix of preppy and sporty that represented both wealth and rebellion (it helped that in around 2015 Kim Kardashian started wearing cycling shorts). Her divorcee status, too, became something to be celebrated in an age of increasing visibility for single women, and in the social media era, the 'Revenge Dress' has been granted a new lease of life.

This is a programme that seeks to tell the story of the royal family from Elizabeth's coronation in 1953, adding drama and emotional context to some of the most significant events in British 20th century history. It is a very different project from, say, Diana: The Musical, an aberration of culture that showed on Broadway and Netflix in 2021, in which Jeanna de Waal as Diana sang the words 'Harry, my ginger-haired son' into a cot. The Crown is a serious piece of drama that, though openly fictionalised, sometimes cuts a little too close to the truth – which is why it makes so many people so cross. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "In series four, Corrin appeared in the performance that immediately shot them, then unknown, to international superstar. They were electrifying, capturing Diana's mannerisms perfectly, imbuing her with a delicate ambivalence in which Diana was neither terrified deer nor manipulative narcissist – we felt for her, but we also understood that she was a human being with flaws. In series five, Corrin was replaced by Elizabeth Debicki, another actress who has captured the character with an accuracy that, in the 2000s and early 2010s, didn't seem possible: showing Diana in her later years, Debicki has the tiredness and resign that Corrin's Diana necessarily lacked; both actors perfectly embody the downward tilt of the head and distinctive physical presence. Debicki told Vanity Fair last year that it would be hard to let go of the character – 'It's been in my body for such a long time.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "In 2021 the Diana canon was expanded further with Pablo Larraín's experimental thriller Spencer, starring Kristen Stewart as Diana spending Christmas at Sandringham and experiencing a nervous breakdown while thinking about Anne Boleyn. Here, the narrative is focused almost entirely on Diana's inner world: she is so traumatised (and severely bulimic) that she is shown crunching down on her pearl necklace at dinner; she unravels into madness and eventually has an accident on the stairs. Stewart is captivating in a role that attempts to show Diana from the inside, rather than the person she was perceived to be by the public. But the film cannot help but add to the mythology: a woman whose spirit was destroyed by the restrictive forces of her husband's family, 'gaslit' – as Stewart put it in an interview about learning the character – and driven to madness. It's striking how the psychological language we use today can be so readily and anachronistically applied to someone whose suffering at the time had a very different tenor, no matter how legitimate it was. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Mantel wrote that 'for some people, being dead is only a relative condition; they wreak more than the living do'. Diana's death cemented her character in people's minds as exactly what they wanted her to be, making almost any interpretation of her bound to fail. But perhaps we should lower our expectations – it's already quite remarkable that we have, collectively, kept her alive for so long.

In a 2019 BBC documentary about her, Here I Am, she says she is 'older than America'. And then there is her most famous aphorism, the one she will be remembered by for decades, perhaps even centuries to come: 'It costs a lot to look this cheap.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "These soundbites, memorable and observant as they are, sit alongside her image to comprise a strong sense of Parton's identity.

She is now widely regarded as a songwriting genius. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Her appeal seems to lie in the fact that, from her bottle-blonde hair to her Deep South accent, everything about her feels endearingly obvious – and yet when you look a little closer, you'll find a lingering sense of mystery.

Parton is a bundle of contradictions: she looks ditzy, with wigs, drag-queen make-up and rhinestone-covered outfits, but she acts savvy. She imparts worldly wisdom in a childlike soprano. But she has joined all these forces together through an unwavering confidence and sense of self that transcends appearance and musical genre – using the paradoxes to her advantage. Because the ditzier you look, the more remarkable your savviness, and vice versa. The more pure and innocent your voice, the more impact it will have when you sing, as she did in 1968's 'The Bridge', about suicide. And so her two most striking, and contradictory, characteristics – an unabashed artificiality and profound authenticity – have, throughout her extraordinary career, simply set the other alight. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Unlike other stars of her generation, who may come back for 'legacy' tours or reunion albums (take the Beatles' recent experiment in AI, for example), Parton's career and presence in pop culture feels very much alive. She was born in 1946 in Pittman Centre, Tennessee, the fourth child of a family living in a one-bedroom cabin (her mother, Avi Lee, would become a mother of 12 children by age 35). The family was what Parton would later describe as 'dirt poor' – having to 'take a spit bath in a dishpan'. Having no television or other forms of entertainment, Parton would perform for her family, telling stories in her songs. By the time she was 10, when she performed one of her songs at a local event, she knew that she was going to be a star.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Parton's famous look – heavily made up, blonde wigs, exaggerated hourglass figure – was not coincidental. She always aspired to this exaggerated version of femininity. She wanted to be 'trash'. Her performance of femininity was a way to escape not only her historic lack of material possessions, but the roughness with which she and the women around her were treated by men. By embodying the sexualised hyper-feminine, pre-empting it somehow, she took back control."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "'Womanhood was a difficult thing to get a grip on in those hills,' she wrote in My Life, 'unless you were a man.' She and her sisters would aspire to be like the models they saw in the newspapers.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "She moved four hours west to Nashville – the hub for country music – at age 18 to try to make it. She got a job singing on The Porter Wagoner Show. For a few years, she grafted, duetting with Wagoner on TV, maintaining a charm and wit, her hair gradually expanding, her smile widening. She had a deep musicality, a prolific creativity, and a once-in-a-generation voice that emanated easily from her and shared what she seemed to be getting at with her look: hyper feminine, powerful, and all-knowing. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "In 1973 she released 'Jolene' – a remarkably original, unfathomably catchy song that topped the country chart in the US. A year later came 'I Will Always Love You' – whose rights she declined to sell to Elvis Presley for a cover version, knowing she would be grateful to keep control of the copyright. Within a few years, she had left Wagoner and blazed from the home comforts of pure country to country-pop. (Two decades later, she would return to her roots and release several albums of bluegrass.) Parton was no longer just a girl from the South, but a star for all. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Even when she branched out from the hillbilly comfort of ditties like 'My Tennessee Mountain Home', Parton's songwriting was key to her perceived authenticity. She managed to speak to and for everyone, in a way that felt it was directly for you. Her best-known and most broadly relatable song was '9 to 5' (1980), which came to her in an instant on the set of the film of the same name where she played a secretary disrespected for her femininity (the idea for the song came when she strummed a rhythm spontaneously by rubbing together her own set of acrylics – she is credited on the recording as being on 'Nails'). The song spells out common workplace grumbles – 'For service and devotion/You would think that I/Would deserve a fat promotion' – but is musically upbeat, again merging fantasy and reality, telling it like it is but always with a smile. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Because of the wide scope of her fan base, Parton has never been openly political. It's been clear from the outset that she is feminist in spirit – one of her early songs, 1968's 'Just Because I'm a Woman', speaks to the sexual double standard applied to men and women – but she has not said openly that she's a feminist (around the time the song was released, during the sexual liberation movement, she made a typical multilayered Parton gag: 'I was the first to burn my bra, but it took three days to put the fire out'). By declaring her political affiliations so openly, she would no longer be appealing to all, especially since those at the heart of her original communities have a tendency towards the political extreme. Earlier this year, she told the Big Issue she '[has] feelings about things', but that 'I'm not an activist, I'm not a feminist, I'm not any of that.' And then, in classic Parton style: 'And yet I'm all of that.' "}, {"type": "text", "text": "She is equally closed-off about her personal life – she met her husband, Carl Dean, at age 18 when she first moved to Nashville, and they married two years later, but he has almost never been seen in public. So she assuages this privacy and mystery with a profound openness in her songs – not telling, exactly, but showing. 'You have to search for a long time because I've written a lot of songs,' she says in Here I Am – 'but of course there are pieces of me in everything I write.' "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Yet it's curious that a star like Dolly Parton, who has built so much of her career on a larger-than-life personality, has also found her biggest hits in songs about other people. 'Jolene', far from being an angry revenge song about her own emotions, is a kind of mournful sonnet for the woman who once flirted with her husband at the bank; '9 to 5' is an anthem for a life she has never lived, and never will. 'I Will Always Love You' sounds like a deeply personal love song (the song was actually about her decision to leave Porter Wagoner to pursue a solo career) but every time she sings it, you sense it's for others. (She often dedicates it to her fans, who absorb it readily and then weep it back out, while Parton's golden smile never falters.) More importantly, it found its biggest audience when it was sung by Whitney Houston in 1992. Parton doesn't mind that people often wrongly attribute the song to Houston – 'it's my song, but it's her record', she said. There is something generous about how she turns to other people when we would all be so happy to hear more about her. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The persona she has built is an exquisitely crafted vehicle for the messages she wishes to impart. 'If I see something sagging, bagging or dragging, I'll get it nipped, tucked or sucked,' she said in 2014 – another snappy maxim about her increasingly exaggerated, surgically enhanced body and face, but one that also applies to her music. She has always been willing to regenerate to improve the product she offers. But at heart, she has always been herself: both artificial and authentic, country and kitsch. Now, she's a rock star, too – and why shouldn't she be? 'All these years people have thought the joke is on me,' she said in an interview in 1977, 'but actually it's been on the public. I know exactly what I'm doing – and I can change it at any time.'

And so the injected storyline of sorts – directing a girls-only mosh pit by the end of the set and a boys-only one in the encore – which he hinted at from the start and slowly built up throughout. It was a neat idea taken too far: he often seemed more interested in setting up the premise than actually singing the songs. In the encore, his it'll-be-ok-mate number one ballad 'Dry Your Eyes' and dense, disorientating night-out-gone-wrong classic 'Blinded by the Lights' came off as secondary to his instructing the crowd what to do.

He sued her for extortion during the pandemic; she countersued for breach of contract, fraud and deceit, claiming that he groomed her.
