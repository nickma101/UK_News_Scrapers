A projected shortfall is often referred to as a black hole, any wiggle room is called headroom."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As Jeremy Hunt says higher interest rates have been deployed by the Bank of England to fight the recent stubborn bout of inflation. And that has vastly bumped up the government's borrowing costs. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "But higher inflation has also delivered the chancellor a boost in revenues from things like VAT and income tax. VAT is a percentage of an item's value, so when things go up in price, the government gets more tax."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Also as prices rise, there's pressure to put up wages, then workers get dragged into higher tax brackets - known as fiscal drag - which means the government collects more income tax. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "So economists reckon the chancellor could have over £10bn of headroom. But what matters is what the OBR thinks - and even headroom of this size would mean this chancellor has far less to 'play' with then many of his predecessors in relation to his rules. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Whether and how the government meets its rules, how it uses headroom, depends on its policy choices, the tax and spending plans aligned with its political priorities, as well as on how the economy is performing. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Those choices mean there are trade-offs, winners and losers. So it's not a case of the chancellor unable to 'afford' to do something or that he 'must' adopt a particular policy. For example, if he wanted to extend the freeze in fuel duty that would cost £4bn (as the OBR is obliged to assume that duty rises annually). If he didn't have headroom, he could offset that by raising taxes elsewhere or squeezing spending. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Even if the OBR agrees the chancellor has several billions of pounds of headroom, he may not opt to splash it right now. There is after all, a general election looming - and likely a spring Budget beforehand."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It might be considered more politically advantageous to dole out sweeteners to voters then. Moreover, if the economy suffers an unexpectedly sharp downturn in the meantime, that could wipe out some of that headroom - potentially leaving the chancellor in the embarrassing position of having to claw back cash to meet his rules."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Or, come the spring, there could actually be more headroom; which he may well choose to use up rather than leave as a generous gift to whoever is chancellor following the election. So instead, this Autumn Statement may focus on the key terms and longer-term measures, such as levelling up, boosting the supply of workers, tackling growth, that the government wants to use to frame its election strategy."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So a pre-Christmas spree seems unlikely, regardless of your wishlist. That's not to say Mr Hunt won't be tempted to offer around a little platter of canapés, a taster of what could come in the spring."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But don't get too distracted by any nibbles served up.

King Kyrgios: the player who's been criticized and psychoanalyzed more than anyone else on the ATP Tour today; who's become almost the dictionary definition of the 'divisive tennis star'; whose career has been defined as much by his battles with the media as the men's Top 10. The villain, the bad boy, the ingrate, the brat. To imagine him putting aside a decade of beef to step behind the mic and assume the honeyed role of the tennis analyst seems faintly incongruous. Yet here he is, in half-profile from his spot on the Tennis Channel set, hands in pockets, relaxed, laughing and joking with Brett Haber and Jim Courier like an old media pro. He's wearing a dark jacket and a lilac T-shirt. The match comments are delivered with fluent authority. The cadence of panel chat comes easily to him: like a good baseliner, he knows when to step in and when to stay back. His hair looks nice. It turns out Kyrgios is pretty much the same on set as he is on court: rattlingly opinionated, and endlessly entertaining. Nick Kyrgios, pundit: why not?"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Alone with Novak Djokovic, the Australian star is the player that every tennis fan today must have an opinion on. I'll state mine up front: I love the guy. Yes, he's sometimes obnoxious on court (no more so than many others at the top of tennis, mind you), and his digs against other players can cut deep. But whether he's cruising or crashing, the man is compulsively watchable. He has opinions, and – unlike many other players on tour today – the courage to express them. He coaches himself, which makes him an exceptionally shrewd observer of the sport. Most importantly, he has a celestial gift for hitting a small fluorescent ball around a court."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Knee and wrist injuries have kept him on the sidelines for much of this year but we all remember Kyrgios's 2022, when the man who thought his window had shut for good suddenly, thrillingly found the form of his career. He took the first set off Djokovic in the Wimbledon final and fileted Daniil Medvedev at Flushing Meadows with the finesse of a master sushi chef. A player who began his career as a mercurial purveyor of tweeners and trick shots has now matured into something like the complete package. His authority comes not only from that pinpoint rifle of a serve but from the exotic variety of moves he can pull from any position on court: the split step, the drop volley, the slap forehand, the backhand bunt. He's the only player on tour today with the ability to make the mundane magnificent; among the many aesthetic peaks of his golden 2022, he ludicrously made the mid-court dink into an offensive weapon. Force of character is as much the key to his late-career success as technical prowess, a force that's impossible to separate from Kyrgios's combustibility, his continuous flirtation with the darkness: he's the Caravaggio of the ATP Tour, a tennis tenebrist who throws blinding thunderbolts across court as the storm of his personality rumbles ever forward. The intelligence and bravado, that sense of a million perspectives yearning to break free, are not simply intangibles of the Nick Kyrgios Experience, but somehow manifest in his physical being too, in the hunched roll of his walk, that sacerdotal prowl."}, {"type": "text", "text": "All of which should, theoretically, make him an ideal candidate to step on set and call some matches. And yet. I still had some apprehension about Kyrgios paunching himself into the pundit's chair – especially on the Tennis Channel, a smugly clubby, fake-happy, tennis-dad kind of network, which seems an odd fit for Kyrgios with his who-cares who-cares derision and splenetic charm. How wrong I was to doubt him."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Kyrgios, called up as a late addition to the commentary roster for the end-of-season ATP Finals in Turin, has been incisive and funny in equal measure, all while doing nothing to hide his preference for players who 'step in' and are prepared to take some risks. In Wednesday's match between Medvedev and Alexander Zverev, that was Zverev, while in Thursday's battle of the rising stars, it was Jannik Sinner over Holger Rune: 'Aggressive type tennis gets rewarded on fast courts. I want to see bang-bang tennis, one-two.' Zverev lost and Sinner won – a perfectly symmetrical result for the start of Kyrgios's career on camera."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Surprisingly, the man billed by the Tennis Channel as 'the human highlights reel' has also done his fair share of filler, enlivening the dead air with a 'Here we go, two break points for Zverev' here and a 'He needs some first serves here' there. He's dropped pleasing bits of player lingo into his commentary: 'short replies' for short returns, encouraging Rune to 'finish the set off with good habits' after the Dane got toweled in the opening stanza against Sinner. He's had a solidly comic gaffe: asking viewers to 'look at people that have had sex against Medvedev' before swallowing hard and quickly correcting to 'success'. And he's proved adept at coming up with interesting ways to say 'that was a good shot', which is after all what a lot of commentary involves. Here was his call after a superb lunging cross-court backhand from Sinner: 'Incredible. Ridiculous. How. Question marks.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Most illuminating of all has been the insight that Kyrgios has offered into his own approach to facing the sport's best players. We've learned that Medvedev's serve can sometimes be picked because he tends to throw the ball out to the right too much; that Kyrgios often 'lies' with his ball toss ('One of my strengths is that I can hit all the serves off different ball tosses, you gotta keep people guessing'); that he does not warm up before matches; that he was virtually coaching Rune for six months a few years ago after the young Dane slid into his DMs to ask for advice. Asked whether he'd rather be loved or genuine, Kyrgios immediately replied: 'Genuine. I don't mind being the villain – I've definitely experienced stadiums where not one person's been going for me, it's a great feeling. You find some really dark energy when the whole stadium doesn't want you to win, those are some of the best moments.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Candor of this variety has been a feature of this year for Kyrgios, who's endured a reckoning of sorts. He's spent much of the season in rehab for his various injuries, but still consistently managed to make headlines. He admitted shoving his ex-girlfriend but in February the assault charge he was given over the incident was dismissed; Kyrgios later issued a public apology for his actions. In May he helped Canberra police catch the man who stole a Tesla from his mother at gunpoint. Over the summer he revealed that he contemplated suicide after losing to Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2019, part of a string of commendably forthright revelations about his struggles with drinking and self-harm: 'I ended up in a psych ward in London to figure out my problems. I was drinking, abusing drugs, lost my relationship with my family, pushed all my close friends away. You could tell I was hurting.' That emotion and openness are among Kyrgios's great character assets; his readiness to show vulnerability marks him out as a rare specimen among modern athletes, who are almost universally controlled and media managed to the point of robotic tedium."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Kyrgios has long had a fractious relationship with Australia's media and tennis establishment – partly because of his contempt for authority but also, I sense, because he doesn't fit the model of the Anglo-Celtic 'good boy' that has been Australian tennis's traditional pinup. He's no Lew Hoad, no Pat Rafter, no Ken 'Muscles' Rosewall; he's not even a Lleyton Hewitt. He's a Greek-Malaysian kid from Canberra who's fanatically committed to the Boston Celtics, simulates sex acts on court, and loves his mum. When I was a child my Greek-Cypriot grandmother used to call anyone monkeying about and trying to be funny 'Karagiozis', and I see something of that folkloric clown in Kyrgios, in his lust for provocation and comedy. Perhaps the only country that has the comfort with unruly complexity to truly accept him for who he is, is America. On the basis of his stint on set this week, all shrugs and gossip and nonchalant conversational lobs about his beloved Celtics, that certainly seems to be the case."}, {"type": "text", "text": "If there's news that emerged from Kyrgios's time behind the mic, it's that he plans to retire in one or two years: 'Kygs has got about a year or two left, then I can sit back and watch these young bucks go at it,' he said during the Sinner-Rune encounter, while noting that he may still seek Djokovic's advice on 'alien longevity stuff'. This isn't exactly news, since Kyrgios has set out the retirement plan before: last year he told an Instagram Q&A that once he passes 30, he'll 'probably go to my house in the Bahamas and just sit and do nothing'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the era of the Big Three we're used to players carrying on into early middle age, but until Roger Federer came along, 30 was generally seen as the natural end point of a top tennis player's time among the pros. Björn Borg quit at 26; Marat Safin blootered his career into the tram lines after he turned 29; Pete Sampras hung up the baggy shorts at 32. Kyrgios retiring once he passes 30 would be a reversion to the historical norm. But for anyone who loves tennis it would be a shame. The greatest compliment I can pay the man's punditry is that it immediately made me want to watch him play again. Kyrgios the commentator, no matter how casually commanding, will never match Kyrgios the player, this volatile maestro of the lines. Tennis after Kygs will be more polite, more tasteful, perhaps even more graceful.

Overseen by O'Malley, this new animated series (produced by Tokyo anime studio Science Saru) chimes with the manga-inspired artwork of his graphic novels: all bold lines and big, expressive eyes.

But then there's also 'stuffed' in the sense of being trapped in an impossible situation with no safe way out. This is the experience of the millions of Britons currently living with chronic food insecurity, obliged to fill up on cheap meals to satisfy immediate hunger pangs while skimping on the nutrients that every body needs."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is the lack of common ground between these two types of stuffedness, the privileged and the deprived, that troubles Vogler. She points to the fault line that opened up during Marcus Rashford's 2020 campaign to extend free school meals into the school holidays. Kate Green, the former shadow education secretary, supported the scheme on the grounds that 'it is the government's responsibility to ensure that children do not go hungry'. Brendan Clarke-Smith, for the government, countered that he did not believe in 'nationalising children': feeding your family was a matter for individuals, not the state."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Vogler suggests that the roots of this division go all the way back to the 15th-century enclosure movement, which saw landlords fencing off the common land on which cottagers had previously grazed their animals, foraged food and collected firewood. By way of compensation for these lost rights, each villager got a small strip of land that wasn't big enough to do more than grow vegetables. Abolishing Britain's small-holding culture while consolidating food production into large, privatised silos effectively deprived the growing population of an intimate relationship with its food. It also created the conditions where emerging agri-business competed to bring produce to market at the lowest possible cost. Unlike those European countries that retain something of the small-holding mindset, Britons are particularly vulnerable to being scanted and scammed when it comes to their food."}, {"type": "text", "text": "To illlustrate this long decline, Vogler presents a series of detailed case histories. Take strawberries. In the 16th century they were a peasant indulgence, looked at askance by an elite who saw them as death-dealing if gobbled down with too much cream, which is what ravenous rustics were apt to do. From here they went upmarket, morphing into a brief six-week high-summer treat whose sweetness aligned them with female tastes (a man who ate too many was believed to be in danger of becoming effeminate). In the 20th century, strawberries' association with Wimbledon made them socially smart while the pick-your-own farmshop movement of the 1970s returned them to a fantasy of communal rural labour."}, {"type": "text", "text": "These days, thanks to polytunnels and a tentacular global transport system, strawberries are available from late March to autumn, although there is an unofficial competition taking place to see who can be first to get them ready in time for Valentine's Day.

Vogler reels off the qualities of this modern-day cultivar, from its mildew resistance to its bland sweetness to its unnaturally throbbing colour. Nor does she disguise her unease: 'The fruity lure of the strawberry hides something darker at the heart of our food system.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "What is that darkness exactly and how do we let in the light? Vogler does not pretend that the answer is simple or obvious. She is excellent, as in her 2020 book Scoff, at foraging among the sources to bring us wonderful stories of older food cultures. Of how in medieval times parsnips were just the thing if you were having difficulty conceiving, or of how artichokes in wine would rid you of body odour. Suffering from depression? Then radishes – with salt and pepper – will lift your spirits in a jiffy."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is in the difficult business of gathering up these narrative ingredients to make a food future that is equitable and safe that things get really tricky.

Together they organised a protest against a carbon tax on petrol that was due to be implemented the following year (notably, this was not long after Emmanuel Macron cut taxes for the ultra-rich).

French protests are always lively, but as the journalist John Lichfield observed, 'the white-hot anger' of the gilets jaunes was 'something new and different'. As it turned out, Macron was surprised too. He abandoned the tax after just over three weeks of protest, leaving the French political class in total shock at what had just happened."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Five years on, what can be learned? The first point is that Macron's fuel tax offered an object lesson in how not to make climate policy.

What this ignores, Huber argues, is questions of power and the distribution of pain."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This is evident, for example, in the Ulez levy, aiming to reduce air pollution, announced by Boris Johnson when he was London mayor, and then implemented and later extended by his successor, Sadiq Khan. Residents of Uxbridge, on the outer edge of London's Ulez boundary, where Labour recently lost a byelection, told the Guardian they opposed it on the grounds that the costs for pollution were falling on ordinary people during a period when the cost of living was rising. It is true that the rightwing press stoked anti-Ulez sentiment, and that there was a scrappage scheme that covered some of the cost of replacing cars – but few things motivate political action like the cost of living. By January 2019, the gilets jaunes had vandalised an estimated 60% of France's fixed speed cameras, arguing they were just a means of squeezing poor people out of money. Similarly in London, saboteurs calling themselves the 'blade runners' have attacked the number-plate recognition cameras that enforce Ulez."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The gilets jaunes were a mass movement with even wider public support. The blade runners, by contrast, are a fringe group. But the Ulez experience suggests that in post-austerity Britain, where public services are 'crumbling', ecological taxes can be experienced as arbitrary sanctions, not as necessary tools in the public interest. This is particularly true for people living on the peripheries of major cities who need cars to get around and are often self-employed, driving for work. The demographic of the Ulez backlash was unsurprising to anyone who knew about the gilets jaunes. Another important lesson is that the backlash can have many consequences: in this case, it created the political space for the Tories to embrace environmentally destructive policies such as the expansion of North Sea oil drilling."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Britain is not the only country failing to learn the lessons of the gilets jaunes movement. In Germany, a law that would have mandated citizens to install costly clean-energy heating systems from January 2024 nearly toppled the German governing coalition, with the Greens' approval rating plummeting. It was then watered down to allow a longer phase-in time. But even with the promise of grants to cover 70% of the cost of the heat pumps, many people felt they were being asked to pay too much and that the policy was being imposed on them in a one-size-fits-all way. One interviewee, an engineer, told the Financial Times that he wasn't against heat pumps, but to install one that would work efficiently in his house would have meant taking apart and reconstructing much of the building."}, {"type": "text", "text": "None of this is to say that taking climate action is unnecessary, or too hard, or inherently a form of class war.

Ludosky told me recently that she thinks the gilets jaunes have had two main legacies. The first is that French people are more concerned about the poor health of their democracy – since the carbon levy they have campaigned for democratic reform (though this has proven harder to deliver than the tax U-turn). The second legacy is that any talk of the ecological transition is now accompanied by ideas for how to make it fair.

To sum up this process in a soundbite would always have been hard, but in the early days of the crisis, calling for 'humanitarian pauses' may just have covered it.

In areas that experience snow cover, moisture would become trapped between lawn and leaves, encouraging mold, mildew and fungal infections. In areas without snow, whole leaves would likely smother the lawn, and block moisture and sunlight from reaching the soil."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The solution many have arrived at is to shred the leaves using a mulching mower and allow the fragments to fall between grass blades, where they break down into a rich soil conditioner. I've recommended this myself before realizing that doing so risks shredding up hibernating insects and their larvae. We'll need those caterpillars (eventual moths and butterflies) and other pollinators come spring, and so will newly hatched birds, which survive solely on insects during their first weeks of life."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So, what to do?"}, {"type": "text", "text": "These days, I rake (or blow) leaves off the lawn and into garden beds and spread them to achieve a layer no more than 2 inches deep.

But if they appear matted (again, conditions vary), remove them before spring growth resumes."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Leaves also can be used to make leaf mold, a type of compost made entirely from leaves. Just pile them up in a corner of the yard, sprinkle with nitrogen fertilizer, and water the mound periodically to keep it from drying out. It may take a year or two, but the leaves will break down into a nutritious soil amendment that can be used as mulch or added to planting holes and containers."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Some leaves contain compounds that inhibit the growth of other plants. Black walnut is perhaps the most notorious of offenders, as a toxic chemical in its leaves called juglone adversely affects and sometimes even kills susceptible plants like Asiatic lilies, baptisia, columbines, peonies, hydrangeas, lilacs, petunias, apples, asparagus, cabbage, eggplant, peppers, tomatoes and potatoes."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Avoid mulching beds with especially thick or broad leaves, like those of oaks, because their slow decomposition rates could threaten to block sunlight and water from the soil and, by extension, plant roots.

If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Furthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights. For example, a world title fight in men's boxing – a professional bout – will always be scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds; and a women's world title fight will be scheduled for 12 two-minute rounds. In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples)."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter's record – and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests. For example, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has boxed six times professionally, taking on former mixed martial arts champions Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren, as well as ex-NBA star Nate Robinson and YouTuber AnEsonGib.

The thing is, this England is quite good. They may even be fun, and there was certainly a sense of commanding confidence in the air as Southgate's side swept Italy aside last month.

It is perhaps why Southgate has seemingly decided not to bring Raheem Sterling or James Ward-Prowse into the fold, despite their club form.

Palmer could impress, but in an entirely different team to the one that he would need to show he can perform in to influence Southgate's thinking. The same could be said for Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It could be that Southgate finds more value from Friday night's match by going strong, with only a couple of changes from what would be his first-choice team. It would be a more useful environment for assessing Palmer, who has shown in his first two months with Chelsea to possess excellent temperament and ability, or Alexander-Arnold, who has long demonstrated how his quality in attacking areas can be used when England have the majority of possession, or even Lewis, who is clearly ahead of Phillips in the eyes of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But suddenly, a pair of largely meaningless qualifiers offer a possible glimpse of the future, and if Southgate has been hesitant to make too many sudden changes in recent months, Palmer now has the chance to accelerate one.

But it has also never felt more like tittle-tattle ('One would almost feel sorry for her,' the Queen announces, 'if one weren't so cross with her'). Indeed, even the show's signature theme music – a soaring string arrangement by Hans Zimmer, that felt so right as it ferried viewers through the post-war period – feels out of place when sandwiched between million-pound paparazzi photos being sold to the Daily Mirror, and shots of Camilla Parker Bowles blowing out the candles on an enormous birthday cake."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While Diana is given a saintlike aura through Debicki's well-honed performance, Dodi is, if not quite played for laughs, portrayed as a bland, nouveau riche man-child, trapped between his puppeteer father, Mou Mou, and the object of his, undoubted, affection. It is a process of humanisation not extended to Henri Paul, the driver who lost his life in the crash, or Dodi's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who was seriously injured. But the show routinely privileges gossip over emotional resonance: highly speculative conversations between Diana and Dodi are included – and drive the plot – whereas Charles breaks the news of Diana's death to the prince, in a scene we, the audience, are not permitted to overhear. This tabloid tone relegates Staunton's Queen to a side character, while Lesley Manville's Princess Margaret slips by entirely unnoticed."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The whole sequence of episodes give a sense of the show's creator, Peter Morgan, catching up with his roots. After all, it was his screenplay for the 2006 movie The Queen that sparked this new career as a royal Kremlinologist. That film trod the same ground as the series' fourth episode, 'Aftermath', and shares some of the symbolism. In The Queen, a stag on the Balmoral estate, spared by a merciful Helen Mirren, comes to represent the dwindling power of the monarchy; in this iteration, the creature – shot by Prince William (played, in convincing teen heartthrob mode, by newcomer Ed McVey) in his first 'blooding' – signifies a loss of innocence. The most obvious diversion from the previously trodden path is the parallel drawn between the tactile, available grief of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Salim Daw) and the icy reserve of the Windsors. 'I am their brother in sorrow,' Al-Fayed declares, but if there is fraternal feeling it is more of the smashed-on-a-dog-bowl variety. Instead, Charles's mercurial affections are exposed via the medium (no pun intended) of a post-mortem private jet powwow with his deceased ex-wife (Mou Mou is offered the same construct, with a suddenly sagacious Dodi). It is a device of incredible convenience, where subtlety would've been a more interesting choice."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But The Crown has always peddled in easy answers.

And when Diana laments her wish to move away and 'start afresh', Dodi asks her, 'California?' 'Exactly,' she replies, with the unavoidable flicker of Harry and Meghan in her eyes. Even a Scottish portrait photographer solemnly announcing, of the Queen, that 'we'll miss her terribly when she's gone', is fraught, now, with consequence. The show's dialogue, which, in its portentous tone has often flirted with hamminess, now feels tailored to the cynical purpose of gravitas."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While the shadow of death can offer creative tension, it also makes The Crown feel like an ailing project.

Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer released a joint statement a day after the news broke, saying they were 'so utterly devastated', and were 'going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss'. During the show's heyday, they had, in a very rare move for a TV cast, always negotiated as a team, pushed for equal salaries six ways; this was a cast that had always acted in unison."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This week, the five actors shared their own individual tributes to Perry, and they were just as moving as you would expect. Aniston shared a recent text Perry had sent her. Cox and Schwimmer reminisced about favourite memories of their co-star. Kudrow shared a poignant unseen photo of the two of them. LeBlanc managed to crack a bittersweet joke. The stars' deep-felt love for their former collaborator is palpable. For the legions of fans who were in their own way also devastated about the actor's death at the age of just 54, these tributes are both healing and painful to read. 'Spread your wings and fly brother. You're finally free,' wrote the Joey Tribbiani actor, in words that are sure to have reduced many readers to tears."}, {"type": "text", "text": "We don't grieve the same ways we used to. The digital age has changed this for everybody, but especially for celebrities. Whenever any famous person passes away, there is always, now, a rush to share tributes, to make one's grief public and visible. In the worst cases, this sometimes has the ring of obligatory self-promotion; even when sincere and heartfelt, there is still an unshakable sense of expectation. Actors live in an economy of performance and attention, and somehow, grief has become a part of this. It's to the credit of Aniston, Schwimmer, and co that their tributes do not feel like some act of duty. They asked for time, and of course they were given it. Their eventual words were moving, honest, and helpful."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Even within the realm of entertainment, sitcoms – perhaps Friends more than any other – have performed a unique function for audiences. They aren't just something to be consumed once, but something that's present in people's lives over long stretches of time. They become part of a routine – both as a weekly fixture during the show's original run, then, later, as a kind of dependable constant through daily reruns (in the UK, early evenings on E4), and, finally, as one of the most-viewed shows throughout the streaming era. The comfort this consistency affords is the very essence of sitcom methodology, but particularly Friends, a show whose very premise revolved around the appeal of simply hanging out with a great group of pals. There are millions of people out there grieving the loss of Perry the actor, Perry the sarcastic joker, Perry the ever-present character who appeared on their screens night after night, morning after morning. But his co-stars' tributes remind us that there are people who are grieving the loss of a man. Grieving not just a Friend, but a friend."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Throughout his life, Perry faced all manner of personal demons.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe – the superhero franchise that has dominated the box office for the better part of 15 years – is crashing back down to Earth. It's spent the past few years drifting out of its lucrative orbit, mind you; ever since 2019's cathartic crossover film Avengers: Endgame, the MCU has struggled to curry consistent interest in its ever-ballooning catalogue of films and TV series. The latest film, The Marvels, is a sequel to Captain Marvel, which grossed over $1.1bn globally. This follow-up has opened at just $47m (£38.4m) – the lowest opening weekend for any MCU film, losing even to 2008's execrable Incredible Hulk."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Marvels follows a slew of other recent MCU releases that have underperformed, both critically and commercially. This year's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 did fine – raking in around $845m globally. But the critically reviled Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania took in just $476.1m. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever made $859.2m – around half a billion dollars less than the original Black Panther. The streaming side, meanwhile, has fared even worse, with Disney+ series such as Loki, Hawkeye and Secret Invasion failing to make any impact on the wider cultural conversation. In a recent report on the 'crisis' at Marvel Studios, Variety's Tatiana Siegel runaway budgets – individual episodes of She-Hulk reportedly cost $25m apiece – an over-saturation of content, and the legal issues surrounding Jonathan Majors, the actor who'd been positioned as the franchise's big villain for the next few years. For these reasons and more, it's clear the MCU is in dark and uncharted waters. But reports of its impending demise are overstated. What actually lies in store is more complicated than that."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Marvel Studios has already committed to projects years in advance. The current slate of confirmed projects stretches until Avengers: Secret Wars in 2027 and includes seven forthcoming films and a handful of streaming series, with multiple other projects (including a new X-Men film) yet to be given a release date. The most drastic scenario would see them releasing these films to increasingly small and unenthused audiences, until they decide profit is no longer a possibility and simply hit the abort button. But this kind of drastic spiral is unlikely to be how it works."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Given the relative failure of films such as The Marvels, they will almost certainly look to restrategise – to squeeze as many final pumps out of what was once their fat-uddered cash cow. MCU releases will become less frequent, something that's already happening: next year, the only theatrical film will be Deadpool 3, down from three this year and last. Expect, too, to see the return of Tom Holland's Spider-Man: the webslinger is Marvel's most bankable asset, with 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home a nearly $2bn aberration in Marvel's post-Endgame decline."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Reports have also suggested that Iron Man's Robert Downey Jr is being courted for an MCU return. While the news is likely to disappoint those who enjoyed his return to legitimate acting in Oppenheimer this year, the comeback would be an obvious win for Marvel Studios: Downey's presence was always a demonstrable box office draw for the franchise, evidenced by his extraordinary paychecks. (For 2016's Captain America: Civil War, Downey Jr reportedly negotiated an additional bonus atop his supposed $40m base fee if his involvement meant the film outperformed the previous Downey-less Captain America – which it duly did, by around $400m.)"}, {"type": "text", "text": "To some extent, the decline of the MCU speaks to a possibility that many at Marvel Studios would be unwilling to countenance – that maybe the superhero craze has run its course. It's not just Marvel that's struggling for commercial potency right now: this year, DC Studios has released The Flash, Blue Beetle and Shazam: Fury Of The Gods to utterly muted receptions. It may be that viewers are losing interest in the very idea of superheroes. Film genres go in and out of fashion – musicals; westerns; romcoms. There's no reason this would be any different. Just don't expect Marvel to admit this any time soon. These are comic book people after all.

Indeed, even the show's signature theme music – a soaring string arrangement by Hans Zimmer, that felt so right as it ferried viewers through the post-war period – feels out of place when sandwiched between million-pound paparazzi photos being sold to the Daily Mirror, and shots of Camilla Parker Bowles blowing out the candles on an enormous birthday cake."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While Diana is given a saintlike aura through Debicki's well-honed performance, Dodi is, if not quite played for laughs, portrayed as a bland, nouveau riche man-child, trapped between his puppeteer father, Mou Mou, and the object of his, undoubted, affection. It is a process of humanisation not extended to Henri Paul, the driver who lost his life in the crash, or Dodi's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who was seriously injured. But the show routinely privileges gossip over emotional resonance: highly speculative conversations between Diana and Dodi are included – and drive the plot – whereas Charles breaks the news of Diana's death to the prince, in a scene we, the audience, are not permitted to overhear. This tabloid tone relegates Staunton's Queen to a side character, while Lesley Manville's Princess Margaret slips by entirely unnoticed."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The whole sequence of episodes give a sense of the show's creator, Peter Morgan, catching up with his roots. After all, it was his screenplay for the 2006 movie The Queen that sparked this new career as a royal Kremlinologist. That film trod the same ground as the series' fourth episode, 'Aftermath', and shares some of the symbolism. In The Queen, a stag on the Balmoral estate, spared by a merciful Helen Mirren, comes to represent the dwindling power of the monarchy; in this iteration, the creature – shot by Prince William (played, in convincing teen heartthrob mode, by newcomer Ed McVey) in his first 'blooding' – signifies a loss of innocence. The most obvious diversion from the previously trodden path is the parallel drawn between the tactile, available grief of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Salim Daw) and the icy reserve of the Windsors. 'I am their brother in sorrow,' Al-Fayed declares, but if there is fraternal feeling it is more of the smashed-on-a-dog-bowl variety. Instead, Charles's mercurial affections are exposed via the medium (no pun intended) of a post-mortem private jet powwow with his deceased ex-wife (Mou Mou is offered the same construct, with a suddenly sagacious Dodi). It is a device of incredible convenience, where subtlety would've been a more interesting choice."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But The Crown has always peddled in easy answers. Big, brassy metaphors for the decline of empire; foreshadowings of tragedy or triumph. This is no different.

And when Diana laments her wish to move away and 'start afresh', Dodi asks her, 'California?' 'Exactly,' she replies, with the unavoidable flicker of Harry and Meghan in her eyes. Even a Scottish portrait photographer solemnly announcing, of the Queen, that 'we'll miss her terribly when she's gone', is fraught, now, with consequence. The show's dialogue, which, in its portentous tone has often flirted with hamminess, now feels tailored to the cynical purpose of gravitas."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While the shadow of death can offer creative tension, it also makes The Crown feel like an ailing project.

Her seldom-seen husband of 57 years, Carl Dean, has always been a headbanger (she says he played loud rock'n'roll on his car radio on their first date), so this record is also sweetly dedicated to him. A reworking of Parton's 1975 song 'Magic Man' (later a hit for soft rockers Heart) is even subtitled 'Carl's Version'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "With arrangements seldom straying far from their originals, the vibe is that of a rather raucous, A-list karaoke party. Parton indulges in cheesy banter with Joan Jett and Stevie Nicks, then weaves little snatches of her own song – 'I Will Always Love You' (1973) – into Cyrus's 2013 hit 'Wrecking Ball'. Determination to hang on to her own publishing rights meant that she had to refuse permission for Elvis to record the song – a moment she once compared to the heartbreak of walking away from a lover to save your sanity.

Her little sparrow's quaver gets slightly lost in the disco throb of Blondie's 'Heart of Glass', and she comes off more strict schoolma'am than stalking lover on The Police's 'Every Breath You Take'.

She genre-hopped from country to pop before Taylor Swift was born. Politically, she's been famously non-partisan – 'I don't condemn or condone,' she likes to say. But new song 'World on Fire' sees her losing her rag at the state of the world, calling out greedy selfish politicians to a 'We Will Rock You'-esque, stadium-stomping beat.

She subsequently divorced her husband and married the boy, Joe (Charles Melton), who is more than 20 years her junior.

The Hollywood star interviews everybody she can, from Gracie's ex-husband, to the son from her first marriage. ('It ruined my life, of course,' the son tells her of his mother's illicit affair.) Elizabeth begins to dress like Gracie. She mimics everything about her, from her make-up to her way of talking."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Elizabeth is a chameleon-like figure whose true emotions are impossible to read. In one telling scene, she turns up at the school Gracie's children attend and speaks to the drama class. A student asks her about doing sex scenes on camera. She admits her ambivalence about such scenes. Sometimes she is pretending to enjoy them but, on other occasions, the reverse applies: she is pretending not to enjoy them when she actually does. Moore's Gracie, meanwhile, combines steeliness and vulnerability. She spends her days exuding cheerfulness and baking cakes that she sells to neighbours – but it doesn't take very much to reveal her insecurity and her selfishness."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Much of the pleasure of the film lies in its clash of styles. At certain moments, it is trashy and voyeuristic. At others, for example when Elizabeth and Gracie are alone together, it becomes closer to Bergman's Persona, with its famous shot in which the faces of the actor played by Liv Ullmann and her nurse Bibi Andersson seem to merge. Marcelo Zarvos's strident musical score adds to the jarring effect."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As the two women shadow each other, Haynes also devotes time to Joe, who is obsessed with caterpillars and butterflies.

Fennell colourfully constructs these elite spaces, in which 'just f*** off and do History of Art' is a real insult, and where the truly, truly privileged own the smallest televisions.

Once you have tracked down your pensions, the next step is to decide on the most appropriate way to manage your combined pensions from now on."}, {"type": "text", "text": "When assessing a manager for your newly consolidated pensions, you should explore how a firm can help you to achieve your goals. You will likely benefit in the first instance from having a single place to monitor your pension assets. Some firms can now provide excellent tools to help you track your investments. Technology has made life much easier for those who want better visibility and more control over their assets, so there is no reason to stick with an outdated provider that can't meet the needs of modern investors."}, {"type": "text", "text": "A single combined pension pot also enables you to manage your costs more efficiently. For those with older pension schemes, charges may well have been high for a long period and historically there has been far less scrutiny over fees, nor a real understanding as to the effect high fees will have on the final retirement pot. It's also likely that the underlying investment approach was based on active fund management, contributing to higher overall fees."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The evidence these days largely favours a passive approach to long-term investing, where professional managers focus on achieving the right mix of investments through Index or ‘Passive' funds. These track the performance of indices such as the UK's FTSE 100 and the S&P 500 in the US, rather than trying to craft a bespoke portfolio from a selection of individual stock picks. The reason passive investing has gained so much in popularity is twofold: the approach has tended to outperform an active approach over the medium to long term, and it is cheaper."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Being cost effective makes a huge difference. I refer to fees frequently in this column because unnecessarily high fees are the single biggest detractor from final retirement pots, and we can avoid them.

You may find that you have been quite cautious until now, but since you have 14 years until retirement and then a long period of retirement itself, you should consider whether you need to make your money work harder. Typically, taking more investment risk gives you the potential for higher returns, and if you have time on your side, you can sit through any periods of market volatility without having to worry about needing to draw on your funds."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You also have the opportunity to make sure you are appropriately diversified.

How long this takes can vary but the good news is that, since the pandemic in 2020, there is a wider acceptance of technology which has generally made the transfer process easier and quicker. You have also helped speed up the process – from months to weeks – by having all your various scheme details to hand."}, {"type": "text", "text": "With the addition of your £200 in contributions a month, how much you can generate from your pension will greatly depend on the factors above: total annual charges, making sure your investments are diversified and sufficiently risk-weighted and having enough time to allow your pot to grow. If you are a lower rate taxpayer, your contributions will be boosted by the government to £3,000 a year (more if you pay a higher rate), and if we assume a yearly return of 5 per cent, your initial pension pot of £67,000 could grow to over £190,000 by the time you retire in 14 years."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Consolidating separate pensions into one pot makes sense for most people. There will be cases where it may not be worth your while; for example, if you have contributed to a defined benefit (or Final Salary) scheme.

It's also worth remembering that you can access one-off financial advice if your situation is complex, or if you need help in assessing whether you should consolidate some pots and not others."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Many of us have accumulated numerous pension pots from a lifetime of working. Taking the time to locate them and to see whether they are fit for purpose – could they be working harder, for less cost? – will almost always reap benefits.

We watch as Oliver smears Venetia's menstrual blood over her face, slurps up Felix's dirty bathwater from the drain, unbuttons his trousers and masturbates into a hole in the ground where Felix has been buried.

There's no denying that it succeeds in the first part, but as for the second part, the film is less successful.

Extreme wealth can be extremely sinister – and yet these films that purport to hold the wealthy to account rarely delve into any real depth about the very real influence the uber rich have on the world around them – everything from their insidious political power to their often detrimental impact on the climate to their impact on the economy is painted with broad strokes or ignored entirely.

I chart it back to when Gillette did that whole new advertising campaign post-MeToo, which basically took a celebration of masculinity and turned it into an if you're a man, you need to prove you're not Harvey Weinstein or you can't use Gillette products, and $9 billion off the bottom line later, they did a screeching U-turn and went back to celebrating masculinity.
