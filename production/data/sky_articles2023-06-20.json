collectively valued at \u00a327m - with more than 2,200 victims in London alone in the last two years, where it has \"become epidemic\", investigators say.It is feared thousands more drivers have unknowingly been targeted across the country - and an urgent appeal has now been launched to help motorists learn the warning signs of the scam.How does the scam work? \n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike traditional crash for cash scams where fraudsters slam on their car's brake in hope that the victim behind cannot stop in time, this con involves mopeds being driven at oncoming cars.The moped scammer hides out of sight in a side road or parking space, and then deliberately drives into the victim as they head towards them.They then usually throw their moped to the ground and drop to the floor to dramatise an injury, before taking photos of the incident.The fraudster sometimes has an accomplice to act as a witness and help facilitate the scam. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have also been reports of an accomplice using a van to help obscure the victim's view before the moped drives into them, making the scam easier to carry out.Most reported incidents have taken place in north London, where residents have been told to be vigilant of any moped users who appear to be lingering unnecessarily on public roads.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nPic: IFB/Hastings Direct \n        \n\n\n\nWho's being targeted?

Now new research suggests it could be good for your brain too.A study which analysed data from people aged 40 to 69 has shown daytime napping could slow the rate at which the brain shrinks as we age.\n\n\n\nThe average difference in brain volume between habitual nappers and those who were not was equivalent to 2.6 to 6.5 years of ageing, researchers found.They said they hope their findings into the health benefits of sleeping during the day will reduce any stigma that still exists around daytime napping.Senior author Dr Victoria Garfield, from the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health & Ageing at UCL, said: \"Our findings suggest that, for some people, short daytime naps may be a part of the puzzle that could help preserve the health of the brain as we get older.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious research has suggested people who have had a short nap perform better in cognitive tests in the hours afterwards than those who did not take forty winks.The new study, published in the journal Sleep Health, looked at whether there was a causal relationship between daytime napping and brain health.Researchers looked at 97 snippets of DNA thought to determine people's likelihood of habitual napping.They compared measures of brain health and cognition of people who are more genetically programmed to nap with people who did not have these changes in DNA, using data from 378,932 people from the UK Biobank study. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey found that, overall, people predetermined to nap had a larger total brain volume. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking

inflation eases to 'slowest monthly rate this year'The genetic variants - DNA changes - influencing the likelihood of someone to nap were identified in an earlier study looking at data from 452,633 UK Biobank participants.But the researchers did not find a difference in how well those programmed to be habitual nappers performed on three other measures of brain health and cognitive function.Lead author and PhD candidate Valentina Paz, from the University of the Republic (Uruguay) and MRC Unit for Lifelong Health & Ageing at UCL, said: \"This is the first study to attempt to untangle the causal relationship between habitual daytime napping and cognitive and structural brain outcomes.\"By looking at genes set at birth, Mendelian randomisation avoids confounding factors occurring throughout life that may influence associations between napping and health outcomes.\"Our study points to a causal link between habitual napping and larger total brain volume.\"Dr Garfield added: \"I

And don't forget Amazon's various Kindles and Microsoft's array of Surfaces.If your head hurts thinking about them all, you're not alone. As someone who recently helped research a new family tablet purchase, it's more difficult than ever to know which models to choose from as use cases vary so wildly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Google from coming up with yet another use case for a tablet - what if it was also a smart home display?The Pixel Tablet launches today into a field more crowded than ever, priced \u00a3599. It's got the same chip as the company's flagship Pixel 7 smartphones, an 11-inch screen, and a bunch of apps optimised to take advantage.But the standout feature is the dock, which you slap the tablet on to with some powerful magnets and effectively transforms the device into a home hub.You can see information like time and weather, have it cycle through photos, play music from the in-built speakers, control your lights, and its \"Hey Google\" voice assistant is always listening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe tablet is designed to be placed on a dock when not in active use\u2026\n        \n\n\n\nNo dock, no diceThe idea is that rather than leave it teetering on the arm of the sofa, down the side of the bed, or worse still at the mercy of your children, you pop it on the dock and make it the centre of your smart home.Google's so committed to this idea, you can't buy the tablet without the dock.It's a very different approach to that taken by other tech companies, and almost seems as much designed to target Amazon's dominance in the smart speaker market as Apple's in the tablet space.Of course, at \u00a3599, it comes in much more expensive than your average home hub - even the pricier ones like Amazon's Echo Show and Google's own Nest Hub.Google has long made great and popular smartphones, and its Pixel range is one of the very best for anyone who favours the Android operating system.But the search giant has never quite found solid footing in the tablet space, and its previous attempt offered a completely different pitch to today's release. The Pixel Slate, from 2018, was a pricey Frankenstein-esque bid to combine tablet with Chromebook, and it was discontinued after just two years.Sceptics will no doubt suspect a similar fate awaits the Pixel Tablet. Google certainly has history when it comes to killing off products and services beyond just misguided tablets, with its Glass headset and Stadia games platform (dead after two and three years, respectively) among the most high-profile examples. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n\u2026and used as a normal tablet when picked up\n        \n\n\n\nBut as you'd expect, its executives are bullish about the Pixel Tablet and the tech is impressive.The thicker bezels and matte finish make it nice and grippy, albeit less premium feeling; it's really fast; offers eight megapixel cameras on the front and back, which work especially well for video calling; and Google promises the battery will survive 12 hours of video streaming.And while Android has never felt nearly as at home on a tablet as on a phone, during our hands-on time we found popular apps - from Google's own like YouTube and Gmail to others like Disney+ and WhatsApp - were rather well optimised and could be used split-screen.The Pixel Tablet also supports multiple accounts, making it more shareable among a household than Apple's iPad, which will help put parents' minds at ease.Most importantly, the dock works as advertised, turning the tablet into an attractive fixture of your living room, with pretty solid speakers for playing music, radio, and podcasts.Read more:Google's first folding phone has eye-watering

two years.\n"}, {"_id": "64917cac51ac331c040b431b", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/altnet-funding-crisis-deepens-as-airband-seeks-new-funds-12906020", "primaryCategory": "business",

To do it is a bold plan to borrow \u00a3100bn+ over the course of the next parliament to transition the country away from fossil fuels to green energy.\n\n\n\nBy far Labour's single biggest spending commitment, the party had pledged to borrow \u00a328bn-a-year to fund the flagship green transition programme, but has since scaled back borrowing plans amid growing concerns about taking on debt as the cost of borrowing rises on the back of higher interest rates.Instead, Labour will gradually ramp up borrowing to that level in the \"second half of the parliament\" if it wins the next general election.But the plan is still huge - undoubtedly the single most radical policy of Sir Keir's Labour government should he win the next election. Labour's green subsidies amount to more in relative terms than US President Joe Biden's own green economy plan - the inflation reduction act - which has earmarked $37bn in subsidies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money will be used to launch a state-run company GB Energy to invest in renewables, with \u00a32.5bn in direct subsidies to green energy providers who contract to manufacture in the UK - the 'British jobs bonus' as Sir Keir puts it. He says it will create nearly 500,000 new direct and indirect jobs. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n7:00\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer outlines energy plans \n\n\n\nSunak refuses to say if he will attend Boris Johnson debate - politics latest \n\nMore on Conservatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Shaun Bailey apologises 'unreservedly' for staff-partying video - and says it is 'for others to decide' about his peerage\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Boris Johnson denied special access to parliament as MPs endorse report which said he lied\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Boris Johnson in 'clear breach' of rules after Daily Mail job announced, says MP watchdog\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nConservativesLabourSir Keir Starmer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe driving purpose of the plan is to drive down energy bills - with Labour claiming that it will take \u00a31,400 off average bills if it can hit the 2030 target.It is also about transforming the economy in order to better fund public services. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSir Keir is clear that this is the sort of \"activist industrial policy\" Britain needs for the longer term, but for voters looking to Labour to commit money to schools, hospitals and transport in the next election, this could prove a hard sell with the amount Labour is willing to borrow to subsidise green technologies dwarfing other commitments for public services.\"We are going to put money into public services,\" explains one senior Labour figure. \"But we have to grow the economy as the first step. Being clear about stable finances and sticking to it is the best way to turnaround the country.\" \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n3:41\n\n\n\n\n\n'We are doubling down not backing off'\n\n\n\nBut while the level of borrowing has raised eyebrows, and afforded the Conservatives a \"borrowing bombshell\" attack line, the plans to block new oil and gas developments in the North Sea as part of the renewables revolution has provoked widespread criticism from industry and union figures fearful of widespread job losses.Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, on Monday said Labour's plans put \"tens of thousands of Scottish jobs a risk\".The criticisms have prompted another policy tweak as Sir Keir promised not to revoke any fossil fuel extraction licenses granted before the next general election, even though it could take years before those new fields begin producing.This allows the Labour leader to insist existing jobs in oil and gas are not at risk, but there's no doubt that as production is gradually wound down, this will be a momentous shift for a sector that supports nearly 200,000 jobs in the UK.There is also the question of whether the Labour leader can actually deliver what he is pledging in this five years. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at Oxford University, who has advised the government on energy policy over many years, said last week the goal was unlikely to succeed on the current trajectory.When I pressed Sir Keir in an interview in Leith on Monday if the \"clean power by 2030\" pledge was a guarantee or a target he demurred, he said it was his \"ambition\" and he believed to be \"doable\". Not an explicit guarantee then, and for good reason.There is also a question about credibility and commitment after the Labour party U-turned on its promise to borrow \u00a328bn-a-year from the beginning of the parliament in order to scale up renewable industry.'Doubling down'The leadership has insisted it is still totally committed to the plan, but has had to scale back commitments in the near-to-medium term as the high cost of borrowing hits against Labour's fiscal rules (no borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and net debt must be falling as a percentage of GDP at end of the rolling five-year period).When I asked Sir Keir on Monday if the U-turn on the financial commitment in the first half of the parliament showed - as with Brexit, tuition fees, and re-nationalisations - that he can't be trusted to keep his promises, he said it showed the opposite, that he was \"doubling down\" on the plan. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:37\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer hits out at 'Tory crap'\n\n\n\n\"It is a matter of trust,\" he told me.\"Rachel [Reeves] - we set out fiscal rules two or more years ago. Inflation is in a completely different place to where it was\u2026 but at the same time as we work through our plans and set out what we want to do in years one, two and three, it is clear we can ramp up to that \u00a328bn and when I say to people in the sector, I want clean power by 2030, they don't say you're backing down, they say that's a real challenge.\"On the timing of this announcement, there is of course a risk that Sir Keir's missions get drowned out by the dramas back in Westminster. There was some discussion about whether to pull the announcement, but in the end Sir Keir decided that he wanted to get on talking about how he might lead Britain than, to quote one ally, get \"bogged down in the psychodrama\" of what's going on in Westminster.\"Doesn't it speak volumes that the Labour Party is today launching a plan for the next generation of jobs, whilst the Tories are squabbling back in Westminster, and the SNP are preaching about promises they've broken?\" observed the Labour leader when I asked him about the current state of his rivals. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more:David Cameron heckled as he leaves COVID inquiryStarmer says Johnson should be banned from parliament after partygate reportSir Keir wants to use these \"mission statements\" to position himself as a leader-in-waiting as the current prime minister Rishi Sunak finds his agenda hijacked by the failings of his predecessor and party infighting once more.But the agenda on Monday is very much about parking Labour's tanks on the SNP's lawns too, given that there is no route to Number 10 for Sir Keir that doesn't go through Scotland. Locating GB Energy in Scotland is designed to firmly park his tanks on the SNP's lawn.A poll out over the weekend suggested Labour was on course to take 26 seats in the next general election - an incredible change in fortunes from the single seat it picked up in 2019 - as the departure of Nicola Sturgeon and her subsequent arrest (she was released without charge) over the police probe into SNP finance leaves the party battered and bruised.\"Nicola Sturgeon not being first minister obviously provides a space and an opportunity that simply wasn't there before,\" acknowledges one senior figure.\"But there's no rule that anybody disillusioned with either the Tories or the SNP necessarily swaps columns to us.

And don't forget Amazon's various Kindles and Microsoft's array of Surfaces.If your head hurts thinking about them all, you're not alone. As someone who recently helped research a new family tablet purchase, it's more difficult than ever to know which models to choose from as use cases vary so wildly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Google from coming up with yet another use case for a tablet - what if it was also a smart home display?The Pixel Tablet launches today into a field more crowded than ever, priced \u00a3599. It's got the same chip as the company's flagship Pixel 7 smartphones, an 11-inch screen, and a bunch of apps optimised to take advantage.But the standout feature is the dock, which you slap the tablet on to with some powerful magnets and effectively transforms the device into a home hub.You can see information like time and weather, have it cycle through photos, play music from the in-built speakers, control your lights, and its \"Hey Google\" voice assistant is always listening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe tablet is designed to be placed on a dock when not in active use\u2026\n        \n\n\n\nNo dock, no diceThe idea is that rather than leave it teetering on the arm of the sofa, down the side of the bed, or worse still at the mercy of your children, you pop it on the dock and make it the centre of your smart home.Google's so committed to this idea, you can't buy the tablet without the dock.It's a very different approach to that taken by other tech companies, and almost seems as much designed to target Amazon's dominance in the smart speaker market as Apple's in the tablet space.Of course, at \u00a3599, it comes in much more expensive than your average home hub - even the pricier ones like Amazon's Echo Show and Google's own Nest Hub.Google has long made great and popular smartphones, and its Pixel range is one of the very best for anyone who favours the Android operating system.But the search giant has never quite found solid footing in the tablet space, and its previous attempt offered a completely different pitch to today's release. The Pixel Slate, from 2018, was a pricey Frankenstein-esque bid to combine tablet with Chromebook, and it was discontinued after just two years.Sceptics will no doubt suspect a similar fate awaits the Pixel Tablet. Google certainly has history when it comes to killing off products and services beyond just misguided tablets, with its Glass headset and Stadia games platform (dead after two and three years, respectively) among the most high-profile examples. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n\u2026and used as a normal tablet when picked up\n        \n\n\n\nBut as you'd expect, its executives are bullish about the Pixel Tablet and the tech is impressive.The thicker bezels and matte finish make it nice and grippy, albeit less premium feeling; it's really fast; offers eight megapixel cameras on the front and back, which work especially well for video calling; and Google promises the battery will survive 12 hours of video streaming.And while Android has never felt nearly as at home on a tablet as on a phone, during our hands-on time we found popular apps - from Google's own like YouTube and Gmail to others like Disney+ and WhatsApp - were rather well optimised and could be used split-screen.The Pixel Tablet also supports multiple accounts, making it more shareable among a household than Apple's iPad, which will help put parents' minds at ease.Most importantly, the dock works as advertised, turning the tablet into an attractive fixture of your living room, with pretty solid speakers for playing music, radio, and podcasts.Read more:Google's first folding phone has eye-watering price\u2026\u2026but it's still some way cheaper than Apple's new headset \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that ever more muddled space between smartphones and tablets, Google will hope its decision to have it flirt with the smart home market proves a master stroke.Considering its history with new products, we'll know in about two years.\n"}, {"_id": "64917cb551ac331c040b432c", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/taking-regular-naps-is-good-for-the-brain-study-finds-12905780", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Taking regular naps is good for the brain", "lead": "Taking a nap during the day can leave you feeling refreshed, recharged and ready to take on the world.

And the figures are reflected on screen - a 2021 diversity study by gaming website Diamond Lobby, of more than 100 of the best-selling titles from the previous five years, found 54% of main characters are white, while just 8% are non-white women.But the celebratory focus of Windrush Tales shifted when, with pre-production barely under way, news broke of a scandal that shook the team's faith to its core. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:40\n\n\n\n\n\n'People traumatised' by Windrush scandal\n\n\n\nThe Windrush scandalBack in 2018, with the 70th anniversary of the Windrush's arrival on the horizon, it emerged that many of those who made the same journey over subsequent decades had been wrongly detained, deported, and denied legal rights by a \"hostile environment policy\" that cracked down on those deemed to have arrived in the UK illegally.Some of those deported later died.Among those worst affected by the government's policy, introduced by the then home secretary Theresa May in 2012, were members of the Windrush generation - who arrived in the UK legally, and with the government's encouragement, between 1948 and 1973. Many, like Rose, took jobs in the NHS - and other sectors impacted by Britain's post-war labour shortage.While indefinite leave to remain was automatically granted upon their arrival in the UK, many weren't issued with any documents confirming their status and were later unable to prove their right to stay when immigration officers came knocking. Jobs and properties were lost, health care and benefits were denied, and in the worst cases, people were deported to countries they barely knew.Read more:Home Office knew policy would hit Windrush generation \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:59\n\n\n\n\n\nI felt like an alien, says Windrush scandal victim\n\n\n\n'A generation were pushed aside'The game's writer Corey Brotherson - who is also a descendant of the Windrush generation - says the scandal shifted the \"entire tone\" of the game, and gave the team extra purpose in their work.\"For a lot of people, Windrush was something that was either not known about much or forgotten,\" he says. \"The contributions of the Windrush generation were pushed aside.

One of his grandfather's first experiences was being ripped off by a taxi driver, and he also struggled for acceptance in the workplace.\"My grandad was a hard worker, but sometimes it was difficult to find work,\" Brotherson says. \"Sometimes if he got a promotion, his white co-workers would be antagonistic towards him.\"It was typical of the racism, bigotry and pushback his generation experienced when they were trying to establish themselves.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nCorey Brotherson, writer of Windrush Tales.

Mr Seymour told the court that Mr Morgan was \"boastful\" and would \"behave foolishly\" at times.The former political journalist also gave details about a story written about Princess Diana, which included a photo of her crying after a visit to her \"saviour\" friend and therapist as she dealt with her divorce from Prince Charles, now the King.Mr Seymour spoke about the article in court, and said in his witness statement: \"The article clearly suggests to readers, and the public, that Princess Diana was upset because of the problems she faced in her life, and having unburdened herself to her therapist.\"However, Mr Seymour said that a few days after the story was published, he remembers seeing Mr Morgan and others watching a video which had been taken by a paparazzi photographer present at the time, which showed why Diana was really upset - after being \"hounded up and down the street by a baying, cat-calling mob of photographers\" from a number of different press organisations.Mr Seymour said in his statement that \"the truth never emerged\" about how the story was obtained and he was \"upset and ashamed that we had printed something so cruel, intrusive and false\".
