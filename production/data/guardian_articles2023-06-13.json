Kiran Stacey has the story here. MPs on the Commons education committee have launched a new inquiry into England\u2019s beleaguered schools inspectorate, Ofsted, looking at the impact of inspections on teachers and school leaders and whether the current ratings system is actually helping schools improve. It follows the death of headteacher Ruth Perry, whose family say she killed herself earlier this year after her primary school was downgraded from \u201coutstanding\u201d to \u201cinadequate\u201d, prompting a national outcry. Yesterday Ofsted announced a number of reforms to try to ease the burden on headteachers, which Perry\u2019s family and the education sector promptly concluded were nowhere near enough. The cross-party committee will examine the current inspection framework, which was first introduced in 2019, and its impact on school standards. MPs will also consider the controversial single-word ratings system used to assess a school, as well as the current complaints procedure available to schools, to see how they might be improved. Robin Walker, the Conservative chair of the committee, said: Despite a growing political consensus that it does have an important part to play, this year has seen a notable groundswell of criticism towards Ofsted, which appears to have stemmed from a feeling that inspections place a high burden on school staff, and a view that one-word ratings do not always fully capture the quality of teaching and care that a school provides to children from a range of backgrounds. Ofsted plays a particularly vital role when it comes to safeguarding but ensuring that inspections are proportionate, timely and reasonable is essential to build trust, especially after the tragic passing of headteacher Ruth Perry. Some have argued that Ofsted\u2019s role should be expanded to provide more support to schools that need to improve, amid concerns around the impact that receiving a negative rating can have on a school\u2019s morale and reputation. It is vital that Ofsted is clear in its role as an independent inspectorate and that it can respond to serious concerns properly when they are raised, which is why we will also want to look carefully at its complaints process. Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, asked the urgent question on UK mortgage costs. Replying to Andrew Griffith, he said the average price of a mortgage was going up by \u00a32,300 this year. He went on: All of this pressure was multiplied by the irresponsible decision of the Conservative government to last year use the country for a giant economic experiment which put booster rockets under mortgage rates while they enacted their teenage right-wing pamphlet fantasies, using the country like lab rats. Homeowners and renters were left to pay the price. The Tories were fighting \u201clike rats in a sack\u201d, he said. He said they were not in a position to address the problem, and should make way for Labour. In his reply, Griffith repeated his argument about this being an international problem. In the US mortgage rates were also going up, he said. Turning away from the Covid inquiry, in the Commons Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has just asked an urgent question about \u201cdevelopments in the mortgage market in recent days\u201d. As Graeme Wearden writes on his business live blog, the government\u2019s short-term borrowing costs now higher than they were during Liz Truss\u2019s brief premiership, when her mini-budget spooked the markets. Graeme says: These two-year gilts are used to price fixed-term mortgages, and the recent increase in yields has already been forcing lenders to re-price deals, or pull them off the markets. There could be more pain ahead too, as the money markets expect Bank of England base rate to hit 5.5% by the end of this year, up from 4.5% today. Andrew Griffith, a Treasury minister, is replying. He said the UK was \u201cnot an outlier in this\u201d and that central banks around the world were putting up interest rates. We are not an outlier in this, as opposition members will know. Central banks around the world are raising interest rates to combat high inflation driven by the pandemic and Putin\u2019s war. But he knew mortgage rates were a concern, he said He said, if customers fell into difficulties, lending rules required lenders to treat them fairly. Repossession was a matter of last resort, he said. He claimed the government was taking action to halve inflation. But Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn borrowing plan would put interest rates up, he claimed. Weatherby says some politicians will argue that austerity put the UK in a good position to deal with the pandemic. But experts will point to its impact on public health, and local authority resilience, he says. Weatherby says the 2011 pandemic flu preparedness plan was the closest thing the government had to a pandemic plan. But it was not adequate, he suggests. Was that fit for purpose for a non-flu pandemic in 2020? Why wasn\u2019t there a whole-system plan? Many civil emergencies are local and require a local response backed up by central government support, where necessary. Wasn\u2019t it obvious that civil emergencies, including pandemics, are by very nature national whole-system emergencies and require national whole-system planning as a result? Options for border controls and screening, travel restrictions and quarantine, maintaining food supplies and public security, enforcing emergency restrictions on movement and assembly, maintaining education and social services systems and protecting the economic well-being of the country and jobs are all matters way beyond the remit of the Department of Health and Social Care. Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, is making his opening statement now. He says that when David Cameron was PM in 2015, he gave a speech to the G7 saying the world had to be better prepared for the threat posed by a pandemic. He says families of those who died want to know whether this advice was actually followed, and whether everything possible was done to prepare the UK for the pandemic. He asks if planning focused on the human impact of a potential pandemic. And he says the inquiry needs to focus on structural discrimination and health inequalities. He says a disproportionate number of CBFFJ families are from black and brown communities. Keith says the year before the pandemic a huge amount of government planning was taking place relating to Brexit, and the risk of a no-deal Brexit. He goes on: The pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union. That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business borders and so on. It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness. Did the attention therefore paid to the risks of a no-deal exit \u2013 Operation Yellowhammer as it was known \u2013 drain the resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic, that should have been utilised in preparing the United Kingdom for civil emergency? Or did all that generic and operational planning in fact lead to people being better trained and well marshalled and, in fact, better prepared to deal with Covid and also to the existence of improved trade, medicine and supply links? Addressing Heather Hallett, the inquiry chair, Keith said: My lady, on the evidence so far, but it will be a matter for you, we very much fear that it was the former. He ends his opening statement by saying the inquiry should also consider whether planning for pandemic considered health inequalities, and how some groups would be more vulnerable. Keith says, in Northern Ireland, power sharing was suspended between January 2017 and January 2020. Northern Ireland was managed by civil servants, he says. He says the inquiry will consider \u201cto what extent that lack of ministerial input affected the civil emergency arrangements, and in particular the inability, because of the collapse of the power sharing agreement, to make any significant improvements to this structure during that interregnum\u201d. Keith is again referring to the emergency planning flowchart cited earlier. (See 11.13am.) It shows that local resilience forums were often in the lead. But was that the right approach, he asks. He also points out that there are bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland duplicating what UK bodies are doing. After a short break, Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, is continuing his opening statement. He says \u201cvery little thought\u201d was given ahead of Covid as to whether a lockdown might be needed if a pandemic struck the UK, and how it might be implemented. Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it\u2019s a word that\u2019s forever seared in the nation\u2019s consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided. Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all. Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy in trying to control a runaway virus in this way. He again suggests \u2018\u201ccomplacency\u201d was a factor. Was there an element of complacency based on our recent experiences, including the ranking in the Global Health Security Index? Or our response to swine flu in 2009 and the UK\u2019s undoubted successes in ensuring Sars and Mers did not spread? Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting? He asks whether an agency should have had full control over emergency planning. He goes on: Perhaps there should be a central leadership position accountable to parliament, with responsibility for whole system preparedness, resilience and response. Keith says the government prepared for a flu pandemic. You will hear evidence that, for many years, an influenza pandemic was assessed as being one of the most likely risks to the United Kingdom. But what about other risks that, whilst they might be less likely, could be just as, if not more, deadly? Did planning sufficiently address the risk not only of the known but the unknown? A new pathogen, a new disease, a disease X as it\u2019s known, with pandemic potential? Did planners pay sufficient focus on potential impact as opposed to likelihood? With Covid, the evidence will demonstrate that the government thought that the greater risk was an influenza pandemic and therefore devoted more time and resources to that possibility. In the event, we were hit of course by a coronavirus \u2013 that might suggest a lack of flexibility or proper foresight. Or perhaps the policies, plans and structures were so flexible and broad \u2026 that this prevented us from focusing enough upon those particular risks which, whilst being perhaps less likely, could cause us more harm? The inquiry will have to consider whether planning became \u201cself-validating or complacent\u201d, he says. He says an influenza pandemic might have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. But, because that was risk, did it mean people did not consider other threats? And he says the government had antiviral medicines stocked up for a flu pandemic. But did this mean that, while the government was thinking of dealing with the consequences of a pandemic, it was not thinking about how it could avoid a different sort of pandemic in the first place? To what extent did United Kingdom government and devolved administrations have a strategy for preventing a pandemic from having disastrous effects, as opposed to dealing with the disastrous effects of the pandemic and the reasonable worst case scenario? He repeats the point about testing not being such a requirement with flu (see 10.48am), implying that the UK should have had more testing capacity for a virus like Covid. At the Covid inquiry Hugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry, is now talking specifically about the government\u2019s preparedness. He says: It is obvious that the degree to which Covid-19 could be prevented from laying waste to society was a matter within the control of government. And the systems for the EPR [emergency preparedness and response] existed \u2026 Systems may not be able to stop a pandemic in its tracks, but they ought to be able to put in place measures of understanding of virus, understanding and forecasting how it might develop, tracking it, limiting transmission and coping with the consequences of large-scale transmission. Keith then shows a diagram showing how the system was supposed to work. This is from the Times\u2019 Tom Whipple. Keith is now talking about the impact of lockdown. Almost every area of public life across all four nations, including education, work, travel, the majority of public services and family life, were adversely affected. The hospitality, retail, travel and tourism, arts and culture, and the sport and leisure sectors effectively ceased. Even places of worship closed. For very many, what they had to deal with when far beyond the curtailment of their normal lives and involve bereavement, serious illness, deprivation, mental illness, exposure to violence at home, terrible financial loss, loneliness, and many other forms of suffering. Keith says the UK had not prepared for a non-flu pandemic. That was relevant to testing capacity, he says. With flu, testing is less necessary, he suggests, because with flu you are more likely to show symptoms. You know you have a bug, you go home possibly to bed and you try not to pass it on and tests aren\u2019t needed. Keith is now setting out a chronology of events at the outbreak of the pandemic. He says that this module will focus on preparedness. And he goes on: Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all. UPDATE: Keith said: No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be. No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared. Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, is now making his opening statement. He says we may never know where the Sars-CoV-2 virus, that led to the pandemic, originated. And we may never know who the first person was to be affected. No inquiry could look into all aspects of the pandemic, he says. But this inquiry will focus on those areas of the pandemic that caused \u201cthe greatest public concern\u201d in the UK, and where there is a need to make urgent reccommentations. Heather Hallett, the inquiry chair, asks attendants to tell people who left the room because they were going to find the video too upsetting that they can now return. She says the film was distressing for everyone, but would have been particularly distressing for relatives. The video ends with a woman saying that, in order to move on, relatives have to know lessons will be learned from the inquiry. A woman says it \u201creally hurts\u201d not being able to give someone a proper funeral, and make their \u201cfinal journey lovely\u201d. She is almost in tears. Another woman says she still suffers from anxiety, and still wears her mask wherever she goes. And another woman says, in Caribbean culture, hundreds of people attend a funeral. In her case, only 20 people were allowed. And the body was sealed in a bag. The family were not even allowed to break the lock on it. A woman from Northern Ireland says in Northern Ireland wakes are important part of the grieving process. She says she cannot go to the cemetery now, because it reminds her of the workers in white suits and masks at the funeral, telling them their time was up. Her mother did not get a celebration of her life, she says. She says she feels that she failed her as a result. A man recalls calling 999 when he was really ill. He woke up again in hospital. When he did wake up, he learned his wife had died. They had been married for 48 years. A woman recalls her father\u2019s funeral. There were just 15 people there. She did not hug anyone, from when she learned her father was dying until after the funeral. It was a very lonely time. Grief was compounded by loneliness, she says. A woman recalls taking her mother to hospital. They \u201cwaited and waited and waited\u201d. Then a doctor called, who just announced that her mother had passed away. She was expecting to go and see her again, but she was told she had died. The video features multiple clips from participants. The woman who was featured earlier, talking about her father and sisted dying within five days of each other, is talking about the moment her sister died. A woman, Jane, recalls her father being taken to hospital. She accompanied him, and urged her dad \u201cto be the strongest you\u2019ve every been\u201d. Another woman recalls being so ill she was \u201cspitting blood\u201d. She went to hospital, and was taken to ICU where she was intubated. She woke up six weeks later. On three occasions she was so unwell they stopped treatment. But slowly and steadily she recovered. The video is being shown now. It features interviews with members of the public recalling their experience of the pandemic. One woman recalls, at the start of the pandemic, discussing with her boss how they would know people who would die as the pandemic developed. But she never realised it would be \u201cmy dad and my sister five days apart\u201d, she says, holding back tears. Hallett says the inquiry will shortly play a 17-minute video about the impact of the pandemic. It is very moving, she says. She says people in the room who do not want to watch are free to leave. Hallett says that she hopes that the inquiry\u2019s recommendations will over time \u201csave lives and reduce suffering in the future\u201d. She also confirms that she intends to publish reports as she goes along. She says: My plan, as people now know, is to publish reports as we go along. So that when the hearings for this module finish, work will begin on preparing the report for this module. When that report is ready, it will be published. In the meantime, the other module teams and I will be working on the next modules. Heather Hallett, the inquiry chair, is opening the hearing. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. She starts by referencing the vigil by relatives of people who have been outside the inquiry building. Their grief was obvious, she says. She says on behalf of those people she intends to answer three questions. Was the UK properly prepared for a pandemic? Was the response to it appropriate? And can we learn lessons for the future? She says an \u201cextraordinary amount of work\u201d has already been done by the inquiry team. Q: Do you use ChatGPT and what do you ask it? Starmer says he has a 14-year-old son who gives him a \u201cmasterclass\u201d on this every day. He does not see it as outlandish. He thinks of its as something that will be part of his life. What it can do is incredible. But Starmer also says he sees the potential impact of AI in his work all the time. For example, he recently talked about how it can be used to improve scanning for cancer, he says. Keir Starmer is speaking at London Tech Week now. There is a live feed here. He says this time last year Boris Johnson was PM. Now we are on our third PM, and our fourth chancellor since then, he says. And we have three byelections just caused by political fallout. Essentially they have been caused by \u201cpolitical tantrums\u201d, he says. He says that is \u201cunprecedented\u201d. There is a price, he says. People want government to focus on the cost of living, not issues like this. And he says disruption likes this affects the reputation of the UK. And it deters investors. Q: What effect will the implosion of the SNP have? Starmer says the implosion of the SNP has been profound. It has had two effects. First, it has led to the SNP\u2019s record in government being examined. And it is not very good, he says. And he says people are open to listening to Labour\u2019s case as to what it could do for Scotland. Keir Starmer is giving a speech to the London Tech Week conference this morning. According to extracts released in advance, he will argue that artificial intelligence will pose challenges that will require \u201cLabour values\u201d from government if it is going to ensure that everyone benefits. He will say: Our country is facing a choice about who benefits from the huge disruption that tech will bring. Will it be those who already hold wealth and power, or will it be the starter firms trying to break in and disrupt the industry, the patients trying to book at appointment with their GP, the worker using technology to enhance and improve their role \u2026 The question facing our country is who will benefit from this disruption? Will it leave some behind, as happened with de-industrialisation across vast swathes of our country? Or can it help build a society where everyone is included, and inequalities are narrowed not widened? This moment calls for Labour values, of working in partnership with business, driving technology to the public good, and ensuring people and places aren\u2019t left behind. Labour would take a whole-economy approach, recognising that tech is not just a sector, but every job and every business must become digital if we are to address the UK\u2019s productivity problem. Diffusing the latest technology across our economy and public services will be as important as supporting the latest unicorns. Three years of public hearings by the Covid inquiry is \u201cfar too long\u201d according to a Tory peer who served as a health minister over the period examined and who warned this morning that Britain had now \u201cgone backwards\u201d in terms of planning for a future pandemic. Lord Bethell told Sky News: The desire to answer the concerns of families is entirely right but there are practical matters for what should be done in preparing this country for another pandemic that is likely some time in the future. \u201cThat work should be done today and it\u2019s taking far too long to learn the practical lessons of the mistakes we made the first time round. The peer was speaking ahead of the beginning this morning of public hearings by the UK\u2019s Covid Inquiry, which is initially looking at pandemic preparedness. But while the inquiry is not due to conclude hearings until 2026, new mistakes had already been made, he said, pointing to the dismantlement of testing facilities while surveillance was \u201cnot good enough\u201d. He went on: We have gone backwards rather than forwards in terms of planning for any future pandemic. We do not have a good pandemic plan in place. The deputy leader of the SNP, Keith Brown, has insisted that Humza Yousaf is \u201csticking to principles of natural justice\u201d as he resists demands to suspend his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon. Yousaf has refused to bow to calls from opposition and a handful of SNP politicians to remove the whip from Sturgeon or suspend her membership following her arrest on Sunday as party of the ongoing investigation into the party\u2019s finances. Brown told BBC Radio Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon has not been charged, she has not been accused of anything, the arrest I appreciate is a dramatic thing to have happened and its perhaps not well understood that arrest is to ensure the interview and information gathering is put on to a formal footing. Asked about instances within the SNP of Sturgeon suspending Margaret Ferrier, Michelle Thomson and others because of their involvement with police investigations, Brown said \u201cthere are different circumstances in each of these cases\u201d. Brown said it was \u201cfairly straightforward\u201d that Yousaf had said he was not taking steps to suspend Sturgeon. Asked if there needed to be a more transparent process rather than simply having the first minister making the decision, Brown said Yousaf had taken early action to review governance and transparency in the SNP. Brown said he had not spoken to Sturgeon in the last few days but that she had made a \u201cvery strong defence of her position\u201d in the statement she posted immediately following her release that protested her innocence. Good morning. Today marks the start of an event that will be in the news, and will dominate public policy thinking, for years. The Covid inquiry has been up and running since last year. But until now all the public hearings have been on procedural matters. This morning marks the start of the evidence-gathering stage of hearings and, after an opening statement this morning from Heather Hallett, the chair, and statements from counsel for the core participants, the first witnesses will be up tomorrow. These hearings focus on \u201cresilience and preparedness\u201d and the really interesting hearings will start next week, when David Cameron, George Osborne and Jeremy Hunt are expected to appear. Yesterday Boris Johnson formally resigned as an MP, ending, or reducing, his exposure to parliamentary scrutiny. But the inquiry may expose him to a more intense level of scrutiny than he has faced before. Public inquiries of this kind always take years, and so Johnson and other ministers may be assuming that judgment day will be some way off. But, as Paul Waugh pointed out in an i column recently, that would be to misunderstand how this inquiry is operating. He explained: Crucially, some critics have missed the simple fact that the modular nature of this inquiry means that Hallett and her team will be making regular reports after each (a few months apart), complete with recommendations for action as well as key findings. Unlike the Chilcot inquiry into Iraq, there won\u2019t be years of evidence and then \u201cone big\u201d report in 2026. Here is Robert Booth\u2019s guide to how the inquiry will operate. And here is Nimo Omer\u2019s guide to some of the wider issues at stake. The inquiry proceedings get going as the Johnson \u201cclown show\u201d (as Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar calls it) continues to preoccupy the Conservative party \u2013 and most of the rest of Westminster too. I\u2019ll be covering that as well. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Keir Starmer gives a speech at London Tech Week. 10am: Heather Hallett, chair of the Covid inquiry, opens the evidence-taking stage of its work with a statement. Then there will be opening statements from counsel. The first witnesses will appear tomorrow. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Afternoon: Peers will debate the Public Order Act 1986 (serious disruption to the life of the community) regulations 2023, a new law that that makes it easier for the police to stop peaceful protests, and a motion tabled by the Green peer Jenny Jones to block the regulations.

I turned around and then saw the two people on the floor, on the road. Someone was screaming. I think a gentleman ran over to help as well. The police were there straight away, then the ambulance arrived and they got the two people in the ambulance and got them sent off to whichever hospital. Another witness in Nottingham has described the moment she saw a man and a woman hit by a van, with her account tallying largely with that given in respect of the same incident by Lynn Haggitt (see 11.09am). Frances, who did not publicly give her surname, told Sky News she was on her way to work and was near Theatre Royal in the city centre when she saw the van hit the two people. There was a male and a female. The female, she could speak. She was in pain from the impact of hitting the ground. She had hit her head but was still able to speak. Then the gentleman as well took the full brunt of the van and he had head injuries but was still awake. He didn\u2019t lose consciousness, he was still awake at that stage. Armed police officers, some wearing balaclavas, have been seen on Ilkeston Road, a few hundred yards above the main cordon, the PA news agency reports. Police appeared to enter a commercial property on the street, with two young women eventually put in the back of a marked car. Several unmarked police vehicles carrying armed officers then left, after the section of the road was cordoned off. Here\u2019s a map showing where the incidents we know of so far happened: We reported earlier that a van was being guarded by police on a street to the north-west of Nottingham city centre (see 11.46am). A little more detail from the PA news agency, which says that \u2013 viewed from the other side of the cordon \u2013 the van has clear damage to its bonnet and windscreen. There are two dents on the bonnet, just above the radiator grille, and two sets of corresponding cracks radiating out from two points on the windscreen, the agency reports. Residents gathered at the cordon said they were disturbed by shouting just before 5.30am, but that this was not unusual because the street is home to several drug rehabilitation establishments. A witness has told the BBC he saw a young man and young woman being stabbed on Ilkeston Road, close to the junction with Bright Street in Nottingham, at about 4am. The man, who did not give his name, told the broadcaster he heard \u201cawful, bloodcurdling screams\u201d and looked out his window to see a \u201cblack guy dressed all in black with a hood and rucksack grappling with some people\u201d. She was screaming \u2018Help!\u2019 I just wish I\u2019d shouted something out of the window to unnerve the assailant. I saw him stab the lad first and then the woman. The lad collapsed in the middle of the road. The girl stumbled towards a house and didn\u2019t move. The next minute she had disappeared down the side of a house, and that\u2019s where they found her. I\u2019d say it all happened within five or six minutes. The man said he called the police, who arrived within five minutes, before paramedics tried to revive the pair for 40 minutes. Two police patrol cars were parked inside a cordon near the TK Maxx store on Milton Street, with armed police present, the PA news agency reports. An adjacent cordon stretching several hundred metres along Mansfield Road was also in place, in the direction of the fatality in Magdala Road. A person who entered the Milton Street cordon shorty before 11.30am was taken to the ground by police officers near a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, before being carried to a police van and driven away. The area around a white Vauxhall Vivaro van left on a street to the north-west of Nottingham city centre has been cordoned off, the PA news agency reports. The van had been left a short distance from the pavement, with its passenger door open, and what looked like a black bag on the road near the door. Police were guarding the cordon by a convenience store. However, they were staying clear of the vehicle, with no forensic activity evidently under way. Kane Brady, a student at the University of Nottingham, told GB News he saw a knife being taken from a white van after a man was arrested outside his house on the street. We woke up to shouts of \u2018armed police\u2019 and what \u2026 sounded like some very loud noises, what sounded like gunshots \u2013 it was that loud. I looked out the bedroom window and saw Tasers. I saw a man being dragged out [of the van] and pinned to the floor. I saw him getting arrested, him trying to resist. I then later saw when they opened the van, I saw a large knife being pulled out and then straight away that\u2019s when police closed off both roads, both Maples Street and Bentinck Road. The city\u2019s two professional football clubs, Nottingham Forest and Notts County, have reacted to the incident. The former has tweeted: We are devastated to learn the news of the horrific events that took place in Nottingham this morning. The thoughts of everyone at #NFFC are with the friends and families of those who have tragically lost their lives and to everyone affected by this incident.

The PA news agency reports that two forensic officers arrived and appeared to spend the majority of their time at a bathroom and plumbing business called Willbond. The forensic officers eventually left the scene on foot with a black crate and large plastic bag. A witness, Lynn Haggitt, has said she saw a van hitting two people in Nottingham. She told Channel 4 News: At half past five, I saw a van pull up at the side of me. It was white, all white. There was a police car behind it coming up slowly, no flashing lights. The man in the driver\u2019s seat looked in his mirror and saw the police car behind him. She said the white van then drove up to \u201cthe corner of the street and went into two people\u201d. The lady ended up on the curb, and then he backed up the white van and he went, speeded up Parliament Street with the police cars following him. Asked if the people hit were hurt badly, she said a man appeared to have a head injury. \u201cThey did get him to his feet,\u201d she added, and said of the woman who was hit: \u201cShe was sitting up on the curb, to me she looked OK\u201d. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, has said she is saddened at the deaths in Nottingham, and has spoken with the chief constable of Nottinghamshire police. She tweeted: I am shocked and saddened that three people have lost their lives today in Nottingham. My thoughts are with those affected by this incident ... I am thankful to the emergency services for their response. Nottingham\u2019s three members of parliament \u2013 Nadia Whittome, Alex Norris and Lilian Greenwood \u2013 have released a joint statement on this morning\u2019s incident: Our city has been devastated by the deaths of three people this morning. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have died and those injured. We are grateful for the efforts of the city\u2019s emergency responders in tackling these incidents. They must be allowed to do their jobs in investigating them. Nottingham is a beautiful city, home to brilliant people from all backgrounds. We are shaken by today\u2019s events but will meet them collectively as a community and heal together. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, addressed the incident during a talk at London Tech Week this morning. There has been a serious incident in Nottingham this morning \u2026 Three people have lost their lives, so I\u2019m sure I speak for everybody in this room when I say we\u2019d like to just send our thoughts to all those affected and the emergency services who are responding to this as we speak. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said his thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones. He tweeted: I want to thank the police and emergency services for their ongoing response to the shocking incident in Nottingham this morning. I am being kept updated on developments. The police must be given the time to undertake their work. My thoughts are with those injured, and the family and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.

Our community\u2019s thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. Our gratitude is with our blue light responders for their work today also. Counter-terrorism police are understood to be assisting the investigation as detectives try to understand what triggered the incidents. Regular police remain in the lead, several hours after the first attack, which was just after 4am. The three attacks have not been declared a terrorist incident, with police urgently investigating the background of the man they have in custody as they try to determine a motive. To understand what happened, police will try to find and examine any phones or computers the suspect used. Road closures in place include Ilkeston Road, Milton Street, Maples Street and Woodborough Road, from the junction with Magdala Road into the city. The tram network is also disrupted, with all services suspended on the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) as the police investigation continued. Glen Gretton, a local resident, said he was woken up at around 5am on Tuesday morning by the sounds of a series of police cars passing his home. The 46-year-old delivery driver, who lives in a flat in Mansfield Road in Sherwood, told the PA news agency: I heard a police car go past. It was driving extremely quickly, followed by another one, another one. They just kept coming so I knew something quite major ... was happening somewhere around the city centre. Police have said two people were found dead in the street in Ilkeston Road just after 4am this morning. A third man was found dead in Magdala Road. Another three people are in hospital after someone tried to run them over in a van in Milton Street, in what police believe is a connected incident. A 31-year-old man has since been arrested. Police have said they are still \u201cworking to establish exactly what has happened\u201d. We\u2019ve got a bit more detail from Nottinghamshire police. Chief constable Kate Meynell said: This is an horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people. We believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody. This investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened. We ask the public to be patient while inquiries continue.

In its daily briefing, the defence ministry also said Ukraine was continuing to mount attacks in the south Donetsk and Bakhmut areas. Ukraine has said its forces have recaptured a number of villages from Russian forces in the south-east since starting its long-anticipated counteroffensive last week. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group, said on Tuesday that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d if Wagner would stay in Ukraine after having taken the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut after a months-long battle. Wagner mercenaries have in the past been active in Africa and the Middle East and still have some contracts there, Reuters reported. A 72-year-old priest was killed in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian settlement of Bilozerka in southern Kherson region, the head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office said on Tuesday. Artillery fire struck the courtyard of a church and also injured a 76-year-old woman, Andriy Yermak said on Telegram messenger, Reuters reported. The shelling damaged four residential buildings, the post office, administrative buildings, the central square as well as critical infrastructure, he added. The death toll from flooding in two Russian-controlled towns in southern Ukraine has risen to 17 one week after a massive dam holding back a reservoir was breached, a Russian-installed official said on Tuesday. Andrei Alekseyenko, chair of the Russian-installed administration in the Kherson region, said 12 people were confirmed dead in Hola Prystan and five in Oleshky, two small towns downstream from the breached Kakhovka dam. Reuters could not independently verify the figures. Hundreds of people were rescued by boat from the roofs of flooded houses in the wake of the disaster, but volunteers told Russian independent media outlet iStories last week that they estimated the death toll in the hundreds. Russia controls the south bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson region, while Ukraine holds Kherson city on the opposite bank, as well as Mykolaiv region farther north. At least 10 people were killed in a Russian missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Tuesday, the city mayor has said. \u201cAs of 1300 (1000 GMT) 10 people have been killed,\u201d Oleksandr Vilkul said in a Telegram post, adding that another person was under the rubble and a further 28 were injured. The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Tuesday that the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus would serve as a deterrent against a potential aggressor and that there should be no hesitation in using them if required. Reuters reports his comments were carried by the Belta news agency. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Friday that Russia would start deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus on 7-8 July after special storage facilities were made ready. It will be the first time that Russian nuclear weapons have been stationed outside the country\u2019s borders since weapons on the territories of Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan were returned to Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The US has tactical nuclear weapons at six bases in five Nato member countries: Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. Russia\u2019s FSB security service said on Tuesday it had arrested a group of former defence industry workers it suspects of supplying Ukraine with sensitive military information and of planning sabotage attacks. Reuters reports the FSB accused the unnamed ex-workers of spying for Ukrainian military intelligence and of handing over technical documents and models used in the manufacture of weapons systems and equipment for Russia\u2019s air force. It said in a statement that the same group was also involved in plans to blow up transport infrastructure such as railway lines used to supply Russian forces fighting in Ukraine At least six people were killed and 25 injured after the Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih destroyed a five-storey residential building. Russian airstrikes hit several civilian structures in the city, including a five-storey building, said the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, Oleksandr Vilkul, adding \u201clikely, there are people under the rubble\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has reported small incremental advances for Ukrainian forces near Bakhmut and Toretsk. She said in a message on Telegram that Ukraine had advanced 250 metres in the direction of Bakhmut in the area of the Berkhiv reservoir, and 200 metres in the Toretsk direction. She also claimed that 3 sq km of territory had been captured in the Berdiansk direction. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has released video footage of what it claims were German-made Leopard tanks and US-made Bradley fighting vehicles captured by Russian forces in a battle with Ukrainian forces. In a message on Telegram, the ministry said some of the vehicles still had their engines running, illustrating the rapid flight of the crews during the battle. The location and timing of the video footage has not been independently verified. Russian military bloggers appear to be claiming that Makarivka, one of the villages that Ukraine said it had liberated in the last couple of days, is back in Russian hands. The claims have not been independently verified. Forty-one people are still missing in the floods caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, while the death toll now stands at 10, Ukrainian officials have said. Regional head Oleksandr Prokudin reports there are currently 3,600 houses in 31 settlements that remain flooded on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro. The water level has dropped by 27cm, and in the past day water has receded from 200 houses. On Monday, Ukraine accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine\u2019s advances in western Donetsk. Russian media reported that a Ukrainian missile strike on the southern Zaporizhzhia front killed an experienced Russian general. \u201cAs a result of an enemy missile attack, the Chief of Staff of the 35th Combined Arms Army, Maj Gen Sergei Goryachev, was killed,\u201d the prominent pro-war blogger Voenkor said in a Telegram post. Goryachev, a decorated commander, previously led Russian troops in Moldova\u2019s breakaway region of Transnistria. The Russian defence ministry is yet to comment on the reports. Early morning shelling by Ukraine on two villages in Russia\u2019s Kursk region damaged several houses and disrupted gas and electricity supply, according to the local governor. A fire broke out at an oil refinery in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region overnight, Russia\u2019s RBK news outlet reported, citing the local city administration. RBK reported that the fire was now contained and its cause was not immediately clear. The head of the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, will arrive in Kyiv on Tuesday to meet Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, before heading to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The US ambassador to Ukraine has commented on the overnight attacks. Bridget Brink tweeted: Another night of Russian missiles, another morning of shattered homes. No matter the lies Russia\u2019s mouthpieces emit about its war on Ukraine, its attacks on civilians, and the devastation it leaves behind, this morning\u2019s images make the awful truth perfectly clear. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has reported small incremental advances for Ukrainian forces on Telegram. She posted to say: In the course of the offensive operation, during the past day, our troops advanced 250m in the direction of Bakhmut in the area of the Berkhiv reservoir. In the Toretsk direction \u2013 200m. In the Berdiansk direction, between 0.5km to 1km, the area of the territory taken under control was up to 3 sq km. She added that the situation was difficult, saying: The enemy is doing everything to keep the positions captured by him. Actively uses assault and army aviation, conducts intense artillery fire. During the offensive, our troops encounter continuous minefields, which are combined with anti-tank ditches. All this is combined with constant counterattacks by enemy units on armored vehicles and the massive use of anti-tank guided missile and kamikaze drones. The claims have not been independently verified. My colleague Dan Sabbagh notes that Russian military bloggers appear to be claiming that one of the villages that Ukraine said it had liberated in the last couple of days is back in Russian hands. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from the flooded areas of Kherson over the news wires. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has released video footage of what it claims were German-made Leopard tanks and US-made Bradley fighting vehicles captured by Russian forces in a battle with Ukrainian forces. The location and timing of the video footage has not been independently verified. In a message on Telegram, the ministry said: Servicemen of the subdivisions of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle. All captured western-made equipment: German Leopard tanks and US-made BMP Bradley. Some combat vehicles with running engines, which indicates the transience of the battle and the flight of the crews of combat vehicles of the armed forces of Ukraine from combat-ready equipment. Russian media reported on Monday that a Ukrainian missile strike on the southern Zaporizhzhia front killed an experienced Russian general. \u201cAs a result of an enemy missile attack, the Chief of Staff of the 35th Combined Arms Army, Maj Gen Sergei Goryachev, was killed,\u201d the prominent pro-war blogger Voenkor said in a Telegram post. Goryachev, a decorated commander, previously led Russian troops in Moldova\u2019s breakaway region of Transnistria. Voenkor added that \u201caccording to representatives of the command of the United Group of Forces (S), the army has lost today one of the brightest and most effective military leaders\u201d. Several Russian war bloggers said Goryachev was likely killed by a UK-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missile. The Russian defence ministry is yet to comment on the reported death of Goryachev. More than a dozen Russian generals are believed to have been killed since Moscow invaded Ukraine. The Zaporizhzhia region, of which about 80% is controlled by Russian forces, is believed to be one of the main focuses of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. Here are some of the images from Kryvyi Rih sent to us over the news wires. The UN humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, Denise Brown, has strongly condemned this morning\u2019s attack on Kryvyi Rih. In a statement she said: Russia\u2019s invasion has, once again, claimed lives and brought suffering to the people of Ukraine. This morning, an attack on Kryvyi Rih has hit a residential building, killing and injuring many civilians. International humanitarian law is clear: civilians and civilian infrastructure are not a target! Yesterday the Russian Federation president, Vladimir Putin, in comments carried by Tass, accused Ukraine of targeting civilians, saying it made no military sense. He said: Why, frankly, is the enemy hitting residential areas? No logic. For what, why, what\u2019s the point? And obviously humanitarian targets \u2013 it\u2019s amazing. And there is no military sense, it\u2019s zero. Here is a video report from Kryvyi Rih, where at least six people are now known to have died. The death toll in the Kryvyi Rih strike has risen to six, Reuters reports, citing the local mayor. This video clip is being shared on social media which purports to show the result of the impact in one of the apartments near the strike. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has cautioned that \u201ckey decisions\u201d still have to be taken by the international community, highlighting the overnight deaths in Kryvyi Rih. He posted to Twitter to say: Kryvyi Rih. An apartment building was hit. 3 dead, 25 wounded, unknown number of people under the rubble. And this kind of thing happens every night. Because the Russian Federation is blatantly destroying Ukraine. I understand that sitting thousands of kilometers away from Ukraine you can talk about \u201cgeopolitics\u201d, \u201csettlement\u201d and the undesirability of escalation for months. And allow the rampage of the \u201cRussian world\u201d. But the key decisions will still have to be made \u2013 Russia is bound to lose and sit in the dock \u2026 Early morning shelling by Ukraine on two villages in Russia\u2019s Kursk region damaged several houses and disrupted gas and electricity supply, according to the governor of the local region. Roman Starovoyt claimed nine houses were damaged and gas and power supplies disrupted in the village of Tyorkino, while several houses were damaged in the village of Glushkovo. Both sit close to the border with Ukraine. The claims have not been independently verified. A fire broke out at an oil refinery in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region overnight, Russia\u2019s RBK news outlet reported, citing the local city administration. RBK reported that the fire was now contained and its cause was not immediately clear. Last month, the region\u2019s local governor said a Ukrainian drone was the likely cause of a fire that broke out in the area\u2019s Afipsky oil refinery. Ukraine denied responsibility. The Afipsky refinery is not far from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, near another refinery that has been attacked several times. Citing regional head Oleksandr Prokudin, Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reports there are currently 3,600 houses in 31 settlements that remain flooded on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro. It reports that the water level has dropped by 27cm, and that in the past day water has receded from 200 houses in the Kherson region. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

The head of the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog will arrive in Kyiv on Tuesday to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy, before heading to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Since the beginning of the conflict, Rafael Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned of the potential for a nuclear accident at the plant, which he has previously visited twice and where a permanent IAEA team is based. The Russian-held Kakhovka dam \u2013 which was breached last week in an incident blamed by Kyiv on Moscow \u2013 forms a reservoir that provides the cooling water for the Russian-occupied plant. The IAEA has warned that the Kakhovka dam disaster has \u201c[complicated] an already precarious nuclear safety and security situation\u201d. Grossi said he would \u201cpresent a programme of assistance in the aftermath of the catastrophic Nova Kakhovka dam flooding\u201d. Rescue operations are under way in Kryvyi Rih, at the site of the five-storey apartment building and destroyed warehouse that were hit by Russian strikes overnight, the governor of the local region has said. The city\u2019s mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, said at least seven people were believed to be trapped under the rubble, without providing more details. Previously, governor Serhiy Lysak said \u201cthere are still people under the rubble of a building. There was a fire there.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was born in Kryvyi Rih, condemned the attack on his home town. On Monday, Ukraine accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine\u2019s advances in western Donetsk. Ukrainian troops have moved along both sides of the river over the last week, liberating villages along the way. Valeriy Shershen, a Ukrainian military spokesperson for that sector of the front, told the Ukrainska Pravda news agency that a dam upstream along the Mokri Yaly had been blown up by occupation forces, causing flooding on both banks. Shershen said the Russian aim had been to \u201cslow down Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive\u201d but claimed it had failed. The dam appears to have been at the village of Klyuchove but its destruction could not be independently verified. Forty-one people are still missing in the floods caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, while the death toll now stands at 10, Ukrainian officials have said. The dam, in Russian-controlled territory along the frontline in the Kherson region, was destroyed on 6 June, forcing thousands to flee and sparking fears of a humanitarian as well as environmental catastrophe. \u201cCurrently, we know about 10 dead in Kherson and the region,\u201d Ukrainian interior minister Igor Klymenko said on Telegram. \u201cWe are also reporting 41 people as missing.\u201d The governor of the Kherson region, the area most affected by the flooding, said two bodies were found on Monday in the regional capital. \u201cToday, an unidentified woman and a 50-year-old man were found drowned in one of the city\u2019s districts,\u201d Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram. A day earlier, Prokudin said three people were killed as Russia shelled a rescue boat evacuating people after the devastating floods. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has described fighting in the long awaited counteroffensive as \u201ctough\u201d but added \u201cwe are moving forward\u201d. \u201cI thank our guys for every Ukrainian flag that is now returning to its rightful place in villages on the newly de-occupied territory,\u201d he said in his nightly address. The country\u2019s defence ministry said \u201cseven settlements were liberated\u201d in the last week of fighting in Donetsk. \u201cThe area of the territory taken under control amounted to 90 square kilometres,\u201d the deputy defence minister said. In the last few days, Ukrainian forces have declared the liberation of a string of villages along the Mokri Yaly river: Blahodatne, Neskuchne, Makarivka and Storozheve among them. However, sources reported that Russian troops launched a large counterattack against Ukrainian forces on Monday, according to thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Some Russian sources reported that the village of Makarivka was retaken in this operation, the ISW reports. At least three people were killed and 25 injured after the Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih destroyed a five-storey residential building, Serhiy Lisak, the governor of Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region said on Tuesday. \u201cThere are still people under the rubble,\u201d Lisak wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Four people were injured at another location in the city, he added. President Zelenskiy shared video footage of the aftermath of the Kryvyi Rih strike, saying \u201cunfortunately, there are dead and wounded \u2026 Terrorists will never be forgiven, and they will be held accountable for every missile they launch.\u201d Russia launched a \u201cmassive missile attack\u201d overnight on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, killing and wounding people and damaging civilian infrastructure, officials said early on Tuesday. \u201cThere are dead and wounded,\u201d Serhiy Lisak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region where Kryvyi Rih is located, said on the Telegram messaging app. Russian airstrikes hit several civilian structures in the city, including a five-storey building, said the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, Oleksandr Vilkul, adding \u201clikely, there are people under the rubble\u201d. The governor posted a photograph of a five-storey apartment block with all windows blown out and smoke coming out of the building. During the early hours of Tuesday, air raid sirens blared across the whole of Ukraine. Kyiv military officials said air defence systems destroyed all Russian missiles targeting the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine\u2019s top military command said 10 out of the 14 cruise missiles Russia launched on the country were destroyed, as well as one of the four Iranian-made drones. The mayor of Kharkiv said Russian drones hit civilian infrastructure there, striking a warehouse and a utility firm\u2019s building. There was no immediate information about casualties. Welcome back to our live coverage of the ongoing war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Jonathan Yerushalmy \u2013 first here\u2019s a round-up of all the latest news. A number of people were killed and injured after Russia launched a \u201cmassive missile attack\u201d overnight on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, officials said early on Tuesday. Russian airstrikes hit several civilian structures in the city, including a five-storey building, said the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, Oleksandr Vilkul. \u201cLikely, there are people under the rubble,\u201d he added. Elsewhere, Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry has said 90 square km of territory has been retaken in Donetsk in the last week, adding that \u201cseven settlements were liberated\u201d. Over the same period, Ukrainian troops have recaptured 16 square km in the area around Bakhmut, the deputy defence minister said. More on these stories shortly, before that, here are the other key developments today: Ukraine accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive. Valeriy Shershen, a Ukrainian military spokesperson, said the Russian military blew up a dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine\u2019s advances in western Donetsk. \u201cThe fighting is tough, but we are moving forward, this is very important,\u201d said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his daily evening address. \u201cI thank our guys for every Ukrainian flag that is now returning to its rightful place in villages on the newly de-occupied territory.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the long-awaited counteroffensive would be under way for weeks if not months. \u201cWe want it to be as successful as possible so that we can then start a negotiation phase in good conditions.\u201d The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Monday it was too soon to say exactly where Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive was going, but Washington was confident of its success in trying to take back land seized by Russia. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, Blinken said the US was determined to maximise its support for Ukraine so that it could succeed on the battlefield. Forty-one people were still missing in the floods caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, while the death toll stood at 10 people, Ukraine\u2019s interior minister said. One man was killed and another was wounded in a Russian attack on the small town of Orikhiv, in the Zaporizhzhia region of south-eastern Ukraine, the regional governor, Yuri Malashko, said on Monday. Malashko said three bombs damaged private houses and communications in the small town, about 8km from frontlines. The man killed was 48 and the one who was wounded was 32, Reuters reported Malashko as saying. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Monday he was concerned that Russia would on 17 July quit a deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertilisers from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Moscow has been threatening to walk away from the deal, known as the Black Sea grain initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July last year, if obstacles to its own grain and fertiliser shipments are not removed. The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations are working on a scheme to combat the suspected theft of Ukraine\u2019s grain by using chemical identification of its origin, Britain\u2019s food and farming minister, Mark Spencer, said on Monday. Spencer told an International Grains Council (IGC) conference in London that Britain was leading on the scheme and that G7 countries were also working closely with Ukraine, the world\u2019s fourth largest grains exporter. Nato\u2019s largest military jet exercise since its founding took place on Monday in the skies over Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. About 10,000 soldiers from 25 countries were involved, making use of 250 military jets \u2013 70 from Germany \u2013 to prepare for an attack on one of Nato\u2019s members. Although the exercise was planned long before Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it is nevertheless being viewed as a signal towards the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin marked Russia\u2019s national day on Monday by appealing to Russians\u2019 patriotic pride at what he said was a \u201cdifficult time\u201d. Speaking at a lavish award-giving ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin made no direct comment on the latest developments in Ukraine, where Kyiv\u2019s forces have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after the Wagner mercenary chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, refused to do so. The signing followed an order that all \u201cvolunteer units\u201d should sign contracts by 1 July bringing them under the control of the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, as Moscow tries to assert its control over private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine. The former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev celebrated Russia Day by posting an edited image to Telegram that showed Kyiv\u2019s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message \u201cIndependence Square. Coming soon \u2013 Russia Square\u201d. Work has started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said.

And Kent are finally all out for 344 with a handy lead of 500 (you read that right) - an amusing tail-end bash led by Qadri (72 off 85) and iced by Quinn (37 off 22) designed to give Surrey maximum irritation. Intrigued to see how Surrey go about things \u2013 as Burns hits the first ball of the innings for four. Wicket to wicket, Balderson\u2019s spell here at Southport was 23 balls, three for six (thank you Ken). Sir Alastair didn\u2019t get a second hundred (Essex 110-5), but joy for Lancashire and Balderson, as he picks up Middleton (77) with a bit of a grubber, and Ben Brown later in the same over, to a super scoop up by Phil Salt. Hants 183-4. Vince joined by a stitched together Liam Dawson. The Edgbaston pitch: Division Two\u2026A wicket at Chesterfield at last, as Haider Ali is lbw for 146 to George Hill. Leus du Plooy still there on 130. An astonishing, game-changing partnership of 277., but the lead even afterwards is only 77. Derbyshire have five wickets to play with. Durham have lost a couple of morning wickets, but more pertinently built the lead to 93. This match looks scrawled with high-scoring draw. Another likely draw at Bristol, where Rishi Patel made another fifty before being Zaman Akhter\u2019s second wicket, Leicestershire 109-2. Toms Clark and Haines thrashing away at Hove, 94 without loss in 19 and a bit overs, pinching a lead of 32. A wicket disturbs the gentle chatter at Southport, Gubbins lbw to Balderson for 62. In comes the prince..Hants 158-2. Time to wander round to Division Two. With an hour gone \u2013 what is happening in Division One? Lancs have failed to make a breakthrough here at sunny, sunny, Southport \u2013 resorting to part-time handyman George Bell. Hampshire content to soak up time. Essex have lost two more wickets, Westley and Walter, but Alastair Cook is still there on 26. Feeling in my bones this could be a hot two ton match for SAC Essex 66-3, the lead 361 over Somerset. At Canterbury, Quadri (a half century under his belt) and Evison have stretched the Kent lead to 412 over Surrey. And Moores and Harrison have temporarily stilled the tilting Notts ship, 128-6. Love this initiative by Somerset, and Gloucestershire too. If you\u2019re south-west based, how about a walk and talk with our very own (always our own) Vic Marks Little George Bell giving the ball a tweak \u2013 he let\u2019s fly a huge appeal, turned down.

Jake Libby\u2019s dream of two more runs slips through his finger tips when he falls to the fourth ball of the morning. Worcestershire\u2019s innings ends on 410, the lead 62. We have action everywhere, with fewer storms forecast for today. Horrible events in Nottingham mean there could be some delays getting to the ground, with road closures and some suspensions on the tram network. Walking from Birkdale station, a hearse passed by, and a cricket fan in baggy shirt, shorts and a multi-coloured bucket hat, removed his hat and paused. Five seconds of dignity and strangely moving.

A standing ovation had serenaded Phil Salt to his first Lancashire century, and his first Championship hundred since 2019, in the days when he wore a Sussex shirt. Daryl Mitchell biffed 68 blockbuster runs and George Bell made a stylish cameo, Organ wheeling away, while Mohammad Abbas and Keith Barker were furiously unlucky. Liam Dawson was shipped off to hospital for stitches in his top lip split after a ball deflected off third slip straight into his face. Fletcha Middleton and Nick Gubbins then took Hampshire to stumps, the deficit reduced to 113. The familar jingle of Essex\u2019s Simon Harmer running through a batting card from Chelmsford\u2019s River End returned to the Championship for the first time in 2023, with Somerset the unlucky opponents. Jamie Porter grabbed the first three Somerset wickets, before Harmer started his work (5-64). Sean Dickson carried his bat for 82. Essex, who had declared just before lunch, spruced up by a rapid 50 from Feroze Khushi, didn\u2019t enforce the follow on. Warwickshire have Nottinghamshire where they want them in the battle of the Midlands big dogs at Trent Bridge. After declaring on 571 for nine, Michael Burgess and Hasan Ali adding rapid morning runs for Warwickshire, whose bowlers then crunched through the Notts top order. Ed Barnard made the breakthrough when he had Ben Slater caught at first slip for 19, Hasan Ali rattled out two more and when Montgomery fell for eight, Notts had lost four for seven. Oliver Hannon-Dalby had time to join the wicket-taking club before Notts were rescued by an oncoming thunderstorm. Leus du Plooy and Haider Ali conjured a remarkable Derbyshire comeback out of a cold bowl of sick, adding an unbroken 231 for the fifth wicket from just 311 balls against Yorkshire. Derbyshire supporters, despondent at their team\u2019s 17 for four in their second innings and still 225 behind just after lunch, struggled to believe what was happening. Dawid Malan had earlier made 106. Another fightback at The Riverside, where centuries sensible (David Bedingham) and bold (Ollie Robinson) gave Durham the lead against Glamorgan. At Bristol, Gloucestershire\u2019s Ollie Price celebrated his 22nd birthday with a career-best 85 against Leicestershire, while Jake Libby dominated Worcestershire\u2019s innings against Sussex with an unbeaten 198. And Kent continued to rip up the form book, skittling Surrey for 145, declining to enforce the follow, and then building an intimidating lead. Good gorgeous June morning! The Southport train chugs through the Lancashire countryside, everything looking much more perky after the evening rains. I caught it by the skin of my teeth after Manchester city centre\u2019s overhead tram lines melted in the heat. Not that increasing temperatures will put any stress on the country\u2019s infrastructure. At tea yesterday, it seemed certain Lancs would polish off Hampshire today \u2013 but Middleton and Gubbins batted carefully to reduce the deficit to 113. If Hants could scramble to a lead of nearly 200, it might just be interesting on a pitch with a mind of its own. Elsewhere, Kent lead Surrey by 310, despite losing five for 26 in the elongated evening session. It\u2019s big, but is it enough? Surrey\u2019s Bazball potential never to be underestimated. And down on the Sussex coast, Jake Libby slept (hopefully) undefeated on 198."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/13/uk-pay-growth-higher-interest-rates-unemployment-vacancies-cbi-chief-mps-us-inflation-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "UK short-term borrowing costs surge above Truss-era highs as more UK interest rate rises loom \u2013 business live", "lead": "UK interest rates expected to hit 5.5% by December after regular pay grows by a record, sending two-year bond yields soaring", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T12:07:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079862", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e51c3c5e332adcb1dc9efa1883679148bc74ed0d/0_171_4367_2622/500.jpg", "body": "Skipton building society is raising the cost of its no-deposit 100% mortgage for first-time buyers but the deal remains available at current prices until Friday, Forbes are reporting. The deal was only announced last month (on the day when Halifax reported house prices were falling), but now needs to be repriced due to the jump in UK bond yields as interest rate expectations climb. Forbes explains: The mutual lender\u2019s Track Record product, a 100% mortgage deal which launched last month, is a five-year fixed rate deal at 5.49%. This rate will be available until 10pm on Thursday (15 June) so borrowers need to act fast if they want to secure this deal. Skipton says the rate will rise to 5.89% on Friday (16 June). The rate increase also means the maximum loan a first-time buyer can borrow through the deal will reduce. This is because the Track Record loan is structured so that the monthly mortgage payments cannot be more than the average of the last six months\u2019 rental costs the applicant has paid. Nick Mendes at broker John Charcol said: At the time of launch the track record mortgage was priced on a 5 year fixed of 5.49%, which was higher than other higher LTV products at the time. The rate had enough margin to take into account higher LTV risks and small increases in fixed rates. Swaps have increased since the product was launched, average 5 year fixed rates are increasing, and the product is no longer viable to remain unchanged. Here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam on today\u2019s bond market ructions: Faisal also points out that NatWest are raising their Buy to Let stress rates And here\u2019s some international context: The pound has rallied today, on expectations of further UK interest rate increases. Sterling has gained more than half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.257, after this morning\u2019s jobs and wages data. Jon Camenzuli, senior corporate dealer, at Moneycorp, explains why: \u201cToday\u2019s leap in basic wage growth to 7.2% is the first sure sign of the wage-price spiral Andrew Bailey warned us about. \u201cING came out yesterday saying we likely won\u2019t see any rate cuts until this time next year and they could well be right. This week is a huge one for data and all of it seems to be pointing to the same thing - further action is needed, regardless of what\u2019s happening in Europe. \u201cWe could see the pound continue its incredible rally if the UK avoids a recession and the Bank of England continues raising rates after the European Central Bank stops. This won\u2019t be welcome news to UK businesses that rely on euro income, but there are no easy decisions in the current economic environment.\u201d Financial markets now think UK borrowing costs could leap to a high of 5.75%, up more than a percentage point from their current level of 4.5%, as the Bank of England attempts to fight inflation. That\u2019s based on the rates of sterling overnight index swaps \u2013 which indicate how the markets expect interest rates to move. Today\u2019s wage data indicates there is no sign, yet, that the UK labour market is cooling, warns NIESR, the economic forecaster. Paula Bejarano Carbo, associate economist at NIESR, says: Today\u2019s ONS estimates suggest that average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, grew by 7.2 per cent across the whole economy in the three months to April, representing the largest growth rate in regular pay recorded outside of the pandemic period. The private and public sectors saw regular pay growth of 7.6 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively. The employment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points to 76 per cent in this three-month period, while total hours worked reached a record high, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. It seems that the cooling labour market that high-frequency indicators have been pointing to is yet to materialise.\u201d In the City, the crisis at Odey Asset Management following the publication of sexual assault allegations against its founder, Crispin Odey, is deepening today. Odey Asset Management has just announced that it is shutting its Swan fund and gating two other funds, following a surge in redemption requests from investors keen to take their money out. The firm has suspended all dealings in the Odey Swan fund and will redeem investors by September 4, according to a letter dated Monday. The letter says the the board of Odey Asset Management also decided to suspend the issue, conversion and redemption of Swan Fund shares in order to \u201cefficiently manage the redemptions and in the best interests of Shareholders\u201d. A subsidiary of Odey Asset Management has stopped investors from withdrawing money from the Brook Developed Markets fund in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against Crispin Odey. Redemptions have been gated following a higher volume of requests from investors to withdraw, which exceeded 10% of the fund\u2019s net asset value. This comes after a number of female employees made allegations of sexual misconduct against multimillionaire Conservative donor Crispin Odey. On Saturday, the executive committee of Odey Asset Management said that Odey would \u201cno longer have any economic or personal involvement in the partnership\u201d. Yesterday it emerged that Crispin Odey\u2019s name will be removed from hedge fund he founded. Odey told the Guardian last week that the allegations had not been proven in court and he had done nothing illegal. Update: JPMorgan is terminating its relationship with Odey Asset Management, the Financial Times is reporting. Goldman Sachs International CEO Richard Gnodde has told Bloomberg the bank is \u201cin the process of moving away\u201d from its prime-brokerage relationship with Odey Asset Management. Here\u2019s Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, on the jump in the 2-year UK gilt yield over its peak after last September\u2019s mini-budget: It comes after this morning\u2019s UK labour market statistics which saw a rise in the number of people in employment to an all-time high and the fastest pace of growth since records began for basic pay (excluding the anomalous pandemic period). These both underscore the tightness in the labour market, which could inhibit the decline of inflation, prompting the Bank of England to carry out further interest rate increases to cool price pressures. Financial markets are pricing in further moves to tighten monetary policy from the current bank rate of 4.5% to 5.5% by year-end, which would add to pressure on consumers and businesses through higher borrowing rates. Resolution Foundation have pulled together a handy thread on this morning\u2019s UK labour market report -and are hopeful that the squeeze on real wages could be ending: The newest Bank of England interest rate setter has warned that it will be tough to return inflation to the UK\u2019s 2% target. Megan Greene was speaking to the Treasury Committee this morning, as short-term bond yields continue to climb. Greene, an economist who is joining the Bank\u2019s MPC from consultancy group Kroll in July, told MPs that the BoE should act against signs of persistence in inflation. She told the committee that halving inflation from its peak last winter will be easier than bringing it down to target, saying: \u201cI think that there is some underlying persistence and so getting from 10% to 5% ... is probably easier than getting from 5% to 2%.\u201d Significantly, Greene then warns about the risks of relaxing monetary policy too soon. She says: \u201cIf you engage in stop-start monetary policy, you may end up having to tighten even more and generating an even worse recession on the other side. \u201cAnd also that inflation expectations can\u2019t be allowed to become de-anchored or you end up in that situation.\u201d UK short-term borrowing costs have continued to soar above their mini-budget peak last autumn. The yield on two-year gilts now trading at 4.83%, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis, up from 4.62% last night. Q: Is the CBI planning to change its name, Ian Lavery MP asks\u2026 Rain Newton-Smith says the CBI\u2019s name isn\u2019t the most important issue, but doesn\u2019t deny that a rebrand is an option. She says the CBI\u2019s listening exercise with business leaders found they believe the UK need a strong collective voice on business, and want the CBI to focus on issues such as sustainable growth, and improving employment and skills. The CBI\u2019s director-general tells MPs: At some stage, if we change our name, would we move away from being the Confederation of British Industry? Again, it\u2019s really one for our members. In April, the Financial Times reported that \u201cthe crisis-stricken CBI will be renamed as part of efforts to demonstrate that it has reformed its toxic workplace culture\u201d. Ian Lavery MP asks whether the CBI is now unnecessary, as other business groups have \u201cstepped up to the plate\u201d since it was forced to pause its work. [for example, the British Chambers of Commerce has launched a new Business Council to bring business leaders together] Rain Newton-Smith says the CBI has been, and can be a really important voice on key issues \u2013 such as high inflation and the cost of living crisis, and weak growth. She cites this Spring\u2019s budget, which took on the CBI\u2019s work on childcare reform, and work helping firms to decarbonise. The Business and Trade committee then ask Rain Newton-Smith how many members the CBI actually has left, following the crisis that engulfed the lobby group. Director-general Rain Newton-Smith says the CBI has 1,200 direct members, which represents 2.5m private sector employees, plus 120 trade associations (which include 160,000 business organisations). In contrast, Germany\u2019s BDI has 39 sector association members, representing 100,000 businesses, she adds. Q: The Labour party, HMRC\u2026are advocating no direct senior-level connection with the CBI. How many members have you lost? Newton-Smith says the CBI has lost \u2018some members\u2019, but won\u2019t give a total. [Back in April, more than 20 businesses cut ties with the CBI after the Guardian reported a second woman had alleged that she was raped by two male colleagues when she worked at the group. That included Accenture, Arup, Aviva, BMW, Fidelity International, Jaguar Land Rover, Kingfisher, Phoenix Group, Sage and Virgin Media O2, with other companies pausing work with the CBI.] Newton-Smith says the 1,200 members it represents now is a \u201creally strong mandate\u201d \u2013 and one that policymakers on both sides of the House of Commons should be listening too. Q: But it\u2019s very hard to tell if you still have the confidence of the industry as a whole, without knowing how many members you have lost\u2026 How will you regain trust with government departments? Newton-Smith insists that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of members have stayed with the CBI. The CBI has been \u201cvery open about its programme of change\u201d, showing how seriously it takes its reforms, she adds. It is also showing it has strong businesses behind it, she insists, and bats the question back to MPs, saying: I would ask, what else do we need to do? I think we have a mandate that any politician or policymaker would respect. We are putting ourselves in front of scrutiny, in front of parliament today. We have the trust of our membership. The new head of the CBI has declared she is very confident that it can recover from the crisis that has gripped the business lobby group this year. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s new director-general, is appearing before parliament\u2019s business and trade committee now. Committee chair Darren Jones MP starts by asking about the reputational damage caused by recent allegations (of multiple examples of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI, reported by the Guardian). Q: Are you and your members confident that you can recover from this period of reputational damage? Newton-Smith, who returned to the CBI in April, says: Yes, we are very confident that we can recover from the crisis that our organisation has gone through. It has been a difficult time for us as an organisation, but we really responded to it and set out a programme of change. Newton-Smith tells MPs that 93% of members voted in support of that programme last week, backing its plans around people and culture, and how its members want it to be a very strong voice for business. Q: The victims involved in these cases want to see that you\u2019ve understood the root causes that led to those situations arising. What have you found from the work have you done? Newton-Smith says the CBI has looked into its organisation, and used independent experts such as law firm Fox Williams to investigate the allegations reported in the Guardian. Consultancy firm Principia Advisory have surveyed over 90% staff, and ran 110 interviews to understand their experiences with the CBI Q: So what were the root causes of the problems that occured? Newton-Smith says the CBI has no information on the two alleged rapes, so it hasn\u2019t been able to investigate those allegations. But it has looked into the issue of whether women always felt supported when they raised concerns, and whether the CBI had the right processes and support processes. The CBI wants to be very best organisation at supporting individuals as and when they they raise grievances, she says. Q: So the governance at the CBI wasn\u2019t right before because there wasn\u2019t a channel to raise concerns? Newton-Smith says governance was weaker than it should have been. Although there was a whistle-blowing line, she says some staff didn\u2019t feel confident in using it, or able to use it. The TUC have warned that family budgets can\u2019t take any more pressure, after wages continued to lag inflation in the last quarter. That\u2019s because basic pay growth, at 7.2%, was well behind April\u2019s inflation reading of 8.7%, meaning real wages are still falling. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says \u201cworking people have had enough\u201d. Nowak is urging the government to resolve the current public sector pay disputes, and lift the minumum wage to help low earners through the cost of living squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder workers are reluctantly taking strike action to defend their living standards. They\u2019ve been backed into a corner and pushed to breaking point. \u201cMinisters need to get round the table and resolve all of the current pay disputes. \u201cPeople need money in their pockets now. \u201cThe government must give public sector workers a real pay rise, boost the minimum wage to \u00a315 per hour, and end their draconian attack on the right to strike in the Strikes Bill.\u201d Today\u2019s wage growth data (see opening post) highlight the risk of a wage-price spiral to inflation, says Josie Anderson, managing economist at the CEBR. With regular pay growing at 7.2% per year, the highest on record (outside of Covid-19) times, the Bank of England is more likely to raise interest rates. Anderson explains: With inflation and wage growth both at very high levels, and unemployment remaining at just 3.8% in the three months to April, employees have been able to bargain for higher wages to cover their rising living costs. As the volatile components of inflation, such as energy, bring down the headline rate of CPI, stickier components, such as consumer services, may cause inflation to persist. This will particularly be the case if wage growth stays high, as this will encourage businesses to raise prices in order to maintain their margins. This morning\u2019s wage growth data have, therefore, increased the likelihood of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England later this month. Cebr expects a 25 basis point hike, taking the base rate to 4.75%.\u201d This morning\u2019s surge in UK short-term borrowing costs comes amid turmoil in the mortgage market. Yesterday, NatWest told mortgage brokers it was raising prices on some new and existing mortgages from today, including a 1.57% percentage point increase on some buy-to-led loans. Santander paused new applications for certain products last night, ahead of launching a new range tomorrow. That followed HSBC temporarily removing its \u201cnew business\u201d residential and buy-to-let products last week, and Nationwide lifting its rates. Lenders are struggling to keep their prices in line with interest rate expectations, since UK inflation fell much less than expected in April, to 8.7%. Once one pulls its business, potential customers flood to the next. Today\u2019s increase in two-year UK government bond yields will put more pressure on lenders to reprice mortgages higher. Steven Morris, advising director at Advantage Financial Solutions LTD, says yesterday was \u201cquite simply horrendous\u201d. Morris explains: We had rate withdrawals and rate increases across the board. Some increases with high street lenders were as high as 1.57%. Some lenders paused lending altogether for a period. Withdrawal deadlines of just a few hours were given. My advice to customers right now is don\u2019t even bother getting mortgage advice unless you are prepared to apply within a couple of hours. Send your broker documents ASAP and up-front if possible or you don\u2019t even stand a chance of getting a deal before it\u2019s withdrawn. He also urges borrowers to \u201cbe kind to your broker\u201d: They have a zillion other clients in the same position as you and with lenders giving just a few hours\u2019 notice of products being withdrawn, are left having to choose which client to \u2018save\u2019. Being a mortgage broker right now is like trying to stop the tide from coming in armed with a mop. Pointless. Here\u2019s our news story on this morning\u2019s wage growth data, which is piling pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates even higher. UK two-year borrowing costs are now at their highest level since the financial crisis, points out Bloomberg\u2019s Kristine Aquino, following their jump today (see here). She explains: And there we have it -- two-year gilt yields have surged past the peak of the Truss turmoil and have hit 4.73%, the highest level since 2008. While that\u2019s quite the milestone, it\u2019s well below the 5.75% level that traders currently expect for BOE borrowing costs. In that case, there may be more pain to come for gilts as markets come to grips with the prospect of even higher rates. Here\u2019s M&amp;G\u2019s Bond Vigilantes team on the jump in UK borrowing costs: Expectations that UK interest rates will keep rising are driving up the British government\u2019s short-term borrowing costs ABOVE levels seen in Liz Truss\u2019s brief premiership. That\u2019s bad news for people who looking to take out a mortgage, or remortage, soon. The yield, or interest rate, on UK two-year government bonds has hit 4.73% this morning, up from 4.62% last night, after this morning\u2019s jobs report showed regular pay growing at the fastest rate on record. That is slightly higher than the peak seen in the turmoil after last autumn\u2019s mini-budget, when chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s plan for unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets. These two-year gilts are used to price fixed-term mortgages, and the recent increase in yields has already been forcing lenders to reprice deals, or pull them off the markets. There could be more pain ahead too, as the money markets expect Bank of England base rate to hit 5.5% by the end of this year, up from 4.5% today. Longer-dated government bond yields have also risen today, but are below their panic levels last autumn. The surge in bond yields last autumn was partly driven by forced selling by pension funds who had followed Liability Driven Investment strategies, and by a lack of confidence in the Truss-Kwarteng plan. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the current situation is different, compared to last September when \u201cthe mini-Budget was doing its wrecking ball job\u201d. This time is different \u2013 LDI has unleveraged, and it\u2019s not about the fiscal or political risk premium. It\u2019s all about strong wage numbers driving expectations for the Bank of England to need to press hike button again and again. We are now in wage-price spiral territory \u2013 private sector wage growth rose to 7.6% in the three months to April, whilst overall regular pay rose 7.2%. This only makes it harder for the BoE to cool inflation \u2013 a tougher stance is required but we know the dangers for the economy and notably the mortgage market if that happens. On today\u2019s jobs data, Minister for Employment Guy Opperman MP says: \u201cOur drive to get more people into work and grow the economy has seen inactivity fall for the fifth month in a row. Vacancies continue to drop, employment is up and the numbers on company payrolls are also up. \u201cWe\u2019re investing \u00a33.5 billion to remove barriers to work - with extra support for people with health conditions, an expansion of free childcare and arming jobseekers with the skills they need through tailored training and extra work coach time.\u201d The money markets indicate that the Bank of England is certain to lift interest rates next Thursday\u2026. and a bumper increase in borrowing costs is looking more likely. Currently, a quarter-point increase in Bank rate to 4.75%, from 4.5%, is seen as a 70% chance. And a half-point increase, taking Bank rate to 5%, is now seen as a 30% possibility, up from around 25% yesterday afternoon. The markets now predict Bank rate will be above 5.5% at the end of this year, a whole percentage point higher than today. Emma Mogford, fund manager at Premier Miton Monthly Income Fund, says today\u2019s jobs market report suggests interest rates must stay higher for longer. The labour market remains surprisingly tight with unemployment falling and wage inflation increasing. While broadly good news for the UK economy, this is very challenging for the Bank of England. It may mean interest rates have to stay higher for longer to bring inflation back to normal levels.\u201d Reaction to this morning\u2019s UK jobs report is flooding in. Matthew Percival, the CBI\u2019s Director for People and Skills policy, warns that the increase in long-term sickness (see earlier post) is concerning. \u201cWhile the number of people in work is rising and unfilled vacancies are slowly falling, the difficulties companies face when hiring is still a hard brake on growth. Signs that stubbornly high inactivity is starting to fall are encouraging, but a new record high number of people unable to work because of long-term sickness is a real cause for concern. \u201cBusiness and government have identified getting people back into work as a top priority. A laser-like focus on delivering the promised expansions to childcare and occupational health services, and businesses increasing flexible working can quicken the pace of easing shortages.\u201d ING says another increase in UK interest rates next week now looks very likely, followed by another in the summer, given the strong wage growth (although still not matching inflation\u2026) ING say: Faster-than-expected wage growth points to a rate hike in June and potentially August, and is a reminder that pay pressures are likely to ease only gradually. That doesn\u2019t necessarily suggest the Bank of England needs to raise rates as aggressively as markets expect, but it does imply that rate cuts are some way off. Jake Finney, economist at PwC UK, says the labour market \u201cremains tight\u201d but there are signs that is is normalising, adding: \u201cThe economic inactivity rate declined on the previous quarter to 21%, which was driven by falls to inactivity rates across all age groups. However, the number of workers inactive due to long-term sickness remains persistently elevated - reaching another record high this quarter. \u201cDeclining inactivity saw both the employment and the unemployment rates increase on the previous quarter. As a result, the total number of employed workers has returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time. This indicates that the labour market is gradually normalising. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says firms are still struggling to hire workers: \u201cToday\u2019s data shows that while the labour market has stabilised a little since the acute shortages of late 2021, it remains very tight by historical standards. \u201cIt also confirms a structural shift: more people with home and caring responsibilities are working than before the pandemic, presumably because they can do so remotely, but those excluded from the labour market due to sickness is depressingly far higher. The slight rise in unemployment in the latest data is due to more people starting to look for work, not increased layoffs. And here\u2019s Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, responding to today\u2019s labour market statistics, said: \u201cOur country has enormous potential. We should be leading in the industries of the future and creating good jobs across Britain, but the Tories continue to hold us back. \u201cFamily finances are being squeezed to breaking point by a further fall in real wages, and record numbers of people are out of work due to long-term sickness. \u201c13 years of the Tories and all we have is a gaping hole where their plan for growth should be and a Tory mortgage penalty damaging family finances for years to come. \u201cLabour will get people back into work, and with our mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, create good jobs and productivity growth across every part of our country.\u201d Chancellor the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has acknowledged that inflation is taking a bite out of earnings, saying: \u201cThe number of people in work has reached a record high, and the IMF and OECD recently credited our major reforms at the Budget which will help even more back into work while growing the economy. \u201cBut rising prices are continuing to eat into people\u2019s pay checks \u2013 so we must stick to our plan to halve inflation this year to boost living standards.\u201d Hunt\u2019s plan to tackle inflation has includes refusing larger pay increases for the public sector, to help doctors, nurses and teachers through the cost of living squeeze: ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan says: \u201cWith another rise in employment, the number of people in work overall has gone past its pre-pandemic level for the first time, setting a new record high, as have total hours worked. The biggest driver in recent jobs growth, meanwhile, is health and social care, followed by hospitality. \u201cWhile there has been another drop in the number of people neither working nor looking for work, which is now falling right across the age range, those outside the jobs market due to long-term sickness continues to rise, to a new record. \u201cIn cash terms, basic pay is now growing at its fastest since current records began, apart from the period when the figures were distorted by the pandemic. However, even so, wage rises continue to lag behind inflation.\u201d The number of people out of the labour market because of long-term sickness increased to a record high, this morning\u2019s UK unemployment report shows. The rise in chronic illness in the UK in recent years has forced more people out of the labour market. As well as Covid-19, the rise in NHS waiting lists to record levels means 7.4 million people in England are waiting to start treatment. Ben Harrison, Director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, says: \u201cWith a record 2.55 million long-term sick, the UK is the worst performer in the G7 for workforce participation since the start of the pandemic. Yet nearly one in four people who are long-term sick want to work. Mel Stride MP\u2019s review of workforce participation therefore must recognise the importance of improving the quality of jobs on offer. Emelia Quist, head of policy research at the Federation of Small Businesses, says current support to bring people with long-term sickness back into jobs isn\u2019t working: Despite this rise, the overall economic inactivity rate decreased by 0.4 percentage points on the quarter, to 21.0% in February to April. Here\u2019s Sky News\u2019s Paul Kelso: The number of vacancies at UK firms has dropped. There were 1,051,000 vacancies in March to May 2023, down from 79,000 in December 2022 to February 2023. That\u2019s the 11th drop in a row, with 250,000 fewer vacancies than a year ago, today\u2019s labour market report shows. The ONA also estimates that firms kept hiring staff last month. It estimates that UK payrolls rose by 23,000 in May, to 30.0 million, over a million more than before the pandemic. Today\u2019s labour market report shows the number of people in employment increased to a record high in the latest quarter. There were increases in both the number of employees and self-employed workers, the Office for National Statistics reports, pushing up the employment total by 250,000 in February-April to 33,089m. That has lifted the UK\u2019s employment rate to 76%, up from 75.8% in November to January. The unemployment rate was 3.8%, up from 3.7% in the previous quarter but down on the 3.9% reported last month. The increase in unemployment in the last quarter was driven by people unemployed for up to 12 months, the ONS adds. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK wage growth has strengthened, giving the Bank of England another headache as it tries to cool inflation without crashing the economy. But while earning are growing, they are still not keeping pace with inflation. Regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 7.2% per year in the February-April quarter, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show, up from 6.6% in November-January. That is the fastest growth rate for basic pay on record, if you exclude the Covid-19 pandemic which distorted wage data. Wages were boosted by the 9.7% rise in the minimum wage in April. Total pay, including bonuses, grew by 6.5% per year in the three months to April. The Bank is due to set interest rates next week, on Thursday 22 June, and looks certain to hike borrowing costs for the 13th time in a row. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, says the UK\u2019s \u201cContinued strength in pay growth\u201d will warrant higher interest rates\u201d. Selfin adds: \u201cThe pickup in regular pay growth is the latest sign that inflation is driving up pay demands, which in turn is making inflation stickier. With negative productivity growth, these figures are well above the levels consistent with the 2% target. \u201cAs higher interest rates feed through to the economy, we still expect the labour market to loosen. But even in that scenario, pay growth may continue to be inflationary as the moderation in prices will drive up real wages and strengthen workers\u2019 purchasing power. \u201cIf there was still any doubt about the direction of monetary policy, these data should solidify another interest rate increase from the Bank of England next week, and probably more in the coming months.\u201d However, in real terms earnings still fell, as UK inflation was clocked at 8.7% in April Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 7.6%, again the largest growth rate seen outside of the pandemic period. Public sector pay growth was weaker, growing by 5.6%, the fastest growth rate since August to October 2003 (when it rose by 5.7%). The finance and business services sector saw the largest regular growth rate at 9.2%, followed by the manufacturing sector at 7.0%. That\u2019s the fastest rise in manufacturing pay since comparable records began in 2001. More details to follow\u2026. Also coming up today Having won a confidence vote last week, the CBI\u2019s new director-general will face MPs today in a one-off evidence session. Rain Newton-Smith will be questioned by the Business and Trade Committee this morning, at a hearing which will focus on \u201cthe group\u2019s future role, and actions to clean it up\u201d. The hearing will also examine whether the CBI can still claim to speak for big businesses, as my colleague Anna Isaac explains: Rain Newton-Smith, a former CBI chief economist who has rejoined as director general while it grapples with the fallout from a sexual misconduct scandal, is to take questions on the organisation\u2019s failings and its future ambitions during an appearance before the business and trade committee. The Guardian has revealed that more than a dozen women have claimed to have been victims of various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI. This included an account from a woman who alleged she was raped at a staff party on a boat on the Thames and another who claimed she was raped by colleagues when she worked at a CBI office overseas. Down the corridor at Westminster, the Treasury committee will hold a pre-appointment hearing with economist Megan Greene, ahead of her appointment to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. Greene is joining the Bank at a time when the mortgage market is in turmoil, so will probably be asked whether she supports further interest rate hikes to fight inflation. Expectations of higher rates have forced several lenders to pull deals, or reprice them higher. Financial investors are eager to see the latest US inflation data today, which will help determine whether the US central bank raises rates tomorrow, or holds borrowing costs. The annual US CPI inflation rate is expected to have fallen to 4.1% from 4.9%, with a smaller dip in core inflation. Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets explains: It is in core prices that we might see some nervousness for markets ahead of tomorrow\u2019s CPI numbers. If we don\u2019t see a slowdown in core prices, then that might introduce some nervousness that might prompt the Fed to hike again tomorrow instead of the pause that is currently being priced.

Two-year gilt yields \u2013 the interest rate on short-term UK government borrowing \u2013 increased by more than 0.2 percentage points to 4.83% on Tuesday, surpassing the level reached in the aftermath of Truss\u2019s ill-fated mini budget. Yields are also the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. It comes after figures from the Office for National Statistics showed growth in average regular pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 7.2% in the three months to April \u2013 the highest level on record, excluding the Covid pandemic. Fuelled by bumper pay rises in the City of London for employees in finance and business services, the latest snapshot showed total pay, including bonuses, also increased by 6.5% over the same period. At those rates, pay growth still lags behind inflation \u2013 currently at 8.7% \u2013 meaning pay is falling in real terms, putting pressure on household finances. Financial markets are betting resilience in the jobs market could stoke persistently high levels of inflation, amid signs of companies continuing to push up wages to meet severe shortfalls in available workers. The Bank is widely expected to increase rates by at least a quarter point from the current level of 4.5% in response at the next meeting of its monetary policy committee on 22 June. Megan Greene, who was appointed in April to join the MPC from next month, told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee on Tuesday that Threadneedle Street might have a tough time to return inflation to its 2% target. Saying that headline inflation should come down \u201cfairly quickly\u201d this year amid a stabilisation in energy bills, she warned that there was \u201csome underlying persistence\u201d in inflation. \u201cGetting from 10% to 5% \u2013 and this goes for probably every major jurisdiction \u2013 is probably easier than getting from 5% to 2%.\u201d Economists said April\u2019s large increase in wage growth could partly reflect low-pay employers responding to the 9.7% increase in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d at the start of the month but said the rise in overall average wages was driven mainly by the momentum in higher-paying sectors. In a sign of continued strength in the British jobs market, the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.8% in the three months to April as companies continued to hire new recruits despite growing financial pressure from rising borrowing costs and subdued consumer demand. Employment rose by 250,000 in the three months to April, lifting the number of people in work overall above pre-pandemic levels for the first time and setting a fresh record high of more than 33 million. However, long-term sickness among working-age adults outside the jobs market continued to rise, reaching a new record high. Reflecting heightened economic uncertainty holding back recruitment in some industries, the number of job vacancies fell for the 11th consecutive period, dropping by 79,000 on the quarter to stand at just over 1m. Average regular pay growth in the private sector accelerated to 7.6%, the largest growth rate seen outside the pandemic period, when the figures were distorted by furlough and changes in employment. Public sector wage growth was 5.6%, the highest level since 2003. Hussain Mehdi, a strategist at HSBC Asset Management, said the figures would add to pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates after inflation fell by less than expected in April. \u201cThe UK labour market remains very tight and continues to confound expectations. For the Bank of England, wage growth is a big problem \u2013 it is simply at too high a level to allow inflation to hit the 2% target. And unlike in the US, there are no obvious signs that wage pressures are moderating.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/boris-johnson-britain-politics", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Clowns belong in the circus \u2013 but unless we take politics seriously there will be more like Boris Johnson | John Kampfner", "lead": "The former prime minister was a symptom, not the cause, of a political culture that gorges on spectacle and trivia, says author John Kampfner", "author": "John Kampfner", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T11:13:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079869", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/017fb7e1228214f67f0f9027be08b12643e81d35/585_0_2787_1672/500.jpg", "body": "Politicians, journalists and assorted hangers-on have been regaling each other with their risque Boris Johnson anecdotes for as long as I can remember. \u201cBoris\u201d this, \u201cBoJo\u201d that. Even his detractors used his first name. The braggadocio, the enjoyment of watching his ascent, reached a peak during his tenure as mayor of London. Commentators, even those on the left, joked about how fun it was to have a Conservative in charge of the capital city who whizzed around on a zipwire. The bonhomie suddenly turned to buyers\u2019 remorse when he embraced the Brexit cause in 2016. What, I ask now, as I asked then, took people so long? It was abundantly clear to me from the moment I met him (he and I were foreign correspondents at the same time for the Telegraph) that Johnson was a charlatan. While I was covering the collapse of communism from Moscow, he was in Brussels inventing stories about straight bananas. It is not the ideology that rankles (one can always respectfully agree to disagree), but the opportunism. His only lodestar was his ego. Leave? Remain? Oh gosh, which one shall I go for? Let\u2019s sock it to those pesky Europeans; let\u2019s invent a few jolly lines about the Turks and the NHS; we\u2019re not going to win, after all, but it\u2019ll be a laugh, and it\u2019ll help me shaft my old chums Dave and George. And so it was. The Clown-in-Chief was shocked by his own success, and the rest is British ignominy. Johnson was not the cause of this country\u2019s malaise or the main reason that it is held in disdain in many chancelleries around the world. He is a symptom of a wider failure of political culture. He was invented and nurtured by people who should have known better, but who were only behaving like everyone else. When I joined the lobby as a political correspondent for the Financial Times in the mid-1990s, I was shocked by the trivia, the flunkeys and the parochialism of it all. Few journalists had any international experience or points of reference beyond this island. They saw politics as a game, reaching its weekly peak (or nadir) with the pantomime of prime minister\u2019s questions. They might on occasion denounce what they called the \u201cyah-boo\u201d politics, but they were willing accomplices in the spectacle. In the early 2000s, an adviser to Tony Blair, while rightly berating me for a cheap bit of knockabout commentary, said that his own government frequently managed to sidestep its errors because reporters didn\u2019t dig deeply enough to uncover the facts. How many hospitals were really built? What happened to the latest housing promise? Drama is easy to write about because it doesn\u2019t involve much work. The laziness of that period is magnified many times now. Twitter has rewarded an army of would-be Johnsons, with their public-school one-liners and their faux fury. Public broadcasters believe they are delivering on their duty of impartiality by taking the most \u201cliked\u201d exponents on both extremes as representatives of public opinion. One can only hope that Britain hit rock bottom during the double defenestration of last autumn. While Liz Truss\u2019s 49-day tenure was rightly the object of mockery, how much serious analysis was there at the time of Johnson\u2019s actual delivery? One example: regional inequalities are greater between north and south than between the former communist East Germany and the better-off west. Levelling up might have been a good soundbite for its time, but its delivery has been negligible. As for Brexit, only now as increasing numbers of its advocates admit that their fantasy project has failed is the reckoning beginning to take place. It has taken a while, but explaining complicated trade figures isn\u2019t sexy, or easy. For the moment, British politics is back in the hands of two representatives of a more sober tendency. Rishi Sunak may indulge Suella Braverman and others on his far right; he may show a combination of weakness and ideological zeal in other areas, but to the outside world he is giving the impression that Britain is being run with a degree of common sense for the first time in years. Admittedly, the bar is set low. His most important attribute is that he does not indulge in flourishes. As for Keir Starmer, he must be relishing the mayhem around him as he watches the Tories and the Scottish Nationalists self-combust. All the while, his preparations for government intensify. Yet much of the coverage of the Labour leader remains superficial, focusing on labels about his personality. Far more important is a detailed analysis of the direction he plans to take the country. Is he really going to remain as timid as he is now on Europe? Has he lost the appetite for radical measures to combat the climate emergency? Politics is a serious business that needs to be conducted by serious people. Leave the clowns to the circus, the entertainers to comedy shows. The next generation of MPs should be rewarded for their deliberative attention to work in committees and their interventions on the floor of the House of Commons \u2013 not for their performances on Have I Got News For You or I\u2019m a Celebrity. Programmes such as Question Time, clickbait for our shrill and superficial times, should start looking instead for some original thinkers. With Johnson\u2019s demise, a country mired in economic malaise and social division finally has the chance to grow up and to jettison politics as theatre. If it fails to seize the opportunity that the past year of mayhem has produced, it will procure for itself a younger clone of Johnson. And it will have only itself to blame.

We\u2019re going to go through the first night and into the second night as much as I can.\u201d Were somebody else to compel Goldstein to stay awake for that long, it would be illegal \u2013 in 1944, the US supreme court found sleep deprivation to be \u201cthe most effective torture\u201d and observed that being forced to spend 36 hours awake is \u201cinherently coercive.\u201d For Goldstein, however, the ability to put herself through such agony is an advantage. \u201cEveryone has a different approach,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to avoid these little micro-naps throughout the day. I know a lot of riders like that approach, of doing little sleeps.\u201d To Goldstein, however, the hidden logistics of napping make it inefficient. \u201cYou got to stop, you got to get in the [follow] car, you\u2019re going to sleep in an awkward position. I\u2019d rather just sleep in one shot and [race] continuously for the next 20-22 hours.\u201d Owing to the race\u2019s timekeeping rules, such nuances in sleep strategy can mean the difference between victory and not finishing. Although Raam is less famous than the Tour de France or the other grand tours of European cycling, it\u2019s arguably more grueling. Among other metrics, RAAM is 700 miles longer than the average Tour de France (as the name suggests, Raam competitors race from America\u2019s west coast to its east coast). Raam\u2019s longer distance alone, however, is not what makes it such an arduous event. In the Tour de France, riders\u2019 overall times are the aggregation of distinct, (almost) daily stages. Conversely, once RAAM\u2019s clock starts in California, riders race until they cross the finish line about 3,000 miles away on the Maryland coast. The fastest competitors complete the journey in a little over a week, while there is a 12-day cut-off for riders to finish the race. It would be inaccurate to claim that Raam\u2019s around-the-clock nature make it more difficult than the Tour de France \u2013 among other differences, the Tour is raced at a much faster pace overall. Raam does, however, present its own challenges. In many ways, Goldstein is the perfect person to explain them. Prior to focusing on ultra-endurance events, she was a professional cyclist with Canada\u2019s national team and previously competed in the Grande Boucle F\u00e9minine Internationale, the predecessor to today\u2019s Tour de France Femmes. \u201cIt\u2019s different. Look, Raam is more of a mental thing,\u201d the 54-year-old explains. \u201cI\u2019d have a hell of a time doing the Tour de France because it\u2019s that high-end kind of thing. You\u2019re going super fast, super hard, but you\u2019re not going 24/7, right? You know there\u2019s a finish \u2026 You\u2019re going to sleep for eight [hours], you\u2019re going to eat properly \u2026 Raam is non-stop. It\u2019s a mental thing, and that\u2019s why the playing field is even with men, because it\u2019s not physical any more.\u201d Goldstein is being modest \u2013 she doesn\u2019t just compete with male cyclists at Raam. In 2021, she beat them. In fact, Goldstein is one of many women who\u2019ve defeated male competition in longer-than-marathon races over the last decade. In 2016, Lael Wilcox finished more than two hours ahead of the fastest man when she won the 4,200 miles Trans Am Bike Race. In 2017, ultrarunner Courtney Dauwalter won a 240-mile footrace in Utah, beating the fastest male competitor by 10 hours. The list of ultra-endurance races in which women have outperformed men goes on. Goldstein, a Raam veteran who had also won the race\u2019s women\u2019s division in 2011, doesn\u2019t appear to place too much extra importance on her overall victory in 2021. \u201cI thought it was kind of cool,\u201d she says, \u201cbut honestly it was just another day on the bike for me \u2026 it didn\u2019t sink in until, like, 24 hours afterward. It was so funny, when I was coming to the finish line and I saw, like, hundreds of people there and I thought there was a [different] event going on, like some show or something. And they were there for me, which was pretty cool.\u201d When asked for a theory as to why women have been beating men in these events, Goldstein pivots back to the mental aspect of ultra-endurance racing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of \u2018if,\u2019 but a matter of \u2018when\u2019 you\u2019re going to experience every element of pain there is [in a race like Raam]. Back, neck, knee, constipation, diarrhoea, swelling. You\u2019re going to have saddle sores. You get to a point of pain that is just intolerable for the average person, and I think women \u2013 we tolerate pain pretty good.\u201d Although scientists are intrigued with this \u201cmental toughness\u201d Theory, it remains under-researched. \u201cFemales have to give birth and it\u2019s intuitive that they might just have this natural proclivity to endure physical pain,\u201d says Dr Nicholas Tiller, an exercise scientist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center who has previously studied the subject. \u201cBut it\u2019s really all just speculation. We don\u2019t know enough about it at this point.\u201d That isn\u2019t to say, however, that there is no scientific explanation for the recent surge in female ultra-endurance excellence. \u201cFemales may be more fatigue resistant owing to more slow-twitch [muscle] fibres and differences in neural control,\u201d says Tiller. \u201cIf you electrically stimulate the muscles of males and females before and after an ultra-run, the females seem to maintain their contractile properties more effectively.\u201d Interestingly, the studies Tiller mentions are designed to remove (or at least reduce) the effects of \u201cmental toughness\u201d as a variable. \u201cWhen you stimulate the muscles with some kind of electric device, you\u2019re taking \u2018effort\u2019 and you\u2019re taking \u2018motivation\u2019 out of the equation. This is a really gold-standard, objective way to study the muscle\u2019s contractile properties.\u201d When coupled with the in-competition success of female athletes like Goldstein, these types of biomechanical observations can lead to the inference that women have a physical advantage over men when it comes to ultra-endurance racing. Tiller says that such interpretations are one-sided. \u201cMost [non-scientific] articles on this subject only discuss the potential advantages,\u201d he says, adding that there are \u201cseveral factors that also inhibit female performance, like lower O2-carrying capacity \u2026 Most experts in this area agree that, in any given race, the 10 fastest males will always outperform the 10 fastest females.\u201d Results further corroborate Tiller\u2019s calls for balanced analysis of the data. For example, men have gone on to win every subsequent edition of the races Goldstein, Dauwalter, and Wilcox won in 2021, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Despite the nuances involved, what can be said with certainty is that women are able to compete with men over ultra-long distances in a way that has proven impossible so far at sprint distances, or even in standard marathons. The increased incidence of external, unpredictable factors in ultra-endurance racing may play a role. In the same way that rain or heat can affect a football match, so too can extreme weather affect an ultra-endurance race. In a race over several days and thousands of miles, the opportunities for external interference are much higher. Indeed, such environmental stressors played an important role in Goldstein\u2019s overall victory in 2021. When discussing her 2021 Raam triumph, Goldstein frequently mentions the \u201cheat dome\u201d through which she had to cycle. Although it\u2019s become a bit of a historical footnote (there has been a lot of wild weather out west since then), 2021\u2019s heat dome was big news at the time. Conditions were not conducive to high-performance racing \u2013 only 20% of solo racers even finished Raam that year. \u201cTemperatures were insane,\u201d she remembers. \u201c52C or 53C [about 125F]. I couldn\u2019t even touch the cockpit of the bike without dousing it with water every 10 minutes. I had to get pulled three times just to get IVs \u2026 It wasn\u2019t just in California and Arizona. In Colorado, climbing Wolf Creek Pass, which is 11,000 ft in the air, it was 30C [86F] \u2026 Usually when I climb that mountain, I\u2019ve got every freaking piece of clothes on \u2013 a parka, a tuque, whatever \u2013 it\u2019s [normally] freezing.\u201d This year\u2019s competitors are not expected to encounter such extreme conditions. Even the most complication-free version of Raam, however, is still exceptionally difficult. Goldstein describes a condition called \u201cShermer\u2019s neck,\u201d common among ultra-endurance cyclists who must crane their head up to see ahead of the handlebars for days on end. \u201cThe muscles in the neck that hold your head, they completely collapse and your head drops. Your head is now resting on your chest, basically, and you have no control of your head \u2013 you can\u2019t lift it.\u201d Goldstein\u2019s (and other racers\u2019) solution is to rig devices which make it physically impossible for their heads to lower below a certain point. Goldstein\u2019s version includes kinesiology tape and tying her braided hair to the heart monitor strap on her back. She says it\u2019s like having your hair pulled for 3,000 miles. Descriptions of such pain prompt an obvious question: why do Goldstein and her fellow cyclists put themselves through it? After all, there are no fortunes to be made in ultra-endurance racing. Goldstein offers a thoughtful explanation \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if enduring the difficulties of Raam is her way of putting a mental down payment on life\u2019s potential for pain. \u201cThe motivation of doing something that is so unusual and so difficult \u2013 it\u2019s just so satisfying,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s the challenge \u2013 pushing yourself beyond your limits and going, \u2018Wow, this is what we are capable of doing.\u2019 It makes other things in life, really quite simple.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/what-happens-donald-trump-arraignment-documents-court-miami", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "What\u2019s going to happen when Donald Trump shows up for his arraignment?", "lead": "The former president is facing 37 federal criminal charges \u2013 what can we expect to see on his first day in court?", "author": "Sam Levine  in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T11:00:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079877", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb5170cad1d78fb4da3d94b5c1f8cd4a6794062/0_145_3272_1964/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump will make his first court appearance on Tuesday after being charged with 37 criminal counts related to his handling of classified documents after leaving the presidency. He is set to appear at 3pm at the federal courthouse in Miami. It will be Trump\u2019s second arraignment this year. In April, he was arraigned in Manhattan on separate criminal charges related to his hush money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. What\u2019s going to happen when Trump shows up in court? Trump\u2019s initial appearance is likely to be brief. He will be formally presented with the 37 criminal charges against him and informed of the penalties, and then he can enter a plea. Trump will almost certainly plead not guilty. Defendants can choose to have the indictment read to them in open court, but many choose to waive that in order to get the hearing over quickly, said Barbara McQuade, who served as the US attorney for the eastern district of Michigan from 2010 to 2017. The judge can also set bail and decide to detain a defendant in custody while trial is pending. \u201cThe judge will consider the bail issue, but I would be stunned if Trump were held pending trial. A more likely scenario is that Trump will be ordered to surrender his passport and promise to pay some sum of money if he fails to appear,\u201d McQuade said in an email. \u201cThe court may consider as a condition of bond some sort of gag order prohibiting Trump from discussing the case, the prosecutor or the judge, but that can be tricky in light of first amendment concerns because Trump is running for president,\u201d she added. Defendants in federal cases are often fingerprinted and have their mugshot taken, McQuade said. But when Trump was arraigned on state charges in New York earlier this year, authorities did not take a mugshot. McQuade said she expected Trump to be fingerprinted. But neither a mugshot nor handcuffs were likely, she said, because people already know what Trump looks like and the former president already has Secret Service protection. Who is the judge overseeing the hearing? Magistrate judge Jonathan Goodman is scheduled to be the judge on duty at the federal courthouse in Miami when Trump appears. He will reportedly oversee the initial appearance, the Miami Herald and NBC News reported on Monday. Magistrate judges handle initial appearances and assist federal judges with other matters. Goodman is a former newspaper reporter and civil litigator who has been a magistrate judge since 2010, according to the Miami Herald. He is well-respected and known for his dry humor, the paper reported. While Goodman will handle Trump\u2019s initial appearance, the overall case will be overseen by US district judge Aileen Cannon, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench in 2020. At an earlier stage in the case, Cannon issued a series of rulings in favor of Trump and was later rebuked by an appeals court. Those rulings have prompted concerns that Cannon will favor Trump as she oversees the case. Will the appearance be televised? No. Federal courts do not allow cameras or recordings in the courtroom. Goodman denied a request Monday evening from a a coalition of news organizations that filed a request on Monday to allow for limited recording in the courtroom or the hallways leading to the courtroom. They also requested that the court release same-day audio of the proceedings. \u201cAllowing photographs would undermine the massive security arrangements put in place,\u201d Goodman wrote in an order Monday evening. He said that he expected an expedited transcript of the proceedings to be available Tuesday. Cecilia Altonga, the chief district judge for the southern district of Florida, also entered an order Monday barring reporters from bringing any electronics into the courthouse building. Will Trump be placed in jail before or after the hearing? No. Trump does not pose the kind of flight risk that would require detaining him. Why is the case being heard in Miami? Because Trump kept the classified documents at issue at his home in Mar-a-Lago, the special counsel, Jack Smith, chose to file charges in the southern district of Florida, the federal jurisdiction where Mar-a-Lago is located. That decision was deliberate and is somewhat of a risk. Smith could have tried to file the charges in Washington DC, where a federal grand jury had been investigating the matter, but it would have probably prompted a legal battle over the proper venue for the case. By filing in Florida, Smith took that issue off the table. But filing the case in Florida also brings its own risks. Most notably, the case will be overseen by Cannon, who has issued rulings favorable to Trump in the past. A jury in Miami may also be more conservative and Trump-friendly than a jury in Washington. Who are Trump\u2019s lawyers? It\u2019s not entirely clear who will make up Trump\u2019s legal team. Two of his attorneys abruptly resigned last week after he was indicted. Trump will appear on Tuesday with Todd Blanche, a defense lawyer also representing him in the Manhattan case, and Boris Epshteyn, another lawyer and controversial top aide who has drawn attention from federal prosecutors himself. He may also appear with Chris Kise, a former solicitor general of Florida who has represented Trump in the documents case. Trump was still interviewing local lawyers on Monday to help represent him. What is Trump charged with again? Trump is charged with 31 counts of unauthorized retention of national defense information, a violation of the Espionage Act. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Trump and Waltine Nauta, his valet, face additional charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, tampering with grand jury evidence and concealing evidence in a federal investigation. Each of those charges is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Trump and Nauta also face additional charges of making a false statement. Those carry a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison. What happens next? After the appearance, Cannon is likely to set a scheduling order laying out deadlines and a timeline for discovery, motions and a trial. Smith, the special counsel, requested that Trump get a speedy trial last week. But there are likely to be extensive disputes over discovery and classified materials that will drag the case out. \u201cI think an initial trial date of next spring or summer is most likely, but with more adjournments before the trial actually starts if the motions get messy, which seems likely in light of Trump\u2019s combative nature,\u201d McQuade said. \u201cI\u2019m sure [the Department of Justice] will want to try the case before election day and Trump will want to stall. Judge Cannon gets to decide.\u201d Hugo Lowell contributed reporting"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/donald-trump-classified-documents-indictment-cast-of-characters-charges", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Donald Trump indictment: a guide to everyone mentioned in the charges", "lead": "Case against the former president names several people who allegedly played a role in mishandling classified documents", "author": "Nick Robins-Early", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T11:00:32Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079880", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c13769a9d40b7e42f0db342105400f594272e633/0_302_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump\u2019s 44-page federal indictment depicts a varied cast of characters orbiting around the former president as he mishandles, flaunts and conceals top secret documents and reveals classified military information. The case involves numerous individuals, some named and others referred only by their titles, but all who allegedly played a role in Trump committing crimes related to the boxes of classified documents he took from the White House after leaving office. The indictment, which was unsealed last week, sets up a criminal case that could lead to significant time in prison if Trump is convicted and further complicate his presidential campaign for the 2024 election. Along with the Trump world staffers mentioned in the indictment, it will also put attorneys on both sides of the case on the national stage. Here\u2019s a guide to the most important people involved: Key names in the indictment Donald Trump Trump, along with his inner circle of aides and attorneys, is the central focus of the indictment. He faces 37 felony charges, ranging from the willful retention of national defense information to conspiracy to obstruct justice. The former president is named constantly throughout the indictment, often referenced in his employees\u2019 text messages or attorneys\u2019 notes, but is also directly quoted talking about holding on to classified information. The indictment alleges that he flagrantly mishandled classified documents that had serious national security implications and could put at risk human sources as well as military safety. It also suggests that he did so in full awareness of his wrongdoing and conspired to conceal those crimes from authorities. Trump, who recent polls show is the frontrunner to become the Republican party nominee for the 2024 presidential election, now faces two separate criminal indictments with more investigations ongoing. Trump Attorney 1 aka M Evan Corcoran Much of the indictment appears to be based on the notes and recordings of \u201cTrump Attorney 1\u201d, who the indictment does not name but reporters have identified as attorney M Evan Corcoran. Trump originally hired Corcoran in 2021 to defend him against federal indictment, leading to a unique situation where he may now become the star witness against the man he was tasked to protect. He is a former assistant US attorney who has worked in private practice for over two decades, but until now was not a publicly known figure. Corcoran took extensive notes and iPhone recordings of his communications with Trump, which a judge forced Corcoran to turn over to prosecutors in an exception to the usual client-attorney privilege. (The \u201ccrime-fraud exception\u201d to the rule states that communications that help perpetuate a crime are not protected.) Corcoran\u2019s notes are featured throughout the indictment, including one exchange where he states Trump made a \u201cplucking motion\u201d when discussing the documents that potentially intimated Corcoran should pluck out and destroy classified information. Corcoran, who hired his own lawyer in February as the documents case progressed, is not charged with any wrongdoing. Waltine Nauta One of the key figures in the case is Trump\u2019s personal valet or \u201cbody man\u201d who reported directly to the former president. A Navy veteran from Guam, Walt Nauta worked as a White House valet during the Trump administration and moved to Florida following the 2020 election to become Trump\u2019s personal aide. Prosecutors allege that Nauta was a point person for Trump whenever he wanted to access or hide the boxes of classified documents. The indictment states that Trump directed Nauta to transport various documents to Trump\u2019s personal residence and that Nauta helped Trump try to conceal the boxes of top secret information from the FBI. Nauta also texted two Trump employees about the documents, in one case sending a photo of a tipped-over box and classified documents spilled out on the floor of a storage room. Nauta faces several charges including conspiracy and making false statements, such as telling investigators that he didn\u2019t know where the boxes of classified documents were being stored. He is the only person other than Trump charged in the case. Supporting characters in the indictment Trump Employee 1 and Trump Employee 2 Two unnamed Trump employees are also featured in the indictment, with texts between them describing moving the classified documents to different storage locations in Mar-a-Lago to make room for business meetings. Following the employees\u2019 discussion, some of the documents were moved to a bathroom at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort and the indictment features a photo of stacks of boxes sitting next to a toilet. The staffer listed as \u201cTrump Employee 2\u201d also worked with Nauta to bring boxes from the storage room to Trump\u2019s residence for his review, according to the indictment. Employee 2 and Nauta share various text exchanges about where the boxes are stored and reference Trump\u2019s demands for information about them. Political Action Committee Representative In either August or September 2021, prosecutors say Trump met with a representative from his political action committee at his Bedminster golf club property. Trump talked about how an ongoing military operation in what the indictment lists as \u201cCountry B\u201d was going poorly, the indictment states, then proceeded to show the PAC representative a classified map of the country while simultaneously saying that he shouldn\u2019t be showing it to them. The representative, who is not named, didn\u2019t have security clearance to see information about the military operation. Trump Family Member In one exchange from the indictment, a member of Trump\u2019s family texted valet Walt Nauta about the boxes of classified documents and Trump\u2019s desire to relocate them. The family member is not named, although Nauta calls the person \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d in a text. The Writer, the Publisher and the Staffers Trump gave an interview on 21 July 2021 to a writer and publisher for a thenforthcoming book, according to the indictment. The unnamed writer and publisher, along with two of Trump\u2019s staffers who are also not named, met in the former president\u2019s office at Bedminster for a recorded interview. The book in question was reportedly former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows\u2019 autobiography, although Meadows was not there himself. During the interview, the indictment shows Trump brought up secret documents multiple times - including showing those present a classified plan of attack against a foreign country, which is described in the indictment as \u201cCountry A\u201d, that multiple outlets have reported was Iran. Neither the writer and publisher, nor Trump\u2019s staffers, had security clearance to see the document. The meeting also led to one of the more striking parts of the indictment, where Trump and one of the two staffers directly discuss the issue that he is holding onto a document that is still classified. \u201cSee as president I could have declassified it,\u201d Trump said of the document, according to the indictment. \u201cYeah. [Laughter],\u201d the staffer responds. \u201cNow I can\u2019t, you know, but this is still a secret,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYeah. [Laughter] Now we have a problem,\u201d the staffer said. The Legal Side Judge Aileen Cannon The judge that will handle the case is Aileen Cannon, who is notable for being the Trump-appointed judge who last year ruled in his favor during Trump\u2019s challenge to the Department of Justice investigation into his mishandling of classified information. Cannon\u2019s decision in that case, which was later overturned by a conservative-leaning appeals court, was widely criticized for being unusually deferential to Trump and utilizing shaky legal reasoning. Several legal experts have expressed concern about her overseeing the case, questioning her impartiality. Todd Blanche Trump\u2019s lead counsel in the documents case will be Todd Blanche, a former federal prosecutor and white-collar criminal defense lawyer. Blanche, who previously represented other Trump world figures including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, resigned as partner from his law firm to represent Trump. Blanche also represents Boris Epshteyn, one of Trump\u2019s top advisers who reportedly recommended him for the role. Two of Trump\u2019s lawyers resigned almost immediately following the release of the indictment, leading to Blanche becoming the attorney in charge of representing the former president. Jack Smith Special counsel Jack Smith is the head of the prosecution team in the case. A longtime justice department attorney, 54-year-old Smith took on the investigation into Trump\u2019s handling of the documents last November after Merrick Garland, the attorney general, assigned him the case. Smith previously was in charge of the justice department\u2019s public integrity unit, which he oversaw between 2010 and 2015. He also served as chief prosecutor for a special court at the International Criminal Court in The Hague that investigated war crimes in Kosovo, and is known for an aggressive prosecutorial style. \u201cWe have one set of laws in this country and they apply to everyone,\u201d Smith said after the charges were released."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/turkmenistan-moves-towards-plugging-massive-methane-leaks", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "Turkmenistan moves towards plugging massive methane leaks", "lead": "Central Asian country has the worst rate of climate-heating \u2018super-emitter\u2019 events in the world", "author": "Damian Carrington Environment editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T10:55:32Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079883", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d717c24774c309be869c025af6bf982e7af133ab/0_0_3264_1958/500.jpg", "body": "The president of Turkmenistan has launched two initiatives aimed at cutting the colossal leaks of methane from the country\u2019s oil and gas industry. Success would represent a major achievement in tackling the climate crisis. A roadmap will pave the way towards the central Asian country joining 150 others that have already signed the Global Methane Pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. An inter-departmental government commission will also focus on reducing emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas. Methane emissions cause 25% of global heating today. A surge since 2007 may be the biggest threat to keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5C and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, according to scientists. Tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest, simplest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions. Turkmenistan was responsible for the highest number of methane \u201csuper-emitter\u201d events in the world in 2022, the Guardian revealed in March. The worst leak caused climate pollution equivalent to the rate of emissions from 67m cars. The US and Russia also had a large number of super-emitter events. \u201cIt is very encouraging that a global effort is under way to assist Turkmenistan to mitigate its methane emissions, and that local authorities are responsive,\u201d said Manfredi Caltagirone, head of the UN\u2019s International Methane Emissions Observatory (Imeo). \u201cBut after the announcements, the real work starts to actually cut emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cOperators in Turkmenistan need to perform measurements on each of their assets, report transparently and mitigate effectively.\u201d Caltagirone said Imeo and the UN office in Turkmenistan were ready to step up their support. President Serdar Berdimuhamedov approved the methane roadmap for 2023-2024 during a cabinet meeting on 10 June. Measures include improving national legislation, cooperation with foreign partners to set up pilot projects and collaboration with Imeo. Berdimuhamedov stressed that Turkmenistan would continue to contribute in every possible way to regional and global environmental partnerships, according to reports. At the UN climate summit Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, Berdimuhamedov said Turkmenistan was reducing greenhouse gas emissions \u201cby introducing modern technologies in all spheres of the state\u2019s economy\u201d, with \u201cspecial attention\u201d to the reduction of methane emissions. Satellite data analysis for the Guardian showed little change in Turkmenistan\u2019s methane emissions from 2019-2022. Scientists whose recent research focused on 29 super-emitter events between 2017 and 2020 said the more frequent emitters were already in \u201cconflict with Turkmen law\u201d. The decree authorising the interdepartmental commission on reducing methane emissions was signed by Berdimuhamedov on 2 June, a few days after he had spoken to John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate, about potential financial support and expertise. In May, the Guardian revealed that methane leaks alone from Turkmenistan\u2019s two main fossil fuel fields caused more global heating in 2022 than the entire carbon emissions of the UK. Emissions of the gas were \u201cmind-boggling\u201d and an \u201cinfuriating\u201d problem that should be easy to fix, experts said. Foreign investment may be crucial to ending the leaks. A recent comment article in Eurasia Review said the country\u2019s government was \u201callergic to spending its own money on such undertakings\u201d The leaks are believed to come from ageing and poorly maintained oil and gas pipelines and from the venting to the atmosphere of unwanted methane gas that is produced alongside oil. However, gathering information on the ground in the repressive and authoritarian state is very difficult."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/13/top-transfer-targets-window-opens-osimhen-simakan", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "From Osimhen to Simakan: top transfer targets as the window opens", "lead": "We pick out in-demand players who could be on the move, including a World Cup winner\u2019s son and Gambia\u2019s rising star", "author": "Ed Aarons", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T10:55:28Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079885", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a0601aa600ae1e2595218efbda8017739a52a5f5/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "David Raya (Brentford) The Spain goalkeeper who used to play outfield in futsal to improve his ball skills has come a long way since being sent on loan to the Conference with Southport in 2014 as a teenager. Given that Raya made the most saves and completed more passes than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League, it\u2019s no surprise that Brentford are so far standing firm to their \u00a340m valuation of the 27-year-old, whose contract expires next summer. Tottenham appear to be the frontrunners having held talks with his representatives in recent days but Chelsea and Manchester United could be tempted to make their moves. Mohamed Simakan (RB Leipzig) Stepping into the shoes of Dayot Upamecano and Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 would be a daunting prospect for any young defender but the 23-year-old from Marseille has taken it all in his stride at RB Leipzig. The half-brother of Isma\u00ebl Bangoura, the Guinea striker who played for Dynamo Kyiv, Simakan began his career at Strasbourg and can also play at right-back. That versatility has attracted strong interest from Arsenal and Newcastle, although he will not come cheap having signed a new contract in December to 2027. Kim Min-jae (Napoli) The South Korea international was a rock at the back for Napoli as they swept to their first Scudetto for more than 30 years. Signed from Fenerbahce last summer as a replacement for the Chelsea-bound Kalidou Koulibaly, Kim is known for his strength and poise on the ball and has emerged as the main defensive target for Manchester United. Erik Ten Hag may have to find a new club for Harry Maguire before investing in the 26-year-old, and Chelsea, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain are also tracking a player whose \u20ac60m release clause is only valid for the first two weeks of July. Daichi Kamada (free agent) PSG appear to have stolen a march in the free agents market by snapping up Marcos Asensio and Milan Skriniar but there are plenty of other such bargains to be had. Kamada, who starred in Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Europa League triumph last year and for Japan at the World Cup, has been attracting interest from all over Europe with his Eintracht contract about to end but seems likely to join Milan despite late attempts from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund to sign him. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha is holding out for a big offer from a top European club and Adrien Rabiot is mulling over a new contract offer from Juventus. Mois\u00e9s Caicedo (Brighton) Brighton\u2019s determination to hang on to their supremely talented midfield general in January ended up with Caicedo signing a new contract to 2027 five weeks after the window had closed, but there is an acceptance he will probably be on the move. Brighton, having already sold Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool for a cut-price \u00a335m, will demand a much bigger fee to allow his former midfield partner to depart. Chelsea appear to be the frontrunners having made the initial approach for the 21-year-old before Arsenal entered the fray in January, although Mikel Arteta could rekindle his interest should their expected move for Declan Rice hit the buffers. Samuel Chukwueze (Villarreal) The Nigeria winger\u2019s brilliant brace against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u in April has fuelled rumours he could be on his way to the Spanish capital, although Premier League clubs and Milan are also believed to have shown interest. Given that he has one year remaining on his contract, now could be the time for Villarreal to cash in on the player who joined their youth set-up in 2017 from Nigeria\u2019s Diamond Football Academy. \u201cPeople will always talk,\u201d Chukwueze said of speculation about his future this week. \u201cI only think of Villarreal.\u201d Kh\u00e9phren Thuram (Nice) Liverpool\u2019s interest in the youngest son of the French World Cup-winning defender Lilian has been well documented. But their hopes of tying up an early deal for the 22-year-old, who was named after an Egyptian pharaoh, have been frustrated by the uncertainty surrounding the Nice owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s bid for Manchester United. Thuram is expected to cost about \u00a350m if he goes but Nice have yet to indicate whether they are prepared to let him leave. They could entertain bids from Newcastle and Chelsea once he returns from the European Under-21 Championship in July. Alex Scott (Bristol City) \u201cThings can happen that you can\u2019t really predict I suppose,\u201d said Bristol City\u2019s manager, Nigel Pearson, this week when asked about the England Under-20 midfielder. But with Brighton, Liverpool, Tottenham, West Ham and Wolves linked with a move for Scott in recent weeks, the future of the player dubbed \u201cthe Guernsey Grealish\u201d appears to lie away from Ashton Gate sooner rather than later. Viktor Gy\u00f6keres, the Sweden striker who excelled at Coventry this season, is another player from the Championship who could be on the move, with Crystal Palace, Everton, Fulham and Wolves interested. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (PSG) The revelation that France forward will not take up the option of a one-year contract extension beyond the end of next season could have multiple implications for this summer\u2019s market. Real Madrid are expected to lead the chase for Mbapp\u00e9 if PSG indicate that they would like to sell him \u2013 the fee could be more than the \u00a3166m they paid to Monaco in 2018 \u2013 so what would that mean for Harry Kane\u2019s prospects of leaving Tottenham? And with Lionel Messi gone and Neymar rumoured to be on his way out of the Parc des Princes, which players will the French champions target? It should be an intriguing couple of months. Victor Osimhen (Napoli) The asking price for the man who has become a Neapolitan idol after his exploits in Serie A this season could be anywhere between \u00a390m and \u00a3150m, such is his value. But Osimhen has made no secret of his desire to test himself in the Premier League one day and the lack of strikers at Stamford Bridge means that the boyhood Chelsea fan could get the opportunity to move to London if Napoli\u2019s president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, is in the mood to do business. Bayern Munich and Manchester United have also been linked with the Nigeria striker, who has scored 40 league goals in the past two seasons. Adama Bojang (Steve Biko FC) The star of the Gambia\u2019s run to the final at the African Under-20 Championships in February and March, the striker followed that up by scoring twice in his country\u2019s win over Honduras as they eliminated France in the group stage of the Under-20 World Cup. Bojang, who plays for Steve Biko FC in the Gambia, has been heavily scouted by European clubs for some time and looks set to make the move for about \u20ac3m. Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Wolves are among those interested from the Premier League, and Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig have also been tracking him. Rasmus H\u00f8jlund (Atalanta) Tottenham\u2019s reluctance to sell Harry Kane to a Premier League rival could prompt Manchester United to turn their attention to the 20-year-old Denmark international likened to Erling Haaland for his physical attributes. H\u00f8jlund was a revelation for club and country last season, scoring a hat-trick on his full international debut against Finland in Euro 2024 qualifying in March and adding two against Kazakhstan three days later. He is also being tracked by Chelsea but if rumours that H\u00f8jlund could switch agents to the firm that represents Erik ten Hag are true it may aid United\u2019s pursuit."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/13/ai-used-to-create-new-and-final-beatles-song-says-paul-mccartney", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "AI used to create new and final Beatles song, says Paul McCartney", "lead": "Musician says he used technology to \u2018extricate\u2019 John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo and complete a decades-old song", "author": "Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T10:51:13Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079887", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/81ffa97a938cdc60ec66d6e44ac2ae1b185aa5f6/0_100_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "A new and final Beatles recording using artificial intelligence will be released later this year, Sir Paul McCartney has announced. The musician said he had used new technology to \u201cextricate\u201d John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo and complete a decades-old song. \u201cWe just finished it up and it\u2019ll be released this year,\u201d he told the Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday. Though McCartney did not name the song, it is likely to be a 1978 Lennon composition called Now and Then. The demo was one of several songs on cassettes labelled \u201cFor Paul\u201d that Lennon made shortly before his death in 1980, which were later given to McCartney by Lennon\u2019s widow, Yoko Ono. It was largely recorded on to a boombox as Lennon sat at a piano in his New York apartment. The lyrics, which begin \u201cI know it\u2019s true, it\u2019s all because of you / And if I make it through, it\u2019s all because of you\u201d, are typical of the apologetic love songs Lennon wrote in the latter part of his career. The idea to use AI to reconstruct the demo came from Peter Jackson\u2019s eight-hour epic, Get Back. For the documentary, dialogue editor Emile de la Rey used custom-made AI to recognise the Beatles\u2019 voices and separate them from background noise. It was this process that allowed McCartney to \u201cduet\u201d with Lennon on his recent tour, including at last year\u2019s Glastonbury festival, and for new surround-sound mixes of the Beatles\u2019 Revolver album last year. \u201c[Jackson] was able to extricate John\u2019s voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cWe had John\u2019s voice and a piano and he could separate them with AI. They tell the machine: \u2018That\u2019s the voice. This is a guitar. Lose the guitar.\u2019 \u201cSo when we came to make what will be the last Beatles record, it was a demo that John had and we were able to take John\u2019s voice and get it pure through this AI. Then we can mix the record, as you would normally do. So it gives you some sort of leeway.\u201d Now and Then was previously considered a possible reunion song for the Beatles in 1995, when they were compiling their career-spanning Anthology series. The three surviving band members released two of the songs from Lennon\u2019s cassettes \u2013 Free As A Bird and Real Love \u2013 marking the band\u2019s first \u201cnew\u201d material in 25 years. But though they also attempted to record Now and Then, the session was quickly abandoned. Producer Jeff Lynne, who cleaned up the reunion songs, said the band were \u201cmessing with it\u201d during the course of one afternoon. \u201cThe song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn\u2019t finish,\u201d Lynne recalled. McCartney later revealed the song was shelved because George Harrison had called it \u201cfucking rubbish\u201d and refused to work on it. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a very good title, it needed a bit of reworking, but it had a beautiful verse and it had John singing it,\u201d he told Q Magazine. \u201c[But] George didn\u2019t like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn\u2019t do it.\u201d An additional factor behind the scrapping of the song was a technical defect in the original recording, which featured a persistent buzz from the electricity circuits in Lennon\u2019s apartment. In 2009, a new version of the demo without the background noise was released on a bootleg CD \u2013 leading to fan speculation that it was a different recording altogether, and was stolen from Lennon\u2019s apartment after his death. Over the years, there have been reports that McCartney would release a complete version of the song, and the musician has often spoken of his desire to do so. \u201cAnd there was another one that we started working on, but George went off it \u2026 that one\u2019s still lingering around,\u201d he told a BBC Four documentary on Jeff Lynne in 2012. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to nick in with Jeff and do it. Finish it, one of these days.\u201d The news comes as controversy over the use of AI music continues to mount, with high-profile fakes of Drake, the Weeknd and Kanye West receiving hundreds of thousands of streams before being scrubbed from streaming services. A UK band even used AI to imagine what Oasis might sound like if they were to reform and release a new album in 2023. McCartney, who was speaking before the launch of a new book and accompanying photography exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, said some applications of AI did give him cause for concern. \u201cI\u2019m not on the internet that much but people will say to me: \u2018Oh, yeah, there\u2019s a track where John\u2019s singing one of my songs,\u2019 and it\u2019s just AI \u2026 it\u2019s kind of scary but exciting, because it\u2019s the future.

Unfortunately for him, it might be too late. Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a pair of lawsuits against the country\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. The lawsuit against Binance, which had been previewed in an earlier action by the CFTC, the US commodities regulator, was juicy: The SEC complaint alleges that [CEO Changpeng Zhao] directed Binance to conceal the access of high-spending US customers to Binance.com. In one piece of evidence included in the lawsuit, the Binance chief compliance officer messaged a colleague saying: \u201cWe are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.\u201d Elsewhere in the lawsuit, Binance\u2019s CCO is quoted as saying: \u201cWe do not want [Binance].com to be regulated ever.\u201d The company runs two supposedly separate exchanges: a regulated US one and an anything-goes international one. A substantial chunk of each lawsuit focuses on the allegation that the company was knowingly helping traders who should only have been allowed on the regulated exchange to skip over to the international one. A Binance spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we take the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an expedited basis. They are unjustified.\u201d But it\u2019s the lawsuit against Coinbase that is sending shivers through America\u2019s cryptocurrency industry: \u201cSince at least 2019, through the Coinbase platform, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered broker \u2026 an unregistered exchange \u2026 and an unregistered clearing agency,\u201d the SEC said in its complaint. \u201cCoinbase has for years defied the regulatory structures and evaded the disclosure requirements that Congress and the SEC have constructed for the protection of the national securities markets and investors.\u201d Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer and general counsel of Coinbase, said: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance. The case against Binance is a clear allegation of clear wrongdoing: if you were to run a crypto exchange that you accept can\u2019t service American customers and then you were to secretly help American customers to trade on it, you aren\u2019t going to be too stunned when regulatory action follows. But the case against Coinbase is more fundamental. It is the SEC arguing that it is illegal to run a cryptocurrency exchange per se. Specifically, that some unknown number of crypto tokens are, in fact, regulated securities (the SEC names 13 in its suit against Coinbase, including Solana, Cardano and Polygon) and that, even if those projects are not illegal in and of themselves, helping people trade in them is. It\u2019s a controversial assessment. During the ICO boom of 2017, the SEC took action against specific crypto projects that veered too close to the sun, and generally won on the merits: selling a token to investors that looks and acts like a unit of stock, while telling them \u201cbuy this and you\u2019ll get rich\u201d, is quite easy for a financial regulator to take action on. But it is less clear that a cryptocurrency exchange where users trade tokens that aren\u2019t illegal could nonetheless function as an illegal stock exchange. Nonetheless, the industry is hedging its bets and looking for an escape hatch. Enter the UK: California-based Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) said Britain was on \u201cthe right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation\u201d. The venture capital firm\u2019s new office will open later this year and will be dedicated to investing in crypto and tech startups in the UK and Europe. Chris Dixon, the head of crypto investing at Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in a blogpost: \u201cWhile there is still work to be done, we believe that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation. \u201cThe UK also has deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and a strong entrepreneurial culture.\u201d Rishi Sunak said he was thrilled that the firm had chosen the UK, a move he said was \u201ctestament to our world-class universities and talent and our strong competitive business environment\u201d. Although the A16Z office is technically targeting \u201cthe crypto and startup ecosystem in the UK\u201d, it will functionally be extremely focused on the crypto part of that mix. The company\u2019s latest UK investment is modish crypto-AI startup Gensyn, the office is led by crypto-focused investor Sriram Krishnan, and, well, there\u2019s this statement by Sunak: As we cement the UK\u2019s place as a science and tech superpower, we must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the economy. \u201cThat success is founded on having the right regulation and guardrails in place to protect consumers and foster innovation. While there\u2019s still work to do, I\u2019m determined to unlock opportunities for this technology and turn the UK into the world\u2019s Web3 centre. It\u2019s been a long time coming for the prime minister, who first tried to attach himself to crypto\u2019s rising star when he was the chancellor. In 2021, he launched a taskforce to explore a Bank of England digital currency, and a year later, he tasked the Royal Mint with creating an NFT, just as the market imploded. (The plans were dropped just under a year later). The UK had already been benefiting from the regulatory uncertainty in the US before last week\u2019s actions, with crypto founders viewing it as a comfortable middle-ground between the risk of remaining in the US and the upheaval of relocating to a fully low-touch regime like the UAE. But a one-two punch of a gleefully optimistic prime minister in Britain and the long-awaited arrival of a true crackdown in America could be the impetus needed to spark a substantial relocation. Of course, there is one problem: Sunak\u2019s regime is not long for this world. You would need a higher risk appetite than even your typical angel investor to bet on him staying in power past 2024, and Labour is somewhat less enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies. The gamble, from those in the space with whom I\u2019ve spoken to, is less that Sunak will be able to pass friendly laws in the 18 months he has left in office, and more that when he\u2019s replaced as prime minister, a crypto clampdown will be extremely low on the list of priorities of whoever replaces him.

Justin Welby\u2019s comment came amid divisions over sexuality between conservative churches in sub-Saharan Africa and more liberal churches in the developed world. Speaking at a conference on religion and the media, Welby said the structure of the Anglican communion, which claims 85 million members worldwide, needed reform \u201cso it\u2019s no longer invariably run by a white guy from England in a communion that is 90% global south\u201d. Since the Church of England\u2019s governing body voted earlier this year in favour of allowing clergy to bless same-sex marriages, Anglican churches in some developing countries, including South Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have said they no longer recognise Welby as the head of the global church. Last week, Welby released a statement criticising the Anglican church in Uganda for its vociferous support for the world\u2019s harshest anti-LGBTQ+ law. It was a \u201cfundamental departure from our commitment to uphold the freedom and dignity of all people\u201d, he said. Welby told the conference on Monday: \u201cWithin the life of the church \u2026 we have to listen to one another and not, as a political party might do, impose one group\u2019s views on people who entirely disagree.\u201d He said he would welcome \u201cserious changes\u201d in the structure of the global church and not \u201chold on to the position of being leader of the Anglican communion\u201d. Welby also said he regarded the decline in attendance at C of E services in his 10 years as archbishop as a personal failure. \u201cEven if I were not responsible for [it], I am certainly accountable for [it]. So that, personally, I count as failure,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not sure I know what else could have been done. Because in the end \u2026 the future of the church and its survival or otherwise does not depend on archbishops; it depends on God and the providence of God. And over the last 2,000 years we\u2019ve been in infinitely worse places than this.\u201d C of E attendance fell by almost a quarter between 2019 and 2022, partly because of the Covid pandemic but also a continuation of declining numbers over several decades. Asked about the possibility of the C of E losing its privileged status as the established church of the country, Welby said disestablishment was a \u201cquestion for parliament\u201d. He added: \u201cWe could argue about whether [it\u2019s] a good thing or a bad thing and there are various views within the C of E. I\u2019m not going to say what I think. \u201cWhat I do know is God is bigger than that. It\u2019s not going to make any difference to the future of the church whether it\u2019s established or disestablished. It\u2019s in the hands of God.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/treat-williams-prolific-character-actor-dies-in-motorcycle-crash-aged-71", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "Treat Williams, prolific character actor, dies in motorcycle crash aged 71", "lead": "Golden Globe-nominated actor starred in a string of films including Hair, as well as taking a lead role in TV series Everwood", "author": "Andrew Pulver", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T10:36:15Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079895", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fe0ae08c2c56f3bd8c537ef1c7519d256dbc6bcf/0_59_3500_2099/500.jpg", "body": "Treat Williams, whose 50-year acting career saw him appear in a string of films including Hair, Prince of the City, Things to Do in Denver When You\u2019re Dead and Deep Rising, has died aged 71 after a motorcycle crash in Vermont.

Williams lived in rural Vermont, regularly posting messages on social media about his love for the area. Born Richard Treat Williams in 1951, in the 1970s he found work in the Broadway stage show of Grease, initially as an understudy but also as lead role Danny Zuko. Early film roles included a detective in the Richard Lester-directed comedy The Ritz and as a US Ranger in the war film The Eagle Has Landed, and in 1979 he had a breakthrough as George Berger in the film adaptation of hippy musical Hair, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award. Williams then appeared as idealistic detective Danny Ciello in Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1981 police-corruption drama Prince of the City (for which he received another Golden Globe nomination), and starred opposite Laura Dern as stalker/creep Arnold Friend in Smooth Talk, a 1985 adaptation of a Joyce Carol Oates short story. In 1988 he co-starred with Joe Piscopo in the zombie-cop comedy Dead Heat. Later roles included ship\u2019s captain John Finnegan in seabound horror Deep Rising, Critical Bill in neo-noir thriller Things to Do in Denver When You\u2019re Dead, opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in family drama The Deep End of the Ocean, and as a film producer in Woody Allen\u2019s 2002 comedy Hollywood Ending. Williams then took a long-running lead role in the TV series Everwood, playing a doctor who moves with his family to smalltown Colorado, which ran from 2002-2006. It led to a string of guest appearances on shows ranging from The Simpsons to Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. Williams married Pam Van Sant in 1988, and had two children."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/see-my-pain/2023/jun/13/from-hugging-lady-gaga-to-standing-in-a-dumpster-playwright-naomi-westerman-on-living-with-chronic-pain", "primaryCategory": "see-my-pain", "title": "From hugging Lady Gaga to standing in a dumpster: playwright Naomi Westerman on living with chronic pain", "lead": "With a successful career in theatre to manage, Naomi Westerman has a busy schedule \u2013 yet she also has the debilitating disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Working in theatre and screen, which are not known for being especially pro-disability, I\u2019ve always taken for granted that my clutch of complicated medical woes needed to be kept, if not secret, then certainly private. Yet it was starting a new career in theatre after a life in academia (via work with disabled theatre companies such as Graeae and Unlimited) that radicalised me into disability activism, and empowered me to come out publicly as disabled. But I rarely talk about my own conditions or the impact they have on my daily life. The social model of disability (the prevailing model used today) holds that disabled people are not disabled by our own bodies but by an ableist society, and the access barriers the world puts up; that there is \u201cnothing wrong with us\u201d, we simply need to be allowed to exist within a more inclusive world. The social model has been incredibly important for helping disabled people reframe how they view their own bodies, and in holding an ableist society accountable for the serious lack of access in the UK and elsewhere. But chronic illness sometimes fits uneasily within this. Disability is a huge spectrum and no single model will ever fit everyone. After years of being told I\u2019m imagining my pain, to now be told by other disabled activists that it\u2019s ableist to want to be cured feels eerily similar. The chronically ill for sure are hindered by ablenormative society (my kingdom for more public benches!), but there is no accessible accommodation in the world that will stop me from being in pain or let me do the things I want to do. I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve had to leave rehearsals, press nights, even holidays, claiming early trains or late meetings. I play the \u201coh so busy, much in demand hot playwright juggling so many different projects\u201d card, but when I do, I\u2019m probably lying and need to go home to nap, or just lie down because I\u2019m in so much pain I can\u2019t think straight. Sometimes I\u2019m not sure why \u2013 fear of not being believed, being seen as weak, of bucking theatre\u2019s \u201cthe show must go on no matter what\u201d mentality? Sometimes I just don\u2019t have the energy for the inevitable intrusive questions that being honest about chronic illness tends to invite. Being allowed to work shorter hours is a crucial access accommodation in and of itself, but I really wish my doctors would just find a cure. I call it the chronic illness tax. Others call it the spoon theory, a term coined by activist Christine Miserandino as a way of conceptualising how chronic illness and chronic pain limits how much energy you have to spend on everyday activity. Say each person has 50 spoons, and it takes one spoon to shower, one to wash your hair, two to make breakfast, etc. If you have a chronic illness you might only have 10 spoons, and have to decide daily what precious activities to allot each spoon to. How do you prioritise? Because it\u2019s not just \u201cbeing tired\u201d. In a world that applauds busyness, that assumes bodies are servants to will, rest is radical. Women especially are expected to just keep going, to be the reliable bedrock of both the workplace and the home, and to negate our own needs. But the cost of running out of spoons is high: serious relapse resulting in weeks or months bedridden, hospitalisation, brain fog, or just pain. Which brings us back to Lady Gaga, who has spoken about her own battles with fibromyalgia and \u201cwaking up every day not knowing how you\u2019re going to feel\u201d. I was invited to attend last year\u2019s Bafta awards, a surreal career highlight. Coming out of the loo I walked straight into Gaga, who saw a fellow crip and decided hugs were in order. It felt a bit like walking into a unicorn. Her music kept me going through so many bedridden weeks and months, but I didn\u2019t need to tell her. She knows what she means to us, because she is us. I floated home \u2026 Actually, that\u2019s a lie. I was happy, but the Baftas require that you arrive hours early, the ceremony is long and my body just can\u2019t hack that. I skipped the afterparties and limped home to go lie down, but before I could crawl into bed and scroll the endless parade of afterparty pics, I had to put the bins out. That\u2019s when it happened: fatigue and brain fog meant I forgot that my keys were in my hand and I watched them parabola through the air and land at the bottom of my building\u2019s bin store recycling dumpster. There was no alternative but to climb in, using discarded crates to form a ladder. Then someone else came along, and, well I panicked, and ducked down. Fortunately whatever neighbour was also throwing their recycling away at 11pm chose a different dumpster, because how on earth do you explain the degree of brain fog or pain-induced utter stupidity that results in you crouched inside a dumpster, wearing a ballgown, babbling about Lady Gaga and illness and pain, pain \u2013 sublime all-encompassing pain? The gender pain gap is a phenomenon in which women\u2019s pain is taken less seriously, and more frequently misdiagnosed and undertreated compared with men\u2019s \u2013 with one in two women believing that their pain is dismissed or ignored because of their gender.

The Knesset will convene on Wednesday to elect two representatives to Israel\u2019s judicial selection committee \u2013 the composition of which is at the heart of the now six-month-old battle over the future of Israeli democracy. Two of the nine members of the panel, which appoints judges, are political appointments. Historically, one has been chosen by the government and one by the opposition. The opposition has put forward the centre-left Yesh Atid MK Karine Elharar as a candidate, but several hardliners in the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s religious-nationalist coalition have demanded that both positions are filled with their own representatives. Whether the status quo will be maintained is expected to indicate how much appetite Netanyahu has to push on with the bitterly contested judicial changes package. He has sent mixed signals over the overhaul\u2019s future. However, it remains a central goal for his far-right partners and some members of his Likud party, and abandoning it could threaten his coalition. Netanyahu returned to office in late December at the head of the most rightwing government in Israeli history, and his justice minister soon announced the wide-ranging judicial overhaul on the grounds the supreme court has outsized power in a country with only one legislative body, and a perceived leftwing bias. The measures could help Netanyahu evade prosecution in his corruption trial, in which he denies all charges. Critics counter that the measures will erase democratic norms, handing politicians too much power by allowing a simple majority in the Knesset to overrule almost all of the court\u2019s decisions, and politicising the judiciary by adding more parliamentarians, or MKs, to the judicial selection committee. The announcement damaged Israel\u2019s economy and inflamed tensions with international allies worried about the country\u2019s democratic health, as well as sparking the country\u2019s largest-ever protest movement, including unexpected pressure from the tech sector and military reservists. The debate reached a climax in late March when Netanyahu fired his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his objections to the changes: wildcat strikes in response brought the country to a standstill, leading the prime minister to announce that the legislation would be delayed until the summer parliamentary session. Israel\u2019s figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, has since brokered halting compromise talks between the government and the opposition, but the negotiations have yielded little in the way of concrete solutions. Gadi Eizenkot, an opposition lawmaker, told Army Radio this week that if no opposition representative was elected to the judges selection committee, talks would be terminated. Netanyahu has kept his thoughts on Wednesday\u2019s vote to himself, and despite intense opposition lobbying of unconvinced coalition members it is still not clear which way the vote will go. The prime minister told the Likud party last week that \u201cthe reform is not dead, but we are making every effort in talks in order to reach broad agreements\u201d. One potential deal floated in the Hebrew media this week would see Elharar, the opposition candidate, appointed to the judicial selection committee, in exchange for opposition support for the reinstatement of the influential Ultra-Orthodox politician Aryeh Deri as a cabinet minister. The supreme court ruled that Deri could not serve as a minister in January, shortly after the coalition entered office, because of a previous conviction for tax offences. The affair eepened the rift over the power of Israel\u2019s courts."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/bus-driver-charged-charges-fatal-hunter-valley-crash-nsw-police-cessnock-local-court", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Hunter Valley bus driver Brett Button said \u2018fasten your seatbelts\u2019 moments before crash, court told", "lead": "Magistrate says it is clear Button is \u2018suffering\u2019 as he is granted bail in hearing at Cessnock local court", "author": "Natasha May and Elias Visontay", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T10:19:47Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079902", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b2dfd88b57912d234292b71b874cece0914e44ed/0_57_4047_2429/500.jpg", "body": "New South Wales police allege the driver of a horror bus crash that left 10 wedding guests dead and 25 injured was driving \u201ctoo quick\u201d for the conditions of the road, as two survivors remain in a critical condition.

Research from the University of Oxford reveals that the risk of death within five years of diagnosis was 14.4% for women diagnosed between 1993 and 1999. This fell to 4.9% for women diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, according to the findings published in the BMJ. For some women the risk of death within five years is as low as 0.2%, according to the large-scale research. The proportion of women who survive the disease has improved substantially since the 1990s, experts found. Cancer Research UK, which funded the study, said the figures were \u201cheartwarming\u201d and would come as reassuring news to women with breast cancer. Researchers, led by academics at the University of Oxford, tracked survival rates in half a million women diagnosed with breast cancer in England between 1993 and 2015. The authors mostly examined cases where breast cancer had not spread beyond the breast. They then tracked the cases to assess their risk of death five years after their diagnosis \u2013 when the risk of death from breast cancer was found to be highest. \u201cThe prognosis for women diagnosed with early invasive breast cancer has improved substantially since the 1990s,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cMost can expect to be long-term cancer survivors.\u201d Dr Carolyn Taylor, a professor of oncology at Oxford Population Health and lead author of the paper, said: \u201cOur study is good news for the overwhelming majority of women diagnosed with early breast cancer today because their prognosis has improved so much. \u201cTheir risk of dying from their breast cancer in the first five years after diagnosis is now 5%. \u201cIt can also be used to estimate risk for individual women in the clinic. Our study shows that prognosis after a diagnosis of early breast cancer varies widely, but patients and clinicians can use these results to predict accurate prognosis moving forward. \u201cIn the future, further research may be able to reduce the breast cancer death rates for women diagnosed with early breast cancer even more.\u201d Some of the potential drivers in the improvement in survival rates could include new treatments, improved radiotherapy, better detection and breast screening and studies which have uncovered varying characteristics of breast cancer, experts said. Cancer Research UK said this was the first study of this size with an extended follow-up to not only track which women died from their disease, but map out characteristics of the patients and their cancer. The charity said that meant doctors would be able to use it to provide an accurate prognosis for women. The paper states that among 15,533 women aged 50 to 70 with \u201cscreen-detected cancer that was HER2 negative, oestrogen receptor positive, medium grade, size 1-20 mm, and node negative\u201d the average risk of death in five years was just 0.5%. And the estimated five-year breast cancer mortality risk for a 60-year-old woman diagnosed with a \u201cscreen-detected tumour, (less than) 20mm (in size), low grade, oestrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and node negative\u201d would be only 0.2%. The researchers analysed different characteristics of the disease and found that for 63% of women, the risk of dying within five years was lower than 3%. But for 4.6% of women, the risk was 20% or higher. Cancer Research UK\u2019s chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said: \u201cIt\u2019s heartwarming news that women today have more time with their families and loved ones after an early breast cancer diagnosis. \u201cReceiving any cancer diagnosis is an extremely worrying time, but this study can give patients a more accurate prognosis and offer reassurance for many women. \u201cThrough the power of science, research, clinical trials and screening over the last 20 years, huge improvements have been made in cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the UK lags behind other countries when it comes to cancer survival. \u201cThe governments across the UK must show political leadership in cancer by taking action to help diagnose and treat cancers earlier and ensure the NHS has enough staff and equipment to meet the growing demands of the future.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/first-thing-donald-trump-to-be-arraigned-over-classified-documents", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Donald Trump to be arraigned over classified documents | First Thing", "lead": "The former president, who faces 37 criminal counts related to his handling of classified documents after leaving the presidency, is to make his first court appearance in the case in Miami", "author": "Vivian Ho", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T10:00:32Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079909", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d716a5139a1242166ba7706d01c48a9791d086f4/0_103_3113_1869/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning.

Pride is usually a busy time for the influencer, who has over 800,000 TikTok followers and posts videos about trans rights and issues. But this year, she says, fewer brands have reached out. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of my trans friends and colleagues, and we\u2019ve all noticed less brands seeking partnerships and smaller budgets for Pride campaigns,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing.\u201d After the legalization of marriage equality, Pride became a marketing opportunity for brands. Enticed by the spending power of the LGBTQ+ community \u2013 it reached over $1tn in 2021 \u2013 brands looked for ways to make their presence known at June events. But this year, some LGBTQ+ influencers say brands are showing less support than they have in the past. Like cops, corporations are not always welcome at Pride, which honors the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, an uprising against police violence led by Black trans women. Many queer activists have remained skeptical about so-called \u201crainbow capitalism\u201d and \u201cpinkwashing\u201d. \u201cOver the last decade and a half, we\u2019ve seen a swell of companies suddenly become very accepting of LGBT people during June, when they know they can make some profit off of us,\u201d said Yvie Oddly, a 29-year-old performer and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race winner. LGBTQ+ rights are under assault across the US: 45 states have proposed anti-trans bills in 2023, from so-called bathroom bills to laws that restrict the rights of trans children. Drag show bans have swept through states, with conservative leaders peddling homophobic tropes about \u201cgrooming\u201d children. The culture war has crept into advertising, especially after Bud Light tapped Dylan Mulvaney, a trans TikTok star, for an ad. The backlash was immediate and lasting: sales of the beer have dropped by nearly 30%, and two ad executives were placed on leave. US politicians including Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley ruthlessly mocked Mulvaney. Target scaled down its annual Pride collection after workers reported \u201cconfrontational behavior\u201d from angry shoppers regarding certain items in the lineup. The people behind the boycotts are in the minority: research from the LGBTQ+ advocacy organization Glaad shows that 75% of straight people feel comfortable seeing LGBTQ+ representation in media. That fact has not stopped Pride 2023 from turning into a marketing minefield. Experts have noted a quieter Pride on the corporate front, in no small part due to the Bud Light and Target case studies. It wasn\u2019t always this way. According to RILA Global Consulting, a company that studies consumers, brands, and trends, this time last year there were less than 400 social media posts calling for boycotts of Pride collections. In May 2023, that number jumped to 15,000. \u201cMoments like this really showcase the depth of commitment brands have to inclusive marketing,\u201d said Sonia Thompson, an inclusive brand coach and strategist. \u201cThe brands that are the most afraid of backlash are the ones that were going at Pride on a pretty superficial level.\u201d This year, Thompson coached a team of advertising agents who represent clients that have never done Pride campaigns. \u201cThey were wondering if this was the right time to dive in, considering the boycotts,\u201d she said. \u201cI told them that if this was a community they really wanted to stand behind, they should not let a vocal minority deter them from doing so.\u201d Some influencers have accused brands of flipping on their initial support for LGBTQ+ people, which they see as succumbing to pressure from anti-trans and homophobic groups. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed to see brands caving to bullies,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cWhen it comes to Pride, I need to know if a company is doing good in the world and actually showing up for our community. I\u2019m very selective of who I work with, and I need to know that a company is doing good in the world, not just profiting off of us.\u201d Corporate Pride collections can feel cringeworthy to the point of self-parody \u2013 Target\u2019s \u201cLive Laugh Lesbian\u201d T-shirt both annoyed and delighted TikTokers when it debuted last month. (The top was not one of the items pulled after the backlash, and it has completely sold out online.) \u201cI love Pride merch, but there is a fine line,\u201d said Ian Michael Crumm, a 30-year-old skincare influencer from New York. \u201cThere are times that you can just tell it feels like a money grab.\u201d June can be a lucrative time for Crumm, but he\u2019s more likely to work with a brand if it reaches out during any of the other 11 months. \u201cOver time, you can tell the brands that are doing it just to be a part of the moment or for consumerism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe brands that I feel truly care do things all year long.\u201d Oddly would also rather collaborate with brands outside of June. But the deals are often better during Pride. \u201cI\u2019m paid drastically differently in June, and I get more opportunities then,\u201d she said. \u201cBrands know that I am more lucrative for their business during this month than any other time of year, which is why they\u2019ll take the slight risk of hiring a drag queen to talk about things for them.\u201d No matter how much flak a company gets for selling Pride merchandise, Oddly said it would never compare to the discrimination queer people across the US face every day. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say and do something when nobody is pushing back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when companies get that pushback we\u2019re already used to, they don\u2019t know what to do. Honestly, I hope everyone gets a little bit of pushback going forward, because that\u2019s going to show me who\u2019s really there for me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/13/artificial-intelligence-us-regulation", "primaryCategory": "technology", "title": "The harm from AI is already here.

As lawmakers on the Senate judiciary subcommittee asked the 38-year-old tech mogul about the nature of his business, Altman argued that the AI industry could be dangerous and that the government needs to step in. \u201cI think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe want to be vocal about that.\u201d How governments should regulate artificial intelligence is a topic of increasing urgency in countries around the world, as advancements reach the general public and threaten to upend entire industries. The European Union has been working on regulation around the issue for a while. But in the US, the regulatory process is just getting started. American lawmakers\u2019 initial moves, several digital rights experts said, did not inspire much confidence. Many of the senators appeared to accept the AI industry\u2019s ambitious predictions as fact and trust its leaders to act in good faith. \u201cThis is your chance, folks, to tell us how to get this right,\u201d Senator John Kennedy said. \u201cTalk in plain English and tell us what rules to implement.\u201d And much of the discussion about artificial intelligence has revolved around futuristic concerns about the technology becoming sentient and turning against humanity, rather than the impact AI is already having: increasing surveillance, intensifying discrimination, weakening labor rights and creating mass misinformation. If lawmakers and government agencies repeat the same mistakes they did while attempting to regulate social media platforms, experts warn, the AI industry will become similarly entrenched in society with potentially even more disastrous consequences. \u201cThe companies that are leading the charge in the rapid development of [AI] systems are the same tech companies that have been called before Congress for antitrust violations, for violations of existing law or informational harms over the past decade,\u201d said Sarah Myers West, the managing director of the AI Now Institute, a research organization studying the societal impacts of the technology. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially being given a path to experiment in the wild with systems that we already know are capable of causing widespread harm to the public.\u201d AI fervor and attempts to regulate it In response to mass public excitement about various AI tools including ChatGPT and DALL-E, tech companies have rapidly ramped up the development or, at least, plans to develop AI tools to incorporate into their products. AI is the buzzword of the quarter, with industry executives hoping investors take notice of the mentions of AI they\u2019ve weaved throughout their most recent quarterly earnings reports. The players who have long worked in AI-adjacent spaces are reaping the benefits of the boom: chipmaker Nvidia, for instance, is now a trillion-dollar company. The White House and the federal government have announced various measures to address the fervor, hoping to make the most of it while avoiding the free-for-all that led to the last decade of social media reckoning. It has issued executive orders asking agencies to implement artificial intelligence in their systems \u201cin a manner that advances equity\u201d, invested $140m into AI research institutes, released a blueprint for an AI bill of rights, and is seeking public comment about how best to regulate the ways in which AI is used. Federal efforts to address AI have so far largely resulted in additional funding to develop \u201cethical\u201d AI, according to Ben Winters, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy research nonprofit. The only \u201cregulation-adjacent\u201d guidelines have come through executive orders which Winters says \u201caren\u2019t even really meaningful\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a clear picture that any of the \u2018regulation\u2019 of AI is going to be actual regulation rather than just support [of the technology],\u201d he said. In Congress, lawmakers appear at times to be just learning what it is they\u2019re hoping to regulate. In a letter sent on 6 June, Senator Chuck Schumer and several other lawmakers invited their colleagues to three meetings to discuss the \u201cextraordinary potential, and risks, AI presents\u201d. The first session focuses on the question \u201cWhat is AI?\u201d Another is on how to maintain American leadership in AI. The final, classified session will discuss how US national security agencies and the US\u2019s \u201cadversaries\u201d use the technology. The lack of leadership on the issue in Washington is leaving the sector room to govern itself. Altman suggests creating licensing and testing requirements for the development and release of AI tools, establishing safety standards, and bringing in independent auditors to assess the models before they are released. He and many of his contemporaries also envision an international regulator akin to the International Atomic Agency to help impose and coordinate these standards at a global scale. Those suggestions for regulation, which senators applauded him for during the hearing, would amount to little more than self-regulation, said West of the AI Now Institute. The system as Altman proposes it, she said, would allow players who check off certain boxes and are deemed \u201cresponsible\u201d to \u201cmove forward without any further levels of scrutiny or accountability\u201d. It\u2019s self-serving, she argued, and deflects from \u201cthe enforcement of the laws that we already have and the upgrading of those laws to reach even basic levels of accountability\u201d. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. Altman\u2019s and other AI leaders\u2019 proposals also focus on reining in \u201chypothetical, future\u201d systems that are able to take on certain human capabilities, according to West. Under that scheme, the regulations would not apply to AI systems as they\u2019re being rolled out today, she said. And yet the harms AI tools can cause are already being felt. Algorithms power the social feeds that have been found to funnel misinformation to wide swaths of people; it\u2019s been used to power systems that have perpetuated discrimination in housing and mortgage lending. In policing, AI-enabled surveillance technology has been found to disproportionately target and in some cases misidentify Black and brown people. AI is also increasingly used to automate error-prone weaponry such as drones. Generative AI is only expected to intensify those risks. Already ChatGPT and other large language models like Google\u2019s Bard have given responses rife with misinformation and plagiarism, threatening to dilute the quality of online information and spread factual inaccuracies. In one incident last week, a New York lawyer cited six cases in a legal brief which all turned out to be nonexistent fabrications that ChatGPT created. \u201cThe propensity for large language models to just add in totally incorrect things \u2013 some less-charitable people have just called them bullshit engines \u2013 that\u2019s a real slow-burner danger,\u201d said Daniel Leufer, senior policy analyst at the digital rights organization Access Now. During the congressional hearing, Senator Richard Blumenthal mentioned his deep concern about generative AI\u2019s impact on labor \u2013 a concern that West, of the AI Now Institute, said is already being realized: \u201cIf you look to the WGA strikes, you see the use of AI as a justification to devalue labor, to pay people less and to pay fewer people. The content moderators who are involved in training ChatGPT also recently unionized because they want to improve their labor conditions as well as their pay.\u201d The current focus on a hypothetical doomsday scenario where the servant class, composed of AI-powered bots, will become sentient enough to take over, is an expression of current inequalities, some experts have argued. A group of 16 women and non-binary tech experts, including Timnit Gebru, the former co-lead of Google\u2019s ethical AI team, released an open letter last month criticizing how the AI industry and its public relations departments have defined what risks their technology poses while ignoring the marginalized communities that are most affected. \u201cWe reject the premise that only wealthy white men get to decide what constitutes an existential threat to society,\u201d the letter said. The limits of self-regulation The budding relationship between lawmakers and the AI industry echoes the way big tech companies like Meta and Twitter have previously worked with federal and local US governments to craft regulation, a dynamic that rights groups said waters down legislation to the benefit of these companies. In 2020, Washington state, for example, passed the country\u2019s first bill regulating facial recognition \u2013 but it was written by a state senator who was also a Microsoft employee and drew criticism from civil rights groups for lacking key protections. \u201cThey end up with rules that give them a lot of room to basically create self-regulation mechanisms that don\u2019t hamper their business interests,\u201d said Mehtab Khan, an associate research scholar at the Yale Information Society Project. Conversations in the European Union about AI are far more advanced. The EU is in the midst of negotiating the AI Act, proposed legislation that would seek to limit some uses of the technology and would be the first law on AI by a major regulator. While many civil society groups point to some weaknesses of the draft legislation, including a limited approach to banning biometric data collection, they agree it\u2019s a much more cohesive starting point than what is being currently discussed in the US. Included in the draft legislation are prohibitions on \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI applications like predictive policing and facial recognition, a development advocates attribute to the years-long conversations leading up to the proposal. \u201cWe were quite lucky that we put a lot of these things on the agenda before this AI hype and generative AI, ChatGPT boom happened,\u201d said Sarah Chandler, a senior policy adviser at the international advocacy organization European Digital Rights. The European parliament is expected to vote on the proposal on 14 June. Although the center-right European People\u2019s party has pushed back aggressively against the total bans of tools like facial recognition, Chandler feels optimistic about prohibitions on predictive policing, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. The battle over the final details will continue for the better part of the next year \u2013 after the parliamentary vote, EU member governments will become involved in the negotiations. But even in the EU, the recent generative AI hype cycle and the concerns about a dystopian future have been drawing lawmakers\u2019 attention away from the harms affecting people today, Chandler said. \u201cI think ChatGPT muddies the water very much in terms of the types of harms we\u2019re actually talking about here. What are the most present harms and for whom do we care about?\u201d Despite that lack of wide-reaching regulations in the AI Act, the proposals were far-reaching enough to make Altman tell reporters that the company would cease operating if it couldn\u2019t comply with the regulations. Altman slightly walked that statement back the next day, tweeting that OpenAI had no plans to leave, but his opposition to the AI Act signaled to rights advocates his eagerness to push back against any laws that would constrain business. \u201cHe only asks for the regulation that he likes, and not for the regulation that is good for society,\u201d said Matthias Spielkamp, the executive director of Algorithm Watch, a European digital rights group. Amid the lack of urgency from US lawmakers and the administration, digital rights experts are looking at existing law and efforts at the state level to put guardrails on AI. New York, for example, will require companies to conduct annual audits for bias in their automated hiring systems, as well as notify candidates when these systems are being used and give applicants the option to request the data collected on them. There are also several existing laws that may prove useful, researchers said. The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s algorithmic disgorgement enforcement tool, for instance, allows the agency to order companies to destroy datasets or algorithms they\u2019ve built that are found to have been created using illicitly acquired data. The FTC also has regulations around deception that allow the agency to police overstated marketing claims about what a system is capable of. Antitrust laws, too, may be an effective intervention if the firms building and controlling the training of these large language models begin to engage in anticompetitive behavior. Privacy legislation on the state level could serve to provide reasonable protections against companies scraping the internet for data to train AI systems, said Winters. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience predict that the federal legislature is going to come up with something good in the near future.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/the-black-demon-review-daft-but-fun-giant-shark-mayhem-on-mexican-oil-rig", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "The Black Demon review \u2013 daft but fun giant-shark mayhem on Mexican oil rig", "lead": "Sincere performances and lively banter turn hokey into entertaining as Josh Lucas\u2019s engineer and his family do battle with a megalodon", "author": "Leslie Felperin", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T10:00:31Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079916", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eea272a96ae143c48708841eddf4ad311515ef63/162_0_5622_3376/500.jpg", "body": "It would seem that megalodons are the menace of the moment. These ginormous sharks, thought to be extinct for millions of years, have been retro-spawned for entertainment purposes by the audiovisual-industrial complex \u2013 specifically in the Meg franchise but also on the Discovery Channel \u2013 because great white sharks, veterans of the Jaws movies, just don\u2019t cut it any more. Still, in thematic terms there\u2019s a throughline that connects most shark movies: one way or another, they\u2019re all about the return of the repressed, with the sharks manifesting the oceanic subconsciousness\u2019 raging, violent id that has been enraged by the human superego effort at mastery over nature. In the original Jaws, it\u2019s not so much Bruce the shark that\u2019s the big bad as it is the township\u2019s greedy mayor, determined to declare the beach safe in the interests of capitalism. Directed by American Adrian Grunberg, its screenplay written by Boise Esquerra working from a screenplay by Carlos Cisco, The Black Demon effectively sticks to this well-greased formula. Yes, there\u2019s a ginormous shark pootling around the waters along the coast of Mexico, locally known as \u201cel demonio negro\u201d. But the real, nefarious behemoth of the deep is a leaky oil-drilling platform offshore that was installed by a fictional conglomerate known as Nixon Oil, the name itself redolent of right-wing gringo corruption. (Which is ironic because Richard Nixon, for all his sins, was the president who started the Environmental Protection Agency.) Paul (Josh Lucas) is an engineer who works for Nixon, and as the film starts he arrives in the town nearest to the rig he supervised building years ago, with his wife, Ines, (Fernanda Urrejola) and two kids, Audrey (Venus Ariel) and Tommy (Carlos Sol\u00f3rzano) in tow for a family vacation while he inspects the rig. Thanks to a series of somewhat unlikely events, all of them find themselves stranded out on the rig itself while the black demon batters the decaying structure. Employee Chato (estimable character actor Julio Cesar Cedillo) helpfully explains that the demon is sent by Tlaloc, the Aztec god of rain, who is mightily pissed off about the rig\u2019s pollution of the waters, and only by making a sacrifice to the demon will Tlaloc be appeased. Of course the white man from the oil company thinks this is nonsense, so viewers versed in genre conventions will be expecting him to be humbled by either losing his own life or that of one of the people he loves. The only certainty is that Chato\u2019s chihuahua pup Toro, a feisty little scrapper, will almost certainly survive because dogs always do in these movies. Hokey as all that is, the cast commit to it all with evident sincerity, and the banter is nearly as entertaining as the periodic scary interludes; in the latter, stunt people descend into the inky drink to try to fix doodads and whatsits that could save the party, each time risking death by shark. The oil-soaked water probably helps hide a multitude of effects\u2019 sins, as the budget looks pretty pinched. For a film of this type, though, this is pretty fun, and it\u2019s nice to see that the teenage daughter gets to save the day via an understanding of the chemistry of nail polish. \u2022 The Black Demon is released on 19 June on digital platforms, and on 17 July on DVD and Blu-ray."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/13/patriarchal-biased-israeli-women-fear-loss-rights-rabbinic-courts-legal-overhaul", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "\u2018Patriarchal and biased\u2019: Israeli women fear loss of rights in legal overhaul", "lead": "Feminist groups sound alarm over little-noticed plan to expand power of state-run religious courts", "author": "Claire Porter Robbins in Jerusalem", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T09:58:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079919", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/108f9584b90602fcccad8c0322e946f275c70af7/0_225_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "For months, the massive protests that have taken place in Israel have rallied groups across the country on issues surrounding the supreme court and judicial independence. Amid the uproar and media attention, however, Israeli feminist groups say a crucial element of the far right\u2019s judicial overhaul package has been lost in the noise, and as a result women\u2019s legal rights are more at stake than they have been in years. \u201cI think most of the public who are out protesting don\u2019t even know about this issue, but it\u2019s hugely problematic for women,\u201d said the Israeli lawyer Tamar Ben Dror of the group Women Lawyers for Social Justice, referring to a subset of changes within the Israeli government\u2019s judicial overhaul package that would massively expand the power of state-run religious courts. At present, rabbinic courts preside only over divorce cases, with some additional will and estate arbitration and religious conversion-related cases. Under the proposal, which has been largely overlooked by the protest movement, rabbinic courts would be granted the power to officiate on civil issues for the first time in 15 years, giving them equal status to the secular justice system. The rabbinic courts follow halacha, Jewish law, and do not allow women to be judges. According to Dr Susan Weiss of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, which provides legal aid and advocacy for women in Israel, rules allowing female witnesses are inconsistently applied, and rabbinical judges have barred female witnesses from testifying, even in domestic abuse cases. Rabbinic courts have also been accused of making it extremely difficult for women to receive gets, or Jewish divorces, from their husbands. \u201cThe rabbinic courts act like mediators to try and get the parties to reach some sort of agreement. And I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do when they deal with civil matters, too. But rules of evidence and burdens of proof are unclear,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cEven if we put women judges in there, they\u2019ll still apply patriarchal and biased laws.\u201d In order to have cases heard by a rabbinic court, both parties must consent to having their cases diverted from the regular court system. Ben Dror said consent was difficult to obtain in ultra-religious communities where women may be pressured to have their cases heard in the rabbinic system. Formally, a woman may decide for herself which court the case goes to, she said, \u201cbut informally, if she goes against this, she\u2019s considered a troublemaker in her community, and that means she doesn\u2019t really have equal say\u201d. Weiss and Ben Dror are part of a contingent of Israeli feminist groups that are trying to raise awareness about the dangers to women they believe the rabbinic court expansion poses. But creating a consensus across the spectrum is challenging in Israel. For Arab and Palestinian women, the proposed overhaul is frightening, but so is the status quo. \u201cAnything that is about widening authorities of religious codes, it\u2019s something that will affect all women,\u201d said Rafah Anabtawi, of the Kayan Feminist Organization. But for Palestinian women, she said, \u201cthe situation is much more complicated, because we suffer from discrimination anyway\u201d. Some Arab women\u2019s groups, including Kayan, have pushed to raise awareness about the proposed rabbinic changes. Yet Anabtawi said she understood why Palestinian citizens in Israel, who make up 20% of the population, were cynical about joining protests against the anti-judicial changes. \u201cMost of Arab society doesn\u2019t believe they are part of this struggle, and their participation will not matter because they have been advocating for reform for years. \u201cThey see how the police and government reacts when there is Jewish demonstrations versus when it\u2019s our demonstration \u2026 It\u2019s an issue of trust.\u201d Ben Dror said it was likewise difficult for ultra-Orthodox Haredi women\u2019s groups to speak out against the overhaul. \u201cThey\u2019re very concerned about the reforms, but they can\u2019t really voice that opinion. It would be frowned upon by their community.\u201d Noach Korman, the executive director of Bat Melech, a women\u2019s shelter that provides housing to Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox women and their children, disagrees that religious women are wary of the expansion of the rabbinic courts. He said there was just as much gendered bias in secular courts as in rabbinic courts. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a big difference between the secular civil code and rabbinic judges; we see differences instead between this rabbinic judge to that rabbinic judge, or this secular judge to that secular judge,\u201d he said. Korman believes that instead, feminist groups are fixated on secularising the legal system rather than the reality of women\u2019s rights. \u201cMost of the feminist movement is a secular movement, and they\u2019re against the religious code anyway,\u201d he said. The subset of changes is backed by the ultra-Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism parties, neither of which have female members of the Knesset. The preliminary vote passed 58-43 in February. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced a freeze to the judicial overhaul, including the rabbinic expansion, in late March, after huge protests threatened to shut down the country. But the fact that the specifics of the rabbinic court legislation are not well known by the public worries Weiss, who fears Netanyahu will advance it to appease religious factions. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make a compromise on the backs of women.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/13/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-situation-in-nottingham", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Tell us: have you been affected by the situation in Nottingham?", "lead": "We\u2019d like to hear from people who have been affected by the situation in Nottingham city centre", "author": "Guardian community team", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T09:40:21Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079921", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3680987e676b7dc7d10f34bbf7e11904583ae2b4/0_267_4000_2401/500.jpg", "body": "Three people have been killed in Nottingham city centre on Tuesday morning and a 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, Nottinghamshire police have said.

Before the meeting, Centrica said annual profits were expected to come in at the top end of estimates, driven by \u201csignificantly higher\u201d profits at its retail division. Centrica\u2019s profits tripled last year to an all-time high of \u00a33.3bn, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine drove oil and gas prices sharply higher and contributed to a rise in household energy bills. The Unite union has urged Centrica shareholders to reject the remuneration package for the chief executive, Chris O\u2019Shea, including what it called an \u201cobscene\u201d bonus, at the annual meeting on Tuesday morning. On top of his annual salary of \u00a3790,000, O\u2019Shea is set to receive bonus payouts of \u00a33.7m, including \u00a31.4m in cash and a long-term share bonus of \u00a32.3m. Last year, he waived a \u00a31.1m bonus, saying he could not take it \u201cgiven the hardships faced by our customers\u201d. This year\u2019s pay packet, which comes during the cost of living crisis and the prepayment meter scandal, has angered consumer groups and unions. British Gas was forced to suspend the forced installation of prepayment meters in February because of concerns over its treatment of vulnerable customers, and is subject to an investigation by the energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem. Agents acting for the company made a third of all warrant of entry applications in England and Wales last year, the Guardian revealed. Unite\u2019s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: \u201cCentrica\u2019s shareholders need to vote his remuneration package down. Mr O\u2019Shea\u2019s obscene bonus is just one glaring example of the epidemic of profiteering afflicting the country. Corporate greedflation is breaking our economy and something needs to be done about it.\u201d An influential shareholder, abrdn, has said it would vote against Centrica\u2019s remuneration report. It said the long-term incentive plan grant awarded to O\u2019Shea in 2020 was not \u201cmeaningfully reduced to reflect the depressed share price during Europe\u2019s initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. Abrdn added that it did not regard the chief executive\u2019s annual bonus of \u00a31.4m as \u201creflective of the impact of forced prepayment installations on vulnerable customers during the ongoing cost of living crisis and the current ongoing probe by Ofgem\u201d.

And Manchester City\u2019s Bernardo Silva is a target. What\u2019s more, the Ligue 1 champions are prepared to throw in Marco Verratti and the Italy goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, as part of the deal, according to the French outlet Footmercato. Talking of keepers, the Internazionale No 1 Andr\u00e9 Onana is tickling Chelsea\u2019s fancy. The new Blues manager, Mauricio Pochettino, wants fresh blood between the sticks and is all ears when it comes to offers for Kepa Arrizabalaga and \u00c9douard Mendy. Chelsea will have to tussle for Onana though, with Tottenham also interested and Inter seeking at least \u00a350m for the Cameroon international. The widely admired Atalanta forward Rasmus H\u00f8jlund has been making eyes at Manchester United, who are one of a number of clubs to have been linked with the Denmark international. Although Harry Kane remains Erik ten Hag\u2019s main attacking target, Hojlund is firmly on his radar and the player, who it has been noted has a new agent, flirtatiously said on Monday that he \u201cmust have done something right\u201d if the stories about interest from Old Trafford were true. \u201cMy goal is to reach the top shelf, and you can say that Manchester United is,\u201d he cooed. Newcastle are sizing up a bid for the Wolfsburg midfielder Felix Nmecha. The 22-year-old has been on Eddie Howe\u2019s radar for a while and the manager thinks his box-to-box style might be just the ticket for his side\u2019s Champions League campaign and, at a fee of around \u00a315m, he wouldn\u2019t break the bank, not that many things would at Newcastle these days. Another subject of United interest is Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Moussa Diaby but the protracted Old Trafford takeover saga could stall progress on any deal and make Arsenal the frontrunners for the speedy French forward. Whoever wins the race, they\u2019d have to cough up around \u00a360m for him. Arsenal are also being jostled in the queue for Brighton\u2019s Mois\u00e9s Caicedo. Chelsea, see, just can\u2019t help themselves and there are suggestions they could beat the Gunners to the Ecuadorian\u2019s signature by reaching down the back of the sofa and offering him more money. That\u2019s on top of a transfer fee likely to be around \u00a370m. With Leeds heading downwards, Crysencio Summerville is the latest rumoured departure from Elland Road, with Feyenoord a possible destination. The Dutch forward began his career with the Rotterdam club and, with Feyenoord having recently been crowned Eredivisie champions, may well be tempted by a return and Champions League football. Aston Villa and Borussia Dortmund are also interested in Summerville and they would also offer European football at various levels. And finally, in today\u2019s world domination enterprise/sportswashing news, Romelu Lukaku is the latest 30-something star to be linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League. Al-Hilal are the reported suitors in this case, a club which has also been linked with Neymar, Luka Modric and a bid to bring in Max Allegri as manager.

Homme, 50, refers to the cancer as \u201cjust the cherry on top of an interesting time period\u201d. He is currently in an ongoing dispute over the custody of his children with ex-wife Brody Dalle. Homme said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely thankful that I\u2019ll get through this, and I\u2019ll look back at this as something that\u2019s fucked up \u2013 but will have made me better.

And there\u2019s a lot of people I want to do that with.\u201d The long and bitter saga with Dalle has seen both parties file restraining orders against the other, and accuse the other of physical assault. Dalle has accused Homme of head-butting her, and telling her that he fantasised about killing her; Homme has said Dalle had punched him in the face on numerous occasions, among other attacks. In 2021, Homme\u2019s sons, now aged 11 and 7, filed a restraining order against him though this was denied by a judge. Later that year, Dalle was sentenced to community service after she violated a court order by failing to hand over the younger son to Homme; after the sentencing she defended her actions as \u201cprotecting her children\u201d. Homme\u2019s daughter, now 17, was granted a restraining order in 2021, which ended in 2022. In March that year, Homme was granted temporary sole custody of all three children, pending a custody hearing later this year. A statement in March from Homme\u2019s publicists said that court proceedings had shown the earlier restraining orders filed against him by his children were filed by Dalle\u2019s boyfriend Gunner Foxx, and that he had forged Dalle\u2019s signature for the order relating to his sons. In the case of his daughter, Homme stated that Foxx took her to court \u201cwithout the presence of either one of her parents. Prior to the hearing on this matter \u2013 at the child\u2019s request and through her own counsel \u2013 the order was rescinded.\u201d He alleged that Dalle and Foxx \u201chave not only caused the children emotional harm, but have also put them in great danger\u201d. Neither Dalle nor Foxx has commented in the wake of Homme\u2019s statement. Homme did not comment on the allegations of domestic violence. Homme does not comment on the custody case in his Revolver interview, saying: \u201cI would never talk bad about the mother of my children. And I will not talk about my children.\u201d Queens of the Stone Age are releasing a new album, In Times New Roman \u2026, on Friday. Homme adds: \u201cThis has been the darkest four years of my life,\u201d an experience that \u201csmashed my old life to pieces, [but] those pieces I\u2019ve been able to build into a ship that\u2019s about to launch\u201d."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/mental-health-crisis-young-people-bernie-sanders", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "America is facing a mental health crisis | Bernie Sanders", "lead": "Young people are grappling with challenges that no generation in modern history has been forced to deal with.

This crisis affects all generations, but has been especially devastating for young people. In America today, 40% of parents report being either extremely or very worried that their child is struggling with anxiety or depression. And they are right to be worried. According to a recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one out of every three teenagers in America reported that the state of their mental health was poor. Two out of every five teenagers felt persistently sad or hopeless. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, suicide is the second-leading cause of death among people age 15 to 24 in the United States. Nearly 20% of high school students report serious thoughts of suicide and 9% have made an attempt to take their lives. In recent months I have had the opportunity to visit a number of schools throughout Vermont and have spoken with students, teachers, administrators and parents. As chairman of the US Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, I have spoken with national experts and recently held a hearing on this subject that featured Dr Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, who has written extensively on this subject. What I have learned is that our young people today face challenges that no generation in modern history has ever been forced to deal with. The pandemic, the worst public health crisis in over 100 years, created fears in children about whether they or their loved ones would get sick or die. That\u2019s an anxiety not easily dealt with by young, developing minds. And let us not forget: over 200,000 children did lose one or both of their parents to Covid and millions more saw relatives and acquaintances become sick or hospitalized. That grief and fear remains long after any national emergency is declared over. The pandemic also brought about a massive disruption in the normal, day-to-day lives of our youth. For the first time in modern history our young people, by the millions, stopped attending school. Not only was their education severely impacted, but so were their social lives. No more getting together with friends after school or on weekends. No more dating. No more team sports. No more theater or chorus. No more doing the normal things that their parents and older brothers and sisters did. But it was not just the pandemic\u2019s impact on health that affected our young people. The pandemic also brought forth an unprecedented level of economic anxiety. It was only a few years ago that, as a result of Covid, millions of workers lost their jobs, lost their health insurance and were worried about being evicted from their homes and apartments. We can all remember the long lines of Americans lining up for emergency food boxes to feed their families. When parents lose their jobs, when they struggle to pay the rent, when they worry about putting food on the table and how to get the healthcare they need, their children are often struggling quietly beside them. And young people know something else. This economy is not working for them. Unless we bring about long-needed reforms, their generation will have a lower standard of living than their parents\u2019. How are they going to afford to go to college or pay off their student debts? Will they ever be able to buy their own home or afford healthcare? Young people are worrying about these things on a daily basis. And then there is the radical impact that screen time and social media have had on the younger generation, something that previous generations have never experienced. According to a recent survey, most kids are spending more than five hours a day on social media or playing video games. Thirty-two per cent of teens surveyed said they were online for five to six hours, 17% reported being online for seven to eight hours and 13% said they were online nine or more hours a day. What is the impact of all that screen time? Well, according to a recent study, 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse. More than 40% of Instagram users who reported feeling \u201cunattractive\u201d said the feeling began on Instagram. About 25% of teenagers who reported feeling \u201cnot good enough\u201d said it started on Instagram. But it\u2019s not just Instagram. The same can be said for Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and other social media platforms. And let\u2019s be clear. When it comes to social media, we are up against some of the most creative minds in the world, who keep coming up with new ways to get teenagers addicted to their sites in order to sell them more products and make more money. Clearly, the mental health damage they do to millions of young people is much less important to them than the huge profits they are reaping. Two other issues have also kept emerging in my discussions with young people. They are deeply concerned about climate change \u2013 and whether the planet that they and their children will be living on will be healthy or habitable. And they also question their government and the kind of political leadership in this country that has allowed this existential threat to occur. And then there is the issue of gun violence. Incredibly, there have been well over 200 mass shootings in the United States this year. They have taken place in virtually every state in the country. Almost all public schools in America now have active shooter drills. For many kids, obviously, the thought of such an attack is extremely frightening and can have a profound impact on their mental health. That is just some of the tragic reality affecting the mental health of tens of millions of young people in our country today. And what are we doing to address this crisis? The answer is: not much. Despite spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as almost any other major country on Earth, our broken and dysfunctional healthcare system allows 85 million Americans to be either uninsured or underinsured. The result: tens of millions of our people cannot afford the mental health treatments they may desperately need. This is just one more reason why we must move away from the horrific system we currently have, which is designed to bring massive profits to the insurance industry and drug companies, and pass the Medicare for All legislation I recently introduced. Unfortunately, as a result of a corrupt and rigged political system, that is not going to happen tomorrow. Further, even with decent insurance, it is hard for many to find the psychiatrists, psychologists, addiction counselors or social workers where they live. As a nation, our healthcare workforce, especially in mental health, is woefully inadequate. Right now, as chairman of the health, education, labor and pensions committee, I am working hard with my staff to address the mental health crisis within the current political realities we face. We are drafting legislation to greatly increase the number of mental health providers in the country and get them into the schools and communities where they are needed most. We are also fighting for a major increase in federally funded health care clinics so that anyone in this country, regardless of income, can get the healthcare they need - including mental health services. But, as important as increasing availability to mental health treatment is, we have got to do much more if we\u2019re going to address the root causes of this crisis. In my view, if we are truly going to resolve the mental health crisis that we face, we will need a political revolution that creates a society based on justice, compassion, human solidarity and a growing sense of community. We can no longer abide the grotesque level of corporate greed that pervades every aspect of our economy. We must move to a society in which people are treated as human beings, not commodities. Our goals are clear. We need to create an economy that works for all, not just the 1%. We need to give hope to those who have lost hope. We need to revitalize democracy, bring new people into the political process and end the corrupt campaign finance system we now have. We need to end all forms of bigotry. Is any of this easy? No. Those who own and control our economic and political systems have endless resources at their disposal to maintain the destructive status quo. But the simple truth is that we have no moral choice. If we truly care about our kids and grandchildren, if we care about the very future of our planet, we must stand up and fight back. Let\u2019s do it.

Cam Cameron, a Scottish teacher and former soldier, has been occupying a tiny guano-flecked ledge on Rockall since 30 May in the hope he can survive there for up to 60 days. For the past 11 days, Cameron, 53, from Wiltshire, has been there on his own after two companions, radio operators who took part in the first week of the expedition to help him raise money for military charities, returned to the mainland. Cameron said his greatest frustration was forgetting to pack a shortwave radio so he could talk to his friends and family; his satellite-enabled laptop has been erratic, making it far harder than he expected to communicate with home. He could also pick up music and the weather forecast \u2013 Rockall is famously one of the Met Office\u2019s maritime forecast zones. It is exposed to huge winter storms, with waves powerful enough to make the 17.5-metre-high rock vibrate on impact. He has been relying on sporadic calls via WhatsApp and text messages, so has asked Harry Brayford, his friend on the mainland helping to coordinate the mission, to see whether any ships or mariners planning to be in the area can help. There were \u201cmany things I now wish I had packed but thought better of it\u201d, Cameron said via text message. \u201cRadio is the biggest regret. I do have one but I was so preoccupied with logistics and transport and funding and weather that I forgot about what I personally needed for the trip. For my own comfort and sanity.\u201d His only company on Hall\u2019s Ledge, which measures 4 metres by 1.5 metres, are the cacophonous seabirds that inhabit Rockall; their guano and nests \u201cstink\u201d, he said. Their presence also raises the risk of contracting bird flu, he has been warned. \u201cIt is an amazing place. It\u2019s just literally a dream come true,\u201d he added. \u201cThe weather over the last few days has been damp, foggy and with some wind. It\u2019s not been the blazing hot sunshine we got for the first few days.\u201d Cameron has had two visits so far: on 4 June the Scottish marine protection vessel Hirta came by. They \u201cdropped me off a lovely Red Cross parcel\u201d, he said. \u201cSo nice to see them. Also SY Boomerang with her skipper Eddie stopped off on 7 June but no one since.\u201d The Rockall expedition has become famous among sailors and ham radio enthusiasts after Cameron\u2019s companions, Adrian \u201cNobby\u201d Styles and Emil Bertsmann, broadcast to 7,300 hams worldwide while they were on the rock. Brayford said he was putting the word out. \u201cThe shopping list he sent me is quite extensive. Amazon doesn\u2019t deliver out there,\u201d Brayford said. As well as fresh toiletries, \u201che wants a hammer, a chisel and a kilo of cement. There\u2019s no Screwfix on Rockall\u201d. One of Cameron\u2019s projects on Rockall, which was annexed by the Royal Navy in 1955 to the anger of the Irish, Danish and Icelandic governments, is to repair and affix signs that mark his and previous occupations, including one given to him by Nick Hancock, whose 45-day occupation record Cameron is hoping to beat. Hence the appeal for extra materials. Alongside his daily diary for a book he plans to write about the expedition, Cameron is writing poetry.

And it\u2019s not just Polly\u2019s family that\u2019s in trouble. A mysterious necklace transports her to Reverie, where the Aspirations, a group of humanoid mythical beings, tell her she has the gift of foresight and needs to use it to save their world as well as hers. The ideas of fate and foresight in Harmony provide a narrative anchor for developer Don\u2019t Nod, which then lays bare exactly how you go about designing the choices in a visual-novel style game such as this. Ahead of each decision in the story, you visit the Augural, a tree with nodes that each represent different choices. Each choice represents an Aspiration\u2019s approach to a problem \u2013 Power favours assertiveness, Bliss wants to avoid conflict, and so on \u2013 and making a decision locks you out of the alternatives. If you\u2019re not sure what to pick, you can look ahead on the tree and see what your choice may lead to. It\u2019s an interesting decision to show players the branching structure behind these narrative choices; Detroit: Become Human and As Dusk Falls did this too, but only in retrospect, after you\u2019d finished the game. Alas, though they are more sophisticated than binary, black-and-white morality choices, few of the decisions and consequences in Harmony are really that interesting, and sometimes being able to see what will happen next sucks the suspense out of the whole thing. There are, by design, very few surprises, and it can be oddly frustrating to be repeatedly shown all the options you\u2019ve locked off from yourself with an unrelated earlier decision. Harmony is solidly written. The visual style and animation are great, and its cast of veteran voice actors does a brilliant job. Characters express themselves in nuanced ways that are easy to empathise with, but for some reason, none of them engender any particular feelings. I didn\u2019t dislike any of them, particularly, but I also didn\u2019t care about them, which made my dalliances with their fate feel even more insubstantial. The potential apocalypse that hangs over the game is supposed to make things feel urgent, but a lot of choices you get to make are pedestrian and lead to similar outcomes, and Don\u2019t Nod draws a simple story out quite a bit in order to create room for more narrative decision-making. The only real antagonist is Mono Konzern, a shadowy drone-operating megacorporation that is hoping to get into pharma and eventually control the whole island. They are shadowy. They are evil. Did I mention how evil and shadowy they are? For Harmony\u2019s story to work, you need to believe that this is indeed a worrying foe, but MK comes across more like a Bond villain than an actual company because the game only represents it through second-hand accounts (\u201cRemember that evil thing they did?\u201d). There is both too much and too little going on in Harmony: The Fall of Reverie at any given time. It is a game of many parts that don\u2019t come together \u2013 an interesting design study packaged in a mildly boring game.

There were cameras flashing everywhere. I could hear the British people in the crowd cheering me on, saying: \u2018Come on, Tessa!\u2019\u201d The moment she realised she had won was surreal. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it; I was in seventh heaven. Everyone started clapping and I knelt down on my knees and put both hands in the air,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is for my mum and dad. It\u2019s for all my family out there. It\u2019s for the Black people in the community, for my friends and for Great Britain.\u2019\u201d Sanderson remains the only British person to have won a gold medal in a throwing event at the Olympic Games. And despite having been to six Olympics, won three Commonwealth titles and competed at the top level for more than 20 years, her journey to success wasn\u2019t straightforward. Along the way, she had to overcome obstacles including racism \u2013 within the sport and from the public \u2013 and what she feels was a lack of support from British athletics\u2019 governing body. Sanderson, the second of four siblings, was born in March 1956 in Saint Elizabeth, Jamaica. Although she spent only a few years on the island, her memories of it are vivid. \u201cWe had this marvellous life there,\u201d she says. \u201cI planted a plum tree at the back of my grandmother\u2019s garden. When I went back in 1974, for the first time, it had grown to be massive. And if you go there now, it\u2019s still beautiful.\u201d In Jamaica, Sanderson and her siblings were raised by their \u201cfantastic and loving\u201d grandparents; her parents had emigrated from Jamaica to the UK, as part of the Windrush generation, to find work. Sanderson and her siblings joined their parents in the UK when she was six. \u201cWhen the news came that we had to leave, it was a total shock. I remember I went and hid,\u201d she says. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018God, what\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 When I came to my senses, I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to see my mum and dad, everything will be great.\u2019 \u201cWhen we flew into Manchester, it was a massive shock, because there was all this snow, all this fog, loads of white people, who we had never seen before. It was so different.\u201d Sanderson and her family settled in Wolverhampton. Her father was a sheet-metal worker, her mother a factory worker and later a hairdresser. \u201cWith four children, it wasn\u2019t easy; it was far from easy,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, the Midlands was rife with racism. Even at school \u2013 we were fighting, you would get called a \u2018nignog\u2019 and a \u2018golliwog\u2019 and this and that. I used to hate Robertson\u2019s jam jars because they had those [golly dolls] on them.\u201d At school, Sanderson\u2019s exceptional sporting talent became clear, not least to her PE teacher, Barbara Richards. \u201cShe was especially fantastic,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cShe took me under her wing and we\u2019re friends to this day.\u201d At the encouragement of Richards, Sanderson joined her first athletics club, Wolverhampton &amp; Bilston, at 13. There, she came across another inspiring woman. \u201cI saw this young girl who was running. Her name was Sonia Lannaman,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cShe was a Black British sprinter and she was just superb. I watched this girl running and I thought: \u2018I want to be like her.\u2019\u201d Lannaman, a future Olympic and Commonwealth medallist, became another lifelong friend. Sanderson competed in her first national competition, the Amateur Athletic Association Junior Championships, in 1971, before competing in the European Junior Championships in 1973. Her first senior competition was the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand. \u201cI broke the British record to qualify and to get to the Games,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I remember running down every morning thinking: \u2018Has my letter come? Have I been selected yet?\u2019 When it came, I was just ecstatic. My parents were happy \u2013 and they knew then that it wasn\u2019t a game.\u201d Despite Sanderson\u2019s success at the Games \u2013 she finished fifth \u2013 a lack of funding or sponsorship money became a problem, especially as she was balancing her athletics training and competitions alongside full-time work as a tea lady and a typist. \u201cTrying to get to and from competitions, trying to book cabs that would take my javelin; everything like that was difficult,\u201d she says. A chance meeting in 1977, while returning home from a competition in Germany, was pivotal. \u201cI was on a flight and a man sat next to me and said that I had thrown very well in the competition,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cI said thank you and was quite excited, then he introduced himself as Michael Samuelson.\u201d Samuelson, a film producer, was also the UK president of the children\u2019s charity the Variety Club (now Variety). Sanderson told him her story and explained her funding difficulties. In response, Samuelson formed a group with other Variety members through which Sanderson was able to access \u00a32,000 a year (about \u00a313,000 today) in sponsorship money, which funded her right up to the 1984 Olympics. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t huge, but it was big enough to make sure that I could compete,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the turning point.\u201d But the intervening years were frustratingly tumultuous. After recording her first podium finishes in 1977 and winning gold at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada, she failed to qualify for the 1980 Olympics. She recovered from this disappointment to win silver at the 1981 European Cup, being denied gold by a world-record throw. That year, a serious injury put her out of action for almost two years; she had to watch the 1982 Commonwealth Games on a television at the end of her hospital bed. She returned to competition in 1983, achieving her career-best throw in June and finishing fourth at the World Championships in August. So, by the time the 1984 Olympics came around, Sanderson was feeling stronger in \u201cmind, body and soul\u201d. At the Games, her throw of 69.56m set a new Olympic record and won her the gold medal. She became the first Black British woman to win an Olympic title, although she did not realise it at the time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until months after I won the medal that people were saying to me: \u2018You\u2019re the first.\u2019 But when I got told that, I thought: \u2018This is happening; I\u2019ve done something amazing.\u2019 I\u2019d like to think that I set an example, because after that lots of girls, Black girls, started throwing the javelin. And I was really beginning to feel proud.\u201d *** Alongside her struggle for funding, Sanderson\u2019s path to glory was affected by a fierce, increasingly high-profile rivalry with Fatima Whitbread, her fellow British javelin thrower. At the time, Sanderson felt that Whitbread received favouritism from the British Amateur Athletic Board (BAAB), given that its promotions officer, Andy Norman, was a family friend of Whitbread (and later became her husband). \u201cFrom 1978 until the Olympics, the rivalry between Fatima and I kicked in big time, so much that it almost got to [the level of] hate,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt that no one was fighting for me apart from my family and my coach. Everything I felt that she was getting \u2013 promotion, competitions \u2013 I wasn\u2019t.\u201d As far as Sanderson was concerned, the rivalry was bitter. Whitbread won bronze at the 1984 Olympics, and came second to Sanderson at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, but beat her in several other competitions. Today, Sanderson says the duel with Whitbread was a factor in her success. \u201cIf that hard and tough rivalry wasn\u2019t there, maybe I would not have won,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was on such a level that it was aggressive. During a lot of the latter years, we hardly spoke. I regret it, in a way \u2026 we could have become better friends during competition times.\u201d As a Black athlete, Sanderson often felt overlooked and underestimated by British athletics in general and by Norman in particular, who began dating Whitbread while he was still planning Sanderson\u2019s competitions. \u201cI think he was very biased, but I did feel at times that he was racist towards me, because he would fob me off like nothing,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cAnd sometimes the language he would use, such as saying [phrases such as]: \u2018Those Black athletes over there,\u2019 it did make me feel very peculiar.\u201d Sanderson says she complained about it at the time to the British team managers and the BAAB, \u201cbut they did nothing, so I had to fight\u201d. In 1987, Sanderson threatened to boycott six official athletics events, for each of which she was being paid \u00a31,000, compared with Whitbread\u2019s \u00a310,000. Her threat led to her being offered an improved deal. After winning Olympic gold, Sanderson thought that any remaining obstacles would be removed. But she was wrong. \u201cI expected things to land in my hands, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI had to work for absolutely everything. I had an Olympic gold medal, I had no sponsorship, I had to work my job\u201d \u2013 she was still working as a typist \u2013 \u201cand then three weeks afterwards I was made redundant.\u201d Nonetheless, she continued to enjoy success, winning four major gold medals between 1986 and 1992, when she began a four-year hiatus from the sport. She insists that she didn\u2019t seriously entertain retiring from athletics until she called time in 1997. By then, she was 41 and had failed to make the finals of the 1996 Olympics and the 1997 World Championships. But she remained active in athletics, becoming a vice-chair of Sport England between 2002 and 2005 and later founding the Tessa Sanderson Foundation and Academy, which supports promising athletes; beneficiaries include the medal-winning Olympic sprinter Asha Philip. Leaving behind the exhausting, itinerant lifestyle of an international athlete afforded Sanderson the time and space to start a family. Although they had met in 1984, it wasn\u2019t until decades later that she reconnected with and, in 2010, married Densign White, a British former judo champion and Olympian. Sanderson had had several unsuccessful rounds of IVF prior to their relationship; she and White fostered and later adopted twins, Cassius and Ruby Mae, now 10. \u201cCassius is very much into football, and Ruby is a diva who loves to dance and cook,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cThey\u2019re my world.\u201d Aside from her kids, Sanderson is most sentimental about the memorabilia she has collected. \u201cI\u2019m terrible; my husband calls me a hoarder. I\u2019ve kept everything from almost every Olympic Games, from the Coca-Cola bottles in 1984 that had my own number on, to a pair of Levi\u2019s jeans that were sent to me and had my name on them.\u201d They still come in handy. \u201cA couple of months ago, my daughter had a \u2018Who would you like to be?\u2019 day at her school and she dressed up in my Barcelona Olympics top.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/trump-finds-no-new-lawyers-mar-a-lago-documents-arraignment", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Trump finds no new lawyers in time for Mar-a-Lago documents arraignment", "lead": "Exclusive: Trump is expected to be represented by existing lawyers Todd Blanche and Chris Kise", "author": "Hugo Lowell in Doral, Miami", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T09:00:45Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079942", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/48ffc5e70c9cfa64c114a6c81b6f43046d17fd45/0_0_5213_3130/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump is expected to be represented at his first court appearance to face federal criminal charges for retaining national security materials and obstruction of justice by two of his existing lawyers, despite trying to recruit a local Florida lawyer willing to join his legal defense team. The lawyers making an appearance with Trump on Tuesday will be the top former federal prosecutor Todd Blanche and the former Florida solicitor general Chris Kise, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump\u2019s co-defendant, his valet Walt Nauta, will be represented by Stanley Woodward. Trump and his legal team spent the afternoon before his arraignment interviewing potential lawyers but the interviews did not result in any joining the team in time for Trump\u2019s initial court appearance scheduled for 3pm ET on Tuesday after several attorneys declined to take him as a client. Trump has also seemingly been unable to find a specialist national security lawyer, eligible to possess a security clearance, to help him navigate the Espionage Act charges. The last-minute scramble to find a veteran trial lawyer was a familiar process for Trump, who has had difficulty hiring and keeping lawyers to defend him in the numerous federal and state criminal cases that have dogged him through his presidency and after he left the White House. After interviewing a slate of potential lawyers at his Trump Doral resort, the former president settled on having Kise appearing as the local counsel admitted to the southern district of Florida as a one-off, with Blanche being sponsored by him to appear pro hac vice, one of the people said. Blanche and Kise had dinner with Trump and other advisers on Monday at the BLT Prime restaurant at the Doral. Among the Florida lawyers who turned down Trump was Howard Srebnick, who had expressed an interest the former president at trial as early as last week in part due to the high fees involved, but ultimately was not allowed to after conferring with his law partners, the person said. The other prominent lawyer who declined to work with Trump was David Markus, who recently defended the Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum against charges that he lied to the FBI and funnelled campaign contributions into his personal accounts, the person said. Trump and his team have interviewed the corruption attorney Benedict Kuehne, who was indicted in 2008 for money laundering before the charges were dropped, the person said. But he has his own baggage as he faces disbarment for contempt of court in a recent civil suit he lost. The other interviews are understood to have been with William Barzee, as well as Bruce Zimet, the former chief assistant US attorney in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Part of the problem of recruiting new lawyers has been Trump\u2019s reputation for being a notoriously difficult client who has a record of declining legal advice and seeking to have his lawyers act as attack dogs or political aides rather than attorneys bound by ethics rules, people close to the process said. The other concern for the top lawyers in Florida being contacted by Trump\u2019s advisers has been the perceived reputational damage that could come from defending the former president, the people said, not just because of his politics but also because of the strength of the indictment, which could potentially lead to years in prison. By using Trump\u2019s own taped admissions about retaining national defense information and the witness accounts of his employees, the indictment gave compelling evidence of Trump\u2019s efforts to hoard the country\u2019s most sensitive secrets and obstruct the government\u2019s attempts to get them back. Trump is said to still be searching for a lawyer in the mold of Roy Cohn, the ruthless New York fixer who defended and mentored him before he was later disbarred \u2013 and the fear of potentially being asked to take similar actions has been a persistent issue. That fear has loomed large for numerous lawyers Trump\u2019s advisers have contacted, the people said, in particular after Trump might have made Evan Corcoran, another former lawyer who withdrew from his defense in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation, into a witness against him. According to the indictment, after Trump was issued a subpoena last year seeking the return of any classified documents, Trump took steps to remove boxes of documents from a storage room that Corcoran intended to search through in order to find materials responsive to the subpoena. The steps Trump took to have those boxes removed from the storage room, an episode now at the heart of the obstruction charge, caused Corcoran to certify a false certification to the justice department confirming that no further documents were at the property, the indictment said. As Trump\u2019s search for new lawyers in Florida continues, Blanche is expected to take the lead role in the Mar-a-Lago documents case in addition to leading the team defending Trump against state charges in New York for paying hush money to an adult film star in 2016. Though Kise is expected to appear alongside Blanche in federal district court in Miami, he has primarily handled civil litigation for Trump since he came off the documents case last October and is not expected to be on the trial team proper, a person familiar with the matter said. The scramble to find Florida lawyers came after Jim Trusty and John Rowley, the two remaining Trump lawyers after the earlier resignation of Tim Parlatore and the recusal of Corcoran, became the latest casualties of a legal team undermined by turmoil and infighting, the Guardian previously reported."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/plastic-production-plastics-treaty-environmental-diplomacy", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Whisper it, but the boom in plastic production could be about to come to a juddering halt | Geoffrey Lean", "lead": "A proposed plastics treaty could join the rescue of the ozone layer as a landmark success, says specialist environment correspondent Geoffrey Lean", "author": "Geoffrey Lean", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T09:00:44Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079944", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/630575f7722c252f30a7ec639fa8cd8913a8c355/0_70_2122_1273/500.jpg", "body": "Plastic production has soared some 30-fold since it came into widespread use in the 1960s. We now churn out about 430m tonnes a year, easily outweighing the combined mass of all 8 billion people alive. Left unabated, it continues to accelerate: plastic consumption is due to nearly double by 2050. Now there is a chance that this huge growth will stop, even go into reverse. This month in Paris, the world\u2019s governments agreed to draft a new treaty to control plastics. The UN says it could cut production by a massive 80% by 2040. Such a treaty \u2013 scheduled for agreement next year \u2013 cannot come soon enough. The amount of plastic dumped in the oceans is due to more than double by 2040. Producing single-use plastic alone emits more greenhouse gases than the whole UK. And microplastics have been found in human blood, lungs, livers, kidneys and spleens \u2013 and have crossed the placenta. No one knows the full effects on the planet \u2013 or the impact of the 3,200 potentially harmful chemicals in plastics on our health. Governments finally began to call a halt in March last year, resolving to \u201cend plastic pollution\u201d at a meeting of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and calling for a series of negotiating meetings on a possible treaty. The recent meeting in Paris was the second such \u201cplastic summit\u201d. Three more are scheduled before the end of next year. Whisper it, but \u2013 with hard work, determination and a lot of good luck \u2013 the plastics treaty might join the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer as a landmark success in environmental diplomacy. It has several important advantages. It is backed by immense public concern \u2013 uniting a whole range of issues from litter to the oceans, human health to climate breakdown \u2013 which can be translated into political pressure. And no new technology is needed: UNEP says the 80% reduction can be achieved using proven practices. These include simply eliminating much unnecessary single-use plastic packaging, ensuring reuse, and replacing many instances of plastic use with more sustainable biodegradable materials. Governments could also discourage the production of new plastics by taxing it and removing industry subsidies. Crucially, like the negotiations over ozone, it has some strong business support. A 100-strong Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty \u2013 which includes giant users of plastics such as Unilever and Coca-Cola \u2013 is pressing for tough regulatory measures. And, as in recent successful UN agreements, an alliance of governments committed to change is leading the charge. This High Ambition Coalition includes all G7 countries except Italy and the US. Importantly, Japan \u2013 which had opposed a strong treaty \u2013 recently switched sides to join it. UNEP also has a good record of cementing treaties. It has brokered a host of pacts, covering issues from wildlife to toxic wastes, and the historic Montreal protocol. That protocol \u2013 the first treaty to be ratified by every country on Earth \u2013 has phased out the use of nearly 100 substances that attack the planet\u2019s protective ozone. As a byproduct, it has done more to slow climate breakdown than any other international agreement, since many of those substances also heat the atmosphere. None of this means it will be easy. When I was reporting the story, I was told that agreeing the Montreal protocol was so dicey that the text could not immediately be translated from English into the other five official UN languages for fear of upsetting its delicate verbal compromises. Weighty, determined opposition to radical measures comes from a powerful minority of plastic-producing countries including China, India and the US. And companies that have obstructed action on global heating are mobilising. Ninety-nine per cent of plastics are made with fossil fuels and the industry is determined to expand their production to offset what it is losing to clean sources of energy. There are three main sources of contention. The majority of countries want binding global rules, while their opponents insist on voluntary ones. Most countries want to limit plastics production and ban dangerous substances, while the manufacturers focus on recycling what is produced. And the majority want decisions to be made by vote, while many of those opposed want to keep a veto by demanding consensus. This issue held up substantive talks in Paris for two days, and is still unresolved. And beyond all this lies the ever-thorny question of who will pay for the change. All in all, some kind of treaty is likely to emerge. How strong and effective it is will depend on how these issues are settled.

Part of the reason earnings growth picked up was because of April\u2019s near 10% increase in the national minimum wage but there was also evidence of rising wages in higher-paid sectors of the economy such as finance and business services. All of this presents a headache for the Bank of England, which for months has been looking for clear signs that the labour market is softening so it can take its foot off the interest rate brake. Yet over the three months to April, the economy generated an additional 250,000 jobs, a much higher figure than the 142,000 in the three months to March. Inactivity fell because more people were looking for \u2013 and finding \u2013 work. Wage growth including bonuses in the latest three months was 6.5% higher than in the same period a year ago, compared with 6.1% in the three months ending in March. Pay growth excluding bonuses picked up to 7.2% from 6.8%. Annual pay growth in the private sector rose and is running at 7.6%, not enough to keep pace with inflation but far higher than the Bank is comfortable with. It is reasonably clear what is happening. Workers are seeking pay increases that will prevent their living standards from falling. People who previously were not looking for work are now doing so in response to cost of living pressures on their household budgets. The avoidance of a recession over the winter has made companies reluctant to lose workers, even though many are still hiring only on a part-time basis. There are some tentative signs that the labour market is softening, including another fall in the stock of job vacancies, but they will not be nearly enough to assuage fears on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee that strong wage growth risks becoming entrenched. A 13th increase in interest rates is nailed on for next week. What\u2019s more, some members of the MPC will probably be arguing for a half-point rather than a quarter-point increase."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/13/call-overhaul-out-of-date-uk-abortion-laws-woman-jailed", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Ministers urged to relax abortion laws in Great Britain after woman jailed", "lead": "Labour MP criticises \u2018chilling\u2019 effect of legislation amid anger at sentence for termination outside time limit", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T08:34:53Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079949", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/953f8b795a2257efc8f3d235c31e8663f7841cf4/0_364_5468_3281/500.jpg", "body": "Ministers are facing calls to \u201cstep up\u201d and decriminalise abortion in Great Britain after a woman was jailed for terminating her pregnancy, as an influential Labour MP said she hoped her party would act if it won power. The call by Dame Diana Johnson, who previously tried to repeal the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act with a backbench bill, said ministers should act to change laws that were also having a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on doctors, midwives and others. Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, said abortion legislation was \u201cvery out of date\u201d and should be overhauled, after a woman was jailed for procuring drugs to induce an abortion after the legal limit. There was outrage on Monday after the woman, a mother of three, was sentenced. She received the medication under the \u201cpills by post\u201d scheme, which was introduced during the Covid pandemic for unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks, after a remote consultation. The woman, 44, pleaded guilty in March under the Offences Against the Person Act and will serve half of her 28-month sentence in custody and the remainder under licence. She had originally pleaded not guilty to a charge of an offence of child destruction. Nokes said the judge in the case had indicated he had believed there was a clear case for parliament to reconsider legislation surrounding abortion. \u201cI think he has a valid point. This is not something that has been debated in any great detail for many years now,\u201d she told Radio 4\u2019s World Tonight programme on Monday. \u201cAnd cases like this, although are tragic and thankfully very rare, throw into sharp relief that we are relying on legislation that is very out of date. It makes a case for parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\u201d Speaking on Tuesday morning, Johnson said Great Britain as a whole had also fallen behind Northern Ireland, after MPs voted to liberalise abortion there, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cSociety has moved on, healthcare has moved on, and I think parliament has a role now to look at reforming our abortion laws.\u201d There was a more cautious reaction from Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, who told Sky News there was a need for \u201cbetter guidance and clearer sentencing rules\u201d. A former chief crown prosecutor has said he would not have prosecuted the woman at the centre of the case, saying he would have factored in the \u201cterrible choices\u201d people were having to make during the pandemic. Citing public feeling towards laws restricting abortions and her mitigating factors, Nazir Afzal told the Today programme: \u201cHad I been involved, had I been doing this particular case, I would not have prosecuted it.\u201d The number of women and girls facing police investigations and the threat of life imprisonment under abortion laws has risen over the past three years, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS). In 2022, a woman who used abortion medication in a failed attempt to end her own pregnancy was reported to the police by her medical team. In the case of the woman jailed on Monday, prosecutors said she had knowingly misled the BPAS by saying she was below the 10-week cutoff, when she believed she was about 28 weeks pregnant. Doctors later concluded the foetus was from 32 to 34 weeks gestation (between seven and eight months) at the time of termination. In England, Scotland and Wales, abortion is generally legal up to 24 weeks but is carried out in a hospital or clinic after 10 weeks. Stoke-on-Trent crown court heard how the woman had discovered she was pregnant in December 2019 before arranging a telephone consultation with BPAS in May 2020."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/13/australia-politics-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ceda-conference-economy-cost-of-living-katy-gallagher-question-time-brittany-higgins-housing", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Morrison addresses Higgins discrepancy; PM says bus crash a \u2018tragedy beyond comprehension\u2019 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Katy Gallagher hits back at Coalition attacks, saying she conducted herself with \u2018highest levels of integrity\u2019.

Two women were seen taking the baby and putting her into a white Suzuki Liana with registration 095HI8. The car was last seen leaving Charlotte Street, Basin Pocket at 2.30pm today.

The minister for international development, Pat Conroy, has shared some images on social media from the G20 development ministers\u2019 meeting in India: Indigenous heritage laws \u2018severely outdated in SA\u2019 A state parliamentary committee has found that Aboriginal heritage laws in South Australia are severely outdated and need urgent attention, AAP reports. In a final report tabled in parliament on Tuesday, the committee made a series of recommendations to establish a regimen \u201cin accordance with community expectations\u201d. It proposed increased penalties for damage or harm to Indigenous heritage, something the government has already acted on, and recognised the need for more consistent laws across the country. Committee presiding member and upper house MP Tung Ngo said in the report: A consistent theme in the submissions received was that Aboriginal heritage laws in this state and around the nation are severely outdated and in need of urgent attention. Aboriginal heritage protection is outdated and does not reflect modern community expectations. Among its recommendations, the committee called for the definition of Aboriginal remains to be expanded to include all bodily remains, not just skeletal matter. It also urged a review of the provisions allowing ministerial authorisation for any damage to heritage sites. The committee said the government should consider ways in which Indigenous communities could be the \u201cultimate arbiters\u201d on any proposal that would affect their local heritage. Aboriginal Affairs Minister Kyam Maher said South Australia\u2019s Aboriginal heritage protection laws were failing to protect the state\u2019s ancient cultural heritage: By legislating an increase in penalties, we are sending a clear message that Aboriginal heritage is to be both protected and respected. The Labor government has blocked a Senate inquiry into the proposed Middle Arm development in the Northern Territory, despite an earlier Senate inquiry into development of the Beetaloo basin recommending a follow-up inquiry. Although Labor had indicated it would support the recommendations from the earlier Beetaloo inquiry, Labor joined the Coalition to vote down a Greens motion to set up the further inquiry. The federal government has committed $1.5bn toward the maritime infrastructure for the huge Middle Arm development in Darwin Harbour, which is being promoted by the NT government as a \u201csustainable precinct\u201d that will run on renewables and be a hub for new decarbonising industries such as green hydrogen and mineral processing for batteries. But environmentalists fear that the huge investment in Middle Arm will inevitably lead to an expansion of gas in the Northern Territory and make Beetaloo a foregone conclusion and result in \u201ca carbon bomb\u201d that will make it impossible for Australia to reach its pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Labor said it was opposing a review by the Senate as the project was at an early stage and would go through other reviews including a strategic environmental assessment. To catch up on today\u2019s biggest headlines so far, my colleague Antoun Issa has the latest: In a statement, Independent MP Zali Steggall has spoken out against the alleged leaking of confidential information provided as part of a police investigation. She said: The media should not have a leave pass on people\u2019s right to privacy\u2026 Media publication of leaked private material produced for a police investigation undermines trust and confidence in the criminal justice system for victims. This is not in the public interest. Queensland Council of Social Service (Qcoss) chief executive, Aimee McVeigh, says the short-term cost of living relief in the Queensland budget would make a \u201csignificant difference\u201d to the lives of some of the state\u2019s most vulnerable people. McVeigh welcomed rebates on power that all Queensland households will enjoy and that will likely see some not pay electricity bills at all next financial year. McVeigh said: With increasing energy costs, increasing rents and even increasing costs of groceries, people on low incomes are really finding it tough right now. People have been not turning on heaters, not turning on lights and not using power because of the pressure that the cost of energy is putting on household budgets. McVeigh said Qcoss was also \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the government\u2019s universal kindy funding, school breakfast program, swimming lessons and funding for solar panels on social housing. McVeigh\u2019s comments came a day after she described the 500 extra social homes the budget would fund as welcome but \u201cinadequate given the state\u2019s current housing crisis\u201d. Queensland Resources Council chief executive Ian Macfarlane says the state\u2019s budget has \u201crevealed the true extent in which Queenlsand relies on the resources sector\u201d but has taken an \u201cenormous hit on the future viability\u201d of the coal industry. Macfarlane told reporters at state parliament: An extraordinary record $15.3bn has been contributed to the Queenlsand government coffers from the coal industry alone. The reality is that Queensland now relies on its viability in the economy on the coal sector. But the former Liberal resources minister said the sector was facing \u201ca grim challenge\u201d with investor confidence \u201cshattered\u201d by the coal royalty increase. Treasurer Cameron Dick today unveiled a raft of short-term cost of living relief measures on the back of budget flush with an unexpected $10bn revenue windfall due to his decision to increase royalties on record-high coal prices. Sarah Hanson-Young continues speaking on the ABC and argues that the leaking of Higgins\u2019 text messages should be investigated. Greg Jennett (host): Should the AFP have a role in investigating this [portions of subpoenaed documents made public] or do you think they, as a party to the sovereign of inquiry and events generally around Brittany Higgins, are they conflicted? Hanson-Young: Frankly I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t called for an investigation already. The AFP have been pretty silent so far. Jennett: Why do you think that is? Hanson-Young: I don\u2019t know but that is a question that they need to ask. This is a very serious leak of private information and it will create a chilling impact on other victim-survivors. No doubt about it. What this says \u2013 and if the parliament doesn\u2019t respond, if the government doesn\u2019t respond, if political leaders and the police don\u2019t respond properly \u2013 what it says is watch out. There is no point telling your story, there is no point putting your head up, because you cannot trust the information will be treated properly. That is a shocking indictment on all of this. I think there are some very very serious questions. I\u2019m glad that the attorney general has referenced it today, but it needs to be investigated. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said that the \u201cpoliticking\u201d over the Higgins\u2019 allegations over the past few days has been \u201crevolting\u201d. Speaking on the ABC she said: We just step back a moment, a young woman alleged to be sexually assaulted in her workplace, she claims that when she went to her bosses, that she wasn\u2019t supported, that she felt dismissed, that she felt silenced. Years later, now her private text messages with her partner are being reported across newspapers and are being quoted in the parliament as part of a political game. The message that this sends to other women right around the country is dangerous. It is going to have a chilling effect and every politician, every policymaker and every leader in this country should be concerned of what is going on here. Polls are \u2018at disconnect to the conversations that I\u2019m seeing on the ground\u2019: yes campaigner Marcus Stewart, Uluru Dialogue Representative and yes campaigner on the Voice to parliament, just appeared on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing. He is asked about \u201cfaltering support for yes in the polls\u201d, and responded: It is a paper scissors rock [depending on what poll] you want to listen to. Ultimately the polls that we see on the news are at disconnect to the conversations that I\u2019m seeing on the ground [and] in our community with the broader Australian public. There is enormous goodwill and so we have to stay calm. We understand polls sell papers, they\u2019re clickbait, but it is not a true reflection of the mood of this nation and appetite for change and the opportunity for us to wake up a better country. There is a lot that worries me but I am absolutely confident that the day post referendum we could see change in this country for the better and we just need to remain calm \u2026 The start gun goes once the bill is passed, hopefully next week, and we take it out of the political domain \u2026 and then we have the opportunity to sit down and have a conversation with the Australian people, win the hearts and minds of the Australian public and, as I said, wake up a better country that Sunday post-referendum. Youth advocates call for voting rights to extend to 16 Non-partisan group Make It 16 has called on federal parliament to extend the vote to the country\u2019s 16- and 17-year-olds as part of a campaign to lower the voting age, AAP reports. The 16-year-old Ravin Desai told reporters at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday: At the end of the day, we\u2019re the people that will inherit the consequences or benefits of what our governments do. The group was supported by a mix of young and older crossbenchers. The independent MP Monique Ryan said young people were affected by decisions parliament made on climate, the environment, housing and the economy: All of these issues matter to them \u2013 more than to some people in this place. It\u2019s only fair that we give them this chance to participate in our democracy. The Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie supported the change and suggested an opt-in model: No one in this country has a greater stake in our future than younger Australians. They will still be here long after I\u2019ve been buried. The Greens youth spokesperson, Stephen Bates, said young people are at the forefront of so many crises confronting Australia. Austria, Argentina, Brazil, Malta, Scotland and Wales already allow 16-year-olds to have their say at the ballot box. The youth suffrage supporters credited higher rates of political engagement and voter turnout compared to older age groups, as results from those nations. Huge thanks to Amy for taking us through the day. I\u2019ll be with you for the remainder of the evening \u2013 let\u2019s get into it. A very big thank you to everyone who followed along today in what was a rougher than expected day. There are many who forget that what goes on in the chamber has very real impact on those outside of it. And the messages from today \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, recent weeks \u2013 have been heard loud and clear. It is not just politics. It matters. If that is you, if you are struggling, please know you are not alone. There are many of us who walk this path with you. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. I will be back early tomorrow to cover off the second day of the sitting. Let\u2019s hope for a gentler one. Emily Wind will take you through the afternoon. And please \u2013 take care of you Ax For those wondering about the Queensland budget, you can find a handy catch up here: The \u2018r\u2019 word The Westpac consumer sentiments and the NAB\u2019s business watch reports were released today and you will be SHOCKED, SHOCKED to learn that things are not great. CreditorWatch\u2019s chief economist, Anneke Thompson, has released a statement mentioning the \u201cr\u201d word and they are not alone \u2013 more and more economists are starting to warn we are headed into recessionary conditions. And you know how the RBA deals with recessions? It cuts interest rates. (Face melting emoji here) None of this changes the fact though that the third or so of people without housing costs or those with big saving buffers have not changed their spending patterns during this period of ongoing inflation. And the rest of us who do have housing costs and no savings are the ones who are paying the price. From Thompson\u2019s analysis: Consumer confidence remains near recessionary levels, with consumers surveyed by Westpac after the rate rise decision on June 6 noticeably more pessimistic than those surveyed the day prior. Consumer sentiment has never been this low for this long, which points to difficult times ahead for the retail sector in Australia. Already, the household goods sector is being severely impacted, with trade in this sector down almost 5% in the year to April 2023, despite record inflation over that time period. Business sentiment is now starting to fall the way of consumers, although the drop in sentiment, it must be said, is a far slower process. Business confidence now sits at -4 index points, and business conditions fell from +15 to +8 index points between April and May. More concerning is that labour and input costs edged up, a further sign that inflation is too sticky. Question time is extended to allow Tony Burke to talk about same job, same pay and then we are all freed. Was it the most unedifying QT we have seen? No. But it is coming close. Thank goodness for the independent MPs for reminding the chamber that all of this is above politics and they are actually dealing with people\u2019s lives. A gentler parliament, this is not. Katter blurs question-statement line Bob Katter has words which seem to be in the form of a question, but if this was old school Q&amp;A, Tony Jones would say \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a statement\u201d and then move on. However, the government cannot move on, so Mark Butler takes it \u2013 it is about pharmacists I think \u2013 and gives pretty much the same answer he gave the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie, earlier. \u2018Calm down Radioactive Man!\u2019 Bowen is ruled to be in order, so he continues: I met with those farmers in the impacted area, they made clear that they have support for the project and announced in response to the government\u2019s announcement of going on the nation, with local supply chain investment, estimated to be in excess of $1bn in more than 3,000 jobs in the construction phase, this investment will deliver long-term economic benefits. There are plenty of more interjections \u2013 Paul Karp hears Labor\u2019s Josh Burns call out to the Liberal\u2019s Ted O\u2019Brien \u201ccalm down Radioactive Man\u201d (again, who is Fallout Boy \u2013maybe Keith Pitt?) But all in all, it is the same old argument. The bringing of people into the gallery though, that is borrowing from old Labor tactics. This is the second time that the opposition have brought people into the gallery to make a point \u2013 last time it was pharmacists in their white coats, this time round it is farmers. It\u2019s going to be a long year. Question on power lines through Mallee farms The Nationals MP Dr Anne Webster asks Chris Bowen: My question is to the minister for climate change and energy. In the gallery today are many farmers from the Mallee. They will be impacted by the government\u2019s fast-tracking of 28,000km of polls and wires across regional Australia. How many more farmers will be impacted from Labor\u2019s arrogant policy to steamroll local communities and pushing forward 28,000km of transmission lines? Bowen: I thank the member for her question. Let\u2019s say to her and the house it would have been better if the question was more anchored in the facts. And the facts of the matter, the fact \u2026 is the member made a number of positions in a question and it is appropriate to point out that those assertions are incorrect, in relation to that, the number of farms affected will depend in no small part on the final route selected, they made an announcement two weeks ago, two weeks ago that they had changed the proposed route based on community feedback, Mr Speaker, that is no bad thing. That is no bad thing. Its original path heading north-west in the Senate through Charlton and the border to go around and hit the Murray River downstream. This is a result of community consultation, community consultation is something we take very seriously in the government, Mr Speaker, in fact, the last sitting week I met with the Murray River group council who came to talk to me about that and I accepted the meeting, the request of course, they are to speak to me about it, they said to me that they appreciated the consultation that they had engaged on, they appreciated the engagement with the government, they made that point to me, they requested a meeting and they got [one]. There is a point of order. \u2018There is a lot of work ahead of us to turn this tide\u2019: Labor on homelessness Julie Collins takes that reader question \u2013 the whole answer is a bit of an essay, so here is the main take away: The Albanese Government believes that everyone deserves a safe and secure place to call home. We know the latest data from the ABS shows the number of people experiencing homelessness climbed by 6,000 people between 2016 and 2021. It is unacceptable that almost 123,000 Australians are experiencing homelessness, as highlighted in the most recent census data. These are more than numbers. These are people, people facing the extraordinary stress of not having a safe roof over their heads. There is a lot of work ahead of us to turn this tide, and we need to work together to do it. \u2026 Earlier this year I also announced our government\u2019s continued investment of $91.7m into youth homelessness through the reconnect program over the next three years. This is in addition to the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement that will see the Albanese government provide $1.7bn this year to states and territories for the operation of housing and homelessness services. We are continuing to work with the states and territories on the future of the Housing and Homelessness Agreement, as well as the development of the National Housing and Homelessness Plan. Collins then moved on to the fund: The fund is about creating a secure, ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable rental homes over the long term. What we\u2019ve seen too often in the past is investments in housing being disrupted by changes of government \u2013 a boost from a government that prioritises housing followed by cuts when a government with different priorities and policies is elected. This is exactly why the Fund is structured in the way that it is. Putting it at arm\u2019s length from budget cycles and changes of government will mean it remains in place. Let\u2019s do another Reader QT. Jenny would like to know: Statistical data shows that the homelessness rates among the population in the Aukus countries are approximately: US 0.18% and worsening. UK 0.39% and worsening. AU 0.49% and worsening. In Europe, Germany has the highest rate of homelessness at 0.37% of the population China has been addressing poverty as part of their economic growth. They currently have an estimated homelessness of 0.18% but it is improving On the Australian government\u2019s attorney general\u2019s website we can read that: \u201cEveryone has the right to an adequate standard of living including adequate food, water and housing and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.\u201d In regard to housing, would the 130,000 Australians who are currently homelessness be better off living in China? Queensland budget day update Stepping into the Greatest Nation on Earth for a moment and Joe Hinchliffe has an update on Queensland\u2019s budget day: Queensland\u2019s opposition Liberal National party says Labor\u2019s budget \u2013 though flush with an unexpected $10bn revenue windfall due to its controversial decision to increase royalties on record-high coal prices \u2013 will fail to fix long-term solutions to the cost of living, youth crime, health and housing crises. The shadow treasurer, David Janetzki, says Queensland will have \u201cnothing to show\u201d for the billions of dollars more than was previously forecast: After the rivers of gold dry up, Queensland will have nothing to show but the highest debt in our state\u2019s history, the highest taxes and failing frontline services. Labor asked about Privacy Act and Higgins The independent MP Zali Steggall asks Mark Dreyfus: To the attorney general, media publication of leaked private material produced during a police investigation undermined trust and confidence in the criminal justice system for victims. The Privacy Act review and the Australian law reform submission have recommended strengthening the privacy standards that media organisations should consider prior to publication. What steps is the government taking to review the privacy act for journalism as journalists have an inadequate self-regulated code of ethics and Australia does not have a statutory tort for breach of privacy? Dreyfus says: As attorney general, I am deeply concerned about the apparent unauthorised publication of material produced as a result of a subpoena in the criminal trial of Mr Bruce Lehrmann. Material produced to a court in response to a subpoena is subject to an implied undertaking from the parties who receive it, that it won\u2019t be used for purposes other than for those court proceedings. So the rule known as the Harmon rule or the Harmon undertaking, to breach it may constitute a contempt of court. I do understand that the Australian federal police have received a complaint in respect of this matter and that the AFP is currently assessing that complaint. \u2018The most egregious abuse of privacy I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019: Gallagher on leaking of Higgins\u2019s text messages In the Senate\u2019s QT, the Coalition\u2019s attack on Katy Gallagher continues. The finance minister has blasted the publication of Brittany Higgins\u2019s text messages, calling it \u201cthe most egregious abuse of privacy I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. Gallagher conceded that she received information about Brittany Higgins\u2019s rape allegations \u201cseveral days before the first public reports went to air\u201d but said she \u201cdid nothing with that information, absolutely nothing\u201d: I was asked to keep it to myself and I did. I won\u2019t stand here and go through private conversations I had with a person at the centre of a very very difficult time in her life, a person who has had her privacy breached in the most egregious way over the last 2 years. Asked by Bridget McKenzie about texts, as reported in the News Corp press, purportedly showing Higgins\u2019s partner talking about discussing the matter with Gallagher and that the now minister had suggested questions for Higgins to prepare for, Gallagher would not comment. Asked several questions about this matter, Gallagher referred back to her statement, adding \u201cthe welfare of Brittany Higgins matters to me\u201d. Subjecting her to further commentary in a very distressing time for her, as minister for women, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable. Gallagher said the current rhetoric would have an effect on other women \u201cwondering if they should stand up and say something\u201d about their own experiences. The speaker, Milton Dick, agrees and gives a warning to the chamber, reminding them they have a role to play and a standard to set. Sussan Ley chooses that moment to make a point of order herself: The points that the member for Goldstein raised around the content of the conversation would be respected better by the minister if she simply answered the question. Dick says Plibersek is being relevant. Tanya Plibersek takes up the answer again: I want to thank the member for Goldstein for bringing us back to what matters here. This conversation is an incredibly difficult conversation for many thousands of people who are watching this right now. They find it distressing because they know that when victims of sexual assault report these matters to the police, they often go into a process which is revictimising and retraumatising. In every instance, Mr Speaker, I behaved ethically and completely properly, respectful of the issues at hand and respectful of the people involved. Barnaby Joyce forgets that he is not \u201cdebating\u201d Plibersek on Sunrise and shouts something \u2013 Dick tells him to shut it. But more parliamentary than that. \u2018Nobody tells me what to ask in question time\u2019: Plibersek Tanya Plibersek: I say again, nobody tells me what to ask in question time. But is it any surprise that the shadow minister for women, when she hears in the media, that there has been a sexual assault in Parliament House, a very serious allegation \u2026 in the media that that had been inappropriately dealt with by the employers in this place, that she would ask questions. Is there any wonder \u2013 and, in fact, Mr Speaker, I would say I would not have been doing my job at all if I had not asked questions about this. Can I take us back to the issue at hand here once again? Is it any wonder, Mr Speaker, that only 13% of sexual assaults in this country are reported to police when we see what has been happening in the media this week? With sms messages leaked to the media. With private conversations taped and leaked to the media. There are so many heckles and interjections it is hard to keep up. The independent MP Zoe Daniel hears them too and makes a point of order: I remind the chamber how triggering this conversation is for the woman involved, for the staff in the building and the women around Australia, who are victims of sexual assault. And I also remind the chamber that we have young people in the gallery listening to this behaviour. We are back on that again. Sussan Ley asks Tanya Plibersek: In the last parliament the member asked 16 questions in question time relating to the serious allegations aired on the Project. When asked about this questioning on Sunrise on 5 June this year, the minister stated that nobody tells me what to ask in question time. Did the minister engage with any third parties regarding the content of these questions before she asked them? There is the same back and forth about whether the question is relevant, going over the same ground we just covered in the previous post. Tanya Plibersek takes the question. This is going to keep coming up. The issue is the opposition can only ask questions about what ministers are doing now/this term of government. So it can\u2019t ask questions about previous roles, or previous parliaments. So the Coalition is trying to link previous comments to current media interviews to have the questions ruled in order. So it is a thin line and a confusing one, but essentially, the opposition has to ask questions about what government MPs are doing now, not what they have previously done/said in previous roles/parliaments. The answer is done, but Sussan Ley tries again to make HER point: The minister\u2019s non-answer to the question relates to your ruling, I suggest, and I want to ask, to your ruling, and quote from practice, where ministers have made statements either inside or outside the House about matters that may concern their actions before becoming a minister, questions have been permitted on those statements. I am not sure what in your ruling narrows the answer that the minister was entitled to give so that she actually could not address the question that I was asking her. Tony Burke is on his feet just as quickly: Just to the point of order, Mr Speaker. \u2018Cause there\u2019s no doubt this issue will arise again on other times. It has over the last 10 years. The key point is the final two words that were just read out by the deputy leader, which is about questions have been permitted on those statements. The question can only be asked about the statement that has been made while the member was a minister. And then Paul Fletcher tries: What the minister said in her interview on Monday went specifically to the question of who had known what prior to the episode being broadcast. I\u2019d suggest to you that the deputy leader is entirely within the standing orders in the question she is asking. And then Dick says, with a little bit of exasperation that that is the point. That\u2019s why it was allowed. That\u2019s correct. If it wasn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t have been allowed. \u2018You bet I asked questions\u2019: Tanya Plibersek on Higgins\u2019s follow-up allegation Tanya Plibersek tries to continue her answer: The deputy leader of the opposition asked me if I stand by what I said on Monday and I do. I tell you why I do. Because it shocks me that in this place today we\u2019ve got these sorts of questions when what the issue is here is a young woman who worked in this place has made a serious allegation \u2026 That she complained and has further alleged that her complaint and complaint was not dealt with appropriately by her employer. You bet I asked questions, you bet I took it seriously. Would I do the same again? I 100% would. There is a reason \u2026 There is a reason only 13% of sexual assaults are reported to the police in this country. Independent MP Kylea Tink then comes to her feet with a point of order: It\u2019s just on standing order number 91 which is about disorderly conduct. This is a conversation which is highly emotive and there are questions to be answered here but I do not think it\u2019s appropriate for any member of this House to be yelling across the chamber at anothermember to simply shut up. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate. So if I could call the House back to order and ask that that be addressed. Milton Dick calls the house to order. Interjections aplenty It is a complicated one, but Milton Dick allows the question. Mostly. He asks Tanya Plibersek to not stray into what is outside practice (so while she was in opposition) and to tread carefully \u2013 ie, stick to what she said on Monday in the interview with Sunrise. Plibersek is back on her feet: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I 100% stand by what I said on Monday and I 100% stand by what I have done at every stage, at every stage. And I tell you what really shocks me about this and what really disappoints me is that once again we are missing the point here. A young woman who worked in this place has made a serious allegation that she was sexually assaulted in her workplace. She has made serious allegations that that was not properly investigated or dealt with \u2026 Sussan Ley is back: Mr Speaker, the question was within the standing orders. The minister indicated her willingness to answer the question. The point of order now is on relevance. The direct question was, was the minister or her office aware prior to 15 February 2021 of the allegations aired on the Project that night. So if she\u2019s answering the question she needs to answer the question. Milton Dick says if that was the question then it would have been out of order. There are so many interjections here, it is hard to keep up and given the subject it is pretty gross. Sussan Ley is up now and asks Tanya Plibersek: I refer the minister to her recent interviews on Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise \u2013 was the minister or her office aware prior to 15 February 2021 of the allegations aired on the Project that night? Plibersek gets up and goes to answer, when Tony Burke gets to his feet: I refer to page 554 and 555 of practice. There are a number of occasions, and we\u2019ve been through this a lot over the years, and there are many precedents under Speaker Smith, where if a question is asked about someone that goes to a period prior to them holding the portfolio, the first question that can only be asked is to refer to the quotation where, as a minister, they have referenced back to it and to ask whether that is correct. That \u2013 simply referring to it and asking a different question certainly, our whole time in Opposition, that never got it over the line. The first question always had to be providing the quotation exactly in line with that precedent, asking whether that was accurate and then subsequent questions could come based on the answer the minister had then given. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s worked here the whole way through. Paul Fletcher argues it is in order saying: Where ministers have made statements inside or outside the house that may concern their actions before becoming a member and or a minister, questions have been permitted on those statements. The question was very specifically in relation to quite extensive statements. The minister has received the question made about this matter on Sunrise on Monday and indeed prior to that. Julie Collins took a dixer on the housing fund during that foray into senate QT and mentioned the Greens leader, Adam Bandt\u2019s earlier support for a future fund \u2013 Paul Karp hears Bandt respond: It was a sovereign wealth fund, for the super profits tax. The Liberal MP Tony Pasin interjected with \u201cfriends are fighting\u201d. So that is the standard of chamber debate today. \u2018I don\u2019t intend to disclose further interactions\u2019: Gallagher Senator Katy Gallagher says she didn\u2019t pass on information from Brittany Higgins to her staff, Penny Wong or Anthony Albanese, as she maintains she was keeping Higgins\u2019s confidence by not spreading that information. In Senate question time, the Coalition opposition went straight on the attack about Gallagher\u2019s knowledge of Higgins\u2019s allegations, asking what she knew and when she knew it. Gallagher referred back to her lengthy Senate statement earlier in the day, and stressed that while she was told some information ahead of time, that info was given to her by people who \u201casked to keep it confidential\u201d. Gallagher, responding to questions from Simon Birmingham and Michaelia Cash, said: \u201cWhat you\u2019re asking me to do is breach the confidence \u2026 to disclose information that was given to me and asked to be kept in confidence by a woman who was alleged to have been raped.\u201d Gallagher again confirmed she did receive some information but added: I don\u2019t intend to disclose further interactions between any people who contacted me and asked to keep their confidence. The finance minister was also critical of \u201cleaked messages being sprayed around TV and newspaper\u201d. The message is if you confide in anybody, seek help from anybody, you will be subject to that information being sought and put on the public record. She called for \u201crespect for Brittany Higgins\u201d as the opposition continued questions. Asked directly about what she did with the information, Gallagher said she didn\u2019t communicate the information to her staff, Wong or her staff, or Albanese and his staff. The New South Wales branch of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) has welcomed the overwhelming backing of union members to support the University of Sydney\u2019s current enterprise bargaining agreement and avoid future strikes. Al Scott, digital communications organiser at the NSW division, said the vote, with more than 900 members in attendance, was the biggest NTEU branch meeting on record. 80% of those members voted yes. Sources close to Guardian Australia have suggested there is internal disagreement among hardline no voters who think casual staff are being shortchanged by the agreement, with some suggesting an alternative minority strike. While noting some of the union\u2019s claims were unable to have been achieved, Scott said the NTEU had been able to secure a workload balance between teaching and research academic roles. The agreement also commits to the 20% de-casualisation of casual academic labour and casual sick leave. A University of Sydney spokesperson said it had \u201calways maintained\u201d it wanted to put a union endorsed agreement to staff and had agreed to many proposals throughout: As such the NTEU members\u2019 endorsement was an important stage in the approval process and we are delighted the response was 80% ... we can now move quickly through the remaining steps and provide colleagues with a $2000 sign-on payment plus a significant annual salary increase, and access to enhanced working conditions. Surely the shortest exchange for the session \u2026 Peter Dutton is up now: Prime minister, has Senator Gallagher misled the senate? Anthony Albanese: No. (That was the entire answer) Labor fields question on regional pharmacies The independent MP for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie, asks Mark Butler: I support consumer access to cheaper medicines. However, many of my Mayo pharmacists are genuinely worried that the 60-day dispensing without adequate compensation will lead them to lay off staff, reduce services or close, I ask the minister what modelling has been done on the impacts of regional pharmacies and will the minister assure the house that no pharmacy would be forced to lay off staff or close as a result? Mark Butler gives pretty much the same answer he did last sitting, when these questions were asked by the Liberal MPs while pharmacists were in the gallery. He finishes with: Of course we are committed to the viability of the community pharmacy sector. Which is why we have committed to fully reinvesting all of the savings \u2013 that is we make sure and the most substantial focus of us in designing that reinvestment package is on the impact of small rural pharmacies. We have had a couple of good discussions with the member for Mayo and we are doubling a rural allowance pharmacies receive to stay open \u2026 There are areas where pharmacies will receive an increase from $40,000 in their allowance to $90,000, a 120% increase in the payments they receive simply to remain open. We\u2019re still consulting about that. Butler sits down, but Darren Chester who has the Nationals\u2019 role of attacker-in-chief (which Sussan Ley fulfils for the Liberals) asks to extend time for Butler to go into the modelling, but his heart isn\u2019t really in it (and it is pointless as the minister has completed his answer). During the dixer Jim Chalmers was taking on the housing fund just a moment ago, Paul Karp heard the opposition heckling the treasurer about the housing fund. Aaron Vitoli was shouting \u201cnot a dollar for housing\u201d which is a Greens talking point as a heckle, while Michael Sukkar called out \u201cHow are those 1m new homes going?\u201d. Probably worth pointing out the Coalition is not supporting the housing bill either. Labor asked about the ongoing dangers of Covid-19 Reader QT time and Tanya asked Mark Butler: With more than 194 deaths last week and rising, why does the government refuse to inform the community about the dangers and ways of prevention of Covid-19 and is the media prevented from reporting on one of the most dangerous current health issues? Mark Butler: Every death to Covid-19 is a tragedy. My thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have passed away. The government is continuing to monitor Covid-19 cases numbers closely, especially over the winter period as we experience a predicted rise in case numbers. Crucially, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths remain low compared with previous Omicron waves. I encourage all Australians to ensure they are up to date with recommended vaccinations. Vaccination is the single most important step each of us can take to minimise the risk of severe disease and death associated with Covid-19 infection. The government continues to deliver important public health information about Covid-19. Messages on the importance of boosters, treatments, masks and Covid-19 safe behaviours are delivered regularly through a range of channels including media and social media, stakeholder networks (including aged and disability care), webinars, newsletters and advertising. The current phase of the national Covid-19 campaign, called \u2018Top Up\u2019, has been in market since April 2023, and is running across television, radio, out of home, digital, social media, and cinema. It highlights the importance of booster vaccination as the best way to maintain protection against severe Covid-19 illness. This communication activity is focused on providing the latest Atagi advice regarding booster vaccination in 2023 \u2013 informing adults that if it has been 6 months or more since your last Covid-19 vaccination or infection, you should consider a booster. Specific materials have been developed for First Nations audiences and information has been translated for culturally and linguistically diverse audiences. All these resources can be found on the Department of Health website at www.health.gov.au/TopUp. In addition, a range of ongoing targeted activities support the current advertising. These have a particular focus on reaching priority and vulnerable audiences and seek to connect people with credible information sources, encourage uptake of vaccination and treatments, and promote protective Covid-19 behaviours. This include stakeholder kits, community engagement, social media and media activities. The Department of Health and Aged Care\u2019s website also includes accurate, easy to understand information and resources on Covid-19, including the risks posed by Covid-19, the various ways people can protect themselves from infection, how to book a Covid-19 vaccination, eligibility for oral treatments, publicly available case numbers and statistics and dedicated resources for those working in the aged care or disability sectors. Visit www.health.gov.au for more information. Anthony Albanese finishes with: I was asked about what the prime minister\u2019s office knew. And the truth is \u2026 that goes to the heart of what this issue is. The heart of what this issue is. The heart of what this issue is. Because the heart of this issue goes to an alleged sexual assault by a Liberal staffer against another Liberal staff member in a Liberal minister\u2019s office in 2019. Metres away from the then Liberal prime minister\u2019s office. When these allegations became public, two years after the Morrison government became aware of the security breach, the truth is that it sent shock waves not just through the parliament but through the nation. As it was the first step in exposing a problematic culture in what should be Australia\u2019s safest building, the one right here. Scott Morrison \u2026 had an inquiry by Gaetjens, his former Chief of Staff who was then his head of his staff, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet about who knew what when in his office. That report has not never been released. What we do know is that the leader of the opposition informed the prime minister\u2019s office, prior to that information becoming public, prior to that, but he didn\u2019t reveal that until 10 days after news.com.au published this information at 8.00 am on 15 February, and the Project interviewed or aired an interview with Ms Brittany Higgins on the Project that evening. For 10 days the leader of the opposition said nothing about what he knew and about the fact that he informed the prime minister\u2019s office on that day. There is then a flurry of point of orders over how Anthony Albanese is answering the question. Peter Dutton says: This is a tricky answer. The prime minister was asked a question. I asked, Mr Speaker, in terms of \u2026 With respect to your office, I framed it in that way, Mr Speaker, if he wants to play these silly juvenile games, the Australian public \u2026 Tony Burke is on his feet now: The question from the leader of the opposition was completely in order because it asked about the prime minister\u2019s office. If he wants to ask about a different question to get a different answer then page 553 of practice will tell him how to do that. But the prime minister is simply answering the question that\u2019s asked. And had the question been \u2026 What the leader of the opposition is embarrassed about is he couldn\u2019t work out how to get a question in order. Paul Fletcher then steps up to argue his boss\u2019s case: The question from the leader of the opposition clearly referred to the prime minister. That\u2019s the prime minister of the day, this man sitting here. He knows what to answer \u2013 all kinds of sneakiness and trickiness does not get around what is and what he is supposed to be answering. Milton Dick rules: I just want to deal with this matter before I return to the prime minister. As members know, the including the manager and the leader of the opposition, the prime minister cannot be asked under standing orders \u2013 and the manager is correct on page 553 of practice which makes it clears that ministers or prime ministers cannot be asked about their former role or a private member before coming a minister. The question was line ball in terms of what the prime minister is responsible for. Just moving forward, questions will be ruled out of order in terms of actions or issues before ministers or prime ministers came into these roles. Back to regular question time now and Peter Dutton asks: My question is to the prime minister. When did the prime minister or the prime minister\u2019s office become aware of allegations concerning sexual assault as broadcast by the Project in 2021? (News.com broke the story earlier in the day, before the Project interview) Anthony Albanese is prepared for this question: Well, of course, the leader of the opposition asked the question about when did the prime minister\u2019s office know about this and indeed that is the question, when did the prime minister\u2019s office know. When did the prime minister\u2019s office know? (There are many, many interjections here) Because \u2026 there was of course an inquiry into what the prime minister\u2019s office knew and when and who was told, and we still have never seen the Gaetjens inquiry. We still have never seen the Gaetjens inquiry. We know that the leader of the opposition asked this question but I\u2019m surprised because he knows \u2013 he informed the prime minister\u2019s office days before \u2026 days and days before there was any public announcement of this. Here is the first of our Reader QT questions Hayden wanted to know: Given that defence has failed to meet recruiting targets for more than 10 years in a row, separation rates are at a record high, and the Defence Strategic Review made no specific recommendations into how to fix the problem, what is the government going to do to fix the workforce issue in the ADF? \u2026 So far the current government\u2019s retention initiatives, announced at the end of last year, and the retention bonus this year, have been met with resounding derision on public forums and social media (as well as in private groups) as being \u201cnot good enough\u201d. Richard Marles responded: Our government recognises the challenges defence faces to recruit, retain and grow its workforce. Investing in our defence force personnel was one of the six priorities that we identified in the government\u2019s response to the Defence Strategic Review. As I have said previously, defence is not immune from the factors that we\u2019re seeing in the broader economy. And one of the issues that we faced over the last few years, particularly during and in the aftermath of the pandemic, is really a skills challenge across the entire country. Defence feels this as well. But this should also be seen in the light of providing opportunities. Defence does a lot of skills and training, so those in the defence force are highly sought after in the wider economy, and there are lots of opportunities for people who have had a career in defence to pursue their career in the wider economy. This also creates a challenge for defence in terms of retaining its workforce. With all of those challenges though, we need to be growing our defence force. And we certainly need to be retaining it at the funded strength levels that are in place right now, which is why this measure is so important. In the wake of the Defence Strategic Review the government announced a $400m package to support Australian Defence Force personnel through a continuation bonus. Similarly, we need to be attracting the workforce which will ultimately ensure we have a sovereign defence industry. That is why we committed in the 2023-24 budget nearly $150m towards 4,000 university degrees and extending the Defence Industry Pathways Program in Western Australia \u2013 this will see a more than doubling of supported places in defence industries, and promote job opportunities and careers in the Western Australian defence industry. University of Sydney union votes to support EBA I have heard reports the University of Sydney\u2019s National Tertiary of Education Union has just voted overwhelmingly in support of the university\u2019s proposed enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA), bringing a possible conclusion to the longest running industrial campaign at a tertiary institution. The University of Sydney\u2019s bargaining process has drawn out over almost two years, with more than seven days of strikes held as negotiations continued. On Tuesday afternoon, union members voted in favour of the EBA at 639 votes to 146 in a heated Zoom meeting. The EBA offers staff a 4.6% pay increase in the first year, totalling 18.1% over the EBA as well as a $2,000 sign-on bonus. The university\u2019s casual network has been critical of the EBA, suggesting it won\u2019t do enough to end insecure work in the sector. You can read more about the campaign here: And with jarring whiplash, question time begins The house holds a moment of silence and then it is into question time. It is an absolute jarring whiplash. Peter Dutton does not ask the first question as he usually would for exactly that reason \u2013 so he is not seen as shifting the mood from somber to attack. So the Gold Coast Liberal MP Angie Bell gets the job. Bell asks: Prime minister, the cost-of-living crisis is the biggest issue facing the Australians today. Doug lives on the Gold Coast and his electricity bill has increased by more than 53% from last year by $308. Electricity prices are continuing to spiral out-of-control under Labor with new increases of up to 25% for households from 1 July. Why are the prime minister\u2019s broken promises making it harder for middle Australians? Anthony Albanese gives the same answer he always does, pointing out that the Coalition voted against the energy relief, before outlining all the cost of living measures in the budget. \u2018By coming together we will be OK\u2019: MP for Hunter The Labor MP for Hunter, Dan Repacholi, also spoke, holding back tears as he talked of about his close-knit community. We can provide strength and solidarity in need to overcome this tragedy. Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the lives lost. Let us remember the victims with love and respect and honour their memory by committing ourselves to creating a safer more compassionate community. Together we can emerge from the dark of this moment a stronger and more united than ever before. My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of the victims in this terrible event. No words can adequately convey the pain and grief you are all experiencing right now. Please know that our community stands beside you in this time of immense sorrow and we offer our support in any way we can. By looking out for each other, by coming together we will be OK. In memory of the victims, please take the time today to call loved ones that are far away, to hug someone you love and remember just how precious life is. Peter Dutton finishes with: I echo the prime minister\u2019s thanks to our first responders whose courage and composure is nothing short of heroic. We often comment following a tragedy of this nature in this parliament about the fact that the first responders instinct is to run into harm\u2019s way when the of most Australians would be to run from it Australians have heard the audio of the ambulance officer calling for help in a calm and measured way, a reflection of his training, not really giving rise to the pressure that he was under and those around him were feeling. I want to thank all of those in our hospitals and healthcare system who will support those affected over the coming days, months and years. In moments such as these our expression of thoughts, prayers and hopes to those affected can feel powerful. But on the contrary there is power in those sentiments. Because they show those affected directly and indirectly that we care for you. We are here for you. It\u2019s our promise to you that you will never have to travel the road of tragedy alone. We bind ourselves to you in this duty driven by the empathy and love we have for you as fellow citizens. Wherever you need strength and support you\u2019ll find it unconditionally. I send our heart felt sense of grief for all of those in the Hunter region at the moment, as the prime minister pointed out, who are doing it particularly tough. Those at the wedding venue, those who were involved in photographs, those who were involved in preparations for other weddings over the course of that weekend. We make sure we promise as a country to provide to those in their darkest hour. Peter Dutton: Since the news of this horrific event broke, the outpouring of our national grief has been palpable. Our heartbreak for those who lost their lives, our heartache for the families and friends whose lives will be forever altered by this disaster, our heartfelt hopes for those injured to make a speedy recovery. The profound national sadness which surrounds this terrible event comes from a deep, human empathy. A wedding day, as the prime minister rightly points out, is one of the most joyous occasions we know, and the happiness of this wedding day has been eclipsed by a dreadful, dreadful event Life\u2019s terrible moments are all the more tragic when they [sit adjacent] to life\u2019s most beautiful moments and we empathise with those affected all the more. For so many of us have been passengers on a bus journeying home from a wonderful wedding. We can picture how those aboard the fateful bus would have been fondly reminiscing about the evening\u2019s festivities \u2013 stories, music, smiles and dancing of the bride and groom. What all those involved are now going through, what they will have to endure, is simply awful. As news of this disaster spread around the nation, I\u2019m sure that for so many Australians, their phone calls with family would have felt even more precious. Their embraces with loved ones would have been a little tighter. Their time together with those dearest to them would have been all that more special. This tragedy reinforces to all of us to never take our precious relationships for granted, to value the moments we have with families and with friends. To always cherish those closest to us because life can be unpredictably cruel. \u2018Australians\u2019 prayers are with you\u2019: PM on bus tragedy Anthony Albanese continues: We think too of the tight-knit community that is the Hunter. They are hurting so badly right now. I do want, on behalf of the parliament, to give our thanks to the first responders. We again have been reminded by those who arrived at this terrible scene, we cannot imagine what they were confronted with, what they had to deal with but, as they always do, they did their job. They did their best looking after people, trying to save lives and to assist in the recovery. What was clearly was just a horrific scene. So to them, but as well to those who continue to assist in the following hours and days, the doctors and nurses, the police and emergency services, those who transported the injured to the hospital, the counsellors and those on Lifeline who no doubt think have received so many calls from people affected by this tragedy I say once again, thank you. I also say thank you to those people who will continue to assist in the days, weeks, months and years ahead. The hard truth is that mental and emotional scars of this will not fade with time. They will live with people for ever. We have a responsibility to make sure that when the spotlight leaves the care doesn\u2019t, that the people who have witnessed this and for people who have experienced this tragedy first-hand. To everyone who has been touched by this tragedy, I do want you to know that Australia wraps our arms around you. Australians\u2019 thoughts and Australians\u2019 prayers are with you at what is an extraordinarily difficult and traumatic time for our community. Anthony Albanese: Today we pause as a parliament to mark a loss beyond words, a tragedy beyond comprehension, an unfairness beyond understanding. What happened at Greta in the Hunter Valley was a cruel end to what should have been one of the happiest of days. We all know that joy of going to a wedding and so many of us know that feeling of getting on a bus with fellow guests, partly as a chance to share the excitement but partly because the bride and groom organised that in order to keep their guests safe. We know that feeling of getting together with friends and family to celebrate the happy couple. To celebrate the love between two people and their declaration of spending a lifetime together, and around those friends and family, gathering around them, holding them at the heart of what is their local community. A wedding is about both the seriousness and the joy of commitment. It\u2019s about a beautiful new beginning and every wedding is filled with such a sense of possibility bow the future. It makes what happened on Sunday night all the more cruel. We hold on to the memory of all those whose lives were tragically cut short. Our hearts go out to all the survivors and to all the loved ones who now have this most terrible of burdens. And our thoughts and love are with the newlyweds who will never know the easy joy of an anniversary. May everyone around them somehow find a way to lift them up. Ahead of question time, both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton have made statements on the Greta bus tragedy. There will be a moment of silence for the victim, their families and the community. Question time is in about 20 minutes so brace yourself. In good news, I do have some answers back from reader question time, so I will include some of those in there as well. Grab what you need to get through the next hour and a half and we will see you back here at 2pm. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been asked about the Coalition\u2019s position on the Indigenous voice at the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia. Dutton argued that constitutional recognition (without a voice) is the \u201cunifying opportunity\u201d, which the opposition is prepared to work with the government on. He said: We have a situation, where I don\u2019t think the public are ready for the voice. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been explained. I think if we had a bipartisan position on this tomorrow, it wouldn\u2019t shift the numbers that we\u2019re seeing across every poll. The slide is obvious, you\u2019ve now seen no take over the yes and I think it will deteriorate further. I don\u2019t care how many people come out in support of voice, from sporting codes, public-listed companies, churches or anything else. The Australian public wants the detail. And this is the crucial point: by design, the prime minister has taken a decision not to provide the detail. The voice design takes place after the vote in our country, which is without precedent. We suggested to the prime minister at the very start, start designing it now so people can have their hesitations or queries answered, and if they can be satisfied the issue they have, the issue wasn\u2019t significant enough to worry about \u2013 you\u2019ll shift those votes. Dutton said the 1967 referendum was a unifying moment, and the equivalent today would be constitutional recognition (without a voice), which would win 80% to 90% support. Senate to sit late for referendum legislation So far, about 52 of the Senate\u2019s 76 MPs have signed up to speak on the referendum legislation, which means the Senate will have to sit late tonight and tomorrow to get through them all. The Senate is used to sitting late \u2013 it has not enjoyed too many \u201cfamily friendly\u201d sittings this year, given its role and the ongoing need for negotiations to get legislation through it. The referendum legislation WILL pass \u2013 there is no question of that, but it will take some time for everyone to have their say on it. Peter Dutton has given his Ceda address and is now giving his opinion on the voice. You can add the independent Victoria senator Lidia Thorpe to the list of senators who will not be supporting Labor\u2019s housing fund bill in the Senate as yet. Thorpe says the bill does not help renters, particularly First Nations\u2019 renters deal with the housing crisis: Cash outlines Coalition\u2019s opposition to voice referendum Amid everything else happening in the parliament today, the Senate debate on the Indigenous voice referendum has begun. The shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, has outlined the Coalition\u2019s opposition to the referendum, particularly the timetable set by the government \u2013 claiming it was being rushed. Cash claimed there was \u201cno external deadline\u201d for the referendum, questioning why the Labor government had decided to accelerate the process. If you don\u2019t know, vote no,\u201d Cash said, ending her speech to the Senate. The government expects the Senate to pass the bill by mid-next week, the final parliamentary hurdle for the referendum before the campaign officially begins. I regret to inform you that Kevin Rudd has once again been Kevin Rudding on social media: Asio should decide who gets top secret security clearances: report The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS, often referred to by it\u2019s official media name \u2013 the powerful parliamentary intelligence and security committee) has tabled its report on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Bill 2023. It has decided that yes, it makes sense to have Asio decide who gets top secret security clearance. The committee noted that the security clearance process is designed to ensure that only individuals who are deemed suitable and trustworthy are granted access to sensitive national security information. At the same time, the committee recognises that the security clearance process must be fair and, to the extent possible, transparent. Individuals who are subject to the process have the right to procedural fairness, including the right to challenge adverse findings and to have their case reviewed by an independent body. The committee is satisfied with the merits and other review processes proposed by the Bill and the involvement of the IGIS in oversight of the powers and functions exercised under the Bill. The committee also supported, the inclusion of the new Quality Assurance Office within the Office of National Intelligence and agrees with ONI that this should \u2018drive the uplift of the mandatory insider threat capability across government agencies that sponsor top secret-privileged access security clearances. The committee\u2019s main quibble is that contractors aren\u2019t used to carry out the vetting, \u201cnotwithstanding the Bill\u2019s authority to delegate functions and powers to Asio affiliates, human sources or agents will not be used to undertake security vetting\u201d. The battle of the soundbites I have had a couple of readers contact me and ask if those explanations will be the end of the matter. Obviously, I am not privy to the tactics committees. But sadly, I think I am on strong footing when I say no. Now it has crossed over to the political, there tends to be no slowing of these things, at least when it comes to point scoring. Most people don\u2019t watch parliament. Politicians know that the main messages which cross over to the public are the soundbites included in news bulletins. And so that is what they will be aiming for here. Who has the best soundbite. Who can \u201cwin\u201d the nightly news. As Paul Karp has already commented in his analysis, it becomes a race to the bottom and many of the people involved very quickly forget this isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about people. And the message many are hearing has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with whether or not they would be believed if they came forward. Please \u2013 make sure you take care of you, and those around you today. \u2018I reject any suggestion of deliberate intent\u2019: Morrison Scott Morrison finished with: However I reject any suggestion of deliberate intent in any such possible inaccuracy to my response, and am pleased to have taken the first opportunity available to me to clarify these matters to the House. The lack of any such deliberate intent is borne out by the fact that regardless of whether an exchange between myself and Ms Brown had occurred prior to providing my response in the House, my answer regarding Ms Brown\u2019s conduct in relation to Ms Higgins dealing with the allegation made in relation to Ms Brown\u2019s conduct, my response had been informed by detailed discussions with Ms Brown and members of my office, who were advising me on those matters. It was and remains my strong view that Ms Brown did all she could to provide support to Ms Higgins at that time, and most importantly, Senator Reynolds\u2019s office had sought to ensure these issues were dealt with through the justice system, in supporting references to be made to the police, while at the same time, respecting Miss Higgins\u2019s wishes for confidentiality and therefore supporting her agency. Allegations of sexual violence against women should be addressed in our justice system. They should not be cynically prosecuted in the public square for politics, as it sadly and increasing been revealed in relation to these issues. The former prime minister says he has recently spoken to Fiona Brown and can not discount her recollection was \u201cthe more accurate\u201d (as we reported a little bit ago in the blog): In my response, I noted the Australian Human Rights Commission says if an employer suspects that a criminal incident has occurred, the individual should be advised to report the matter to the police, and that is indeed what the minister, that is Senator Reynolds, did at the time, obviously supported by her office. The minister arranged for Britney [Higgins] to have that meeting with the AFP that occurred on 1 April. I responded to everyone here, by implication that included Ms Brown, tried to do the right thing, they took advice and followed the advice and they sought to provide that support. On Saturday, the last Saturday, I had the opportunity to discuss the matters [explicitly] with Ms Brown regarding her recollection of the events for the first time and I appreciate the opportunity to have the discussion with Ms Brown. While my recollection differed to that of Ms Brown, given there\u2019s more than two years that have passed, given the considerable activity of that week, and the presence of Ms Brown\u2019s contemporaneous note, while I believe my response to accurate at the time, I cannot obviously fully discount her recollection of those events now were the more accurate. \u2018It was an extremely busy week\u2019: Morrison Scott Morrison continues with the timeline: There were many corridor conversations within my office, as opposed to the corridors of this place more broadly, that occurred that week, and note that Ms Brown\u2019s office was located directly outside my own. It was an extremely busy week and there were many other issues I was addressing at the time, most significantly Covid-19 and the advancement of Aukus. Over the course of the week I responded to 14 questions from the then leader of the opposition and the member for Sydney on the Higgins matter. On Thursday just before 3pm, I responded to a further question addressing those matters. The question was from the then leader of the opposition who asked if I raised a statement with the staff member in my office, Ms Brown, that Ms Higgins will allege in a statement that Ms Brown made her feel that her ongoing employment would be jeopardised if she continued. I raised that matter with the member of my staff and that was my recollection at the time. I preceded by noting there were many conversations over the course of the week in relation to these issues. Scott Morrison continued: On Saturday, last Saturday, the Weekend Australian reported comments by Ms Brown, a former member of my staff, as prime minister, regarding the accuracy of an answer to a question I gave as prime minister on Thursday Feb 18, 2021. Following the publication of the article on the Weekend Australian, I took the opportunity to review and inform myself once again of the event of that week, as the Weekend Australian article was the first occasion I was made aware that Ms Brown had a different account of the events I referred to in my response to a question in the house on Thursday February 18, 2021. I\u2019m pleased to take this first opportunity to address and clarify these matters here to this house. I became aware of the incident involving Ms Higgins on Monday February 15, 2021. Over the course of that week, I received numerous briefings on what was known about those events to assist me to address the issues appropriately in this house. The briefings included information drawn between discussions held between members of my senior staff and Ms Brown. Here is Scott Morrison\u2019s whole statement, which happened at the same time as Katy Gallagher was making her statement in the Senate. Morrison: I take statements made to this House extremely seriously. Especially as ministers and indeed prime ministers and am fully aware of the responsibility of members in this regard. I\u2019ve always shown great care to ensure any statements I made to this house have been accurate to the best of my knowledge and recollection at the time. And where I have been in error, or where errors are brought to my attention, I have always taken the opportunity to enter this House at the first opportunity to correct the record. This is our obligation as members. There is also the voice debate coming up in the Senate. It will pass, and then the campaign will begin in earnest. \u2018I take my responsibilities as a senator for the ACT seriously\u2019: Gallagher Katy Gallagher finishes with: I have made my position clear to this Senate today. I repeat again \u2013 I take my responsibilities as a senator for the ACT seriously, and act with integrity at all times. This integrity is something I have displayed throughout my career and through my response to Ms Higgins\u2019s rape allegations. And she takes her seat. Katy Gallagher then moves to the settlement Brittany Higgins received from the department of finance \u2013 and media reporting around it in recent weeks: Finally, on the issue of the Commonwealth settlement of the claim brought by Ms Higgins, much has been incorrectly written about my role in this, over the past few months. Despite those outlets being provided with the accurate information. So this is crystal clear for this chamber and beyond, the minister for finance has no decision making role in processes around significant legal matters, absolutely none. Paragraph 3.2 of the legal services directions provide that significant claims against the Commonwealth may not be settled without the agreement of the attorney general. The attorney general has made clear he was the decision maker on behalf of the government on this matter. This has been made clear to all of those outlets that continue to misreport this fact. Katy Gallagher then takes aim at the opposition: It does seem strange to me I\u2019m providing a statement to the Senate, but those that were much closer to the events in 2019 have not done so \u2026 The events of the past week, with the media coverage, the questions surrounding the publication of a young woman\u2019s personal phone records provided for use in a court, splashed across TV and newspaper, with opposition members giddy with the courage, has done nothing but seriously damage this confidence. I fear the message out of this for women who want and need to come forward is watch out. Women who may now choose to keep allegations of serious sexual or violent abuse silent. To suppress the trauma and feel as though justice will always elude them. Women who may feel like the system won\u2019t properly protect their welfare and may let them down, and I\u2019m not going to stand for that. Katy Gallagher continues in that vein: At a time when she needed their support the most, she should have been dealt with as a human being, not a problem that needed managing. The response shouldn\u2019t have been calculated by the political needs of the coalition government, it should have been met with compassion and support and it wasn\u2019t. And we cannot lose perspective on the questions that remain unanswered by people in this place, who had a responsibility, a direct duty to this young woman. Unanswered questions about when they first become aware, some two years before this matter was made public. Unanswered questions about what actions they took, some two years before these allegations were made public. Unanswered questions about who did they share this information with. For example, the secret Gaetjens report, commissioned by the former prime minister, Mr Scott Morrison, that still hasn\u2019t seen the light of day. Katy Gallagher then turns to what she believes to be at the heart of the matter: It seems most of the discussion in the media this past week has been about what I did with information I had, in the days leading up to Ms Higgins\u2019s allegations becoming public. But the fact remains that those who owed Ms Higgins a direct duty of care had known of this for almost two years, and did nothing to make changes or improve culture and safety in the workplace where this incident had occurred. And can I say to the Senate, we must not lose perspective on what matters here. At the heart of this whole story sits the wellbeing or otherwise of a young woman who came forward and made allegations on her own terms, a woman who bravely stood up and spoke out on her own terms. And confronted her employer, the then government, that Ms Higgins feels significantly let down by, in the days, weeks, and months following the allegations she reported to them. Katy Gallagher: I want to be clear with this Senate \u2013 as I was with Senator Reynolds and Senator Ruston on the night of June 4 2021. I was provided with information in the days before the allegations were first reported, and I did nothing with that information, absolutely nothing. I was asked to keep it to myself, and I did. I did nothing differently on this occasion, compared to hundreds of other times, that people have reached out to me in my time as a politician, and asked me to keep their information private. Including women seeking support over alleged sexual assaults, violence, and harassment. Being available and trusted by our constituents is fundamental to the jobs we do on behalf of them. I was not involved in any way with the story that went to air on the night, or reported online that morning. I was in no way involved with the timing in which this story was published or aired. Any allegations or assertion that I did is wrong and I reject it in the strongest possible terms. Katy Gallagher says she explained what she knew at the time to Senator Reynolds who accepted Gallagher\u2019s explanation (then): I explained that to Senator Reynolds in a wide-ranging private meeting that night, where several matters were discussed. I informed Senator Reynolds that I was given a heads-up by the allegations in the days before they became public, an explanation she accepted at the time, some two years ago. Senator Reynolds even said so on the record in Senate estimates that same night, and I quote, \u201cI would like to say in relation to the matters raised before the dinner break, Senators Wong, Gallagher and I had a very respectful discussion before the dinner break and they assured me they were not involved in the matter becoming public.\u201d I repeat, they assured me they were not involved in that matter becoming public and I accept their assurance.\u201d This proves that Senator Reynolds knew the context of our exchange that evening was around whether or not \u2013 was around whether I was involved in that matter becoming public and I was not. Senator Reynolds and Senator Ruston have known that for two years and have never since raised a concern about that with me. The allegations that were made public were done so on Ms Higgins own temples, those are the facts. Facts that appear to have been lost in the past week. Katy Gallagher continued: Over the past week, coalition members, including those at the centre of the rape allegations, have been alleging that I have misled the Senate over comments I made almost two years ago. I reject those allegations. I take my responsibilities to this place as a Senator very seriously, and I have always conducted myself with the highest levels of integrity. And I always will. I did not mislead the Senate. At Senate estimates on June 4 2021, the then minister for defence, Senator Reynolds, said, \u201cI know where this started\u201d she went on to say, \u201cI was told by one of your senators two weeks before about what you were intending to do with the story in my office.\u201d Two weeks before. I was shocked at the assertion made by Senator Reynolds, with the clear implication that I was responsible or had some involvement with making that story public. That was not true. It was never true. And I responded to that allegation by saying no one had any knowledge. Back to the senate and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, is giving her own personal explanation: I want to begin by statement by saying that when it comes to responding to the serious allegations of rape, that occurred in a minister\u2019s office in this building, I have at all times been guided by the bravery and courage of a young woman who chose to speak up and about an alleged incident in her workplace. I have always acted ethically and with basic human decency on all matters related to Ms Higgins. I will continue to do so. I will always support women to come forward and I will always respect their confidence when it is sought. Scott Morrison continues: It was and remains my strong view that Ms Brown did all she could to provide support to Ms Higgins at that time, and that, most importantly, Senator Reynolds office had sought to ensure these issues were dealt with through the justice system and supporting references to be made to the police, while at the same time respecting Ms Higgins wishes of confidentiality and thereby supporting her agency. Allegations of sexual violence against women should be addressed in our justice system. They should not be cynically prosecuted in the public square for politics as has sadly increasingly being revealed in relation to these issues. Scott Morrison: While I believe my response to be accurate at the time, I cannot obviously fully discount that her recollection, having read her recollection of those events now, will [be] more accurate however, I reject absolutely any suggestion of deliberate intent in any such possible inaccuracy in my response, and I\u2019m pleased to have taken the first opportunity available to me to clarify these matters to the house. The lack of any such deliberate intent is borne out by the fact that regardless of whether an exchange between myself and Ms Brown had occurred prior to providing my response in the house, my answer regarding Ms Brown\u2019s conduct in relation to Ms Higgins had been informed by detailed discussions with Ms Brown and members of my office who were advising me on those matters. Over in the house, the former prime minister Scott Morrison is making a statement about what he knew about Brittany Higgins\u2019s allegations and when. He is explaining the difference in when he says he learned of the allegations from Linda Reynolds\u2019 former chief of staff Fiona Brown and what he recalled. Penny Wong offers thanks in Senate The Labor senator and foreign minister Penny Wong starts proceedings in the senate to thank her colleagues for their support on the passing of her father. Wong took leave from estimates to be with her father in his final days. She thanks Simon Birmingham and Anne Ruston for helping to facilitate her leave. I wanted to take the opportunity before the day commenced to thank my Senate colleagues from across the chamber for the messages of condolences and sympathy on the passing of my father. I particularly think first mine colleagues, Senator Farrell, Senator McCarthy and Senator McAllister for covering me at estimates and also Senator Gallagher and Senator Urquhart. I did want to also take the opportunity to thank the opposition. Because of their agreement, I was able to spend my father\u2019s last days with him and not attend estimates I say thanks to Senator Birmingham and Senator Ruston for that. I appreciate it deeply, as do my family. The bells are ringing for the final minute \u2013 the parliament session is about to get underway. Eyes are on the senate in case Labor senator and finance minister Katy Gallagher makes a personal explanation ahead of the day of attacks the coalition is planning. PM addresses state of voice at Labor caucus At Labor caucus, Anthony Albanese addressed the state of the voice referendum. He said he remains positive about the referendum, citing support from the business, sports, arts and entertainment sectors, and that he was looking forward to passing the bill and fixing a date for the vote. Albanese noted there was \u201cno division\u201d within Labor on the question, unlike the Coalition, and the government was determined to give the Voice the best chance to pass. Just on the final part of Josh\u2019s post there \u2013 leave it to the National party to wonder how anyone in this country can walk and chew gum at the same time. The idea that the nation can only focus on one policy issue at a time, and expects its government to only focus on one policy setting at a time may explain why the Nationals continue to struggle to find a foothold in the modern political debate. Dutton to push for scrapping voice to parliament after polls The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, will again ask the government to radically reshape the referendum and reduce the proposal to simple constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians, and scrapping the voice to parliament, in the wake of some polls showing flagging support. Speaking to the Coalition partyroom today, Dutton noted the Resolve poll in the Nine newspapers showing slipping support, with a national majority and three of six states against the voice. The Guardian Essential poll, also published today, conversely shows support for the voice at 60%. The polls have suggested the best case is the voice gets up by a slim majority and the country is divided,\u201d Dutton said, according to a party spokesperson. There is an opportunity now for the prime minister to unify the country, through constitutional recognition without a constitutionally enshrined voice. We will work with the prime minister to do this. However Dutton didn\u2019t say exactly how he would \u201cwork with\u201d Anthony Albanese to effect this outcome. It is very unlikely the government will take up this offer, after Labor\u2019s longheld commitment to the Uluru statement from the heart, which specifically calls for recognition through the voice \u2013 after years of rejection of symbolic constitutional recognition by Indigenous communities. Dutton, on the other hand, says the government should consider it. The prime minister is saying constitutional recognition, a genuine step toward reconciliation, is the price he\u2019s willing to pay for the success of the voice referendum,\u201d he said, again reiterating calls for detail about the voice. Foreshadowing what\u2019s likely to be a key line from the no side as the campaign amps up, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, claimed Australians would wonder why the government was spending much time focused on the voice instead of cost of living issues. Labor used \u2018alleged rape victim for political purposes\u2019: Dutton The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has accused Labor politicians of using \u201can alleged rape victim for political purposes\u201d, claiming they \u201cconspired\u201d to maximise the political damage for the Coalition from the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations of sexual assault. Dutton\u2019s claims in the Coalition\u2019s partyroom meeting this morning foreshadowed the opposition\u2019s plans to, in his words, \u201cpressure\u201d Labor over the matter. The opposition will home in on the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who has admitted receiving information about Higgins\u2019 allegations ahead of their publication in the media in 2021. Her former colleague Bruce Lehrmann was charged but vehemently denied the allegations and maintained his innocence; an initial trial was aborted last year due to jury misconduct and prosecutors dropped the charges against Lehrmann amid concerns about the impact a second trial could have on Higgins\u2019s mental health. Dutton told his caucus that he believed it was an \u201copen and shut case\u201d that Gallagher had misled the Senate, pointing to an estimates hearing where she (as a then-opposition member) said \u201cno one had any knowledge\u201d of the allegations prior. It\u2019s increasingly clear that a group of Labor operatives conspired to maximise the damage. It was absolutely brazen. Labor used an allege rape victim for political purposes,\u201d Dutton told the room, according to a partyroom spokesperson. They said Gallagher would be \u201cgiven the chance to correct the record\u201d in the Senate today, and that Dutton believed it was \u201centirely right and appropriate for us, as an opposition, to put pressure on Labor to answer the questions.\u201d Labor \u20181,000% behind Katy\u2019 Gallagher: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has addressed Labor\u2019s caucus about Brittany Higgins\u2019s sexual assault allegation and the Coalition\u2019s targeting of finance minister, Katy Gallagher, over her knowledge before it was aired. Albanese said that Labor\u2019s opponents \u201cknow no limits to opportunism\u201d, adding that it was \u201cmind-boggling\u201d that they tried to make Labor appear responsible for an allegation by a Liberal staffer that she was raped by a Liberal staffer (Bruce Lehrmann denies the allegation) in a Liberal minister\u2019s office, metres away from the prime minster\u2019s office. Albanese warned about the impact the debate would have on women coming forward. He said: This caucus is 1,000% behind Katy \u2026 No government has done more to put women at the centre of policymaking that what has happened under [women\u2019s minister] Katy Gallagher. [Gallagher is] a person of extraordinary integrity. The attack on Katy Gallagher is unfair, unjustified and unscrupulous. There will be no backwards steps taken. Albanese addressed Gallagher personally: We thank you. We honour you. We\u2019re with you. Albanese also referred to how Scott Morrison had handled the allegations, including personalising the issue (Jenny telling him to think of his daughters), and remarks he made about the women\u2019s march for justice and being lucky they weren\u2019t in a country where protests are met with bullets. Albanese argued the Labor opposition would not have been doing its job if it hadn\u2019t pursued the government\u2019s handling of the complaint, noting that its advocacy had resulted in the Jenkins review. \u201cA young woman was let down terribly by the previous government,\u201d he said. Asked about the possibility of a further inquiry, Albanese said the government had to be cognisant of the impact it would have on people \u2013 which sounds like a no, because it would be retraumatising to the complainant. He said people will make their own judgment about whether it is tenable no one said anything to Scott Morrison in 2019 or 2020. We acted responsibly the whole way through,\u201d he said. Childcare group awards staff 7% pay rise Remember how one of the reasons for increasing the pay for aged care workers was because it would cause a shift in the care industry where other care sectors \u2013 such as childcare \u2013 would need to address their wages because of the risk they would lose even more workers? Well, the childcare group Goodstart Early Learning have announced it will be increasing wages for most educators by 7% on 1 July. The not-for-profit provider says it is one of the \u201clargest wage rises offered by a major national employer\u201d. Goodstart\u2019s chief executive, Dr Ros Baxter, said the wage rise was the largest in the organisations history: We recognise and value our educators, and today\u2019s significant pay rise is vital for our people in these trying economic times. Goodstart educators will now be paid at least 5.3% more than award rates in a sector where most educators are paid only award rates. Most of our educators will receive a 7% rise and the starting salary for a graduate teacher at Goodstart will rise 5.75% to $80,000, more than new teachers are paid in most government schools across Australia. There is a national shortage of teachers and educators and we are doing what we can to be an employer of choice. But we are also very conscious of the need to balance support for our hardworking staff with affordability for families. That also helps close the gender pay gap, given the number of women who work in the childcare sector. The government\u2019s childcare subsidy changes will start next month which will put more pressure on an already strained sector, so expect to see more conversations in this space very soon. Population changes means new electoral maps and the AEC is looking at WA \u2013 here is the new seat Antony Green thinks might be drawn for the state: It looks like being established in Perth\u2019s east. NSW and Victoria look like losing a seat. And Queensland is close to gaining another one. Keep an eye on the AEC Blair Comley to be appointed secretary of health and aged care The government has announced its recommendation for the new secretary of the health and aged care department, with Prof Brendan Murphy retiring: Anthony Albanese will recommend the governor general appoint Blair Comley to the role: Mr Comley has had a distinguished career across the commonwealth and NSW public sector. Between 2011 and 2013, Mr Comley was secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. He then led the New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet as secretary between 2014 and 2017. Mr Comley is currently a director and partner at EY Port Jackson Partners. With his strong economic qualifications and proven leadership navigating complex issues, Mr Comley will bring innovation and policy rigour to addressing the challenges and opportunities within our health system. Making a recommendation to the governor general is only a formality \u2013 Comley has the role for at least five years. It begins on 17 July. Murphy also got a shout out from the prime minister: On behalf of my government, I thank Professor Brendan Murphy AC for his service to Australia\u2019s health sector, as chief medical officer since 2016 and as Secretary of the Department of Health since 2020. Professor Murphy\u2019s service during the Covid-19 global pandemic kept Australians safe. I wish him well as he embarks on his well-deserved retirement. The Greens party room has met, deciding to continue negotiating with the government on the housing Australia future fund bill but not accepting Labor\u2019s latest offer of guaranteeing $500m disbursements every year. According to the Greens, it doesn\u2019t answer its core demands of more funding and a rent freeze. With no agreement on that bill, the government has reordered Senate business to deal with the voice constitutional alteration bill this week. We expect the debate will go all week, with possible extended sittings, before a possible vote later in the week. The Senate is sitting on Friday. The Greens do not support their ex-senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s amendment that \u201cnothing in this Act shall be taken to cede or disturb the sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u201d. The Greens regard it as a poison pill that will sink the referendum. Instead, Greens senator Dorinda Cox will propose a symbolic second reading amendment acknowledging Indigenous sovereignty was never ceded. The Greens also decided not to facilitate any political game-playing or points scoring on Brittany Higgins allegations and related leaks. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: I also wanted to make some comments in relation to the disgusting treatment of Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations, the politicking and the mud slinging and the hypocrisy that is surrounding this at the moment. People should be ashamed themselves. I\u2019m extremely concerned about the message this sends to young women and and not just women outside these building but women inside this building. And whether you are a political staffer, whether you are a cleaner, whether you work at Aussies cafe whether you are journalist, it is not okay. And the people trying to score political points out of this should be ashamed for themselves. We\u2019re not interested in facilitating the game playing in the Senate. And I think there\u2019s some serious questions that need to be asked about how the private information of Brittany Higgins\u2019 text messages and her partner\u2019s are even being exposed publicly. Hanson-Young noted Channel 10 has referred the matter to the AFP, questioning whether it was already being investigated before the referral. Hanson-Young expressed concern for Higgins\u2019 welfare. She said: After spending 12 months of discussion on trying to raise the standards in this place and to have this back being debated in this matter ... I want to make it very, very clear we are not [going] facilitate political gameplay over a young woman\u2019s alleged sexual assault and the way she was treated by her bosses. Queensland parliamentary speaker returns to work after hiatus Dipping out of the federal parliament for a moment to look at some state politics. AAP reports Queensland\u2019s parliamentary speaker, Curtis Pitt, has returned to the chair on budget day after a temporary hiatus citing mental health, divorce and health issues. Pitt missed the regional parliament\u2019s sitting in Cairns last month within his electorate of Mulgrave, taking to social media to admit he was \u201cnot doing as well emotionally as I\u2019ve made out to anyone\u201d after a divorce from a two-decade marriage and dealing with ulcerative colitis, depression and his parents\u2019 serious health issues. The five-term MP again took to social media on the eve of his return to parliament, posting a picture of four Superman models with a message for others to seek help when they need it. The 12th of June is Superman day - it\u2019s also the day I\u2019m returning to work. I want to say thank you to everyone who has given me so much support during my time away. I am very grateful. While I\u2019m going back to work, my journey is just the beginning ... you don\u2019t need to be the Man of Steel on the outside. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside that counts, and talking is important. For those who don\u2019t know, Pitt is a HUGE Superman fan. Comics in general, but Superman above all. We wish him well. Why are the Greens and independents like David Pocock pushing so hard? Well, the basic answer is: people have nowhere to live. And the situation is at crisis point. Collins calls on Greens and Liberals to support housing future fund The housing minister, Julie Collins, is pushing the line the government have a mandate for its housing fund fairly hard this week. That\u2019s because it was part of the election platform. But the easy rebuttal to that is the Senate has a mandate to push for more, because the Greens and independents were voted in on their commitment to hold the government to account. So we remain at a stalemate. Collins: The time for delays in terms of this legislation are over. What we know is that more delays mean less homes on the ground. It will take more time to get homes on the ground. What we also know is all of the experts, whether they be from homelessness services, whether they be from social housing providers, whether they\u2019re from the Property Council or the Master Builders or the HIA, everybody supports the housing Australia future fund. What we need is people in the Senate, particularly Liberal senators and Greens senators, to look at this. This is not the only thing we\u2019re doing, but it is critical to our agenda. And we took it to the last election. The Australian people voted for this $10bn fund. And I would call on senators, the Greens senators and the Liberal senators to support the housing Australia future fund. Labor concludes party room meeting as well Labor has also broken from its caucus meeting. So you\u2019ll hear what was in all of those meetings very, very soon. That also means the parliament sitting is about to get underway in earnest. Strap. In. PM: national cabinet a \u2018ballast\u2019 for states and territories to drive a common agenda through with the commonwealth How does Anthony Albanese think his productivity reform agenda is going with the states? Softly, softly. One of the things that I think the national cabinet can do is \u2013 part of the problem we have in this country is the gap \u2026 between the rhetoric \u2026 of some of the media. But consistent with Ceda\u2019s position of we need productivity reform, we need change, we need to drive that dynamic through. And anytime it [is] suggested, any reform you get - shock, horror, these are the impacts, don\u2019t do anything, you get that contradiction there. So, reform is hard, we know that that\u2019s the case. I think the national cabinet can provide a ballast \u2026 for state and territory governments working with the commonwealth to drive that common agenda through and to get things done that would be more difficult if it was just a single unit of government. So, it can work together against the pushback that occurs in any reform. Coalition finish party room briefing The Coalition have also finished their party room meeting, so the briefing on that will happen very soon. Peter Dutton will also be addressing the Ceda conference \u2013 that will happen around midday, so you\u2019ll hear a few of the same messages. Committee established to investigate use of ADF in disaster response A defence subcommittee has been set up to hear about the impact of using the Australia Defence Force to respond to Australia\u2019s never-ending natural disasters. Labor MP Julian Hill says it is time to take a look at what effect that is having on the ADF: The subcommittee will hear how this seemingly near persistent requirement is impacting the organisation from a preparation, training, and capability perspective, as well as reviewing current policy and approaches to resourcing. Leading experts and senior Defence representatives will publicly share their views on this important matter which will also provide useful context as respective authors consider the 2024 national defence strategy. That committee is meeting today. Greens party room briefing wraps up The Greens have finished their party room briefing \u2013 from what I hear, it was dominated by the housing fund, but we will hear exactly what went on soon. Prime minister identifies current opportunities for Australia as a nation So what are those opportunities? Anthony Albanese says they are: The opportunity to be a renewable energy superpower \u2013 and to use that to drive becoming a manufacturing powerhouse. To lead the world in the standard of care and support that we offer our citizens. To drive a new wave of productivity in our big firms and our small businesses and our start-ups. Australia has the resources, the people, the get-up-and-go to seize this moment. Our government is determined to make sure that we do just that. We are a government with a sense of purpose. Grasping these opportunities and sharing them is at the very heart of that purpose. In our first year, I believe that we\u2019ve laid a very strong foundation. That was the theme of our budget. In the year ahead, we\u2019ll continue to build the better future that the Australian people voted for. PM: Labor always understood \u2018the world would present us with challenges\u2019 Because in terms of \u201cthe state of the nation\u201d, things are not great. Anthony Albanese didn\u2019t exactly channel Gerald Ford\u2019s \u201cthe State of the Union is not good\u201d line, but he did point to the challenges: When my colleagues and I were campaigning during the election just over a year ago, we knew that Australia was facing a period of economic uncertainty. We knew there was a shocking legacy of waste and neglect that we would have to deal with. And we knew that events beyond our borders and outside our control would bring significant and complex and unpredictable challenges. But we sought the privilege and the opportunity of government to take up these challenges, to take them on. To look after Australians doing it tough, to help people under pressure here and now \u2013 but all while never taking our eye off the future agenda. That\u2019s why people turn to Labor governments \u2013 they trust us to make the right decisions for the present, but importantly as well, to shape the future. And while my colleagues and I always understood the world would present us with challenges, we also held to the belief that it would offer us great opportunities. Summary of Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia The Ceda speech from Anthony Albanese included the usual \u201crah-rah government\u201d lines: Australia\u2019s future security and our future prosperity depends on our economy breaking new ground: - Attracting new sources of international investment. - Diversifying our future exports. - Boosting the skills of our workforce. - Building greater resilience in our supply chains. - Moving more of our businesses up the international value chain. - And supporting the full, equal, respectful and overdue participation of women in the economy. This is the dynamic, competitive and diversified economy that we are already working with business to build \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing encouraging results: - The most jobs created in the first year of any government in Australian history. - Record levels of participation, including a record number of women in full-time work. - Wages growing at the fastest rate in a decade \u2013 and real wages growth forecast for next year. We\u2019re proud of this record \u2013 but we\u2019re not resting on it. But it also focussed on the challenges. Not even coming challenges. Because we are in them. Essential poll good news for Anthony Albanese The latest Essential poll comes ahead of Anthony Albanese\u2019s Ceda address. As Paul Karp reports, there is some good news for the prime minister in the numbers: Labor is now the preferred party to handle the rising cost of living and interest rates after a collapse in the proportion of Australians who believe the Coalition is best on key aspects of the economy. The result of the latest Guardian Essential poll of 1,123 voters is a warning sign for the Peter Dutton-led opposition, suggesting that voters are not angry at the Albanese government\u2019s handling of the economy, despite the pain of 12 interest rate hikes and inflation. Hearing on migration issues tomorrow The head if home affairs, Michael Pezzullo, will face the joint standing committee on migration tomorrow, which will be the first time he has fronted this particular committee. The committee chair Labor MP Maria Vamvakinou said in its seven meetings so far, the committee has heard plenty about what is wrong with the system as it stands and now it is going to the source for answers to some of its questions: This hearing will be the perfect opportunity for the committee to get answers on the current operation of the migration system from those directly responsible for administering it. The hearing is particularly timely given the recent completion of the Parkinson Review, the announcement of the government\u2019s proposed migration strategy, and the ongoing multicultural framework review. The committee will be very interested to hear about the outcomes of these initiatives and how the department will implement associated reforms. Tune in for that one. Parliament to start at midday after party room meetings Parliament is going to start at midday today, because of the party room meetings. Those meetings are going to be a bit messy today because a) it is the last sitting before the break and b) everyone is in a fighting mood. The Coalition think they are on to a winner with the Katy Gallagher attacks. Labor is outraged over them. Everyone is spitting mad. And that is before we even get to the referendum legislation debate in the Senate (it will pass) and the housing bill negotiations. By the end of this sitting, everyone will need a break. High Speed Rail Authority established today High speed rail in Australia has inched slightly closer to reality, with the Albanese government\u2019s High Speed Rail Authority beginning operation from today. On Tuesday, the transport minister, Catherine King, announced that the board of the HSRA \u2013 which itself was only formed earlier this month \u2013 had appointed Andrew Hyles as acting CEO as the board begins its formal search for its inaugural CEO. In a statement, King noted the commonwealth had committed $500m to the Sydney-Newcastle corridor. High speed rail was a signature policy Anthony Albanese took to the May 2022 election, but significant developments regarding the project \u2013 which has been promised to begin with a stretch between Sydney and Newcastle \u2013 have been sparse in the more than 12 months since Labor took office. While there are no high speed rail lines that have been built in Australia, there have been several agencies dedicated to the transport mode. The formation of the HSRA on Tuesday means the abolishment of the National Faster Rail Agency, a body established by the Morrison government in 2019, which did not deliver on earlier high speed rail projects. PM on Gallagher attacks: \u2018we won\u2019t be distracted by these sort of campaigns\u2019 In a harbinger of how uncomfortable today is going to be, the PM was asked in that same interview about Katy Gallagher. The day in parliament will cover both, often at the same time, and it is going to get messy. Asked about whether Gallagher had questions to answer, Albanese said: Oh, this is absurd. Katy Gallagher has been transparent. We\u2019re talking about here an alleged incident, an alleged rape that occurred in 2019, in a Liberal minister\u2019s office, of one Liberal staff member, by another Liberal staff member, and somehow Katy Gallagher is responsible for \u2026 Q: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that, but the question is being put. At one point it was like, what did you know when? And there\u2019s been two different answers to that. Albanese: No, that\u2019s not right. Go and have a look at the footage. Linda Reynolds in that speaks about \u2018you knew weeks ago\u2019, and she says that she was told that two weeks ago or weeks ago, she was told that there would be a conspiracy, that Labor was planning this. And that\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s a bizarre conspiracy theory that suggests that Labor somehow is at the centre of all of this. And indeed, according to Senator Reynolds herself, in the discussion that took place at that time, on the Monday night, Katy Gallagher said, \u2018Yes, I was made aware in broad terms that there was an incident in the days beforehand\u2019. So this has been known by Senator Reynolds since that time, since 2021, and now in 2023, somehow, this is this concocted issue by what is a desperate Liberal opposition looking for any issue. I mean, one would have thought that just weeks after we handed down a budget, they would be concentrating on the economy and on issues that affect average Australians. We\u2019ll continue to do our job and we won\u2019t be distracted by these sort of campaigns. PM on Hunter Valley bus crash: \u2018a tragedy beyond belief\u2019 Speaking to ABC Radio Sydney this morning, Anthony Albanese spoke about the Greta bus crash tragedy: It\u2019s just such a horrific incident to occur. People associate weddings with love and lifelong commitments and celebrations with family and friends. And for it to end in this horrific tragedy, with so many deaths, so many injuries, but of course, the scars will last for such a long, long period of time. It is going to be very difficult for the communities involved, the two sporting teams involved as well. It is just a tragedy beyond belief. David Pocock welcomes Labor offer on housing fund The ACT\u2019s independent senator David Pocock has welcomed the government\u2019s shift on the housing fund, saying it has now responded to six of the eight initial joint crossbench requests: We\u2019re all seeing the effects of the housing crisis in our communities. It\u2019s hurting more and more Australians. We need action. These most recent changes in response to feedback from stakeholders and the crossbench will ensure this package of bills does more to address that crisis. The two big areas where the government hasn\u2019t budged are increasing the overall quantum of the fund and providing additional funding for First Nations housing. However, by agreeing to bring forward the date of the first review there\u2019s an opportunity to reassess the size of the fund and its operations. While the community wants to see more government investment, the need is growing and action is urgent. These have been difficult negotiations but ground has been given and I hope there is sufficient support in the Senate to pass the bills this week. Gallagher and Higgins questions to be centre of today\u2019s parliamentary session Parliament is going to be very, very messy today as the coalition and Labor go head to head over whether or not Katy Gallagher misled parliament. Gallagher was not a minister when the Senate estimates exchange happened. But that won\u2019t stop the politics as each side accuses the other of politicising the issue. Simon Birmingham went on Sky News to push the Coalition\u2019s side: The reality is that it was Anthony Albanese\u2019s Labor team that chose to, through the parliamentary processes, [ask] hundreds and hundreds of questions about these allegations to take them from a legal matter, a criminal matter, a matter to be decided by the courts and put them through the parliament as well. Now, having done that and done that whilst proclaiming the innocence of their team in terms of any prior knowledge or involvement in the political nature of that attack, frankly, [that] does now warrant scrutiny as to whether or not they did have that prior knowledge or information. The questions Labor was asking at the time was about what the then prime minister Scott Morrison or his office knew at the time, as well as what the then government did when the allegations had been privately raised. There is also the very important questions of how Brittany Higgins\u2019 private text messages have been leaked. Queensland announces further 50,000 free kindergarten places as part of budget day Happy Queensland budget day, to those who celebrate. The lock up is about to begin, but here is what we know so far (from staff reporters and AAP) The Queensland government has kicked off budget day by announcing it will make kindergarten free for all the state\u2019s families from next year. Currently 14,000 children receive free kindy, which is a 15-hour-a-week government approved program aimed at the year before children start school. Under the reforms, which will apply to kindergarten programs at long day care centres as well as community kindergartens, meaning an 50,000 additional children will be able to attend for free. Annastacia Palaszczuk described it as a $645m investment in the state\u2019s future. There are currently around 8,000 children who are eligible to attend a kindy but don\u2019t, and it\u2019s time to close that gap. The government has hinted there will be further cost-of-living relief in the budget, including an expected increase in the existing $175 energy rebate to help people struggling with power bills. Regional Queensland residents last week were hit with the highest electricity increase in the country at 29%. The cost-of-living measures come as the government is flush with money from higher coal and petroleum royalties, with the budget update six months ago forecasting a $5.2bn surplus for 2022/23. Shorten: \u2018We in the Labor team have a lot of support for Senator Gallagher. Full stop\u2019 Bill Shorten came to the defence of finance minister Katy Gallagher while speaking to the Nine network this morning. Gallagher is facing scrutiny over whether she may have misled parliament over what she knew about the Brittany Higgins allegations and when. Paul Karp has those questions covered here: Shorten said: I\u2019m just going to make a couple of points about Katy. And one of the reasons why she does an awesome job is because she\u2019s got such integrity and respect amongst the whole Labor team. In terms of what Senator Reynolds is complaining about in the parliament, Katy Gallagher was in opposition. She was asking tough questions of Senator Reynolds on a particular matter. And then Senator Reynolds has decided to say that she was misleading the parliament. Senator Gallagher said she wasn\u2019t. And we in the Labor team have got a lot of support for Senator Gallagher. Full stop. \u2026without me getting into every detail of every crossed T and dotted I, the point is that Senator Reynolds was saying that Senator Gallagher had weaponised this matter, that she was aware of everything for weeks in advance. And Senator Gallagher has said she wasn\u2019t, and she was answering Senator Reynold\u2019s question. The specific thing that Reynolds was putting to [her] \u2013 it wasn\u2019t true, according to Senator Gallagher, and she just stood her ground. First Nations people call on government to sign nuclear weapons prohibition A group of people are on their way to Canberra to call on the prime minister to sign the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons and speak to MPs about their experience surviving the British nuclear testing program in Western Australia and South Australia in the 1950s. From the statement: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the British nuclear testing program at Emu Field in South Australia, and one of the delegates, Karina Lester, a Yankunytjatjara Anangu woman from north-west South Australia, is a second generation nuclear test survivor from these tests. Her late father, Yami Lester, was blinded by the tests at Emu Field and Karina carries his story as well as her grandmother\u2019s story about the impacts of the tests on her people. Our mob were not informed of those tests that were about to take place on our traditional lands. Consent was never given by Anangu for the Emu Field tests. The government did not come and ask Anangu if it was okay to test on our traditional lands. First Nations peoples of this Country have been speaking up strong about truth telling, this is our truth telling, about the impacts felt by my people, Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara, the contamination of our traditional lands, the hurt and pain and suffering still felt to this day. All Australians need to know the truth about what happened on our own soil. I\u2019m travelling to Canberra because we Aboriginal people need to be around the tables to make the decisions, and the nuclear ban treaty is a good opportunity to be part of the solution. Labor says rent freezes don\u2019t work and we must instead increase supply The housing minister, Julie Collins, was on ABC News Breakfast speaking on the housing fund and she responded to the rent freeze question: Everyone knows the commonwealth doesn\u2019t have the power to cap rents. There\u2019s eight different states and territories across the country all doing different things. Some of them have ruled it out. We have data and evidence it doesn\u2019t work and it puts downward pressure on supply. What we need to do is add to supply. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, not just with our housing Australia future fund and our other investments. We have homes under construction today because we made that money available. In my own home state of Tasmania, people are moving into new premises within weeks because of a decision we made since we have come to government. And of course, the $1.7bn this financial year from 1 July that\u2019s going to states and territories to invest in more affordable housing. The national housing accord, another $350m from 1 July 2024 for another 10,000 affordable rental homes that will be matched by states and territories. And of course, this comes on top of the budget measures that we have announced in this year\u2019s budget, which is more tax changes and concessions for build to rent, which the sector indicate will be between 150,000 and 250,000 additional rentals because of that decision and our additional funding for the housing investment finance corporation. Liberal party emails supporters anti-voice message from John Howard Liberal Party HQ have sent an email from John Howard to supporters asking for donations to fight the Voice. The bits in bold are the parts the Liberal HQ have made the emphasis on: Recently, you might have received an e-mail from Peter Dutton about the voice. I am concerned that enshrining in the constitution a voice that covers all areas of \u201cexecutive government\u201d presents a real risk*. Like most people, I am in favour of constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. However, what is being proposed is a voice that can speak to every part of the federal government, with the potential for recommendations to be litigated if they are rejected. This could create a constitutional quagmire**. There is a risk that a future high court could place an interpretation on the voice which goes beyond the current expectations of the government***. The Liberal team will highlight these risks to everyday Australians. However, making these arguments in the face of political, corporate and celebrity support for the \u2018yes\u2019 campaign will be a challenge. Can you support Peter Dutton and the Liberal Team with a donation? This voice is constitutionally risky. Its effects are unknown, as are key details about how it would operate. Furthermore, this voice would be permanent. Every dollar donated will go to communicating key messages to everyday Australians. *It doesn\u2019t. **This has already been debunked. The parliament remains in charge of its own destiny. ***Constitutional experts have already said, repeatedly, that no, they do not see that happening, as the voice is advisory and not binding to the parliament. Greens: investment property holders will still have access to negative gearing \u2013 but what of renters? If the Greens get their way on rent freezes, what happens to people with investment properties when there are interest rate rises? Max Chandler-Mather: They still have access to negative gearing, which means they can write off losses on their rental properties on their tax, but can I just ask what happens to the one-third out of this country who [are] subject to another year of unlimited rent increases? Rents have gone up \u2026 over 20% over the last 12 months? The RBA has predicted the rents may go up even faster over the next 12 months. What happens to that person who is currently budgeting, choosing between paying the rent and feeding their kids, what happens to that pension on a fixed income, knowing that the next place they\u2019ll be sleeping is their car after the next rent increase? It is not sustainable in one of the wealthiest countries on earth to allow unlimited rent increases. I had someone write to me recently who had \u2026 copped a $584 a week rent increase \u2026 how [are] people meant to survive in those circumstances? [When] the cost of living is going up across the country right now, our point to the government is: \u2026 you can\u2019t ignore a third of the country when it comes to one of the worst housing crisis we\u2019ve seen in generations. Greens believe they have compromised and Labor needs to offer more Max Chandler-Mather says the Greens have compromised on the bill and it is up to the Labor government to come to the table with something serious. He says: There is a downturn in the private construction industry freeing up the skills and materials we could put to work right now building public and affordable housing, states and territories across the country. [We could] have frozen rent increases before \u2013 we have a budget surplus of $4.2bn and the Labor party is locking in $30bn a year in tax cuts for people earning over $200,000 a year. It is remarkable that [is] the only barrier right now to spending real money from this year on public and affordable housing and starting to coordinate limits on rent increases. Labor has put rent freezes on the agenda for the next national cabinet. Chandler-Mather says there is more the government could be doing; They delivered an energy price cap last year, even though part of the regulation [was] that was required at a state level. They recall[ed] parliaments across the country and it was led by the federal government. I hear the federal treasurer get up in parliament every day to talk about how they put caps on energy prices. Why can\u2019t they put caps on rents? Because they\u2019ve decided that the one-third of this country who rent don\u2019t matter. Now, we know that the federal government plays a coordinating role on all sorts of issues including energy price caps last year, all we\u2019re saying is they need to put a billion dollars on the table, cash incentives on the table, to incentivise a freeze on rent increases. And let me tell you, it would be a brave premier to turn back to their state and say not only are we going to turn down billions of \u2026 extra funding for housing in the middle of a housing crisis, the only reason we\u2019re turning it down is because we don\u2019t want to stop your rents going up for the next two years. Greens not supportive of current Labor offer on housing On ABC Radio RN Breakfast, Max Chandler-Mather is explaining why the Greens can not support the housing fund yet. Chandler-Mather says the $500m a year floor doesn\u2019t come in for another 12 months, and no homes will be built until 2025. Why is it fair in one of the wealthiest countries on earth that we have to tell that single mom waiting for a public home that she has to wait until after 2025, and then basically go into a lottery to see if they can get one of the up to 20,000 social homes that government wants to build through to what 2030, when the shortage is 640,000 homes? Labor offers Greens olive branch over affordable housing Labor has moved a smidgeon on the housing future fund, as Paul Karp reports: Labor has guaranteed a minimum of $500m will be paid out of the housing Australia future fund every year in a last-ditch bid to win Greens support for the bill to help build social and affordable housing. The housing minister, Julie Collins, wrote to the crossbench on Monday offering a \u201cguaranteed fixed disbursement\u201d of $500m from 2024-25, with a new power for the treasurer and finance minister to increase the amount by regulation, making it a floor not a ceiling. But the Greens are not overly thrilled by the offer. Labor can\u2019t pass this bill in the senate without the Greens, unless the Coalition suddenly decide to support it, so this deadlock remains. For now. Minute\u2019s silence to be held for victims of Hunter Valley bus crash There will be a minute\u2019s silence for the Hunter Valley bus crash victims today in parliament. There will be some rare moments of bipartisanship in response to the crash today. Expect to see politicians from all sides drop the politics for a moment as they speak on it. Thank you to Martin for getting us started there \u2013 Amy Remeikis is with you now and will be for most of the day. Just a note on the horrendous tragedy in the Hunter Valley \u2013 there will be a lot more developments there today, and we know people are still looking for information, so we have set up a dedicated blog. Our thoughts are with those families and the community. All of it makes politics seem a little ridiculous at times, but there are some important policies in amongst the muck \u2013 including the housing future fund. It remains to be seen whether Labor will bend and create a policy the Greens can support. Given how pressing the housing need is and how many people are already suffering, there\u2019s no time to waste. Today is also party room meeting day, which will set the tone for the week. Given this is the last sitting before the winter break, each side is throwing everything at \u201cwinning\u201d the debate. It means things will be getting messy. We\u2019ll cover off all the events and provide context and fact checking where we can. You have Paul Karp and Josh Butler in Canberra, as well as the entire Guardian brains trust to bring you news from outside Capital Hill. It\u2019s going to be a long seven sitting days. Grab your coffee and let\u2019s get into it Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage as parliament resumes in Canberra. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories before my colleague Amy Remeikis boots up her computer. It\u2019s going to be an early start to the political day when Anthony Albanese addresses the state of the nation conference organised by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. The prime minister will be buoyed by our latest Essential poll showing that Labor is the preferred party to handle the cost of living and interest rates crisis amid a collapse in the proportion of respondents who favoured the Coalition on interest rates, which fell 16 points from 42% to 26% since February. Indeed, he will tell the conference over breakfast that his government has helped to \u201cenhance economic security in a time of global uncertainty\u201d. We\u2019ll have more on this soon. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, will also be speaking at the conference (he gets the lunch slot) but his party might be more interested in making political capital this week from the ongoing Brittany Higgins saga.

Winning the song prize and main prize at BBC Cardiff Singer of the World in June 2013 was a turning point in my career \u2013 and my life. I\u2019m one of only three people to win both prizes; maybe this, the competition\u2019s 40th year, will see another singer claim the double? It\u2019s a long process, with many stages of auditions to whittle down hundreds of singers from around the world hoping for a place at the in-person competition in Wales. My personal process was longer because it took me several years of trying before I made it to the final stage. As a burgeoning dramatic mezzo, those extra years to learn and grow were a blessing in disguise. In 2013 (the competition is held every two years), I finally made it to Cardiff, one of 20 finalists competing alongside singers from countries including Ukraine, Argentina, Egypt and China. It was a fantastically badass roster of competitors. I knew, or knew of, a couple of the singers already, Daniela Mack and Ben Johnson come to mind, and on day one I was quaking in my boots, but we all quickly bonded, and I formed some lasting and valued friendships. As soon as I heard I\u2019d been chosen to represent the US my first priority was to programme what I was going to sing. This was a monumental and extremely important task \u2013 you want to go into the competition with sets that show off all the facets of your musical strengths and who you are as an artist. In Cardiff, there are four heats with one winner from each going into the final. Double this if you\u2019ve opted to also compete in the song prize competition. There isn\u2019t a pre-ordained number of arias or songs you must do (although the song-prize set has to have at least one German lied in it), but whatever you perform has to fit within the time allotted for your performance. Thus I had to plan four different sets, and submit exact details of these for approval many months beforehand. Deciding on the programmes took almost as long as choosing and commissioning the competition dresses, as I needed a different gown for each performance. I put on two recitals at home in Georgia before I left to test out my competition repertoire in front of an audience \u2013 and to try performing in those new dresses and shoes. (I was raised in the country by hippy parents, and I think it shocked people in my home town that I wasn\u2019t barefoot or wearing flip-flops.) I arrived in Cardiff with two huge suitcases \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to travel light as a competing singer! I had to buy one more before I left, to transport my Welsh crystal trophies home safely. (Don\u2019t worry, they came with me in my hand luggage.) I got there several days before the start of the competition not only to get over jet lag, but also because I knew that Bryn Terfel was giving a concert in St David\u2019s Hall, the competition venue. It was an opportunity to experience how the hall sounds from the audience\u2019s side, and also to hear one of my favourite singers, and Cardiff song prize legend, live in concert. One of the competition staff offered to take me to meet Bryn backstage. Once I got the fangirl panic out of my system, we chatted and he gave me an invaluable piece of advice: \u201cGo to the pharmacy, and get yourself some zinc. You\u2019re about to stress your entire body, brain and spirit out with this competition, and you need to make sure your immune system has extra support.\u201d Several of my fellow competitors fell ill during the intense two-weeks of rehearsals, interviews and performing. If Bryn and I ever end up in the same place at the same time again, I owe him a pint. I had never been to Wales before and was ridiculously excited to be in the city where Torchwood was filmed. One of the entrances to the Torchwood HQ is right outside the Millennium Centre, the home of Welsh National Opera \u2013 I was going to stand in that exact spot. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was how excited people at the BBC and in Cardiff would be to find out I had even heard of Doctor Who or Torchwood. I was given tickets to the Doctor Who Experience, which was incredible; a BBC producer somehow got John Barrowman to sign a headshot for me (OMG OMG OMG!!); and I was also given a kids\u2019 \u201cbuild it yourself\u201d Sonic Screwdriver kit, still proudly on display on my living room shelves today. But perhaps the most extraordinary moment of all was when the BBC National Orchestra of Wales surprised me one morning during a main prize rehearsal by playing the Doctor Who theme music as congratulations for winning the song prize the evening before. I burst into tears, I was so overwhelmed! (Did I just watch the video of that again right now and tear up? Yes I did.) As Bryn had warned, the competition was a tricky balance between staying present with my health and energy reserves and knowing how to navigate the moments when I felt like my battery was empty but still needed to show up and show off. If you make it to the finals for both the song prize and the main prize, you will have done four competitions, each with different programmes of music in front of a live audience and broadcast around the world. You will have done a multitude of interviews, from BBC content for the competition to radio and print, not to mention fielding press requests from your home country. But, at the same time, you will be swimming in love and support \u2013 from the BBC team to your own community of friends, family, colleagues. People will appear from all corners of your life to cheer you on when you do a competition as major as Cardiff and I\u2019ve yet to experience another outpouring of love as overwhelming as that, and that\u2019s saying something, given how wonderful my support system is and how lucky I have found myself in my career since. My win at Cardiff meant I went from being an auditioning singer scrambling to figure out how to pay my bills to having offers pour in nearly daily, and now I was starting to be asked what I wanted to sing \u2013 what a luxury! I learned how to say \u201cno\u201d more often, a lesson I find needs revisiting on occasion, and I was able to accept roles on the basis that they would be interesting and intriguing and/or be stepping stones in a long and sustainable career. What advice do I have for this year\u2019s singers? Prepare to within an inch of your life, and then go out there and be the best storyteller you can be. Whatever songs and arias you chose, sell them like you would sell performing your favourite role at your dream opera house. And after the competition, know that even the most blessed careers bring challenges. For me, the biggest is how much time I spend on the road \u2013 there have been seasons when I have been home fewer than 30 days in the year. But I wouldn\u2019t change a thing \u2013 my life took a massive turn a decade ago this June, and the real gift of winning was the chance it gave me to be the artist I dreamed of becoming. \u2022 The BBC Cardiff Singer of the World 2023 competition ends on 18 June with coverage all week on Radio 3 and BBC Four. The main prize final is live on BBC Four and Radio 3 at 5pm. Jamie Barton sings the role of Azucena in Il Trovatore at the Royal Opera House, London until 2 July."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/black-lotus-review-kickboxer-thriller-looks-like-ad-for-amsterdam-tourist-board", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "Black Lotus review \u2013 kickboxer thriller looks like ad for Amsterdam tourist board", "lead": "Rico Verhoeven\u2019s Dutch-produced acting debut is a slapdash meeting of illogical storylines amid meaningless plot points", "author": "Phil Hoad", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T08:00:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079955", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bd203f0b13e2ca3fe7d44624c1b71dded783b4f1/382_0_6292_3776/500.jpg", "body": "This hapless Dutch-produced thriller almost redeems itself with a decent final sequence staged in the neon-doused John Wick style, but it is too little, too late. Gigantic 6ft 5in kickboxer Rico Verhoeven blows his shot at action stardom with a showing of anti-charisma best described as if Lenny from Of Mice and Men had become a special forces operative. And the Amsterdam tourist board \u2013 for whom this at least lustrously shot film serves as a long commercial \u2013 must hold serious dirt on Frank Grillo for him to have signed up. Even by his snap-your-hand-off-for-a-paycheck standards, he has a binfire on his hands. Verhoeven plays Matteo, former crack point man for a tactical unit of vague remit, who is licking his wounds after a hostage rescue at the German national opera goes south and his boss is killed. Recuperating at a Romanian sawmill, as you do, he returns to Amsterdam to make contact with bereaved wife Helene (Marie Dompnier) as well has his goddaughter (Pippi Casey). But the former\u2019s new husband Paul (Peter Franz\u00e9n) is siphoning money from Saban (Grillo), a \u201cEurotrash Tony Montana\u201d who runs the local branch of a global crime syndicate. Which puts the family in the line of fire, and forces Matteo to dust off his particular set of skills. Sadly, acting is not among them. Verhoeven makes Steven Seagal look like Derek Jacobi, so director Todor Chapkanov\u2019s decision to have Verhoeven refrain from breaking heads for nearly an hour is all the more bizarre. Apart from some topless woodwork thirst-trap scenes, his only function is as identifiable landmark amid a flappy meeting of illogical storylines and flashbacks: the Interpol agents trailing Saban; Paul\u2019s financial scam; Matteo and his old chief\u2019s bromance in Afghanistan, \u201cironically\u201d fleshed out as they nonchalantly snipe Taliban. This is a film both slapdash and depressingly generic, down to some \u201cfamily\u201d pep talk ChatGPTed in from Fast and Furious.

(See Jane Harper, who does this for Australia.) Now I\u2019ve a new writer to shout about: Nilanjana Roy\u2019s Black River (Pushkin Vertigo) takes place in the small village of Teetarpur, just outside Delhi. \u201cThere is nothing Teetarpur is famous for,\u201d writes Roy. \u201cThe village lies at the edge of the Delhi-Haryana border, an hour\u2019s drive down silent, forested roads covered in powdered summer dust. Its soul has remained half a century behind the capital.\u201d Munia is a shy, sweet eight-year-old, \u201ca brown scrap, so easily overlooked\u201d. But she is the apple of her single father Chand\u2019s eye. Almost as soon as the book starts, we see her murdered \u2013 hanged from a jamun tree \u2013 and then watch the village turn into a mob as her corpse is discovered, with suspicion falling upon a homeless man who was with her body. Sub-inspector Ombir Singh investigates, tries to prevent mob justice and, with his limited resources, digs to the core of a crime with long tendrils and dark origins. Roy brings rural India and Delhi to vivid life as much as she does her characters. The death of Munia is shocking and devastating: it is the mystery that drives this thriller but also its heart, as Roy tells of Chand\u2019s prior life, and his love for his daughter. Riveting. It is bittersweet to crack open the 28th, and final, Inspector Banks novel. The mighty Peter Robinson, who died last year, created one of the most convivial, compelling detectives in Alan Banks: compassionate, intelligent and music-loving, he was the sort of man you wanted to spend time with. Standing in the Shadows (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) is a worthy addition to the Banks canon. It opens in 1980, in a Leeds living under the shadow of the Yorkshire Ripper, where student Nick discovers that his ex-girlfriend has been murdered, and that he is the prime suspect. We then move to 2019, when a skeleton that is most definitely not Roman is discovered on an archaeological dig near Scotch Corner in North Yorkshire, and Banks and his team are called in. Robinson handles his two plots with characteristic skill: the voice of student Nick is brought to enjoyably irritating life; and it is a pleasure to be back in Banks\u2019s company, whether it\u2019s watching him with his friends and colleagues, listening to his thoughts on music or waiting for his intuition to kick in and for him to see to the heart of things. Robinson was an author at the top of his game, and Banks a detective at the top of his. Both will be sorely missed by their readers. Rachel isn\u2019t really called Rachel. It is the name Aidan Thomas gave her, after he took her years earlier and imprisoned her in a shed in his garden. Aidan is a serial killer, who has murdered eight women. Rachel is the ninth, and she is determined to stay alive. \u201cRule number one of staying alive in the shed. He always wins.\u201d But after five years in one room, things are changing, and Rachel needs to be ready for her chance to escape. Cl\u00e9mence Michallon\u2019s debut novel The Quiet Tenant (Abacus) is a nail-biting terror of a read, slowly revealing how Rachel, already a little bit broken, ended up where she did: \u201cWhen you found me, it didn\u2019t surprise me. Of course you found me. You had to happen to someone, and you happened to me.\u201d And then following as her courage incrementally ratchets up, as, brainwashed and terrified, she starts to eye, and then discard, her opportunities to escape. I finished it at very high speed, heart pounding, absolutely loving it. It\u2019s time to get cosy with the second in former Church of England parish priest Richard Coles\u2019s series about Canon Daniel Clement, A Death in the Parish (W&amp;N). Set in the English village of Champton St Mary, this time around Daniel is not only trying to steady a community still recovering from the murders of Coles\u2019s debut Murder Before Evensong, but also dealing with the merger of his parish with that of neighbouring Upper and Lower Badsaddle. This brings new associate vicar Chris Biddle with it; he shocks parishioners by wearing dungarees, while his children have aspirations to be goths. Those waiting for a death to be thrown into the mix will have a fair few chapters of village life to get through before they reach the ritualistic killing that Daniel and his good friend Neil Vanloo, the local policeman, need to solve. And Coles can have a heavy hand with the similes (custard skin is \u201cas wizened as a Saint-Tropez grandame\u2019s face\u201d; Daniel\u2019s car is \u201cmoving so slowly they would have been overtaken by the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier\u201d). But he is also gloriously astute on the details of village interactions, quietly smiling at the \u201cC of E way of correcting someone by replying with the right word to their wrong\u201d, or at the difficulties of getting men to sing in church as the tune rises higher. And Daniel, the \u201cstill centre of a turning world\u201d, mild, kind and deep, is an enjoyable protagonist to spend 400 pages with. This is another slice of quiet, but charming, cosy crime. \u2022 To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com.

Lehrmann is suing Ten and Wilkinson in the federal court over their initial reporting of Brittany Higgins\u2019 rape allegations, which he denies. The rape trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and a second trial was abandoned due to concerns about the risk it posed to Higgins\u2019 life.

Gallagher posed a series of \u201cunanswered questions\u201d, including when those in the Morrison government first became aware, what actions they took, whom they shared the information with and why they had not released the \u201csecret Gaetjens report\u201d into the issue, commissioned by Morrison. \u201cIt does seem strange to me that I am providing a statement to the Senate but those that were much closer to the events in 2019 have not done,\u201d she said. Morrison on Tuesday also denied allegations he had misled parliament about whether he\u2019d spoken to her regarding Higgins\u2019 claims that her job was under threat. Those allegations were levelled by Brown, Morrison\u2019s former staff member and one-time Reynolds staffer. On Saturday Brown told the Australian that on 18 February 2021 Morrison incorrectly replied in question time that he had spoken to her about Higgins\u2019 claim that her job had been threatened. Morrison then approached Brown afterward and said \u201cwe\u2019ve spoken, haven\u2019t we\u201d, she claimed. On Tuesday Morrison told the house: \u201cWhile I believed my response to be accurate at the time, I cannot obviously fully discount [Brown\u2019s] recollection of those events now were the more accurate. \u201cI reject absolutely any suggestion of deliberate intent in any such possible inaccuracy in my response and I\u2019m pleased to have taken the first opportunity available to me to clarify these matters to the house.\u201d He said that week was an \u201cextremely busy week\u201d, with numerous briefings and responding to more than a dozen questions in parliament. Morrison said he strongly believed Brown and Reynolds\u2019 office had done all possible to respond to Higgins\u2019 allegations at the time. \u201cAllegations of sexual violence against women should be addressed in our justice system. They should not be cynically prosecuted in the public square for politics, as has sadly been increasingly revealed in these issues,\u201d he said. In question time, Albanese deflected a question about when the \u201cprime minister\u2019s office\u201d knew of the complaint by noting that Morrison\u2019s office had not released the Gaetjens report. He denied Gallagher had misled the Senate. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, reiterated her comments that \u201cnobody tells me what to ask in question time\u201d, adding that she would \u201cwould not have been doing [her] job\u201d as shadow women\u2019s minister if she had not asked about the Morrison government\u2019s handling. Earlier, Albanese told the Labor caucus its opponents \u201cknow no limits to opportunism\u201d, adding that it was \u201cmind-boggling\u201d that they tried to make Labor appear responsible in some way. \u201c[Gallagher is] a person of extraordinary integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attack on Katy Gallagher is unfair, unjustified and unscrupulous. There will be no backwards steps taken.\u201d Albanese argued the Labor opposition would not have been doing its job if it hadn\u2019t pursued the government\u2019s handling of the complaint, noting that its advocacy had resulted in the Jenkins review. \u201cA young woman was let down terribly by the previous government,\u201d he said. In the Coalition party room, Dutton accused Labor politicians of using \u201can alleged rape victim for political purposes\u201d, claiming it was an \u201copen and shut case\u201d that Gallagher had misled the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that a group of Labor operatives conspired to maximise the damage. It was absolutely brazen. Labor used an alleged rape victim for political purposes,\u201d Dutton told the room, according to a party room spokesperson."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/giant-saltworks-proposed-for-exmouth-gulf-a-threat-to-ningaloo-and-endangered-species-conservationists-say", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Giant saltworks proposed for Exmouth Gulf a threat to Ningaloo and endangered species, conservationists say", "lead": "German company\u2019s plan for 210-sq-km development in WA could \u2018block the water that runs over that coastline into the gulf\u2019", "author": "Mostafa Rachwani", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T07:19:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079968", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/86330a2f893dcbd19c4c9b6079f8c5e21a386e64/0_0_3966_2380/500.jpg", "body": "A proposal to build a giant saltworks in the Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia has been condemned by conservationists as a threat to endangered species. German industrial company K+S has submitted its proposal to build a 210-sq-km saltworks on the pristine gulf \u2013 a crucial part of the adjacent world heritage-listed Ningaloo coast. The proposal would involve constructing salt pond walls over the nationally listed wetlands, which could disrupt the ecosystem\u2019s nutrient flows via tidal or flood waters into the gulf and disrupt the marine food chain. The development could also add to the risk of discharge of toxic hypersaline water from the salt ponds that could kill highly sensitive mangroves and harm marine animals, such as critically endangered sawfish and shovelnose rays, which live in the nearby creeks and marine waters. The director of Protect Ningaloo, Paul Gamblin, said the proposal posed too many risks to the local environment. \u201cThe right thing for K+S to do would be to withdraw its project for the good of the Exmouth Gulf ecosystem and its long list of threatened species. \u201cThose huge salt ponds would potentially block the water that runs over that coastline into the gulf, which provides a lot of nutrients for Exmouth Gulf, it relies on that shoreline. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cIf you build those very long walls, you risk breaking that connection between the lands and the sea. You could also have the hypersaline water that could seep through the walls, as has happened elsewhere, and threaten the local ecosystem.\u201d Gamblin said such a proposal would \u201cundermine\u201d attempts by the state government to protect the gulf, which is a sanctuary for threatened species such as dugongs and turtles. \u201cIf you start undermining the environment there, you start undermining the natural capital, which supports the activities which generate most of the jobs and the economy in that area,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re cutting off your nose to spite your face by allowing industrial projects that damage the area.\u201d Gerrit G\u00f6decke, Managing Director, K+S Salt Australia told the Guardian K+S Salt Australia had spent six years and $10m in research into the environment and ecosystems around the proposed project. He says the proposal takes into consideration the environmental impact, and that it was negligible. \u201cNutrient flow has been considered and the peer-reviewed results of Coastal, Surface Water and Nutrient Pathway studies show there is little to no impact on the Exmouth Gulf.\u201d \u201cStudies into the proposed re-hydration and return of bitterns (dehydrated seawater with salt removed) to the ocean and potential effects of salt water ponds on local groundwater also show very little potential impact.\u201d The Exmouth Gulf is home to about 800 species of fish and 831 species of molluscs, as well as 63 species of sharks and rays and at least 15 species of sea snakes, some critically endangered. The gulf is also a globally significant humpback whale nursery, a spot where mothers with young calves look to rest and eat in preparation for migrating to the Antarctic. The submission of the proposal comes nearly two years after the state government declared it would introduce safeguards to protect the \u201cspectacular\u201d gulf. The McGowan government introduced conservation measures in December 2021, including the establishment of a new marine park for the eastern and southern parts of the gulf and class A status for local areas of significance such as Qualing Pool, Camerons Cave and the gulf\u2019s islands. The classifications were introduced after recommendations from the Environmental Protection Agency, which welcomed the measures, with Prof Matthew Tonts from the EPA saying it was a \u201cwin for the environment\u201d. \u201cFuture activities and developments proposed for Exmouth Gulf will need to show they are compatible with the protection of the key values of this globally significant area,\u201d Prof Tonts said at the time. \u201cThis will ensure important marine species such as humpback whales, dugongs, dolphins and turtles are protected for future generations.\u201d The WA Environment Minister Reece Whitby reiterated the government\u2019s dedication to protecting the region, but said the ministry is waiting on independent advice. \u201cIt\u2019s important to consider the potential cumulative impacts of any proposals in the Exmouth Gulf and their effects on the environmental, social and cultural values of the area.\u201d \u201cI will wait for the independent advice from the Environmental Protection Authority regarding the proposal by K+S Salt Australia Pty Ltd. It would be inappropriate to comment on any proposal under assessment.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/13/evicted-tenant-homeless-three-months-london-travelodge", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "\u2018Morale is very low\u2019: evicted tenant\u2019s three months and counting in a London Travelodge", "lead": "Nicole Bent and her daughter are among dozens of homeless families being put up by council in hotel rooms", "author": "Sammy Gecsoyler", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T07:00:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079970", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/57ba9cb916e2267af3c0602bd9da7c64b3020612/0_481_7864_4719/500.jpg", "body": "A hotel getaway should be a time to escape the stresses of everyday life \u2013 but for Nicole Bent, life in a hotel has become her everyday. \u201cIt\u2019s been demoralising, to be honest. That\u2019s the word I would use to describe this whole experience,\u201d she said of her ongoing three-month stay in a north London Travelodge. Bent, 28, and her three-year-old daughter have been living in the hotel since the beginning of March, when she was made homeless after her tenancy came to an end and the landlord wanted to sell the property. She is one of dozens of homeless families being housed there by Enfield council while it tries to find her a permanent home. When the Guardian visited the hotel last month, the onsite restaurant was filled with families. Most said they had been evicted from their privately rented properties due to rent increases or because the landlord wanted to sell their property. Enfield has the highest number of no-fault evictions in London, and the number of households recorded as being at risk of homelessness due to a no-fault eviction rose 140% from 2021 to 2022. Long-term hotel usage in the borough has risen sharply in the past year. Enfield Dispatch reported this month that 113 families were being kept in hotels or B&amp;Bs by the council past the six-week legal limit by the end of March 2023, up from one family in April 2022. Under Travelodge policy, guests have to move rooms every 28 days, but Bent has had to move rooms eight times in the space of 10 weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to move a tremendous amount of times. One time there was an issue with the heating and the other time it was the bed. I\u2019ve been on three different floors,\u201d she said. There have been numerous reports of other families being moved out of the hotel with no notice because the council often waits until the final day of their booking before extending their stay. Collette Collington, 42, a mother of three, says she was left in the hotel lobby with her belongings earlier this month after the council failed to extend her booking. She was eventually booked into another room in the hotel on the same day. Another woman with three children was left stranded outside the hotel for almost 12 hours after being moved out in the morning. She waited outside the hotel with all of her belongings until night-time when the council booked her a room in a Travelodge in Hertfordshire. The council has said keeping families in hotel accommodation is costing it about \u00a3850,000 a month. It projects a \u00a320m deficit for this financial year, citing the cost of hotel accommodation as a factor. The government has frozen the local housing allowance (LHA) \u2013 the amount to which people claiming housing benefit who rent privately are entitled \u2013 at 2020 levels. LHA rates vary depending on location and the number of bedrooms in a property. If a claimant\u2019s rent is more than the LHA, they are responsible for the remaining amount. In Enfield, the shortfall between the LHA and the average rent of a four-bedroom property in 2022 was \u00a3595 a month. To address this financial hole, the council said it would have to start rehousing residents living in hotels and temporary accommodation outside London and south-east England, where rents and the LHA are more in line. Families living in the hotel are desperate to leave. Among those being housed there are people with serious mental health and drug abuse issues, and police have been called a number of times. \u201cSafety is an issue,\u201d Bent said. \u201cI feel uncomfortable. [People with these issues] hang around the front of the hotel when you\u2019re going in and they always try to speak to my daughter as well. There is an air of discomfort. They also know which room I live in.\u201d There are also concerns about the welfare of Travelodge staff. Some have apparently been attacked, with one having a hot drink thrown over them. Bent said: \u201cThe staff have been very kind and accommodating to me. They\u2019ve obviously had a huge change in the duties their jobs require.\u201d Some families have been in the Travelodge for more than 10 months and counting. \u201cMorale is very low in the hotel,\u201d Bent said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be optimistic but it\u2019s hard to remain positive.\u201d An Enfield council spokesperson said: \u201cThe Travelodge booking system does not allow for long-term reservation of rooms and therefore regular rebookings need to be made. Council officers are visiting families to explain the options available to them and if direct contact cannot be made we are writing to them to outline next steps. \u201cThis situation exemplifies the deteriorating state of housing in London and the collapse of the private rental sector.\u201d Travelodge said: \u201cWe have been working with Enfield council for many years to provide short-term accommodation. All parties understand that this is a temporary arrangement until the local authority can find a more permanent solution. \u201cIf a customer that has been booked via Enfield council has an issue regarding their temporary accommodation requirements, they need to liaise directly with them who has made their specific booking.\u201d George Savva, the council\u2019s cabinet member for social housing, said: \u201cWe have no alternative but to follow the approach of many other local authorities and help find homeless households decent, stable homes in affordable areas outside of London.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/13/saudi-arabia-golf-pga-tour-public-investment-fund", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Saudi golf takeover is blueprint for what they want to do everywhere else | Jonathan Liew", "lead": "The Saudis came for golf.

Perhaps you happened to be playing a round at Beaverbrook Golf Course at the same time as Rumayyan and the PGA board member Jimmy Dunne were thrashing out the early stages of a deal that would change golf for ever. Perhaps you happened to be eavesdropping at the next table as they ate dinner or at least close enough to hurl a well-aimed bread roll or slip something into the ceviche. Short of that, however, there is very little you or I could have done to prevent the effective merger of the PGA Tour with the rebel LIV Golf organisation, backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. Your opinion was not consulted. Your vote was not canvassed. Players who had turned down eye-moistening sums of Saudi money out of what they laughably believed was a reciprocated loyalty to the PGA Tour found out, like everyone else, when their phones started pinging. Let\u2019s be reasonably firm about this at the outset. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t like golf. You don\u2019t have to harbour a shred of affection for the PGA Tour, which was essentially birthed in similar circumstances: an audacious power grab by the game\u2019s top players in the 1960s. The finer details of how the new shared enterprise will work and what becomes of the beloved Milton Sewage Solutions Open at Grundle Pines should not overly detain us. The wider significance here is in the concussive speed and devastating lack of transparency with which this transaction was conducted, the way intractable obstacles were simply bulldozed or bought away, the utter indifference to public opinion, outcry, backlash. This may be the story of how Saudi Arabia bought golf. But really, it is a blueprint for what they want to do with everything else. There remain a couple of curiously prevalent misconceptions when it comes to Saudi Arabia\u2019s investment in golf. The first is that it is all simply part of an elaborate public relations exercise, a sanitisation of its image, an attempt to deflect attention away from its human rights abuses, its treatment of women and LGBT people, its brutal justice system, its role in a ruinous war in Yemen. But the extreme secrecy of the LIV-PGA Tour deal exposes the fact it knows exactly what people think of it. The circle of trust, according to a report in the New York Times, was deliberately kept as small as possible. Even most of the PGA Tour board had no idea what was happening. Does this strike you as the behaviour of a regime concerned with winning hearts and minds? The brazenness, the wall of silence, the smoke and mirrors, the decision to present this deal to the world as a fait accompli: this is all part of the performance. The projection of power matters as much as the power itself. It says to the world: we bone-sawed a journalist, we bought golf and you didn\u2019t even know anything was happening. The second misconception is that the PGA\u2019s surrender is no more than a venal money-grab, when it is clearly so many other things as well. Monahan may not be the most trusted guy in the room right now, but when he tells people the PGA Tour \u201ccannot compete with a foreign government with unlimited money\u201d, he\u2019s simply stating a bald truth. The litigation and inflated purses required to compete with LIV Golf were threatening to emaciate the organisation piece by piece. Monahan knew this. So did the Saudis. Reckon your favourite sport would put up any more of a fight? Football is already being bent towards the gravity of Saudi money, with the takeover of Newcastle United, the purchase of major stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and a 2030 World Cup bid in the offing. The International Cricket Council has signed a major partnership with Aramco and there are persistent rumours of a lucrative Saudi Twenty20 league in the near future. Tennis is, quite frankly, a sitting target. Formula One, boxing: too late, lads. The NBA recently changed its rules to allow sovereign wealth funds to buy into its franchises, although the commissioner, Adam Silver, recognises Saudi investment is \u201ca two-edged sword\u201d. Which is nice. The more tectonic shift, however, is less about individual sports and about the very idea of what sport is. Since its earliest days, organised sport has been conceived as its own end. The Olympic gold medal, the World Cup final, the Ashes urn, the season ticket at your local club: these things have an intrinsic worth, not as an auxiliary to a greater goal. But when entire clubs, entire competitions, even entire sports are being repackaged as investment vehicles, advertising boards, weapons of geopolitical power, then it is fair to wonder whether a turning point has been reached. The tragic paradox is that for the most part the people who care about sport do not own it and the people who own it do not seem to care for it at all. It is of no consequence to Saudi Arabia whether or not you like golf. Eventually, it will find the thing you do like and your views will not be of interest to them. No, they will not be taking questions. No, you will not be kept up to date on progress. As ever, you will find out what\u2019s happening whenever it decides you need to know."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/13/i-am-angry-every-day-zinchenko-will-not-be-silenced-over-war-in-ukraine", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "\u2018I am angry every day\u2019: Zinchenko will not be silenced over war in Ukraine", "lead": "Arsenal defender opens up to Jacob Steinberg on the crisis, fundraising with Andriy Shevchenko and August\u2019s Game4Ukraine charity match", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T07:00:42Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079974", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5cc47419bedf891c31784925f685e9089c13017f/0_260_7813_4687/500.jpg", "body": "Half an hour in Oleksandr Zinchenko\u2019s company is a harrowing experience.

How many people lost their houses, jobs or whatever \u2013 and for what?\u2019 I just really want to know.\u201d Barely a moment goes by when Zinchenko does not find himself thinking about the invasion. He is in London, a long way from the conflict, but there is no escape from the mental trauma of knowing bombs are raining down on your compatriots every day. Zinchenko sees the images on the news, scrolls through social media, and the sorrow threatens to consume him. The shocking destruction of the Kakhovka dam is the latest devastating blow. \u201cI was talking to some of the volunteers helping around there,\u201d he says. \u201cThe stories I heard \u2026 Some people don\u2019t have the opportunity to leave their houses because the water is so high already. Some don\u2019t have an opportunity to go because they are quite old. I heard about one woman, holding two little babies, born just a few months ago. She was on the roof, holding the last stone and trying to survive. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t. With the kids.\u201d Zinchenko turns away after being asked how he copes. \u201cOh please,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get in my head because I don\u2019t know what is there at the moment.\u201d Somehow, he and other Ukrainians are still managing to resist. Zinchenko will not be silenced. He has just visited Ukraine with the former Chelsea and Milan striker Andriy Shevchenko and met the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss the creation of Game4Ukraine, an 11-a-side charity match that will raise funds to rebuild Mykhailo-Kotsiubynsky Lyceum, a school in the Chernihiv oblast destroyed by Russian missiles. \u201cWe have to move forward,\u201d Zinchenko says. Shevchenko and Zinchenko are ambassadors for United24, the fundraising operation set up by Zelenskiy, and the hope is that football will bring people together. Game4Ukraine will be held at Stamford Bridge on 5 August, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will coach one of the teams and talent from sport and entertainment will be involved. \u201cThis game is so important,\u201d Zinchenko says. \u201cApart from the money we are trying to get to rebuild the school, it\u2019s also a powerful message to the world that we are all together.\u201d Zinchenko, who brightens up when he thinks of his two-year-old daughter, is asked how he deals with the pressure of playing Premier League football. \u201cI have to,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to work. Our heroes are losing their lives. \u201cThere is someone who is abroad, representing the country in the best way they can, using this kind of opportunity like we are now. They talk about the situation. It\u2019s important to keep going, to keep showing the world the real truth, because a lot of propaganda is around. I know everyone has some fatigue but I cannot stop. \u201cFootball is my life and when I am on the pitch I start to forget about everything. Football is such a powerful opportunity to stick together, to have fun. Since the invasion my head was lost, but me and my family were talking a lot about this and we have to keep going. \u201cI can help my country much more from here than if I would be there at the moment. But I promise I really want to be there. Last week, when I arrived there \u2026 I don\u2019t know, this is my homeland. I just want to be there. For sure, after football, I am going to live in Ukraine.\u201d Zinchenko marvels at Zelenskiy. \u201cI am so proud of my president. The things he does are incredible. Watching the process from the inside, the people around him, how they work is unbelievable. They don\u2019t stop. They. Don\u2019t. Stop. \u201cI had a tough, tough schedule in Ukraine. Close to me were people from the president\u2019s office and I was watching them. It looked like they weren\u2019t tired at all. I asked them if they were working in this routine every day. They said: \u2018Since the invasion, yes.\u2019 I believe with this energy, with these people, we have a bright future.\u201d The promise of a better tomorrow sustains Zinchenko, who appreciates the support of the British public. He remembers being in a shop in Manchester and two kids coming up to him. \u201cMaybe 10 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought they just wanted a picture but they said: \u2018Alex, we are all with you and your people.\u2019 I was shocked. Ten years old? They really understand. That means their parents talk in the same way.\u201d One day the former Manchester City player will tell his daughter about Russia\u2019s aggression. When he was in Ukraine he met children who studied at the school in Chernihiv and heard about their suffering. \u201cKids cannot lie,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are just talking the real truth.\u201d There is no filter. \u201cThis is one of the most scary things: our kids growing up in Ukraine. This is a big mental injury for them. Living in wartime, this is the most scary thing that can happen for all parents.\u201d Did Zinchenko see any joy in the children? \u201cWell, most of them love football. When we were playing football, me and Shevchenko with them, they were smiling, laughing and really enjoying the process. I hope they will get more moments like this in their lives and try to forget. But unfortunately it will be so difficult.\u201d Going back to Ukraine has made Zinchenko even more determined. \u201cThe invasion was one and a half years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeing this situation from your phone, laptop, calls, messages, I was already in shock. But we are human beings and we are starting to get used to it. We are starting to get used to the routine but it\u2019s a completely different story when you see these destroyed buildings with your own eyes rather than your phone. \u201cThis is completely different. I can\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t scary.

The government has already started to close in on scientists and point the finger at them for the poor response in the early stages of the pandemic. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said it was a mistake to \u201cempower scientists\u201d and the BMJ pointed to the former health secretary Matt Hancock making \u201cscience the fall guy\u201d in the blame game over what went wrong. But it\u2019s vital that the inquiry separates out what were scientific questions, that independent advisers and academics could provide data and input on, and what were leadership decisions. Policy measures such as closing gyms or schools or play parks, or the introduction of mandatory face coverings, were conveyed as \u201cscientific\u201d decisions, but they weren\u2019t. Scientists could present the probable risks and benefits of certain policy options, but the final decision didn\u2019t lie with them. For example, when considering whether to close gyms, a scientific question would be: \u201cWhat is the risk of transmission within a gym setting? How many would become severely ill and need hospitalisation, and how many would die?\u201d That type of analysis, as well as guidance on measures to reduce transmission in that setting, could be given, along with an assessment of how certain we were about the knowledge. This is what Covid-19 advisory group members were tasked with. For scientists, the challenge was filling in the puzzle pieces about Sars-CoV-2, from how transmissible it was, and risks of transmission in various settings, to the hospitalisation rate and burden on healthcare services. And, of course, modelling possible future scenarios. Certainly, we can evaluate how well they performed these tasks, and whether their data and predictions were reasonable given the situation. In terms of the response itself, public health scientists, including myself, had our own ideas for what the best approach would be (including learning from other countries that had had earlier waves of Covid-19) and these were presented to ministers in the form of briefings and papers \u2013 just as with any other area of policy, from defence to the economy. The pandemic brought a new immediacy to scientific advice, but it didn\u2019t fundamentally change the job of elected politicians, which was to balance these multiple streams of advice, and decide what the next stage of the response would be. Another political decision was over whether face masks should be mandatory for children in primary schools. Again public health scientists can answer, \u201cWhat\u2019s the risk of transmission within a primary school classroom?\u201d and \u201cHow effective are face coverings if used appropriately at reducing transmission?\u201d But this was balanced against the advice from child psychologists who provided evidence on the impact of face coverings on emotional and speech development, especially for young children with special needs, and with input from headteachers on the practical challenges of implementing mandates. Ministers then had to decide whether to introduce these, and if the benefits outweighed the costs. What\u2019s particularly surprising is when government ministers such as Sunak, when he was chancellor, chose not to take any scientific advice at all in policy decisions, such as in the launch of \u201cEat Out to Help Out\u201d. In this scheme, the public were encouraged and actively subsidised to spend money in one of the riskiest settings for transmission: indoor hospitality. They were led to believe it was safe, even though scientists could clearly predict this would lead to onwards transmission and would probably undo the progress made in bringing case incidence down going into autumn. If scientific advice had been considered more thoroughly, then other approaches with similar economic benefits might have been used, such as expanded outdoor dining, takeaways and deliveries, and local vouchers and support schemes. The Covid inquiry starting point should be that government has a responsibility to ensure that its citizens are \u201csafe enough\u201d from risks that it can manage. We expect the water from our taps to be clean and not give us cholera, the food in shops not to poison us, and our roads to have speed limits and traffic rules to prevent accidents. This came to the forefront in the Covid-19 response: governments were expected to protect their populations and parse the question of \u201chow safe is safe enough\u201d. There was no perfect path through the pandemic as various countries struggled with waves of hospitalisations and high death tolls. Government ministers had to make rapid decisions, and countries that did better in terms of health and economic measures (such as Denmark, Norway, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand) seriously considered the trade-offs, and made judgments with strong and competent leadership. There was no way that life could continue as it did before Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 some action had to be taken. Scientists did their best to rapidly collect data about a new pathogen, analyse it and provide factual advice to governments on the risks that Covid-19 posed to human health, healthcare services and economic stability. They also could suggest various public health solutions to the challenge, but what leaders decided to do with that advice in terms of policy was 100% political. Scientific advice can provide data on the risks and benefits of closing schools or gyms or of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d, but no scientist ever had the executive power to make policy decisions. This was the responsibility of elected officials. And knowing my academic colleagues, none of us would have wanted that power either.

Plans to increase taxes on the miners have been historically fraught. Meanwhile, the wounds inflicted on Labor by the Adani saga still feel fresh. And this is Queensland, where the black rock is still king, and critical to the state\u2019s economy and its identity. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Cameron Dick\u2019s latest budget, flush with $15.3bn income from coal royalties, has brought the bigger picture into focus. Labor is running a version of Muhammad Ali\u2019s famous \u201crope a dope\u201d strategy \u2013 inviting superficial attacks and leaving opponents\u2019 weaknesses badly exposed. Everything voters might want \u2013 a budget surplus, debt reduction, cost-of-living handouts, infrastructure projects, new housing, health funding \u2013 is now linked to the decision to increase royalties on unprecedented profits. In Dick\u2019s words, the royalties \u201cunderpin everything that we are doing\u201d. \u201cA Queensland without progressive coal royalties \u2026 means there will be no cost-of-living relief, cancelled infrastructure programs, cuts to services, and a higher debt burden. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a credible opinion on this budget without having a credible opinion on royalties. [Opposition leader David Crisafulli] needs to accept that, or he needs to start cutting back on the $89bn capital program and tell Queenslanders what he\u2019s not going to build.\u201d If this is starting to sound familiar, it\u2019s because it is. These are versions of the same attack lines on potential LNP cuts that Labor used in 2020. And 2017. And 2015. The only thing missing was the dark spectre of Campbell Newman, dressed like death and carrying a scythe. Labor uses these lines again and again because they are effective. Queenslanders want public services and publicly-owned assets. If the LNP opposition offers anything other than full-throated support for the coal royalties, they\u2019ll be fodder for Labor\u2019s attacks (and scares) about hidden cuts. Last year, Dick warned the mining industry that its campaign \u2013 reportedly costing $40m in advertising \u2013 could backfire and damage the sector\u2019s social licence. On Monday, the day before the state budget, Dick told the Queensland Resources Council to \u201cshow some respect\u201d while coalminers were making record profits and households were struggling with the cost of living. There is no question that the decision to increase royalties has put Queensland on a stronger economic footing coming out of the pandemic. It has helped the state pay for significant cost-of-living relief measures and long-overdue programs like free kindy for preschoolers. But the true irony here is that, by the next election, the impact of the state\u2019s royalty changes will have largely disappeared. The system was designed so that miners paid higher rates while export prices were at extraordinary and record highs. When global shocks end, and coal prices return to normal, so do the royalty rates. Subsequently, most of the spending is on one-off measures. Over the next four years, the state budget anticipates \u201ca sharp decline\u201d in coal prices and for royalties income to drop below long-term averages. Most of the extra money being fought over is already in the coffers. So by the time all of this public debate has played out, on election day in October next year, the argument will be largely academic anyway."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/13/chad-border-unaccompanied-children-flee-sudan-fighting", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "title": "Aid agencies raise alarm as solo children cross Chad border to flee Sudan fighting", "lead": "Unicef says \u2018more and more unaccompanied children\u2019 among thousands of refugees streaming across 1,000km-long border", "author": "Lizzy Davies", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T06:00:42Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079985", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1aca094671b00474ade1b4081ec9ff3d06d61462/0_0_5000_3001/500.jpg", "body": "Hundreds of unaccompanied children have crossed the border from Sudan into Chad in recent weeks as fighting separates families and forces minors to make the arduous journey to safety without their parents. Humanitarian workers say \u201cmore and more\u201d children are arriving alone in the neighbouring country, to which more than 100,000 refugees, about 60% of them under-18s, have fled since fighting erupted between rival military factions in mid-April. After a more orderly first wave of refugees \u2013 who had decided to leave Sudan before the conflict came to their home villages and had had the chance to prepare a little \u2013 those arriving more recently had often fled the latest surge in fighting, said Jacques Boyer, the country director for the UN Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef) in Chad. \u201cAt the beginning we weren\u2019t seeing a lot of unaccompanied or separated children, because the children were moving with their families,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now for three weeks this population has been escaping the fighting and the bombing, [and] there are more and more unaccompanied children.\u201d Boyer said 267 unaccompanied children had so far been identified, but that that figure was certain to be an underestimate. \u201cThere are far more kids that are probably unaccompanied,\u201d added Boyer. A colleague had met a 14-year-old boy from Darfur who had become separated from his parents when unidentified armed men attacked their village, he said. \u201cThis young boy explained [that] there were rumours the village would be attacked. So the villagers were preparing to flee. \u201cBut while they were preparing [to leave], the village was attacked by unidentified gunmen and the population escaped in panic. And the child was separated \u2026 from his parents and he followed his neighbours. He crossed the border with the neighbours, not the parents.\u201d As soon as a lone child is identified, relief workers on the ground will try to find their families \u2013 but that can be a considerable challenge. In the case of the 14-year-old, Boyer said, the neighbours and the child are trying to find where the biological parents are. \u201cBut \u2026 the border between Chad and Sudan is more than 1,000km and even if the parents are probably not that far from where the child is, if they have succeeded to cross the border, we have dozens of thousands of refugees. \u201cSo it\u2019s really difficult to identify where the parents are,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, the phone network is not good.\u201d The task of reunification became easier, he said, if the families and children went to official camps where they were properly registered in the refugee system. \u201cIf the parents stay in host communities then it will take more time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible, but it will take more time.\u201d In any humanitarian crisis, he added, unaccompanied minors were \u201cthe most vulnerable\u201d of the vulnerable, with child labour or sexual exploitation a real risk. In an attempt to mitigate this, UN workers try to ensure they are kept with adults they know \u201cin a kind of family environment\u201d. With the Chadian Red Cross, Unicef is also putting in place \u201cchild-friendly spaces\u201d where under-18s can receive psychological support. \u201cBecause, as you can imagine, most of these kids have gone through serious psychological trauma. They saw gunmen; they heard the bullets,\u201d said Boyer. Concerns about lone children only add to the considerable worries humanitarian workers have about the tens of thousands of young people fleeing Sudan. Cases of measles have been identified among child refugees and more than 350 have been diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition. The true figure is thought to be far higher. The other major headache for relief workers is the imminent rainy season, which has already arrived in some places and is blocking access to refugees, according to Jean-Marie Bihizi, the Catholic Relief Services\u2019 country manager for Chad. A CRS team had travelled to the Sila region of south-eastern Chad last week to assess the refugees\u2019 needs and had planned to distribute food as well as other crucial items such as mosquito nets, plastic sheeting and water-purification tablets. \u201cBut they couldn\u2019t cross because of a river \u2026 flooding,\u201d said Bihizi. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t cross the river to get to the site. So they were obliged to go back.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/the-nutritionist-made-a-lot-of-sense-until-her-perplexing-advice-about-raw-chicken", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The nutritionist made a lot of sense \u2013 until her perplexing advice about raw chicken | Zoe Williams", "lead": "I thought I\u2019d found the perfect dietary expert for my interview.

For she was evidently desperate, the 44-year-old mother of three children \u2013 one of whom has additional needs \u2013 jailed on Monday for the 19th-century crime of procuring her own miscarriage. The court heard that she must have known for months that she was expecting; that having moved back in during lockdown with her estranged ex while pregnant with another man\u2019s child, she\u2019d furtively Googled both how to conceal a pregnancy and how to end one, agonising over the decision for weeks. In the end she obtained abortion drugs from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) under a lockdown measure allowing for remote consultations without attending a clinic, intended solely for women less than 10 weeks pregnant. Police were called after she delivered a stillborn daughter aged between 32 and 34 weeks \u2013 well beyond the 24-week limit for an abortion, except in cases of severe foetal abnormality or serious risk to the mother, and old enough to be viable. She still, the court heard, has nightmares in which she sees her dead child\u2019s face. Mr Justice Pepperall noted that all this happened in the \u201cfirst and most intense stage of lockdown\u201d, a time when many parents of young children felt close to snapping; that she remains racked with guilt. But still, he concluded, she knew full well she was over the legal limit and she lied. Had she pleaded guilty from the start, she might have got a suspended sentence, but instead she got 28 months. It\u2019s a distressing end to a distressing case for which prison simply doesn\u2019t feel like the answer. Her three children, the court heard, rely on her. What earthly purpose is served by separating them from their mother when she poses no conceivable threat to the general public? The law is the law, of course, but in this case it seems a particularly heartless ass. What makes all this disturbing for many women, meanwhile, is that it exposes the surprisingly slender thread from which our reproductive rights hang. You might think abortion was decriminalised in England, Scotland and Wales back in 1967, but you\u2019d be wrong: essentially David Steel\u2019s landmark bill merely created a defence to something that\u2019s still a crime (under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act in England and Wales and under common law in Scotland; the exception, ironically, is Northern Ireland, once the most draconian of all, but which recently decriminalised abortion up to 12 weeks if a doctor certifies the duration of pregnancy). And this isn\u2019t the only case in which those ancient laws have been invoked. In 2021, a 15-year-old girl faced a year-long criminal investigation over an unexplained stillbirth, which ended only after a coroner ruled her loss was due to natural causes. In 2016, a 21-year-old Northern Irish woman received a suspended sentence after being reported to police by her housemates for buying abortion drugs online. Last year in Oxford, the prosecution withdrew its case against a woman whose baby had survived her taking a dose of the stomach ulcer drug misoprostol, which is also used as an abortifacient: she said she\u2019d previously been prescribed it by a doctor in Portugal and had taken it accidentally, mistaking it for anti-thrush tablets. BPAS points out that it\u2019s vulnerable women \u2013 such as migrants unsure of their rights on the NHS, or women terrified of their abusive partners knowing they\u2019ve ended a pregnancy \u2013 who may be more likely to fall foul of the law. Some doctors, meanwhile, fear that involving the courts may dissuade women who miscarry (for whatever reason) from seeking medical help, with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists arguing that prosecution is not in the broader public interest. Britain is not the US, as we must periodically remind ourselves: we lack the religious fervour animating America\u2019s culture wars and so abortion never became a partisan political issue here. It\u2019s outdated law, not politicians trying to recreate Gilead, driving these prosecutions. That said, only parliament can tackle what the Labour MP Stella Creasy calls this \u201changover from another era\u201d by finally decriminalising abortion. That doesn\u2019t mean unleashing a free-for-all, but regulating abortion like any other medical procedure with complex ethical implications, letting parliament set the legal framework under which doctors can operate. Yes, there\u2019s a risk of reopening old battles about the content of that framework, which may be why previous governments have steered clear. But tragic cases such as this one suggest doing nothing can be the crueller choice. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As satire, it was phenomenally effective, with the choicest skewering saved for those who see the main character primarily as a means to trumpet their own empathy. Crucially, the book never made a saint of its protagonist, who, more than ready to feel the weight of the world on his shoulders, has one or two blind spots of his own. Taylor\u2019s next book, Filthy Animals, was a series of linked short stories again exploring class, sex and race in a campus setting but this time inhabiting three characters rather than one. His new book, dubbed \u201ca symphony of a novel\u201d (blurb-speak for \u201cbarely disguised story collection\u201d), sticks with higher-ed sexual entanglements in the American midwest but further stretches his canvas to more than double the number of characters, with uncertain results. It opens in a poetry workshop as seen through the eyes of one of its students, Seamus, whose peers are, he thinks, merely \u201ctethering their bad ideas to recognised names and hoping someone would call them smart, call them sharp, call them radical and right, call them a poet and a thinker and a mind, even if they were just children\u201d. He can\u2019t hide his disparagement, not least of someone \u201cwhose work was chiefly about herself, as if all that had transpired in the existence of humankind was no more consequential than the slightly nervy account of her first use of a tampon\u201d. His sceptical comments rile female classmates who are quick to accuse him of \u201cviolence\u201d. There\u2019s more than a whiff in this piss-take of MFA culture of a former creative writing graduate unloading a degree\u2019s worth of beef (you suspect that a small portion of the book\u2019s audience may be reading the workshop scenes very attentively indeed). But the literary send-up is just a springboard for a broader exploration of education, economics and desire. When class is brought prematurely to an end and Seamus picks up an extra shift at the hospice kitchen where he funds his study, Taylor introduces the book\u2019s central tension, between students who have money and those who don\u2019t, as micro-dramas continually break out among its highly strung cast over, say, the morality of selling sex clips online or working in an abattoir as they pursue ambitions in music, dance and writing. Real Life drew power from putting us in the headspace of a single character at odds with his milieu. Nothing in The Late Americans matches the dramatic interest of that book; the basic but unignorable problem is that the characters are simply too inert. Dialogue boils down to passive-aggressive squabbles that circle unvoiced emotion, a tension-generating strategy dulled through overuse. It hardly helps that the novel itself keeps insisting how irrelevant everything is. What starts as the despondency of particular characters (\u201cHe mattered so little\u201d; \u201cThey were all inconsequential\u201d) spirals into a kind of blanket auto-cancellation: \u201cthe whole world, the whole procession of its events marched on without a single notice or care that there in their tiny, obscure particle of the galaxy, two people\u2019s hearts were breaking over and over again\u201d. That worn-down register is really a literary humblebrag, asserting modesty while ludicrously laying claim to a cosmic vantage point. Throughout, Taylor\u2019s cadences lunge for high-literary heft: I gave up counting how often he deployed formulations such as \u201cthe oily salt of it\u201d (when someone is thinking about the sauce on their penne) or \u201cthe warm animal of himself\u201d (when someone is thinking about, well, not penne). The tone is exhausting. Witness this chapter opening: \u201cIvan and Goran did not talk about how long it had been since they had fucked. They did not talk about how long it had been since they had held each other and fallen asleep. They slept together, woke together, ate together, and otherwise went about their lives as though nothing at all changed, though of course everything had. It was not denial. It was something else \u2013 fear, perhaps, or a lack of caring.\u201d The passage, first brusque, then tender, gives way to characteristically fussy self-correction that sounds solemn but ultimately feels like padding. There\u2019s no sign of the sense of humour that Real Life had in abundance. Why? Taylor is too smart not to know what he\u2019s doing \u2013 his critical essays on Substack are an education for anyone interested in reading or writing \u2013 yet the overall effect resembles nothing so much as a dare to create character-driven fiction from austerely deprived means, as if draining the dregs of his theme before lighting out for new turf. \u2022 The Late Americans by Brandon Taylor is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).

It\u2019s an atmospheric mood piece set in and around the Forest of Dean which doesn\u2019t quite deliver either as psychological drama or folk horror, and might have been better boiled down to a short film. Rory Alexander plays a troubled young man who has just been let out of a psychiatric facility after what appears to be a breakdown caused by the disappearance of his mother some years before. There are some disturbing dream-setpieces in the woods (perhaps the one this man sees at night) featuring a woman and a little boy. Once released, he goes to stay with a garage mechanic called Dunleavy, played by Rylance, an amiably bleary, dishevelled but worldly-wise individual who was once a friend of his mum\u2019s, or maybe more than a friend. Dunleavy lets him crash at his place, although the young man insists on sleeping in the car outside the house, and Dunleavy gets him a job at the garage where the other workers invite him out for a drink at an oddly conceived quasi-Lynchian bar; here the young man has a connection with a sex worker who reminds him of his lost mother. The relaxed confidence and style of Rylance\u2019s performance rather exposes the callow and uncertain nature of the others, while the direction, casting and line-readings sometimes seem a bit unconvincing. But set against this is the fact that Ryder is still only in his early 20s and is still clearly a remarkable potential talent. Inland points the way to more mature work still to come. \u2022 Inland is released on 16 June in UK cinemas."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/13/my-parents-want-to-split-their-home-into-two-houses-selling-one-to-me-is-it-feasible", "primaryCategory": "money", "title": "My parents want to split their home into two houses, selling one to me.

My parents live in a large semi-detached house that they extended to twice the size of the original three-bed in the early 90s. They are both in their 60s now and thinking about retiring but are held back as they still have a mortgage to pay and aren\u2019t keen to move out of the area they\u2019ve lived in for more than 30 years. They\u2019ve recently proposed the idea of splitting the house into two separate addresses, keeping the extended part of the house for themselves and selling me the original part of the house. Both parts of the house would be a good size and have parking and garden access, so I think we meet all the criteria for size and space that the local council would have. The sale would provide enough to pay off their remaining mortgage, making it possible for them to retire. It would also make it easier for me to get on the property ladder as they would give me a small discount on the price (property prices are high in this area). I\u2019ve looked it up and seen there are a lot of articles about subdividing a house into flats but not much about subdividing into two separate houses. Would the house being semi-detached cause issues with subdividing? Is their mortgage lender likely to protest against the change even if the sale pays off the remaining mortgage? If this worked out it would be a brilliant advantage to my parents and myself but while my parents are fairly confident and are beginning to think of having plans drawn up and planning out what would internal work would be needed to split the property (bricking up doorways between the halves, splitting the water, gas and electric systems, etc), I\u2019m nervous that they could start to invest money in this plan only to run into major hurdles later. Is this a feasible plan or are we daydreaming to think it will work? VP A I don\u2019t think you are daydreaming but I do think you need to do a bit more homework. First, your parents need to talk to their solicitor to check that their current freehold can be split. If it can, the next job is to talk to their mortgage lender, ideally with a realistic idea of what their eventual property will be worth (so it would also be an idea to talk to an estate agent). If this is more than their outstanding mortgage, their mortgage lender may be amenable to the idea of splitting the property into two but if it is less, it will be a no-no. If the lender is prepared to let them go ahead, the next job is to get plans drawn up to apply for planning permission, so they will need to pay for an architect\u2019s expertise. According to the quick guide to splitting a property published by Lawdit Solicitors, you will also need \u201cdetailed plans showing exactly what part of the property is being taken out of the original title\u201d to submit to the Land Registry as part of an application to split the freehold into two (which is only possible if a property is to be split vertically). As well as submitting plans, you will also need to explain why you want to split the title. \u201cThere is no guarantee that your application will be successful\u201d, the guide says, \u201cas the Land Registry will only split the title if they deem it to be necessary\u201d."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/13/doctors-censured-medical-record-breaches-gmc", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "Twenty-four UK doctors in five years censured over medical record breaches", "lead": "GMC says cases were among 194 incidents of alleged violations of confidentiality between 2017 and 2022", "author": "Denis Campbell Health policy editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T06:00:41Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.079999", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f7a93db38bb4ab5409b6dde85290385445276e45/0_0_2880_1728/500.jpg", "body": "Two-dozen doctors have been disciplined by the UK medical regulator in the last five years after accessing and using information from patients\u2019 treatment records without good reason. The General Medical Council (GMC) said it had struck off two of the 24 doctors it had sanctioned after finding that they had undertaken \u201cinappropriate use\u201d of medical records. Another 10 were suspended, 10 were warned about their future conduct, one had a condition imposed on their licence to practise medicine and the other had to undertake not to repeat their behaviour. The 24 cases were among 194 incidents of doctors allegedly accessing medical records without a clinical justification that prompted a complaint to the regulator between 2017 and 2022. Privacy campaigners said it was shocking that almost 200 people had made complaints to the GMC accusing doctors of violating patients\u2019 confidentiality in that way. \u201cA GMC complaint is not a small undertaking, so this is the tip of the iceberg for the real level of [doctors\u2019] inappropriate use [of medical records],\u201d said Sam Smith, a spokesperson for the campaign group MedConfidential. \u201cThat this many people have been able to gather sufficient evidence to bring a GMC complaint is shocking\u201d. He urged NHS England to change the way the NHS app operates so that patients can automatically see which staff have accessed their records, in order to prevent inappropriate access. The Guardian revealed last month that a \u201cstalker\u201d female doctor at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge accessed the records of her ex-boyfriend\u2019s new girlfriend \u2013 whom she had no role in treating \u2013 and shared some of the intimate information that she obtained. The Guardian did not name the doctor or the woman whose privacy she violated. The GMC is now investigating the consultant\u2019s behaviour. Responding to the GMC\u2019s figures, the victim said: \u201cGiven how unlikely it is that a patient will discover that their data has been illegitimately accessed, it is highly likely that doctors are accessing patients\u2019 notes more often than the roughly 40 times a year that lead to someone complaining to the GMC. \u201cThe fact that our most personal data is so widely shared with so few safeguards, I believe puts us all at risk of NHS staff examining our records without good reason.\u201d Earlier this year, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), the GMC\u2019s disciplinary arm, banned Dr Noel Sardar, a psychiatrist in Wales, from practising as a doctor after he was convicted in 2019 of stalking two vulnerable women with mental health problems whom he had treated. Sardar alarmed both women by calling them on their mobile phones and coming to their homes. Last year the MPTS struck off Dr Monika Ciechanska, a London hospital doctor. The hearing in her case was told that she had accessed, or caused other people to access on her behalf, electronic patient records using other doctors\u2019 accounts so that she could order medical tests. The GMC reiterated that doctors should not access patients\u2019 records without a medical reason. A spokesperson said: \u201cPatients must have confidence that their personal information is protected at all times. Our guidance is clear. We expect doctors to make sure any personal information about patients is effectively protected at all times against improper access, disclosure or loss, and they must not access a patient\u2019s personal information unless they have a legitimate reason to view it.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/13/a-three-week-repair-to-my-cherished-mini-has-taken-eight-months", "primaryCategory": "money", "title": "A three-week repair to my cherished Mini has taken eight months", "lead": "I miss it, and wanted it checked over to take part in a charity drive", "author": "Zoe Wood", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T06:00:41Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080002", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7ff267fb16d59961693efe83b9bc4a04b3c4c3/0_139_4256_2554/500.jpg", "body": "I am a pensioner and last September had my cherished low-mileage classic Mini transported to a garage in Northampton for repairs on its automatic gearbox.

I chose Kingsthorpe Precision Engineering, which trades as AP2 World, because the website described it as a world leader in classic Mini repairs. The owner, Martin Altria, told me the job would cost \u00a32,400 and take three weeks. I keep getting different excuses for the delay. The last one was that the air conditioning was faulty and a \u00a3400 part was required. I reluctantly purchased the part and had it sent there. That was six weeks ago. My Mini is worth \u00a310,000 and, as a full-time carer for my disabled wife, I don\u2019t have the money to hire a lawyer. I miss driving my car and would be grateful for any advice. DG, Dronfield My first thought was to seek advice from the police, who in the end did facilitate the return of your Mini. However, the garage told Northamptonshire police it had kept the car because the \u00a32,345 bill had not been paid. You insist you were never sent a bill to pay and this had never been cited as the reason for the long delay. The police advised you to settle the bill \u2013 a garage can hold on to your car while there is a payment outstanding under \u201cliens\u201d law \u2013 but to write \u201cpaying under protest\u201d on their copy. This lets the garage know they can expect further action. To your frustration, the police said this was a civil matter over payment and advised you to have the car assessed. If the repairs were unsatisfactory, you could report the garage to Trading Standards and pursue your cash via the small claims court. So you paid the invoice plus another \u00a3160 to have the car picked up and your cherished Mini is back with you. However, you say the repair work has not been done. We tried unsuccessfully to seek a refund on your behalf but could get no response from Altria via email or phone. You have reported the firm to Trading Standards and are considering a small claims court action. Going to the small claims court (there\u2019s a different process in Scotland and Northern Ireland) is a last resort and you must pay a court fee (in this case about \u00a3200). We wish you luck.

The town is a natural way station for travellers following the classic Grand St Bernard route south into Italy. The chic set stop off in Martigny en route to Verbier. Switzerland has so many celebrated metre-gauge mountain railways, among them an outstanding trinity of lines that are boldly promoted to overseas tour operators and have ample capacity to handle large groups. Those three crowd-pullers are the wonderful Bernina railway from the Upper Engadine to Tirano in Italy, the steeply graded line from Brig to Andermatt and beyond (used by the Glacier Express) and the fine GoldenPass route running west from the Thunersee via the Simme Valley to Gstaad and Montreux. By contrast, the hourly Mont-Blanc Express railway from Martigny to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains in France is relatively unsung, yet in my opinion rates as rewarding as the Bernina, Glacier and GoldenPass routes. The Mont-Blanc Express tussles with topography, cutting through fierce rocky terrain above the Trient Gorge and then following the ominously named Eau Noire upstream across the border into France. The railway then dives into a long tunnel, before dropping down into the Chamonix Valley and following the River Arve down to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, where there are connections to the Geneva area. Although promoted as the Mont-Blanc Express, the 24-mile (38km) journey from Martigny to Saint-Gervais is no fast dash, taking well over two hours and averaging only 15 mph. There are over two dozen intermediate stations, though many are request stops. When I made this journey in May 2023, I took a full day for it, stopping off along the way. Bold engineering The notion of a narrow-gauge mountain railway from the Valais region over the hills to Chamonix in France gained traction in the 1880s as investors saw how Niklaus Riggenbach\u2019s rack system, pioneered on the Rigi Railway in 1871, was allowing cog railways to access remote mountain communities. The line from Martigny through to Saint-Gervais via Chamonix wasn\u2019t completed until 1908 and initially it was suspended during the winter months. Better avalanche protection later allowed year-round operation. When it came to electrifying this route, there were debates whether third rail or overhead wires were the best option; neither side won, and the line uses a mix of both methods. Platform 40 at Martigny station is easily missed, tucked away beyond the main platforms. The red and white Mont-Blanc Express slips out of Platform 40 on time and with no great fanfare. There\u2019s a tantalising glimpse to the left of the fierce ravine cut by the River Trient as it cascades down from the heavily glaciated mountains away to the south. Then we start to climb steeply and I appreciate why engineers opted for a cog railway for this section of the line. The train passes by great cliffs, twisting and turning with a feast of neck-craning panoramic views. I make a first stop at Salvan, a small village with a neat station styled in the manner of an Alpine chalet. The road which leads past the station is called Rue Marconi, a reminder it was here that Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi conducted early experiments in wireless telegraphy. Joining the next train an hour later, we quickly crest the thousand-metre contour with welcome hints of spring sunshine. There\u2019s an announcement: \u201cProchain arr\u00eat: Le Tr\u00e9tien\u201d. The Mont-Blanc Express duly rolls to a halt at Le Tr\u00e9tien. This is too good a chance to miss, so on a whim I alight. This is a gorgeous village high above the Trient Valley, and a jumping-off point for hikers wanting to explore the Trient Gorge. The area was bypassed in the heyday of tourism development in this region, when resorts like Zermatt, Crans-Montana and Chamonix shot to prominence. But by the 1880s, adventurous travellers were making their way to Salvan and Le Tr\u00e9tien, drawn by a magical mix of glaciers, rugged scenery and pastoral beauty. In a pleasant hour wandering steep alleys and lanes around Le Tr\u00e9tien, I meet only one other person and our paths cross twice, each time with a reciprocal smile and a nod. All too soon, I am back at Le Tr\u00e9tien\u2019s lonely station platform, indicating with a wave of my hand that I\u2019d like the approaching train to stop. For the third time today, I am bound for France and within 20 minutes we are slipping over the border. The Chamonix valley It is well known that the ambition of train operators flags at frontiers and an announcement indicates everyone must change on to a French train at Vallorcine. This is standard practice on the Mont-Blanc Express, which is actually two well-coordinated train services run respectively by Swiss and French operators. It\u2019s an easy cross-platform change of train, and within a few minutes we are on our way again, now on a French train but also prominently branded as the Mont-Blanc Express. We are still climbing, through a long tunnel under the Col des Montets. When the road over the pass is closed by snow, the rail tunnel provides the only link between Vallorcine and the Chamonix Valley. So there\u2019s a creative sharing of the narrow tunnel, allowing cars to drive through when no train is scheduled. It\u2019s an arrangement that has not yet led to disaster. Emerging from the tunnel into the sunlit valley of the River Arve, there are glorious views on the run down to Chamonix, with the rubbly moraines on the Glacier d\u2019Argenti\u00e8re high to the left. I make a third and final stop at Chamonix, enjoying a wander through this pleasant town where the entire economy is defined by mountain tourism. The town\u2019s official name is Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, but the clouds do not cooperate so I am denied a good view of the highest peak in the Alps. By late afternoon, I am back on the train, now with frequent stops and more like a tram, as we slowly drop down to Saint-Gervais-les-Bain. Elevated concrete highways loop assertively over the railway as a reminder that we are returning to more populated terrain. I didn\u2019t see Mont Blanc on this occasion, but I still found this international route a remarkable railway adventure. Tickets from Martigny to Chamonix (\u20ac34.40) or Saint- Gervais-les-Bains (\u20ac44.40) can be bought from Rail Europe.

The first evidence session in a massive public inquiry into the UK\u2019s handling of the Covid pandemic starts today. Lady Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer in the House of Lords, who also led the inquests into the 7/7 bombings, is the chair. The scope of the investigation is staggering: it looks at every part of the pandemic, from the government\u2019s preparedness, to political decisions that were made, and the impact on the health service and vaccine rollouts. This inquiry is different from others that we have seen in the past because of the scale of the pandemic. It affected everyone and as a result everyone has questions. To date, over 220,000 people have died from Covid in the UK and an estimated 2 million more self-reported experiencing long Covid. That does not include the untold damage to young people whose life prospects may have been irreparably damaged, or the impact on the nation\u2019s mental health and the sizeable economic damage. In addition to learning lessons to better handle future pandemics, Hallett views this inquiry as a space to \u201ccommemorate the hardship and loss that so many people in the UK suffered\u201d. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Guardian social affairs correspondent Robert Booth about what we can expect in the coming months from the Covid inquiry. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Health | A woman has been sentenced to 28 months in prison after pleading guilty to procuring drugs to induce an abortion after the legal limit. The mother of three, 44, received the medication under the \u201cpills by post\u201d scheme, which was introduced during the Covid pandemic. Italy | The former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has died aged 86. The media tycoon, who led three governments between 1994 and 2011, had been diagnosed with leukaemia some time ago. Politics | Sources have told the Guardian that Rishi Sunak would block Boris Johnson from standing again as a Conservative MP before the next election. The prime minister clashed publicly with Johnson over his failed attempts to elevate several close allies to the House of Lords. Scotland | The first minister, Humza Yousaf, has rejected growing calls from across the political spectrum to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from the Scottish National party after her arrest on Sunday. The former first minister has said she is innocent of any wrongdoing. Economy | Britain has experienced the worst exports record of any member of the G7 besides Japan over the last decade, according to a new analysis that will raise pressure on the government to reconsider its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. In depth: \u2018Clearly, things went wrong \u2013 there\u2019s an obligation to make sure we improve our responses\u2019 Before it even began, the Covid inquiry was faced with significant obstacles. The government is spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on legal action to block the inquiry from examining Boris Johnson\u2019s unredacted WhatsApp messages and contemporaneous notebooks. Ministers argue that 55,000 documents have already been handed over \u2013 and anything that hadn\u2019t been was irrelevant. But Hallett has stood fast in her demands, saying that it was for her to determine the relevancy of all potential evidence. This obfuscation has been decried as an attempt to cover up mismanagement. And that is all before the inquiry has begun hearing evidence. *** Why is this inquiry so important? With no deadline to hit, the inquiry is expected to last at least until 2026. At least \u00a385m has already been spent, and it is expected to cost well over \u00a3100m over the next three years. Hallett may call up to 1,000 witnesses to give evidence in that time, likely including at least three prime ministers, numerous cabinet ministers and senior civil servants. The reason for the exhaustive exercise? The UK has one of the highest Covid death tolls in the world. The cost of making similar mistakes in the future is simply too high \u2013 experts say that another pandemic is inevitable, potentially in the next decade. It is of upmost importance that \u201cthe lessons are learned for next time\u201d, Robert says. \u201cClearly, things went wrong in our response to Covid, we could see that happening in real time, so there\u2019s an obligation to make sure we improve our government and health system responses.\u201d There has also been a big push from the bereaved \u2013 particularly the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents more than 6,000 families \u2013 who desperately want the public inquiry to examine what really happened to their loved ones. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not taking the role of an inquest, it will provide answers for those who witnessed first-hand how things were going wrong, especially in the most acute circumstances,\u201d Robert says. *** The main themes The inquiry is being split up into six \u201cmodules\u201d but only the first four have been opened: resilience and preparedness, decision-making by the government, the impact of Covid on the health system, and vaccines. This first leg will probably include the role of austerity in reducing capacity in the health service to respond effectively and safely to a pandemic. In the autumn the political drama will accelerate. \u201cThe second module is probably going to be the most box office moment politically,\u201d says Robert. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take apart the government\u2019s decision making. What happened inside Downing Street? How was the government working? How were they responding to the science? How were they responding to public opinion?\u201d This is likely going to be the most scarring part of the inquiry for politicians, particularly for Rishi Sunak as he has the most to lose and was a crucial part of the government as chancellor. Seeing as Boris Johnson has already set his political career alight and has another Covid-related inquiry hampering him, he has a lot less to lose, and plenty of opportunity to hamper his successor with his evidence. However, if the findings are bad enough they could burn any future chance of a Johnson return to Downing Street. And all of that only takes us to the end of this year. Hallett then has the small task of covering the entire healthcare system, the scandal around procurement, the crisis in care homes, test and trace, the impact on education and children, the role of the Treasury in supporting the economy, and how the welfare system supported the most vulnerable. She has also emphasised the need to frame all of this evidence-gathering through the lens of social and economic inequality because we know that Covid affected different sections of society in different ways. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s just an incredible amount to get through,\u201d Robert says. *** The victims Bereaved people will have the chance to take part in the inquiry through something called a listening exercise, essentially an online form that people who have lost loved ones in the pandemic can fill in to give their view on the testimony that is being given during the inquiry. But for many, this is not enough. \u201cThey want to be giving evidence in the witness box themselves; they want to be far more central,\u201d Robert says. Unfortunately, there are simply too many people who have been affected by the pandemic for this to be possible: \u201cThis isn\u2019t like the Grenfell inquiry or Hillsborough where you have a limited number of bereaved advocates. Over 220,000 people died of Covid in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s not possible to represent all of those people in an inquiry like this,\u201d Robert says. This need for representation has created tension between the inquiry and the bereaved families groups. For some more insight into the thoughts and feelings of those who lost loved ones during the pandemic, read Robert\u2019s brilliant interview with four bereaved people who recall the haphazardness of the response and share why they think Britain was so unprepared. *** What to expect next The public will not have to wait three years for answers from this inquiry \u2013 Hallett has decided to produce reports as she goes along. \u201cWe expect the first report on modules one and two next year, which is quite quick,\u201d says Robert. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really important for the UK because the clock is ticking on the next pandemic and knowing what we did wrong should shape what we do right now.\u201d This constant output will mean that the inquiry will remain at the forefront of the political agenda, especially as we head towards a general election in the next 18 months. Beyond political intrigue, what can the inquiry hope to achieve? The bereaved cannot have their loved ones returned to them, young people cannot replace lost years and those with long Covid will not be cured. But transparency and accountability can go a long way in helping the nation to heal from the pandemic years. What that could look like is, as of yet, unknown, says Robert: \u201cWhat is clear though is that it\u2019s going to be the big saga of the next few years.\u201d Yesterday\u2019s newsletter incorrectly named Nigel Evans as the Conservative MP who stood down as an MP on Saturday and triggered a byelection; that should have referred to Nigel Adams, MP for Selby and Ainsty.

The treasurer, Cameron Dick, on Tuesday handed down Queensland\u2019s 2023-24 budget, which offered a rare opportunity for a government to pitch itself to economic conservatives \u2013 via a record surplus and debt reduction \u2013 while at the same time spending big on households struggling with inflationary pressures. At the heart of this year\u2019s budget is the increased revenue generated by coal royalty hikes \u2013 a measure announced last year that has faced significant opposition from the mining sector, including a $40m advertising campaign by the Queensland Resources Council. The budget papers reveal income of more than $15bn from coal royalties in 2022-23 \u2013 about $10bn more than had been forecast 12 months ago \u2013 due mainly to sustained high coal prices, which trigger the increased royalty rates. The boost has allowed the government to frame its 2023-24 budget as a Robin Hood-style affair \u2013 portraying miners as greedy for complaining while they rake in super profits, while marking the budget papers with a \u201ctackling the cost of living\u201d stamp. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe can deliver our state\u2019s biggest cost-of-living program, our state\u2019s biggest building program and deliver lower debt for one simple reason \u2013 progressive coal royalties,\u201d Dick said. \u201cOur decision to take on the mining lobby, to stand our ground and to fight for the people of our state has delivered a rich reward.\u201d The increased royalties income are set to push the 2022-23 surplus to $12.3bn, which Dick said was the largest recorded by a state or territory government. The budget predicts Queensland will run a $2.2bn deficit next year, largely due to one-off spending measures. Coal royalties also helped the state temporarily reduce net debt, which is now $5.9bn, instead of the $19.8bn forecast 12 months ago. By 2026-27, debt levels will have climbed back to almost $47bn, largely due to infrastructure spending. Queensland will spend $8.2bn in 2023-24 on cost-of-living relief, including a $550 energy rebate for every household, with concession holders to receive an additional $150 discount on top of an existing $372 rebate, taking total support for this group to $1,072 in 2023-24. Dick said the rebate was the most generous of all the states and territories and meant many Queenslanders won\u2019t pay for electricity at all next year. He said the rebates were a deliberate measure to assist households in a way that is deflationary, rather than putting cash directly into people\u2019s pockets and potentially contributing to further inflation. The government has also announced it will fully subsidise 15 hours a week of kindergarten (in Queensland kindy is the year before children start school). The measure is expected to save Queenslanders up to $4,600 a year in fees. \u201cIt gives more Queenslanders the opportunity to return to work or to take on more work,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWe understand the economic potential that is unlocked by enabling more women to get back into the workforce.\u201d Dick also boasted a record $89bn will be invested in the state\u2019s \u201cbig build\u201d program over the next four years. The program will help provide critical infrastructure across the state ahead of the 2032 Olympic Games. Those measures come on top of increased funding for health, housing and youth justice \u2013 all areas where the state government has found itself under political pressure in recent months. Almost $2.9bn extra will be spent on health services over the next five years, including measures to reduce ambulance ramping and boost the state\u2019s patient travel subsidy scheme. The government will increase funding for social and affordable housing to $1.1bn, with $250m slated for housing and homelessness support services. Youth crime is another focus of this year\u2019s budget. The government has allocated $440m over five years for youth co-responder teams, policing and to help seniors secure their homes. \u201cThis budget delivers what the people of Queensland need: comprehensive cost-of-living relief,\u201d Dick said. \u201cNo other government in Australia could promise this. And no other government in Australia could deliver what this budget delivers for Queensland.\u201d The opposition Liberal National party said the budget failed to deliver long-term solutions to the cost-of-living, youth crime, health and housing crises. Shadow treasurer David Janetzki said Queensland would have \u201cnothing to show\u201d for the billions of dollars more than was previously forecast. \u201cAfter the rivers of gold dry up, Queensland will have nothing to show but the highest debt in our state\u2019s history, the highest taxes and failing frontline services,\u201d Janetzki said. The Queensland Resources Council chief executive, Ian Macfarlane, said the budget \u201crevealed the true extent in which Queensland relies on the resources sector\u201d. But the former federal Liberal resources minister said investor confidence had been \u201cshattered\u201d by the coal royalty increase and it would be an \u201cenormous hit on the future viability\u201d of the industry. The Queensland Council of Social Service chief executive, Aimee McVeigh, welcomed rebates on power that would benefit all Queensland households and that would likely see some low-income households not pay electricity bills at all for the next financial year. \u201cPeople have been not turning on heaters, not turning on lights and not using power because of the pressure that the cost of energy is putting on household budgets,\u201d she said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/13/hundreds-of-families-mourn-in-peru-as-children-fall-victim-to-dengue-outbreak", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "title": "Hundreds of families mourn in Peru as children fall victim to dengue outbreak", "lead": "Death toll mounts in northern Piura region after torrential rain and floods lead to worst ever epidemic", "author": "Dan Collyns in Piura", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T05:30:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080011", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dfe6b06d02e3e8dbfd90c836933f90bb3e1e2791/0_515_8139_4883/500.jpg", "body": "In a stream of white, mourners walked behind an ivory-coloured, shoulder-borne coffin as neighbours, heads bowed and hands clasped, peered out of doorways on the narrow street in Castilla, a middle-class suburb in Piura, northern Peru. At the gates of the San Jos\u00e9 de Tarbes school, dozens of girls wearing grey skirts and white shirts with red ties awaited the cortege, holding white balloons and roses. It was a farewell for their schoolmate Priscila Quispe, seven, who died of dengue in the Santa Rosa public hospital last week. In the school courtyard, her teacher paid tribute to the bright, caring girl as the children, staff and parents stood in stunned silence. Quispe was one of the victims of a dengue outbreak sweeping through Piura, the centre of Peru\u2019s worst epidemic of the mosquito-borne virus on record. Peru has 137,539 dengue cases and registered at least 223 deaths, the highest mortality rate for the virus in the Americas, according to data released on Saturday from the Panamerican Health Organisation and Peru\u2019s National Center for Epidemiology, Disease Prevention and Control. Battered by heavy rains and flooding in recent months, Piura has seen more than 40,000 cases and 69 deaths this year, at least a dozen of them children, in the city of around half a million, according to the local health authority. In April and May, Cyclone Yaku unleashed torrential rain on northern Peru, and the flood waters provided the ideal breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti mosquito, the vector for dengue, as well as chikungunya and zika, which is endemic in the hot northern region, near the border with Ecuador. \u201cThe first day, [my daughter] had a high fever and abdominal pain, then on the second and third day she was vomiting and had diarrhoea,\u201d said Lilian Pizarro, whose seven-year-old, Camila, was recovering in an emergency tent hospital erected on a sports field to deal with the overflow of dengue patients. Under mosquito nets, the patients were cared for by medical specialists sent from the capital, Lima. Despite a contingency plan for a dengue outbreak, \u201cthe demand has been much greater than the supply\u201d, Dr Jennifer Cuadros, a medic with the prevention and control of metaxenic and zoonotic diseases directorate, told the Guardian. The caseload was already double that of 2017, after the last El Ni\u00f1o tore through Peru\u2019s coastal region, killing more than 140 people in floods and landslides, and causing billions of pounds in damage. The city\u2019s public hospitals have been struggling to cope, and beds are available for only the most severe cases. \u201cHere we only take dengue patients with alarm signs \u2013 bleeding, persistent abdominal pain, persistent vomiting,\u201d said Dr Ludwig Zeta, 26, who was manning triage, along with two nurses, at a maternity hospital as dozens of patients waited outside. \u201cWe have many young people and a good number of children.\u201d He had not seen so many ill people since the Covid pandemic, in which Peru had one of the world\u2019s highest mortality rates. \u201cIn Piura, 30% of the infected people are children,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Orrego, the ombudsman for the region. \u201cTheir cases can quickly become fatal, so we need paediatricians.\u201d On the outskirts of the city, dozens of dengue sufferers have no choice but to stay home. In a hut made from plywood and woven matting, Juana Aquino, 66, and her nine-year-old grandson, Abraham, were both laid up with fever. She has been his carer since her daughter and the boy\u2019s father were killed in a motorcycle accident five years ago. Another daughter, Giovani Risco, was caring for both but was afraid to take them to the hospital, fearing they would be taken into intensive care. Neighbours were also sick. An elderly couple, Josefa Rivas, 74, and Mario Mor\u00e9, 76, had been confined to their beds for two weeks, too weak to move and barely able to eat, their family said. Cristobal Timan\u00e1, a community leader, estimated that more than half of the 640 households there had dengue. The community, which began as a camp for flood victims six years ago, relies on tanks to pipe water into barrels stored in homes. These are uncovered and so are breeding grounds for the mosquito larvae. Timan\u00e1 said he had been appealing to the local authorities to fumigate their homes for two months, but to no avail. An El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon expected later this year will bring more heavy rain and flooding. The climate crisis has driven a rise in vector-borne diseases, according to a 2022 study. \u201cThe increase in temperature is going to continue, and diseases like dengue are one of the results,\u201d said Dr Luis Pampa, an infectiologist from Peru\u2019s National Health Institute, who was treating patients in the tent hospital. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be fortune-tellers to say that, if we do not take this problem seriously, it could get worse.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/13/hunter-valley-bus-crash-driver-court-ten-people-killed-greta-nsw-updates-latest-news", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Bus driver released on bail; junior doctor and local athletes among victims \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Follow live", "author": "Rafqa Touma", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T05:10:47Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080014", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1083383cc591f750864a427c5f8c7c3a522bc6bb/0_0_3197_1919/500.jpg", "body": "We\u2019ll be wrapping up the live blog coverage of the Hunter Valley bus crash today \u2013 here are the day\u2019s developments: NSW Police confirmed that 10 people are deceased \u2013 nine at the scene, and one later in hospital.

The tragedy will be doubly hard to take for her colleagues at the hospital, based in Newcastle, where some of those injured in the crash are being treated. The state\u2019s health minister, Ryan Park, said news that NSW Health had lost one of its own made a dark day even darker. Park said: Our focus now is on putting all of our support around her family, loved ones and her friends. This has made a very dark day even darker for New South Wales Health. We\u2019ve lost one of our own, someone who was obviously going to have a long and illustrious career in medicine has been taken way too early and on behalf of the New South Wales community, obviously the premier and myself, I express our deepest condolences to her family, her friends and her loved ones on what it will be a very, very, very sad day in a very very sad weeks and months ahead. We\u2019ve just seen Button\u2019s supporters who arrived earlier now leave the court house with a piece of paper and take the pathway which will lead them to the front of the police station. Brett Button set to exit police station The modern silver Cessnock police station is directly behind the old brown brick pillared courthouse, connected through the short covered passage Brett Andrew Button passed through this morning. Media is waiting behind the police station, where we believe Button will soon be exiting through its big black gates. We\u2019ve seen Button\u2019s supporters return to the courthouse so we\u2019re expecting him to be released on bail shortly. Within 45 minutes of the first emergency call, NSW Ambulance commander Luke Wiseman was at the Hunter Valley crash scene, AAP reports. \u201cIt was a complex operation,\u201d he told Sydney radio station 2GB today. \u201cUnfortunately, as we all know, not everyone could be released.\u201d Emergency service workers smashed the front windscreen and used airbags to elevate the bus to free survivors. Multiple people were on the bus and emergency services were \u201creally, really pressured\u201d. The isolated location made it more challenging. Helicopters were unable to land close by due to the thickening fog. Wiseman said one of the first arriving on the scene was a young paramedic undergoing training. \u201cShe had just completed her duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was within the first 15 minutes of her drive home that she actually came across the incident.\u201d Speaking outside Cessnock police station after a bus crash that killed 10 people and injured more than 20, New South Wales police superintendent David Waddell says 14 of those injured remain in hospital. Watch the full video here: Bus driver \u2018happy to be going home\u2019, says lawyer Brett Button\u2019s lawyer, Chris O\u2019Brien, told reporters leaving the court that his client was \u201chappy to be going home\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s doing OK under the circumstances ... In all of the circumstances he\u2019s holding up well.\u201d Sydney Women\u2019s AFL Masters community \u2018shocked and saddened\u2019 The Sydney Women\u2019s AFL Masters social competition said its community was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the deaths of Nadene McBride and her daughter Kyah, who both played their football in Singleton. Our thoughts and sympathy extend to all the friends, families and team mates of Nads and Kyah and the Singleton football community. Please reach out to each other for support. \u2018We adored him\u2019: statement issued on behalf of family of Kane \u2018Superman\u2019 Symons The Carlton Park Surf Life Saving Club, based in Tasmania, has issued a statement on behalf of the family of Kane Symons, who was among those on the bus. President Christine Gaby said: CPSLSC are heartbroken to hear of the tragic passing of Kane Symons in the Hunter Valley bus tragedy. We send our love and support to Steve, Sarn and Jaimie. Kane, otherwise known as \u2018Superman\u2019 was an amazing athlete who competed at the highest level. But more than that he was a leader, a great bloke and a mate to many. We adored him and he will be truly missed. Symons was also a footballer playing in Singleton at the time of the crash and had been named in the AFL Hunter Central Coast men\u2019s squad just four days ago. His girlfriend, Kyah McBride, had been named in the same team\u2019s women\u2019s squad on the same day. She is also among those unaccounted for. Friends and sporting clubs are paying tribute to the victims of the Hunter Valley\u2019s horror bus crash, which included a mother and daughter from nearby Singleton, a young athlete described as \u201ca great bloke and a mate to many\u201d, and a former footballer with \u201ca big heart and willingness to help anyone\u201d. Their respective football and lifesaving clubs issued statements via their Facebook pages overnight, paying tribute to Nadene McBride and her daughter Kyah, footballers from nearby Singleton, Kane Symons, a local footballer and lifesaver previously from Tasmania, and former footballer Andrew Scott and his wife Lynan Scott, from Queensland. Queensland\u2019s Redland-Victoria Point Sharks Football Club described Andrew Scott, known as Chisel, as a \u201cterrific member of our community both on and off the field\u201d. The football community is mourning the loss of former player Andrew Scott and wife Lynan who passed away in the Hunter Valley this week. Chisel, as he was known, played for the Bombers in 2014 alongside his brother Luke. He also was a longtime player at QAFL level with Mt Gravatt where he was part of the Vultures\u2019 2007 Premeirship team. He was a terrific member of our community both on and off the field and was characterised by his big heart and willingness to help anyone. Driver\u2019s release delayed while family collect passport for surrendering Button\u2019s release has been delayed because family have to get his passport, which he has been asked to give up, and the driver lives 40 minutes away. Driver\u2019s family visibly distressed while leaving courtroom Button\u2019s family sat in the gallery in court during his hearing, hanging on every word being spoke, often biting their lips, one member with his elbows leaning against the rail clasping his hands. They would not have been able to see Button who was in the box which had a large wooden frame, blocking the view of the accused from the gallery. Despite Button being granted bail, the family were visibly distressed leaving the courtroom, with at least two female members of the family crying. Magistrate considered driver\u2019s children and medical concerns when granting bail In granting bail, magistrate Robyn Richardson considered Button\u2019s need to provide family support to his two children. Richardson also considered the defence\u2019s medical concerns for Button. She said she was mindful of Button\u2019s medical needs, including an impending doctor\u2019s appointment. Magistrate lays out bail conditions Brett Andrew Button has been granted bail in Cessnock courthouse. Magistrate Robyn Richardson granted the bail on conditions that Button: be under curfew from 8pm \u2013 6am report to police three times a week surrender his passport not occupy the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle, noting his licence had already been suspended not apply for travel documents not drink alcohol or take non-prescription drugs Richardson noted despite the strong prosecution case \u201cbail should not be denied as a punishment\u201d. Richardson said: It\u2019s clear to this court he suffers along with the rest of the community ... I see before me a man suffering. The driver of the wedding bus which crashed in the Hunter Valley and killed 10 has been granted bail. Fifty-eight-year-old Brett Button will be released. Driver appears in Cessnock courthouse The accused sits with his bald head bowed for most of his appearance in court. His handcuffed hands are clasped in his lap as he sits in the barred wooden box in the centre of the Cessnock\u2019s courthouse. He only occasionally looks over his glasses at the magistrate who will decide if he will receive bail. He is wearing a black hoodie and black pants. He occasionally shuffles his black rubber-soled shoes. Mayor says Singleton community struggling to come to terms with tragedy Sue Moore, mayor of Singleton Shire Council, says the community is struggling to come to terms with the deaths of locals in the Hunter Valley bus crash. I understand seven of the victims are from Singleton - so, struggling still, coming to terms with it. The wider community as well as the families, obviously. The wedding couple. The people that are still in hospital with injuries. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s just so widespread. You don\u2019t know which angle to go at first. Road laws in New South Wales require all bus passengers to use seatbelts if the vehicle is fitted with them, but experts say compliance is a grey area and question whether belts could have prevented all 10 deaths in Sunday\u2019s Hunter Valley crash. Read the full story by Elias Visontay here: Community gather outside Cessnock courthouse The media and community members are gathering outside Cessnock courthouse. The small regional courthouse is full and people are being turned away. The driver of the wedding bus, Brett Button, will be led from Cessnock police station through the tunnel connected to the courthouse just behind. The community members are largely silent, standing arms folded and hands in pockets. Here are some shots from the latest press conference by Guardian Australia\u2019s Mike Bowers, who has been on the ground in the Hunter with Natasha May. PM describes bus crash as a \u2018tragedy beyond belief\u2019 Prime minister Anthony Albanese says the Hunter Valley bus crash is a \u201ctragedy beyond belief\u201d in conversation with James Valentine on ABC Sydney Breakfast Radio this morning. It\u2019s just such a horrific incident to occur. People associate weddings with love and lifelong commitments and celebrations with family and friends. And for it to end in this horrific tragedy, with so many deaths, so many injuries \u2026 Of course, the scars will last for such a long, long period of time. It is going to be very difficult for the communities involved, the two sporting teams involved as well. It is just a tragedy beyond belief. Support for Hunter community must continue long after crash, premier says More from Chris Minns on ABC News this morning. The NSW premier says support for the community must continue \u201conce the immediate glare\u201d of the Hunter Valley bus crash \u201cmoves on\u201d. It doesn\u2019t happen everyday and this is one of the worst accidents the state has seen in decades. I am really focused on ensuring that once the immediate glare of this terrible, terrible tragedy moves on, that the government and the community is still there for those who need it and the immediate responsibility is to help families that have lost a loved one, support our emergency service workers and heal those that are still in hospital. There\u2019s still 14 people who are in hospitals across the Hunter and in Sydney. We need to get them back on their feet as soon as possible. Bus driver driving in a manner \u2018inconsistent with the conditions\u2019 Superintendent David Waddell alleges the 58-year-old male driver of the bus was driving in a manner \u201cinconsistent with the conditions\u201d. Waddell alleges the driver \u201centered that roundabout driving in a manner that was inconsistent with the conditions\u201d. He alleges that \u201cthe speed was too quick for him to negotiate that roundabout, causing the vehicle to fall on to its left side and cause those injuries\u201d. The bus driver, identified as Brett Andrew Button in court listing released this morning, was refused bail and will face Cessnock local court at 9am today. Seatbelts \u2018legally required\u2019 if bus is fitted with them, premier says NSW premier Chris Minns says \u201claw changes\u201d to do with safety on buses have been recommended. We will be in constant communication with New South Wales police, there\u2019s recommendation made to us about law changes in relation to safety on buses or coaches or in cars and vans in NSW, we\u2019ll of course take action. Minns says if there are seatbelts on coaches in NSW, \u201cyou are legally responsible to wear them\u201d. I\u2019m not going to comment of the last 24 hours, but obviously those inquiries are ongoing. It\u2019s always the driver of the vehicle whose responsibility it is to ensure that there\u2019s enforcement with the law and to re-enforce the point. If there\u2019s seatbelts on a coach or a bus, you are legally required to wear them. \u2018This is going to be a traumatic few weeks,\u2019 says NSW premier NSW premier Chris Minns tells ABC News there was an influx of trauma patients to John Hunter hospital in the middle of Sunday night. I was at John Hunter hospital yesterday speaking to the emergency department there that had to deal with obviously an influx of trauma patients in the middle of the night on Sunday night. This is going to be a traumatic few weeks, perhaps even worse than the initial shock of learning of the disaster on Sunday night. One patient in a critical but stable condition A NSW Health spokesperson has confirmed that, as of 6am today, one patient from the Hunter Valley bus crash is in a critical but stable condition. Eight patients are in a stable condition at John Hunter hospital, two patients are in a stable condition at Maitland hospital, and two patients are in a stable condition at Royal Prince Alfred hospital. Another patient is in stable condition at Calvary Mater Newcastle. \u201cNSW Health extends its deepest sympathies to the families, friends and loved ones of those who died and were injured in a bus crash in the state\u2019s Hunter region,\u201d the spokesperson says. Cessnock City Council mayor Jay Suvaal says the community of the Hunter Valley bus crash are in a state of shock. It\u2019s still a bit of a state of shock, waking up yesterday to the horrible news that we saw. And today we\u2019re now waking up to learn more about the victims involved and sadly knowing that quite a number of them are actually from our neighbouring community of Singleton. So, that sort of makes it even more devastating. We are a really close-knit community. Suvaal tells ABC News Breakfast he has worked with the mayor of Singleton \u201cto make sure that both of our communities are supported during this difficult time\u201d. Drop-in clinics are available at the Singleton youth venue from 9am, and at the Branxton Community Hall from 10am, today. Disaster recovery officers and chaplains will be providing mental health support, \u201cwhich is really needed here\u201d, Suvaal says. \u201cPeople will be able to just come in, that have been affected by this, and talk to someone.\u201d Identifying victims to take \u2018the next few days\u2019 Superintendent David Waddell says the process of identifying victims will take \u201cthe next few days\u201d: We\u2019ll work through that disaster victim identification process over the next few days. Our investigators, our family liaison officers, are speaking to the families and the victims. We are in contact. That process will continue throughout the investigation and throughout the court process. Police to conduct mechanical investigation of bus A crime scene investigation is under way at the site of the crash in Cessnock. Superintendent David Waddell confirms a mechanical investigation of the bus will be conducted today. We\u2019ll conduct a mechanical investigation of the vehicle today \u2026 The whole conditions will be examined as part of the investigation. The vehicle was removed late last night. Superintendent David Waddell confirms there were no children on the bus. We\u2019ve got people in the range from 20s to 60s, males to females, local and interstate, as you expect, when people travel far for a funeral \u2013 sorry, for a wedding. Superintendent David Waddell describes the scene in Cessnock as traumatic: Some of our police are visibly distraught. It was a very chaotic scene. Obviously we have good processes and as the emergency services comes together we have worked well and it\u2019s been a very thorough investigation and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But at the time, the initial response, was quite chaotic for those attending police and other emergency services. It\u2019s a traumatic event for all the family, all the friends, from what was a wedding, where people come from wide and far. NSW police are addressing the press at Cessnock this morning. Superintendent David Waddell confirms that 10 people are deceased \u2013 nine at the scene, and one later died in hospital. \u201cI see there\u2019s been speculation about the identity of those 10 persons,\u201d Waddell says. \u201cWe cannot confirm the identity of those 10 victims.\u201d A total of 25 people were taken to hospital. 12 of those people have since been released. There are still have 14 in hospital. Two are in ICU. Two people at RPA have had surgeries. \u201cThe injuries range from lacerations to breaks and fractures. There\u2019s minor injuries to very serious injuries with two in ICU.\u201d Jess Wishart and her two children came home early from their long weekend camping trip at Lake Liddell. Wishart said it \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel right\u201d staying any longer after waking up to the news that 10 people had died in a wedding bus crash near their home town of Branxton. Another local Georgia Bainbridge was up late on Sunday night watching a movie when she heard \u201call the sirens and all the commotion going on\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who was involved in the accident, who\u2019s hurt, who\u2019s not, you know \u2013 but so many people are already reaching out to everyone, sending their love, sending condolences.\u201d Bainbridge and Wishart came to lay flowers on Monday afternoon at the roundabout where the crash occurred. Read the full story from Natasha May here: Premier: \u2018Everyone was doing the right thing\u2019 which adds to the devastation More from the NSW premier, Chris Minns, on Sunrise: The organisers of this wedding did exactly the right thing. They had a destination wedding, they had a bus on hand so people wouldn\u2019t drink and drive or be tempted to drink and drive. Everyone was doing the right thing here and many people have lost their lives. I think that adds to the devastation that people are feeling this morning. Minns says the tight-knit communities of Singleton and Cessnock are \u201cgoing to need a hand from the state and the community\u201d. An emergency response centre for counselling is being set up in Singleton, and trauma counsellors and NSW Health workers will be at the centre from 9am this morning. \u201c\u2026 Many people have lost their lives and this is a terrible accident in a community that\u2019s generally known as a place of happiness and joy, the Hunter Valley.\u201d The NSW premier Chris Minns addresses the Hunter Valley bus crash on Sunrise this morning: Certainly we haven\u2019t seen it in many decades in NSW and it\u2019s a trauma that will last, unfortunately. Minns describes \u201csevere trauma in Greta and Cessnock yesterday afternoon\u201d. He says some emergency service workers first on the scene had been working from midnight, and had been asked to go home by their commanders but they weren\u2019t leaving until the job had been completed. That won\u2019t surprise many people, they know exactly what our firefighters, ambulance officers and police officers are made of. Mitchell Gaffney and Maddy Edsell had a \u201cbeautiful ceremony\u201d, hours before a bus carrying weddings guests who attended overturned on the Hunter expressway. Read the full report by Christopher Knaus and Caitlin Cassidy here: After Sunday night\u2019s tragic wedding bus crash in the Hunter Valley, stunned locals are still anxiously waiting for details of how the accident occurred and official confirmation of who was among the victims. The driver of the bus, a 58-year-old man from Maitland, will appear in court in Cessnock this morning charged with 10 counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The Guardian will be in court and will have the details as they emerge. We are also expecting a police press conference within the next few hours with the latest updates.

About a third of the population are convinced that the cost of living crisis is a government plot to control the public, and similar numbers think \u201c15-minute cities\u201d \u2013 an attempt to increase walking in neighbourhoods \u2013 are a government surveillance ruse, and that the \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d \u2013 the idea that white people are being replaced by non-white immigrants \u2013 is happening. The findings, on the eve of the first evidence session of the UK\u2019s public inquiry into the pandemic, which killed more than 227,000 people in the UK, come from an April survey by Savanta for King\u2019s College London (KCL) and the BBC. It found beliefs were shared through social media \u2013 most commonly YouTube and Facebook \u2013 and fuelled by websites including 21st Century Wire, The Light, The Expos\u00e9 and Breitbart, the last of which was run by Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser Steve Bannon. One in seven people \u2013 about 6 million adults \u2013 believe violence is a fair response to some alleged conspiracies. The general public underestimates the number of conspiracy theorists by approximately 4 million adults, according to the researchers who uncovered what they described as \u201cshocking\u201d attitudes. \u201cProtest is a key part of a healthy democracy and people will have sometimes legitimate concerns about the motivations behind government and others\u2019 actions, but it\u2019s worrying that around one in seven say that violence would be acceptable in protests against, for example, government digital currencies or 15-minute cities,\u201d said Prof Bobby Duffy, the director of the Policy Institute at KCL. Social media are the most likely places for people to first encounter conspiracy theories but people who read publications such as The Light were much more likely to believe in conspiracies than the wider population. Headlines in a recent edition of the UK-based publication include \u201cClimate CO2 hoax \u2013 how bankers hijacked the real environment movement\u201d and \u201cControl over money will end in total slavery\u201d. Conspiracy theories often develop out of real-world problems and anxieties. For example, rising interest rates and inflation, which reduce affluence and leave families struggling, can fuel a belief that powerful forces are plotting to deliberately impoverish certain sections of society. \u201cThese findings underline the importance of conspiracy theories in explaining how many people understand politics and the events which shape their lives,\u201d said Dr Rod Dacombe, a reader in politics in the department of political economy at KCL. \u201cFor some people, conspiracy theories provide the main focus of political participation and the primary means through which they understand what is going on in the world.\u201d Nineteen per cent of people in the survey said it was true or probably true that \u201cthe UK government carried out the 2005 attacks on the underground in London to encourage support for war in the Middle East\u201d, and 18% said it was definitely or probably true that \u201cthe Manchester Arena attack involved \u2018crisis actors\u2019 who pretended to be injured or killed \u2013 people weren\u2019t really killed or injured\u201d. Three out of 10 people thought the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d initiative announced by the World Economic Forum in 2020 was a conspiracy to impose a totalitarian world government. Between a fifth and a quarter of people \u2013 8 million to 10 million adults \u2013 said they would protest against the introduction of central bank digital currencies, a \u201cdeep state\u201d of military, intelligence and government officials who try to secretly manipulate government policy, \u201c15-minute cities\u201d and against vaccines.

Adamson recalled the \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d when the virus got into her father\u2019s care home. \u201cThey weren\u2019t getting any of the testing at the time \u2013 the tests were being diverted to the NHS or PPE supplies,\u201d said Adamson, a nurse, NHS manager and adviser on regulation. The problem seemed structural. The manager told her: \u201cYou know Jane, we\u2019re very much the poor relation [to the NHS].\u201d The care home struggled for staff as people were discharged into it from hospital and more agency workers were used. \u201cThey were ill-prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cThe infection control practices were inadequate.\u201d The pandemic \u201creally sharpened the focus\u201d on how social care had been treated less well by the government for years, she said. By the end of 2020, 15 residents at Aldrick\u2019s home were dead from Covid. Like Adamson, many of the bereaved have a dual perspective on the UK\u2019s preparedness as they also work in health and social care. Several wanted to give evidence but have not been summoned, so they must watch on. For Dr Saleyha Ahsan \u2013 who worked in intensive care during the pandemic and lost her 81-year-old father, Ahsan-ul-Haq Chaudry, to the virus \u2013 a key witness is Hunt, now chancellor. His decision as health secretary to impose a new contract on junior doctors in 2016 dealt a \u201cdevastating blow to the morale and to the workforce\u201d, she said. \u201cThe contract has made life that much harder for doctors,\u201d she said. \u201cEven before the pandemic started, you had a workforce that was already demoralised, already exhausted. The impact that has had on recruitment and retention is devastating. Someone needs to join the dots on that.\u201d The inquiry is freighted with emotion for many. Bereavement for Ahsan has been \u201cdifferent, because it\u2019s been really associated with the search for the truth of what the hell went wrong\u201d. News stories about the inquiry are \u201cre-triggering\u201d and she says that every time she hears the latest twist in the dispute over Boris Johnson\u2019s WhatsApp messages \u201cI\u2019m back in the room with my dad\u201d as he died. She wanted to testify on the UK\u2019s preparedness based on her pre-pandemic experience in the army medical corps and as an NHS doctor, but has not been called. PPE training for nuclear, chemical and biological attacks was routine in the army but there was nothing similar in the NHS for a pandemic or epidemic. Neither were medics aware of the findings of government pandemic planning exercises. The NHS was \u201cwholly unprepared\u201d, she said. \u201cWe\u2019d had bird flu and we\u2019d had Ebola,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely someone somewhere should have sat there and thought: \u2018this is inching closer, we\u2019ve now got to get this into our training,\u2019 but no one did.\u201d Stuart Tuckwood, a former nurse who went back to help in intensive care in a major hospital in southern England when the pandemic hit, will also follow the inquiry closely. Those months struggling with the sickest patients are an \u201cextremely traumatising time to look back on\u201d, he said. \u201cI remember one long night in intensive care when I was working with support from the military in a room with three or four extremely sick people with only myself, a volunteer doctor who hadn\u2019t worked in a hospital for a long time, a nurse who had recently arrived from another country who was only just getting used to the NHS and a children\u2019s nurse who had been redeployed,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these issues were there in the run-up to Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a surprise that we were in such a terrible situation. We had problems with staffing levels and burnout and losing people for years in the run-up to Covid and the government just wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d Tuckwood, who now works for the Unison trade union, described \u201ctaping up the gowns to the gloves, putting on masks, visors, goggles, doing our best to protect ourselves\u201d. They didn\u2019t want to waste potentially scarce PPE by continually changing it so \u201cwe were dehydrating ourselves \u2026 to try and get through as long as we could\u201d. Martina Ferguson will be flying over from Northern Ireland to be in the inquiry room on Tuesday. Twice daily, for eight years, she visited her mother, Ursula Derry, in a Portadown care home. Then came the \u201cunimaginable heartbreak\u201d of lockdown. Continuing the visits at her window was \u201ctraumatic\u201d. \u201cEmotions were deeply disturbed,\u201d she said. Aghast at the injustice of separation she quickly started lobbying politicians, Northern Ireland\u2019s human rights commissioner and even Johnson, but to no avail. \u201cWhy did we get this wrong, so badly wrong?\u201d she said. \u201cI think there have been lots of failures. Why did we not lock down the borders sooner? What about the track and trace \u2013 we spent a huge amount of money and that didn\u2019t work. I think there are failures around the public purse. \u201cI am representing my mummy every step of the way in this public inquiry and I want to find out: was my mummy treated fairly?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she was.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/13/covid-inquiry-uk-hearings-what-when-where", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "What will the Covid inquiry look at \u2013 and when will we get answers?", "lead": "Independent inquiry begins hearing evidence on Tuesday \u2013 but is not due to conclude until 2026", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T05:00:42Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080022", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cd838bd7bccb9c0a3f9f8d1127b1c2aa3759db02/0_127_3289_1973/500.jpg", "body": "The official public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of Covid is due to begin in earnest this week. But what will it focus on, who will give evidence and how much will it cost? Here is a guide to where we stand at the beginning of what is likely to be years of forensic examination. Who is in charge? The inquiry chair is Lady Heather Hallett, a former appeal court judge who acted as coroner at the inquest into the London bombings of 7 July 2005. She is running an independent inquiry established by Boris Johnson, then prime minister, under the Inquiries Act. That means she can compel the production of documents and call witnesses to give evidence under oath. She will preside alone, rather than with fellow panellists, after a decision by Johnson to avoid delay. Hugo Keith KC, the counsel to the inquiry, is chief inquisitor. The Oxford-educated barrister, described in the Chambers legal guide as \u201cone of the best inquest silks on the market\u201d, previously represented the late Queen at the inquest into the death of Princess Diana, Rebekah Brooks at the Leveson Inquiry and Boris Berezovsky at the inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko. What will the inquiry examine? The overarching themes are \u201cthe UK\u2019s response to and impact of\u201d the pandemic and \u201cwhat lessons can be learned\u201d. But Hallett will break these into modules. Four have been formally opened: resilience and preparedness, core UK decision-making and political governance, impact of the pandemic on healthcare and vaccines and therapeutics. These hearings will probably run until the end of 2024, at which point a general election is expected. Further modules on procurement, including PPE, and social care will run in the first half of 2025, leaving another year to cover test and trace, education, children and young people, financial support for business, jobs and the self employed, funding of public services and the voluntary sector, and benefits and support for vulnerable people. The inquiry\u2019s final modules will investigate the pandemic\u2019s impact and inequalities in the context of public services \u2013 including key workers \u2013 and in the context of businesses. What about the devolved nations? A separate inquiry is under way in Scotland and the two chairs have agreed to regular coordination to limit duplication. Hallett\u2019s UK-wide inquiry will conduct its own hearings on government decision-making in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on road trips next year. Who will the inquiry hear from? As many as 70 witnesses will contribute to the first module on pandemic preparedness, starting on Thursday with Prof Jimmy Whitworth and Dr Charlotte Hammer, experts in infectious diseases, epidemiology and public health. If the inquiry continues at that rate, Hallett may have called 1,000 people before she is finished. At least three prime ministers (David Cameron, Johnson and Rishi Sunak), numerous cabinet ministers, senior civil servants and Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, the chief medical and scientific officers during the pandemic, are among likely witnesses. Each module has different \u201ccore participants\u201d, legally represented at the inquiry. There are 27 such organisations or individuals in the first section, 39 in the second and so on. They range from government departments to universities, trade unions and campaign groups. Covid bereaved groups are represented but are not being asked to give evidence as much as they would like. How will bereaved people and the public have a say? The inquiry has set up a listening exercise called \u201cEvery Story Matters\u201d. A total of 6,000 people have so far completed an online form telling their stories, but Hallett wants more and is drumming up interest with TV, print and social media advertising. Responses will be analysed by \u201cspecialist researchers\u201d who will also apply computerised artificial intelligence \u201cto make sure we are not missing trends or key insights\u201d and \u201chelp reduce human bias\u201d. Summarised and anonymised responses will be turned into themed reports, submitted into each relevant investigation as evidence. The inquiry is also planning \u201ccommunity listening events\u201d across the UK, so people can share their story in person with members of the inquiry team. Where will it happen? Mostly in London at hearing rooms in Paddington previously used for the Grenfell Tower public inquiry. With so many witnesses and core participants space will be tight and the bereaved are frustrated at the lack of room for more than a few people in the main hearing room. Hallett said \u201cwe couldn\u2019t find a venue that was perfect, available for the time that we shall need it, and that would not cost the taxpayer an exorbitant sum of money\u201d. Every minute will be streamed on YouTube. When do we get answers? Hearings are due to conclude in summer 2026, although public inquiry timetables are prone to slippage. So final analysis may not come until later that year or even 2027. However, Hallett wants to issue reports on each module as she goes. She hopes to publish reports on preparedness and resilience and core decision making during 2024. Who is paying? Even before the first witness is sworn in, the inquiry has spent \u00a323m, while it and several government departments have issued long-term contracts for around \u00a3126m, according to Tussell, a company that monitors government contracts. Large sums are being spent to digitally manage the avalanche of written evidence. Core participants can apply for state funding for legal representation. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group is understood to be funded, whereas the Trades Union Congress is not. The cost to the taxpayer will probably reach into hundreds of millions of pounds."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/13/whos-that-busker-on-the-streets-of-nairobi-only-the-world-famous-cellist-yo-yo-ma", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "title": "Who\u2019s that busker on the streets of Nairobi?

Yet playing today in front of stalls where butchers roast meat and hairdressers compete over heads to braid is a very surprising busker: the distinguished cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Playing Over the Rainbow alongside Kenyan percussionist Kasiva Mutua, he matches his cello to her beats in a truly eclectic mix. Ma\u2019s broad artistic sensibilities make weaving together the diverse musical traditions of drum and cello seem like a natural fit. \u201cIt was symbolic to introduce [classical] music to the crowd through something they know and understand,\u201d says Mutua. \u201cAfricans understand rhythm to their core.\u201d Ma\u2019s pop-up market performance typifies much of his visit in the city over the last week \u2013 a daring, headfirst dive into the realities of Kenyan artists. He bashfully makes occasional use of Sheng \u2013 a Nairobi slang that plays on words from English and Swahili, and he arrives at the market in a matatu \u2013 the music-blaring, graffiti-covered buses that millions in the city rely on to get around. Mutua says such symbolism bridges perceived gaps. \u201cClassical music has a class \u2013 no pun intended. It is seen to belong to a type of people,\u201d she says. With Ma\u2019s unassuming manner, there is little to let on that he is a 19-time Grammy award-winning internationally-renowned musician who has played on the world\u2019s largest stages. Nairobi is Ma\u2019s last stop of his Bach Project \u2013 a five-year, six-continent global tour. With its rising cultural and artistic scene, organisers say the city was near the top of the cellist\u2019s list. The project marked Ma\u2019s ambition to connect cultures and people across the world, performing Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s cello suites in 36 countries \u2013 a nod to the much celebrated six cello suites (which he calls his \u201cconstant musical companions\u201d), each of which has six sections. It is one of the cellist\u2019s most significant undertakings in recent years. Bach\u2019s cello suites were not well known by the time of the composer\u2019s death in 1750. They began to resurface nearly a century later, and were brought to prominence in the 1930s when Pablo Casals, one of the world\u2019s most highly regarded cellists, performed and recorded the neglected suites. Ma has recorded interpretations of the suites three times, with more than a decade between each. They are wrapped up with his life\u2019s memories, he has said, citing his first encounter with Bach\u2019s music when he was four: his father, Dr Hiao-Tsiun Ma, taught him the first suite in small, incremental steps with exceptional dedication. Ma Sr, who lived in both China and France, had turned to Bach\u2019s music for refuge during the second world war, memorising the sonatas and partitas over the long days, to play them to himself at night. \u201cFor almost six decades, they have given me sustenance, comfort and joy during times of stress, celebration and loss,\u201d Ma wrote at the start of the Bach Project in 2018. What power does this music possess that even today, after 300 years, it continues to help us navigate through troubled times?\u201d. Beyond busking, Ma takes to a more conventional stage with a concert at the Kenya national theatre. His audience now is a classical crowd \u2013 the \u00a3114 auditorium tickets sold out in 24 hours \u2013 with prominent members including the arts minister, Ababu Namwamba, and the US ambassador, Meg Whitman. He tells the audience: \u201cAll I had to offer was this music in me,\u201d explaining how he used culture to thrive under difficult conditions. He says he wants to celebrate ordinary people, and the project has been a \u201clistening and learning\u201d tour to that end. Ma plays as though he is the only person in the room. Only the loud applause breaks through to him, earning his bow and embrace of the audience, arms flung wide. The solemn, lonely fifth cello suite \u2013 his penultimate performance \u2013 makes the auditorium fall silent. From a viewing room on the upper balcony, Brian Kivuti, a 34-year-old Kenyan jeweller, listens with closed eyes. \u201cFor me, it was a practice in presence,\u201d says Kivuti. \u201cThere are no lyrics telling you how to feel. It\u2019s just the music and you, feeling your way through, so you pay more attention to how the notes make you feel.\u201d Kivuti, more accustomed to the \u201cemotional bombardment\u201d of an orchestra, says elements of the music were \u201cvery European\u201d, and it took him time to adjust. \u201cWhen I started to listen with my body, I could feel notes of hope, the quiet of a Sunday morning, the dizziness of preparing for a party. The rise and fall of the notes allow you to tap into more than just everyday feelings.\u201d At the theatre\u2019s Wasanii restaurant, workers perched on rooftop balcony seats to watch a screening of the performance. For Margaret Wanjiru, a 22-year-old waitress, Ma\u2019s music is a far cry from what she knows, such as her tribe\u2019s Mugiithi. \u201cIt may not be the music I grew up with, but it slows you down, however much you\u2019re busy, and allows you to get lost in your thoughts.\u201d The Nairobi Orchestra, one of the oldest in Africa, performs ahead of Ma\u2019s set, and its musicians are thrilled to have him in the auditorium. Violinist Bernadette Muthoni says: \u201cFor me, it was very huge to think that Ma was going to play just a few metres from where we were. He\u2019s what a lot of us aspire to.\u201d Ma\u2019s evening performance is followed by a \u201cday of action\u201d where he engages directly with communities. He explores the Kenyan capital accompanied by local artists, taking to the streets with Dennis Muraguri, a Kenyan visual artist who documents matatu culture through camera and prints. Ma also visits the Real Vinyl Guru, a record store run by James Rugami, who collects Kenyan music dating back to the 40s. At the Kaloleni Social Hall, a place of great postcolonial symbolism, Ma walks in on a performance by the Ghetto Classics, a music programme for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them,\u201d says Sharon Machira, a Kenyan creator, who accompanies the cellist on the tour. Watching Ma, who started his musical journey early and became a child prodigy, she thinks he may have seen his younger self through them. \u201cI think he really identifies with \u2018the other\u2019, because everything he does is about breaking down barriers,\u201d she says. Later there will be a visit to the Kakuma refugee camp, home to more than 200,000 people, for a music collaboration with artists from South Sudan, Burundi, the DRC and Ethiopia. Ma is increasingly interested in using his work for social impact. He played outside the Russian Embassy in Washington DC last year to protest against its war in Ukraine, and dedicated his Songs of Comfort to providing solace for people during the difficult days of the pandemic. The Bach Project, and its conclusion last week in Nairobi, are another milestone on that journey."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/13/uk-exports-record-worse-than-any-g7-country-except-japan-in-last-decade", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "UK exports in last decade worse than any G7 country except Japan", "lead": "UN figures show value of British goods and services exports rose by 6% between 2012 and 2021, compared with 29.1% for EU", "author": "Daniel Boffey Chief reporter", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T05:00:41Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080026", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1982bcf7df45e07ac90242028f33af8243c22c72/11_133_2580_1549/500.jpg", "body": "Britain has endured the worst exports record of any member of the G7 besides Japan over the last decade, according to a new analysis that will raise pressure on the government to reconsider its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. As most of the world\u2019s other major seven economies have rebounded from the pandemic, export growth has remained sluggish in the UK at a time when businesses trading with the EU faced extra red tape and costs as a result of the country leaving the bloc. Figures from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) show that the UK\u2019s goods and services exports had a value of \u00a3813bn in 2012 and rose by just 6% to \u00a3862.6bn by 2021. That compares with the double-digit increases enjoyed by Canada (10.2%), France (16.1%), Germany (22.7%), Italy (15.9%) and the US (13.8%). The EU\u2019s 27 member states as a whole enjoyed a 29.1% increase in the value of their exports in the same period. The value of UK exports in 2019, before the pandemic, was \u00a3881.6bn, around \u00a320bn higher than the figure posted in 2021, according to an analysis of the UNCTAD figures provided by the House of Commons library. Only Japan, which has been particularly exposed to a drop in demand from China as it has become increasingly self-sufficient in goods such as cars, car parts and steel, posted worse results than the UK, with the value of trade rising by just 0.5% from \u00a3912.2bn in 2012 to \u00a3917.5bn in 2021. The trade and cooperation agreement the UK struck with the EU after years of wrangling is up for review in 2024. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said that a government led by him would seek better terms of trade, although he has limited the scope of any changes by ruling out rejoining the single market or negotiating a new customs union. There have been repeated complaints from business leaders about a range of post-Brexit obstacles to trading with the EU and the lack of effort by the UK government in seeking to address them. Most recently, three of the world\u2019s largest carmakers, Vauxhall, Jaguar Land Rover and Ford, told the government that it needed to renegotiate with the EU to change post-Brexit rules due to come in next year that they say threaten UK electric vehicle production. In its most recent forecast, the Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected the weakness in UK overall trade to persist for the next two years, with export volumes forecast to fall by 6.6% in 2023 and by 0.3% in 2024. The shadow trade minister Gareth Thomas said that the disappointing growth in exports over the last decade was a direct result of the extra burdens on businesses exporting into Europe, which remains the country\u2019s biggest market. He said: \u201cIn the last decade the Tories have failed to deliver on key trade targets, have cut support to businesses wanting to win new export contracts and have made trade with key allies more difficult. \u201cA Labour government will ensure our trade policy delivers for the British people and enables our businesses to grow and prosper, with our mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade did not provide an explanation for the comparatively poor performance over the last decade but provided a figure from the Office of National Statistics to suggest that exports were up year on year. The government also pointed to the more healthy export results in services, such as finance, where trade is less dependent on the EU than in goods. Around 36% of services exports are made into the bloc compared with 47% of goods exports. A government spokesperson said: \u201cIn the 12 months to March 2023 the value of UK exports were up 24% in current prices and services exports reached a record high of \u00a3415bn. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that appetite for world-class UK goods and services continues to grow globally, and we\u2019ll keep supporting these fantastic businesses in their exporting journey, helping to create more jobs, pay higher wages and grow the economy.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/13/gillian-anderson-and-stanley-tucci-back-calls-to-rescue-british-families-in-syria", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Gillian Anderson and Stanley Tucci back calls to rescue British families in Syria", "lead": "Estimated 60 children among those trapped in detention camps since Islamic State collapse", "author": "Diane Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T05:00:41Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080030", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/615c1d883b80c95524b75a3351c86f7e7482be8f/0_144_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "A group of celebrities including Olivia Colman, Stephen Fry and Gillian Anderson have called on ministers to rescue and bring home British families trapped in detention camps in north-east Syria. The stars, along with various NGOs including War Child UK and Human Rights Watch, the Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi and several national security experts, have signed an open letter to the UK government appealing for the rescue of approximately 25 British families, including an estimated 60 children most of whom are under 10 years old, who are languishing in the camps. The families have been detained there for almost four years after the collapse of Islamic State. \u201cThese British families have been abandoned by their government and live in squalid conditions where they are exposed daily to life-threatening violence, disease and other deprivations,\u201d the letter states. \u201cYoung British boys and girls are growing up in this dangerous environment with very limited access to education, sufficient food, clean water and shelter and medical care.\u201d Since 2019, at least 38 countries have repatriated or allowed home some or many of their nationals, including, in the last year alone, France, Spain, Australia, Canada, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The US has brought almost all of its citizens home. The signatories of the letter \u2013 who also include the actors Riz Ahmed, Stanley Tucci and Jonathan Pryce \u2013 accuse the UK of \u201creneging on its human rights obligations, abdicating responsibility for its citizens and risking damage to its global reputation\u201d. A report last year from the all party parliamentary group on trafficked Britons to Syria found that British women and children detained in camps in north-east Syria had been trafficked to the country against their will. In February this year, Shamima Begum, the most high-profile person from the UK detained in a camp in Syria, lost her appeal against the removal of her British citizenship. War Child UK has released poll findings suggesting that 53% of UK adults support bringing home British families detained in north-east Syria, compared with 13% who oppose it. Richard Barrett, a former head of the UN\u2019s al-Qaida/Daesh monitoring team, who also signed the letter, said: \u201cWe can and should repatriate British families from these insecure detention centres and reintegrate them into society, prosecuting them within the law where appropriate. Britain is being left behind as countries around the world repatriate their own citizens. If we truly believe in human rights and the rule of law, we should bring these families home.\u201d Bring British Families Home is a group of British families who have relatives unlawfully and indefinitely detained in north-east Syria. They said:\u201cEvery day we suffer the pain of knowing our loved ones are living in dangerous and inhumane conditions. Our nephews, nieces and grandchildren, many of them infants, are growing up in a desert camp, denied access to education, healthcare and the basic rights other British children take for granted.\u201d A government spokesperson said:\u201cOur priority is to ensure the safety and security of the UK and we will do whatever is necessary to protect the UK from those who pose a threat to our security.

The Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF has essentially bought professional golf, taking over the PGA Tour by merging it with LIV, a new, smaller competition golf series that Saudi Arabia launched in 2021. Last year\u2019s World Cup taught the Saudis a very important lesson. Oil is temporary; sport is for ever. The move has triggered outrage. Human Rights Watch declared that Saudi Arabia \u201cis attempting to \u2018sportswash\u2019 its egregious record of human rights violations\u201d. US media channels have numerous segments discussing the ethics of accepting money from a notoriously brutal regime. These are justified concerns: Saudi Arabia\u2019s image problem has intensified under its leader, Mohammed bin Salman, who brought the nation into global disrepute with the grisly murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a crackdown on political opposition and the ramping up of capital punishment. Last year, Saudi Arabia executed 81 people in 24 hours for crimes that included witchcraft and drug smuggling. But Qatar has taught the Saudis another important lesson: controversy dies down once the event gets going. The World Cup in Qatar started with boycotts and ended with what was hailed as the greatest final of all time. The PGA outrage will probably last longer, because the Saudis have really strayed out of their lane here. Weapons are one thing but this is golf, a spectator event of hushed cerebral commentary. A petrostate is capturing the favoured pastime of a refined, old-money elite, of CEOs in country clubs and neutral colours. That world belongs to the Saudis now. The PGA-LIV merger has forced through a dramatic change of heart within the upper echelons of the sport. The PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, had previously denounced LIV, and compared the PGA players that it tempted away to the perpetrators of 9/11. Those principles, it turns out, were for sale. The money won: $3bn, to be precise; enough to sweep Monahan\u2019s moral misgivings about terrorism and the integrity of golf aside. Grubby as the U-turn sounds, Monahan and the PGA are only continuing a long American tradition of nose-holding over Saudi Arabia, if the price is right. For all the moral queasiness, the PGA takeover reflects the Anglo-American ethos of capitalist enterprise. The Saudis are as free as anyone on the market to make the best offer. Their main crime, it seems, is in revealing that the globalised free market makes no exemptions, or space for moral sanctities. When a cultural institution is sold to the highest bidder, there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being pressed into the service of a foreign kingdom\u2019s quest for reputation laundering. Saudi Arabia, in search of ways to diversify its portfolio of assets beyond oil, has long worked to thwart the moral declarations of leaders who pledged to punish the regime for its human rights abuses. On the campaign trail in 2019, Joe Biden said that Saudi Arabia would be punished for its murder of Khashoggi, and for the brutal war in Yemen, pledging to end the sale of materiel to the Saudis \u201cwhere they\u2019re going in and murdering children\u201d. \u201cWe were going to, in fact, make them pay the price,\u201d he said, \u201cand make them, in fact, the pariah that they are.\u201d But last year, the US sold $3bn worth of Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia. The country maintains that these are only \u201cdefensive\u201d, not offensive weapons, although experts maintain that Washington has made \u201cno distinction\u201d between these two categories. It is hard to capture just how much Saudi Arabia has changed over the past 10 years, and how well that has served its attempts to pitch itself as a nation that is trying its best to move on from its fundamentalist past. Prince Mohammed has pushed through a slate of social liberalisation policies, overturning public order laws and bans on women driving, and purging the country\u2019s powerful religious establishment. A country that outlawed cinemas is today hosting open-air concerts and fashion weeks, and inviting the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman for long audiences with Prince Mohammed. After his visit, Friedman heralded the arrival of \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s Arab spring, at last\u201d, under Prince Mohammed and his reform project. \u201cOnly a fool would predict its success \u2013 but only a fool would not root for it.\u201d With this rebranding, Saudi Arabia joins Qatar and the UAE in understanding that apparent social liberalism takes the edges off political despotism and smooths entry into polite global society. It makes it easier for an Anglo-American elite to justify its cosiness with the regime, on the grounds of business and security interests. Saudi Arabia\u2019s entry into professional golf is a bitter pill to swallow, but there will be more. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund already owns Newcastle United, recruited Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to play in its domestic league, bought two Anthony Joshua boxing matches and a slot on the Formula One calendar, and plans to invest a further $20bn to attract global stars to its domestic football league. In doing so, the Saudis have revealed their confident place in a global financial system whose gatekeepers let them in long ago. So don\u2019t hate the players. Hate the game.

Communities up and down Australia\u2019s east coast were left reeling as the identities of those yet to be accounted for began to emerge on Tuesday morning. Their respective football and lifesaving clubs issued statements via their Facebook pages overnight, paying tribute to Nadene McBride and her daughter Kyah, footballers from nearby Singleton; Kane Symons, a local footballer and lifesaver previously from Tasmania; and former footballer Andrew Scott and his wife, Lynan Scott. Rebecca Mullen, a junior doctor based at Calvary Mater hospital, is among those who died in the bus crash.

We\u2019ve lost one of our own. Someone who was obviously going to have a long and illustrious career in medicine has been taken way too early and on behalf of the NSW community.\u201d Mullen, like many at the wedding, was a keen sportswoman. She ran, played football, kayaked and hiked. Her old football club, the Armidale-based New England Nomads, described her as \u201cwonderfully talented\u201d and offered its sincere condolences to her friends and family. \u201cWe are extremely saddened by the tragic news that one of our former players, Bec Mullen, died in the bus crash in the Hunter on Sunday,\u201d the club said. \u201cBec was an extremely active member of the club, a wonderfully talented sportswoman and a friend to all who knew her.\u201d Queensland\u2019s Redland-Victoria Point Sharks Football Club described Andrew Scott, known as Chisel, as a \u201cterrific member of our community both on and off the field\u201d. \u201cThe football community is mourning the loss of former player Andrew Scott and wife Lynan, who passed away in the Hunter Valley this week,\u201d the club said. \u201cChisel, as he was known, played for the Bombers in 2014 alongside his brother Luke.

Please reach out to each other for support.\u201d The Carlton Park Surf Life Saving Club, based in Tasmania, issued a statement on behalf of the family of Symons, who was Kyah\u2019s boyfriend. \u201cWe send our love and support to Steve, Sarn and Jaimie. Kane, otherwise known as \u2018Superman\u2019, was an amazing athlete who competed at the highest level,\u201d the club\u2019s president, Christine Gaby, said. \u201cBut more than that, he was a leader, a great bloke and a mate to many. We adored him and he will be truly missed.\u201d Symons was also a footballer playing in Singleton and had been named in the AFL Hunter Central Coast men\u2019s squad just four days ago. Kyah had been named in the same team\u2019s women\u2019s squad on the same day. Sue Moore, the mayor of Singleton shire council, says the community is struggling to come to terms with the loss. \u201cI understand seven of the victims are from Singleton \u2013 so struggling still, coming to terms with it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe wider community, as well as the families, obviously.

The smell is what you would imagine from several acres of burnt moorland, like an intense garden bonfire. In the dust I spot a small invertebrate curled up and toasted, and scoop it up in my palm. Yesterday I had woken to images of this hilltop ablaze against the night sky. The top of Burbage is visible from several Sheffield suburbs and folk had got their phones out. Roads were closed as firefighters and volunteers tackled the flames in shifts. Now the last of them are packing up to leave and I\u2019m able to inspect the damage. This stretch of Burbage is old grouse moor in rehab. Much of it is leggy heather, but twigs of birch and rowan are poking out in places and there\u2019s more bilberry than there used to be. Some brush has been cut back to reduce the fuel load. I find myself in a blackened drainage ditch, dug long ago to drain the moor and boost the heather. Now it\u2019s plugged with loose stones to keep the ground wet. Alas, the dry weeks of May have left the peaty soil parched. A disposable barbecue has done the rest. Stepping off the burnt area, the contrast is startling and instructive. Deep in the heather I spot a heath moth, and while I\u2019m down there I notice beetles and spiders prospecting in the cooling ash. Catastrophe can also be opportunity. High overhead, half a dozen swifts are jagging back and forth, while a pair of meadow pipits tumble around each other close to the ground. I hope their nest escaped. Heading home, I pass a trig point overlooking the burnt moor. A woman is painting it. I joke that the Ordnance Survey must have sent her. She laughs and explains that she\u2019s painting out graffiti. \u201cThis place,\u201d she says, as though speaking of a friend, \u201cyou know, if things aren\u2019t right, you come here.\u201d And I see her eyes have filled. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/qld-budget-2023-winners-and-losers-summary-who-will-benefit-is-better-worse-off-queensland-state-government", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Queensland state budget 2023 winners and losers: parents, households prioritised over coal lobby\u2019s campaign", "lead": "Treasurer Cameron Dick unveils what he says are the most generous electricity rebates of all the states and territories", "author": "Eden Gillespie and Ben Smee", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T04:02:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080039", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5d618a56ee2655743ac7f4dc8e02e0900cd81d94/144_27_2130_1278/500.jpg", "body": "The Queensland government has delivered a budget aimed at tackling cost-of-living pressures after pocketing a $10bn windfall from increased coal royalties. This year\u2019s budget centres on health, housing and youth crime, with another $89bn slated for infrastructure projects over the next four years. Here is a breakdown of the winners and losers in Queensland\u2019s 2023 state budget: Winners Parents The Queensland government has announced it will fund up to 15 hours of free kindergarten for all four-year-olds across the state each week. The $645m measure will save Queenslanders up to $4,600 a year in kindergarten fees. The government will also provide up to $150 for swimming lessons for eligible children aged 0 to four years old, and $2.7m over the next two years to expand school breakfast programs in areas experiencing financial hardship. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Households All Queensland households will receive a $550 electricity rebate this year, with concession holders to receive an additional $150 energy payment. Vulnerable Queenslanders will continue to receive the existing $372 rebate, bringing total support for this group to $1,072 in 2023-4. The treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the rebate was the most generous of all the states and territories and meant many Queenslanders won\u2019t pay for electricity at all next year. Regional Queenslanders Regional Queenslanders will benefit from an additional $70.3m over four years in the budget for the patient travel subsidy scheme. The program provides financial support to patients who need to travel more than 50km from their nearest public health facility to access specialist medical services. An additional $16bn will also be invested in regional infrastructure projects across the state, including for the CopperString 2.0 transmission project, long-duration pumped hydro projects, the Fitzroy to Gladstone pipeline and the Burdekin Falls dam. Losers The coal lobby The Palaszczuk government has stood its ground on progressive coal royalties introduced last year, despite fierce criticism from the Queensland Resources Council, which has run a $40m advertising campaign against the scheme. Dick said the increased tax was the reason the government was able to invest more than $8bn in a range of cost-of-living measures and pay down the state\u2019s debt. \u201cOur decision, to take on the mining lobby, to stand our ground, and to fight for the people of our state, has delivered a rich reward for Queenslanders,\u201d he said. Vulnerable children and families The budget papers show clearly the state\u2019s priorities have shifted when it comes to helping vulnerable children and families. There is money to hire more youth justice workers, and more police. But at the same time, staffing numbers for next year have been cut \u2013 in actual terms \u2013 from the department responsible for child safety, seniors and disability services. Renters and people in housing stress The Queensland government will spend an additional $1.1bn for social and affordable housing, with $250m slated for housing and homelessness support services. It promises 1,200 new dwellings via a build-to-rent pilot program. The government says these measures will strengthen housing supply, but community organisations say a much more aggressive response is needed.

Rain Newton-Smith, a former CBI chief economist who has rejoined as director general while it grapples with the fallout from a sexual misconduct scandal, is to take questions on the organisation\u2019s failings and its future ambitions during an appearance before the business and trade committee. The Guardian has revealed that more than a dozen women have claimed to have been victims of various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI. This included an account from a woman who alleged she was raped at a staff party on a boat on the Thames and another who claimed she was raped by colleagues when she worked at a CBI office overseas. The chair of the committee, Labour\u2019s Darren Jones, said he wanted to establish whether the CBI could still deliver on its core lobbying objectives. \u201cAre they going to be able to represent the interests of bigger businesses in the UK, given the number of members who have recently left and the recent competition from other lobby groups?\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe will also be asking what failings have they found within their organisation.\u201d Jones said the committee would avoid asking about individual cases of harassment and assault because of a police investigation. Future engagement with parliament and the government will also be put in the spotlight. \u201cParliament and the committee used to rely a lot on the CBI for data and information about business, and part of this is checking if we\u2019re still happy to do that,\u201d said Jones. The Guardian\u2019s investigation into the CBI revealed concerns about the behaviour of senior managers and the handling of complaints about their conduct by a range of figures at the group. Several members of staff have now left the CBI, by mutual agreement or having been dismissed, after an investigation by the law firm Fox Williams. City of London police have opened an investigation into some of the allegations. Tuesday\u2019s committee session will examine how the CBI handled complaints of sexual misconduct and consider what future the group \u2013 which has dominated business\u2019 engagement with the government and parliament for almost 60 years \u2013 now faces. The survival of the lobby group is still in doubt after it failed to win back access to the government \u2013 a critical part of its offering to its members \u2013 despite claiming victory in a confidence vote. The CBI faces questions on how many members it now has after refusing to reveal the the overall number who turned out to vote. It reported a 93% endorsement based on only 371 votes. CBI staff have been told that the organisation will need to cut about a third of its wage bill even after last week\u2019s vote. Bloomberg separately reported that several sponsors of its annual conference, which is likely to take place in November, had withdrawn their support. Questions from MPs are expected to focus on why CBI staff past and present characterised the culture at the lobby group as toxic. The committee is also likely to scrutinise why insiders chose to share allegations of harassment with the press and how complaints were handled internally. The CBI may also face questions about inconsistencies in statements by its leadership in recent weeks, according to another MP on the committee. In an effort to relaunch itself with a prospectus last month, senior figures at the CBI sought to play down an admission in an open letter from its president, Brian McBride, in April that it had hired \u201cculturally toxic\u201d people and \u201ctried to find resolution in sexual harassment cases when we should have removed those offenders from our business\u201d. His comments were in response to findings from the Fox Williams investigation into how the CBI handled harassment complaints. Newton-Smith\u2019s immediate predecessor, Tony Danker, was dismissed after separate complaints were made about his conduct. He said he felt he had been made the \u201cfall guy\u201d for the wider scandal at the lobby group, but also said he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for making colleagues \u201cfeel uncomfortable\u201d. He apologised \u201cprofusely\u201d for any offence he caused, and said that it was \u201ccompletely unintentional\u201d."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/12/nba-finals-game-5-miami-heat-v-denver-nuggets-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "NBA finals Game 5: Denver Nuggets beat Miami Heat to clinch title \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Nikola Joki\u0107 and Co clinched the team\u2019s first NBA championship on their own home court.

Butler misses a 3, but Adebayo keeps the rebound alive, and Butler drives and draws a foul \u2013 a real one this time. He makes both. He\u2019s gone from eight points to 21 in no time flat. What?

Jimmy Butler finally re-emerges with a 3. It\u2019s still not over. Then Caldwell-Pope launches one toward the heavens. It lands with a neat little roll through the net for 3. Butler answers with another 3, nearly doubling his point total in two possessions. A Denver miss, and now we have Butler shooting a 3 and drawing a foul \u2026 Or did he? Denver challenges the call, and from our look at the replay, they\u2019re going to win. The only contact was from Butler, reaching out a leg in desperation.

Miami keeps it and gets another chance, but it ends up in the hands of Joki\u0107 for the big man\u2019s 16th rebound. But Joki\u0107 tries to get a little too cute with a pass at the other end. As badly as things are going for Miami right now, the Nuggets just can\u2019t pull away. Heat 76-81 Nuggets, 6:42, 4th quarter Miss. Miss. Miss. Strus blocks a shot by Braun \u2013 a spectacular play, that one. Gordon blocks a shot by Lowry, practically slamming it into the floor as the shot clock nears zero. Finally, Murray hits a jumper for the first points in about two and a half minutes. Another Miami timeout, and the Nuggets are creeping closer to the title. Heat 76-79 Nuggets, 8:36, 4th quarter A great defensive sequence for the Nuggets \u2026 until Caleb Martin zips through the lane and scores. Both teams miss, then Joki\u0107 does what he does best. Kyle Lowry, though, is Miami\u2019s wild card tonight. Another 3 cuts the lead to one. Denver goes back to Joki\u0107. Adebayo plays good defense. Not good enough. He scores. Great D from Denver again, then an offensive rebound from Gordon and a cut underneath by Braun, the rookie having a breakthrough night. He\u2019s fouled. He misses both. Heat 71-75 Nuggets, 10:59, 4th quarter Yeah, the Nuggets have the momentum now. Joki\u0107 opens the quarter with an easy bucket. Miami squanders a chance, and Denver works the ball around to Murray, who calmly drains a 3-pointer. Timeout Heat. Erik Spoelstra didn\u2019t build his 15-year resume of excellence in Miami by letting games like this get away without a fight. Jimmy Butler? Still stuck with eight points. Injury alert on Caldwell-Pope: Heat 71-70 Nuggets, end 3rd quarter So not all long-range 3s are bad ideas. Lowry drains one from 29, and the Heat go back up by 1. Joki\u0107 feeds to Braun, but the Heat defenders converge and give him no room. How big will that Lowry shot be? Will the Heat gain any confidence from having the lead at this stage? It still feels as though the momentum has shifted Denver\u2019s way. And they might be 12 minutes (plus ads) away from their first NBA championship. Heat 68-70 Nuggets, 54.1 seconds, 3rd quarter Philosophical question: Is Duncan Robinson related to Colin Robinson from What We Do in the Shadows? Is the NBA in the Vampire Cinematic Universe? Anyway, Christian Braun continues his strong supporting role with two free throws to tie it. Then Porter pulls up for three and \u2026 he makes it! Nuggets lead for the first time since it was 18-16. (The score. Not the year.) Adebayo answers with two. He has 20 now. Heat 64-64 Nuggets, 2:13, 3rd quarter Another poor shot choice from Miami, with Duncan Robinson flinging one from 28 with the form of a disc golfer. Joki\u0107 finds Caldwell-Pope open for 3. He misses. Nuggets steal, and Caldwell-Pope races away for a layup. He misses in traffic, but Bruce Brown helpfully tips it back in. Joki\u0107 steals, and Porter snakes his way through a couple of Heat players in transition to tie it. Stat of the night so far, aside from Denver\u2019s catastrophically lousy 3-point shooting: Miami plus/minus \u2026 Kevin Love -11 Caleb Martin +20 Heat 62-60 Nuggets, 4:12, 3rd quarter Early in the game, the Heat were taking good shots but missing. Now they\u2019re taking bad shots. And missing. But so are the Nuggets. Porter misses an open look from the corner. Then Joki\u0107 tosses the ball the length of the court to Gordon, who catches in traffic and \u2026 misses the dunk. Thanks a lot for taking your improv class tonight, Hunter. Beautiful game you\u2019ve left me. Not. Heat 60-60 Nuggets, 6:44, 3rd quarter Joki\u0107 hits one of two free throws. Miami\u2019s Gabe Vincent then makes one of those inexplicable momentum-shifting bad decisions, rushing a shot from 28 feet that hits nothing but backboard. The Nuggets race back the other way and find Murray in the corner. Will Denver finally gets its second 3-pointer of the game on its 18th attempt? Yes. We\u2019re tied. Heat 60-56 Nuggets, 7:02, 3rd quarter Here\u2019s another philosophical question \u2026 Let\u2019s say your opponents couldn\u2019t hit water if they fell out of a boat when they\u2019re shooting from outside. Do you just collapse into the middle, where they\u2019re starting to find some success? Joki\u0107 is in particularly fine form in the middle now. His putback gives him 16 points and 13 rebounds. Heat 58-51 Nuggets, 8:13, 3rd quarter So here\u2019s a philosophical question \u2026 Let\u2019s say your team has missed 16 of its first 17 3-pointers in a given game. Do you give up on the entire concept of outside shooting? Or do you figure something has to fall eventually? Is there such a thing as the \u201claw of averages,\u201d as late Spinal Tap drummer Mick Shrimpton said of his chances to survive the rash of deaths striking those who preceded him in the role? Anyway, Murray makes a nice drive to cut the lead to four. Then Kevin Love drains a 3 at the other end as if taunting the hosts. Heat 53-47 Nuggets, 11:13, 2nd quarter And we\u2019re back with a missed 3 from Miami. Joki\u0107 works inside, draws a late double team and scores. He\u2019s fouled and converts the free throw. Strus hits a shot at the other end. Apologies in advance for any third-quarter commentary issues. I just saw several ads for reality shows, and brain no words makes now. Need better passing, Denver? Peyton Manning is in the building. Here\u2019s that turnover from Joki\u0107 to Butler from a few minutes ago. Butler struggled with his shot through much of the half and has labored to get to eight points. Adebayo leads the Heat with 18 points and nine rebounds. Joki\u0107 is nearly on pace for a triple-double with nine points, nine rebounds and four assists. Strus misses a shot off an inbounds play with the shot clock nearly gone. Joki\u0107 flings it ahead to Caldwell-Pope, whose layup attempt will make every high school and youth coach in the country cringe. Miami misses, and Porter slams a beauty on a nifty Joki\u0107 pass. Miami misses again, and Joki\u0107 lets fly from 67 feet (according to ESPN\u2019s stats page) at the buzzer. He doesn\u2019t miss by much. Heat 51-42 Nuggets, 1:07, 2nd quarter Adebayo scores. Nuggets miss a 3. Adebayo scores. That\u2019s a summary of the last 20 seconds and the first half as a whole. Denver is 1 for 14 from behind the arc. And they\u2019re not any better from the line, where Bruce Brown misses two. Heat 47-42 Nuggets, 2:13, 2nd quarter The superstars combine for a basket, with Joki\u0107 threading a perfect pass to Butler for a breakaway slam. Unfortunately for Denver, Butler plays for the Heat. The Nuggets are not taking good care of the ball. Nor are they hitting 3s. Two bad misses in quick order, but Braun bails them out with a rebound and putback. Miami misses again, and Joki\u0107 sends the ball down to Braun, who drives and draws the foul. The rookie is helping Denver weather a storm here, though he misses the second of his two free throws. Heat 45-39 Nuggets, 3:38, 2nd quarter Lowry must be feeling OK, because he returns from the timeout with a tough 3-pointer. Joki\u0107 hits a little hook in the lane. He\u2019s 4 for 4. A defensive rebound from Joki\u0107 puts Denver in business at the other end, and Murray wins a post-up battle. But back at the other end \u2013 it\u2019s Lowry with another 3. Ouch \u2026 Heat 39-35 Nuggets, 5:37, 2nd quarter Joki\u0107 backs in against Adebayo and bangs his body off Lowry before sinking his close-range shot. Lowry gets up slowly. The Nuggets then make it a nice run. With the shot clock running down for Miami, Bruce Brown pops the ball free. Jamal Murray corrals the loose ball and flings it ahead to Brown, who\u2019s off to the races for an easy dunk. Timeout Heat. I need a translation \u2026 Hunter has also checked in on Twitter. He\u2019s at his last improv class. So when he\u2019s hired at Saturday Night Live, do I need to cover his assignments? Heat 39-29 Nuggets, 7:17, 2nd quarter \u201cHere, Christian \u2013 you take a shot.\u201d \u201cNo, Nikola, please \u2013 you take it.\u201d The give-and-go between Braun and Joki\u0107 advances the ball about one foot, but maybe that gave Joki\u0107 a tiny bit more confidence. He hits the shot. Miami runs a perfect inbounds play, and Duncan Robinson hits only the second 3-pointer for the Heat so far. The Nuggets still have just one. Another poor possession for the Nuggets, and an Adebayo rebound gives Robinson an easy chance to score inside. That\u2019s a 10-point lead for the Heat. Timeout. Heat 32-27 Nuggets, 8:47, 2nd quarter Denver rookie Christian Braun gets a nice basket inside. Murray strips the ball from Butler. A foul is called. The replay is shown. No foul was committed. As a youth soccer referee, I hate to call out lackluster officiating, but this is a poor showing thus far from the men in gray and black. Of course, crowds will boo anything, and they boo a replay of an Aaron Gordon foul that rather clear. That\u2019s three fouls on Gordon. At last, Joki\u0107 returns. Good stat from the ESPN/ABC crew \u2013 the Heat outscored Denver by seven in his absence. Heat 28-23 Nuggets, 10:11, 2nd quarter Kevin Love, whose wife had a baby over the weekend, comes up with two blocks on one possession to force a shot-clock violation. The Nuggets\u2019 offense is a trainwreck right now. Heat 28-22 Nuggets, 10:53, 2nd quarter Check that \u2013 the Butler bucket was on the first play of the second quarter. The Nuggets are then unable to get the ball across midcourt, and the lacrosse-style scramble for the ball goes to Miami. Butler hits two free throws, the second with a friendly roll, and Miami leads by six. First-quarter thoughts Miami\u2019s making better decisions in general. They\u2019ve missed a lot of good looks. Denver had a rocky start (ouch, sorry for the geographical pun there), then settled down, then came unglued. The ball movement is better than it was in the first few minutes. The shot selection is not. Joki\u0107 hasn\u2019t missed a shot. But he has only taken one. Butler is one for four. Heat 24-22 Nuggets, end 1st quarter Jordan swats a shot, and Porter ends up scoring at the other end. Adebayo battles again and scores. He\u2019s got 14 points and six rebounds. Porter, who leads the Nuggets with seven points and seven boards, misses at the buzzer. So if you tuned in for a battle between Joki\u0107 and Butler, our apologies. If you wanted to see Adebayo vs. Porter, enjoy. Heat 22-18 Nuggets, 2:14, 1st quarter Adebayo works against Green, fakes, gets Green in the air, goes up and hits a jumper as he\u2019s fouled. Adebayo has 11 points, hitting five of seven shots. Strus is three for four with a three and a free throw, giving him eight points. Jimmy Butler? None. After the Denver timeout, Adebayo makes it 12 for himself, 22 for the Heat. Heat 19-18 Nuggets, 2:40, 1st quarter Adebayo bucket and the foul. He makes the free throw, and the Heat somehow have the lead again. Heat 16-18 Nuggets, 3:05, 1st quarter Strus flings the ball high, high in the air, and Adebayo gets up to slam it home. At the other end, Strus picks up his second foul. But Strus stays in and beats the defense down the court for a breakaway layup. He might have been fouled, which means we get the excruciating experience of TV commentators critiquing the refs. The Nuggets respond, and Adabayo answers with a jumper of his own. Then \u2026 uh oh, guess who has two fouls now. It\u2019s Joki\u0107. I don\u2019t like that call. Heat 8-15 Nuggets, 4:55, 1st quarter If you \u201cMax Strus ends the drought with an out-of-control drive straight at Joki\u0107,\u201d congratulations. Count it, and he converts the free throw. Joki\u0107 answers with his first shot of the game. It\u2019s a 3. It\u2019s good. Heat 5-12 Nuggets, 5:57, 1st quarter During the long timeout, I counted 10 straight missed field goals and two missed free throws by Miami since they led 5-0. Heat 5-12 Nuggets, 5:57, 1st quarter Butler\u2019s first free throw goes clank off the back of the rim. The second one rattles out. The Heat are cold. A screen in his own front court frees Murray to drive the rest of the way down the court for a dunk that\u2019s all too easy. Another Miami miss, and Porter makes it 10-5. Another Miami miss, and Porter finds Green cutting to the basket for an emphatic slam. Heat timeout. Heat 5-6 Nuggets, 7:14, 1st quarter Airball, Butler. Airball, Adebayo. But Butler draws a foul, and the Nuggets call timeout. Heat 5-6 Nuggets, 7:14, 1st quarter Caldwell-Pope scores his and his team\u2019s second bucket on an acrobatic jumper from about six feet. The Heat fail to respond, and Gordon gives Denver the lead. Heat 5-2 Nuggets, 8:45, 1st quarter Joki\u0107\u2019s first moves on offense aren\u2019t good. He bangs, bangs, bangs, bangs, bangs and loses the ball. The Nuggets already have four turnovers. As if trying to make up that gap, Adebayo commits the Heat\u2019s first turnover in spectacular fashion, throwing the ball into his own bench, perhaps thinking one of those players was actually on the court. Caldwell-Pope has the first Denver points. Heat 5-0 Nuggets, 10:00, 1st quarter Adebayo announces his presence with authority with a steal and a dunk. Denver goes on to squander the next two possessions as well, and then Strus hits a 3 off an in-bounds play with scant time on the clock. Starters Denver: Porter, Murray, Joki\u0107, Gordon, Caldwell-Pope Miami: Strus, Vincent, Butler, Adebayo, Love Kind of a pity TV broadcasters break away for ads instead of showing the player intros. Let\u2019s just watch the best player intros ever, shall we? Colorado hipsters Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats step to the tipoff circle for an a capella rendition of the national anthem. I\u2019d prefer The Samples, but that wasn\u2019t bad at all. For the record, I\u2019m wearing a T-shirt and cargo shorts. Joki\u0107 should not be confused with Nikola Jovi\u0107, a reserve power forward for the Heat. Probably not a mistake many people would make. Anyone tuning in from the UK might be interested to know he\u2019s one of three active NBA players born in the UK and the only one born outside London. Maybe Leicester will have an NBA championship to console themselves after Premier League relegation. The Leicester Riders were BBL runners-up this year after winning the last two championships. Fairly or unfairly, NBA players are judged by their championships more than their peers in other sports. Simple math tells us why. In baseball, a starting pitcher only plays once every four or five games, and a batter usually comes up to the plate only four or five times per game. In soccer, there\u2019s one ball for 22 players spread over about 8,500 square feet. Even a football quarterback is powerless to help his defense and is seriously hindered without a solid offensive line. In the condensed area of a basketball court, one player can change everything, and a championship changes that player\u2019s legacy. The greatest players never to win it all are typically those whose paths were blocked by even greater players. Prime examples: Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley and Reggie Miller kept running into Michael Jordan. Barring a Jordan-sized impediment, a player often has to claim a ring to join the pantheon of the greats. Which is why the person with the most at stake tonight is Denver center Nikola Joki\u0107, the Serbian superstar who won league MVP honors in 2021 and 2022. Hard to believe he was drafted 41st in 2014. He doesn\u2019t necessarily need a win in this series to be included in the conversation of the best NBA players of the century so far. But a win surely removes any doubt. All this despite being an unassuming man or, as my Guardian colleague Hunter Felt says, a man with \u201cabsolutely no swag.\u201d And the plot thickens like the humid Florida air \u2026 Tyler Herro has been cleared to play. He, like Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, averaged more than 20 points per game in the regular season. It\u2019s a pity that the Writers Guild of America remains out on strike, because the Miami Heat\u2019s compelling story is in desperate need of a Hollywood ending. After spending the first couple of months of the season struggling to reach the .500 mark, the Heat turned things around by winning four straight on the road in December, including a win in Mexico City credited in part to Jimmy Butler consuming some grasshoppers and tequila. They still barely won the weak Southeast Division and were pushed to the brink of elimination in the play-in tournament. Since then, they\u2019ve flirted with and made history. By beating the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, the Heat became the first team in the short history of the play-in tournament to advance in the playoffs after playing their way in. By beating the New York Knicks, the Heat became the second No. 8 seed to reach the conference finals. Against Boston, the Heat nearly became the first team to blow a 3-0 lead in the playoffs, but because playing on the road doesn\u2019t seem to affect this team in the least, they won Game 7 in Boston to reach the NBA Finals. Tonight, for the third time, they face elimination. They\u2019ll need to reel off three straight against the Denver Nuggets to become the first eighth seed to win it all and add to a dramatic June in Miami, where the NHL\u2019s Panthers are also in the finals as a No. 8 seed (they\u2019re also down 3-1 ahead of tomorrow\u2019s game), and Major League Soccer\u2019s Inter Miami has just signed some guy named Messi. So if one were to cross the writers\u2019 picket line, Butler would score 40 tonight to lead his team to a 110-107 win, and Tyler Herro would finally return to the lineup in Game 6 to inspire the Heat to take the next two. (Hold that thought for late news \u2013 Herro has been upgraded to questionable for tonight\u2019s game. Maybe someone is writing the script after all.) Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Aaron Timms on Nikola Joki\u0107\u2019s journey to the top of the game. Hybridity has always been in Nikola Joki\u0107\u2019s basketball DNA; after all, this is a player who was famously drafted by Denver in the middle of a Taco Bell commercial for the quesadilla-burrito mashup known as a quesarito. The pretty, historic town of Sombor, where Joki\u0107 grew up, is tucked into the northwestern pocket of Serbia, flush against the borders with Croatia and Hungary; the Hungarian, Habsburg, Ottoman and Austrian empires have all, at various points over the past half-millennium, laid claim to it. Joki\u0107, perhaps fittingly given his origins, has emerged over this postseason as the NBA\u2019s ultimate border-hopper: a center with the touch of a guard, a prodigious scorer who\u2019s better as a passer, the embodiment of total basketball, infinitely adaptable, positionless but always in position, a crossroads in human form. As Denver tightened their grip on the finals with a coolly commanding Game 3 win in Miami on Wednesday night, a talent that once threatened to go unrewarded with the hard currency of titles has come thrillingly into mint. Joki\u0107\u2019s numbers \u2013 32 points, 21 rebounds, 10 assists \u2013 made him the first player ever to post a 30-20-10 game in the NBA finals. But most impressive was the way in which he accumulated these figures, with a freedom and variety that captured the best of his childhood heroes. Growing up in Serbia in the early years of this century, Joki\u0107 would spend hours on YouTube watching his favorite NBA players. \u201cI watched Magic because of his passing, and Hakeem because of his post moves, and Jordan because he is Jordan,\u201d Jokic wrote in 2016, a year after joining the Denver Nuggets as a second-round draft pick. The two-time MVP is clomping through these finals with the vision and improvisational sizzle of Magic, Hakeem the Dream\u2019s size-defying touch and footwork, and Jordan\u2019s on-court omnipresence and invincibility, his sheer weight of numbers and aura of statistical destiny. A claim for historical greatness is convincingly being assembled.

The Democratic governor\u2019s decision to appear on Hannity confounded many of his supporters, but Newsom, who routinely spars with Republicans on social media, took the opportunity to defend his state\u2019s record and its policies with a senior adviser telling Politico that he viewed the interview as \u201cgoing into the lion\u2019s den\u201d. The interview opened with Newsom and Hannity arguing over immigration, Joe Biden and the economy. The Fox News host repeatedly insisted the president is not up to the job and described Newsom, long viewed as a presidential hopeful, as articulate and more energetic. \u201cI\u2019m rooting for our president and I have great confidence in his leadership,\u201d Newsom said before again defending Biden\u2019s record. \u201cI know he\u2019s capable. I see results \u2026 real results.\u201d The California governor said he would not enter the Democratic primary and would continue to support Biden. Hannity, who has run several recent segments painting Newsom as a radical liberal who wants to \u201cbring California\u2019s failures to the rest of the country\u201d, also questioned Newsom about population declines in the state and California\u2019s homelessness crisis. \u201cThe state has not made progress in the two decades as it relates to homelessness,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cHousing costs are too high. Our regulatory thickets are too problematic.\u201d \u201cThe difference between me and other politicians is, I own this. I take responsibility for this. I love this state,\u201d Newsom said, describing his administration\u2019s efforts to reduce homelessness by putting more money toward tackling the issue and suing cities that have blocked efforts to expand housing. Hannity said the back and forth were the product of a \u201cfriendly discussion\u201d and praised Newsom for taking part in the interview. \u201cI appreciate your passion for your state. I appreciate the fact that you fight for the things you believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just I don\u2019t agree with your views.\u201d Newsom has been touring red states and running billboard ads promoting abortion rights in Texas, Mississippi and other Republican-led states. Hannity, a longtime ally of Donald Trump who recently moderated a deferential town hall with the former president, reached out to Newsom, according to Politico. Newsom and Hannity have reportedly known each other for years, though the governor has not appeared on Fox since 2010. Although the Democratic governor often criticises the conservative network for its flagrant promotion of election conspiracy theories and fearmongering about crime in liberal states like California, he has also shown a zeal for sparring with rightwing figures. Last week, he doubled down on his feud with the Florida governor and 2024 presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis, by threatening criminal charges after flights chartered by the state sent Latin American migrants to California. Newsom addressed the incident in his interview with Hannity, telling him that Florida officials lied to the people seeking asylum who were transported to California and told them there would be jobs waiting for them. \u201cI talked to every single one of them. They were lied to. They were misled,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of faith tradition allows this?\u201d The governor also said he would gladly debate DeSantis, who he said would lose in 2024. \u201cTrump is going to clean his clock,\u201d Newsom said. Newsom has insisted he has \u201csub-zero\u201d interest in running for president while placing himself at the forefront of political conversations in recent months. He touted a quixotic plan to push for a constitutional amendment regulating guns, placing age limits, background check requirements and other restrictions on gun ownerships. With the country bitterly divided over gun rights, such an amendment is highly unlikely to ever pass \u2013 two-thirds of the House and Senate, or two-thirds of all states would have to agree to a constitutional convention to make it happen. Newsom is proposing the latter route, which has never happened before. Legal experts also warn it would set a dangerous norm. He announced the gun rights plan on NBC\u2019s Today Show, saying that the proposal was crafted in response to the federal court rolling back several gun safety laws. It is conspicuous, the Sacramento Bee\u2019s editorial board wrote in response to Fox promoting an interview with the governor, that the governor has not made time for interviews with local outlets. \u201cGood luck on Hannity, Governor Newsom,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching, and we\u2019ll also be watching for you to be a little more present in California media, since you\u2019re not running for president.\u201d The second part of the interview, in which Newsom and Hannity will discuss, among other issues, the Chinese spy balloon, will air later this week, Hannity said.

He was also named the finals MVP after averaging 30.2 points, 14.0 rebounds and 7.2 assists across the series. The Serbian All-Star, who was a second-round pick in the 2014 draft, also became the lowest drafted player to win a finals MVP. Denver\u2019s title catapults him into the conversation as one of the all-time great NBA centers. His teammate Jamal Murray was also superb: he averaged 21.4 points, 6.2 rebounds and 10.0 assists a game in the finals after missing the entire 2021-22 season with a torn ACL. \u201cIt\u2019s long before we made it here that I thought this was going to happen,\u201d said Murray. \u201cI had a belief of being in the playoffs before, having the experience, seeing the team and the chemistry grow, having the same core my whole career, that\u2019s when I saw it. That\u2019s when I believed it. \u201cTo be here just kind of rounds it out and shows that when we are given the right circumstances and everybody healthy, God willing, we can do it. I think when we\u2019re playing our best basketball, we are a very hard team to stop.\u201d It was far from a vintage Nuggets performance in Game 5. They missed 20 of their first 22 three-point attempts and seven of their first 13 free throws before outscoring the Heat by 12 points in the second half. The Heat\u2019s radar was off too: they shot 34% from the floor and 25% from three. Butler scored eight straight points to help the Heat take an 87-86 lead with 2:45 left in the game after his team had trailed by seven. He made two more free throws with 1:58 remaining to help Miami regain a one-point lead. Then Bruce Brown got an offensive rebound and tip-in to give the Nuggets the lead for good. Trailing by three with 15 seconds left, Butler jacked up a three-point attempt, but missed. Brown made two free throws to put the game out of reach and bring the title to Denver for the first time. \u201cIt was and ugly and we couldn\u2019t make shots, but at the end we figured it out,\u201d Joki\u0107 said. \u201cI am just happy we won the game.\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone immediately set his sights on his young core \u2013 Murray is 26, Joki\u0107 28, Michael Porter Jr 24 and Aaron Gordon 27 \u2013 winning more titles. \u201cI got news for everyone out there,\u201d Malone said as he stood on the championship podium. \u201cWe are not satisfied with one.\u201d Denver had looked like champions for much of the season, and qualified for the playoffs as the No 1 seed in the Western Conference. That was in contrast to the upstart Heat, who overcame the odds to qualify for the NBA finals as a No 8 seed. \u201cYou have to tip your hat to [Denver],\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said after the game. \u201cI said it, but they are one hell of a basketball team. They play the right way, they compete, they are well-coached and they have a strong culture. So for this season, they deserve this.\u201d Denver\u2019s win leaves Phoenix, Utah, Brooklyn, Orlando, Indiana, Charlotte, Memphis, Minnesota, New Orleans and the Los Angeles Clippers as the 10 current franchises still waiting for a first NBA championship."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/wes-anderson-says-bill-murray-misconduct-allegations-wont-affect-their-working-relationship", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "Wes Anderson says Bill Murray misconduct allegations won\u2019t affect their working relationship", "lead": "Director, who has worked with Murray on nine of his 11 films, says it was Covid-19, not misconduct allegations, that stopped the actor appearing in his latest film Asteroid City", "author": "Sian Cain", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T02:42:48Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080090", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/04b0b56f50e8eb7fd776364302439f5e821d6799/521_0_4399_2639/500.jpg", "body": "Wes Anderson has said that various allegations made against his frequent collaborator Bill Murray will not affect their working relationship, describing him as \u201cpart of my family\u201d. The 54-year-old director, known for using the same actors across his films, spoke before the release of his latest, Asteroid City, which is one of only two of his 11 released feature films that Murray has not appeared in. \u201cMy experience with Bill is so extensive,\u201d Anderson told IndieWire. \u201cBill was such a great supporter of me from the very beginning. I don\u2019t want to speak about somebody else\u2019s experience, but he\u2019s really part of my family. You know, he\u2019s my daughter\u2019s godfather. In fact, he actually baptised her. He\u2019s the one who splashed the water.\u201d Murray was to play a motel manager in Asteroid City, but had to drop out due to Covid-19 and was replaced by Steve Carell. The only other Anderson film he has not appeared in was the director\u2019s 1996 feature debut, Bottle Rocket. Murray\u2019s exit from Asteroid City had nothing to do with the accusations against him, and was due to the actor being sick with Covid-19, Anderson said. \u201cThere was some confusion about what happened with Bill,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was supposed to play the motel manager who Steve Carell plays, and Bill got Covid four days before he was supposed to start shooting \u2026 So Bill missed his part and Steve Carell came in quite suddenly. He was great, I loved having him.\u201d Anderson said Murray later visited the film\u2019s set in Spain and they drove to France together when the shoot finished. \u201cIt was a great way to finish but it was the first time I hadn\u2019t had him in a movie in a long time,\u201d he said. Last April, production was indefinitely paused on Aziz Ansari\u2019s feature film Being Mortal when a female crew member accused Murray of straddling and kissing her through a mask. In October, it was revealed that Murray had reportedly paid $100,000 to settle the complaint. Murray said he was being \u201cjestful\u201d, while the \u201cmuch younger\u201d woman said she interpreted his actions as \u201centirely sexual\u201d and was \u201chorrified\u201d. Speaking last month, Murray addressed the allegation in an interview with CNBC, saying: \u201cI did something I thought was funny and it wasn\u2019t taken that way. The movie studio wanted to do the right thing, so they wanted to check it all out and investigate it and so they stopped the production \u2026 It\u2019s been quite an education for me.\u201d The allegation triggered a wider conversation about Murray\u2019s past behaviour. Geena Davis wrote of his \u201cdifficult\u201d behaviour in her memoir, alleging that he \u201cinsisted\u201d on using a massage device on her in a hotel room and \u201cscreamed\u201d at her in front of hundreds of crew members on a film set. Seth Green alleged that Murray once dropped him in a bin \u201cby his ankles\u201d when he was a child, which made him cry. Murray\u2019s Charlie\u2019s Angels co-star Lucy Liu alleged on the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Asian Enough podcast that Murray had directed \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cinexcusable\u201d insults at her on set. Her fellow co-star Drew Barrymore corroborated Liu\u2019s account, saying Liu \u201cstood up for herself\u201d: \u201cI am proud of us as a team and a company that we didn\u2019t tiptoe on the eggshells.\u201d Murray has not responded to the claims made by Davis or Green. He has previously addressed allegations made by his Charlie\u2019s Angels co-stars about his behaviour on set, saying in 2009: \u201cLook, I will dismiss you completely if you are unprofessional and working with me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/12/westfield-san-francisco-mall-closure-economic-struggles", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Westfield mall firm gives up San Francisco center as Nordstrom closes", "lead": "City will lose one of its largest shopping centers which saw a decline in economic activity, occupancy and foot traffic", "author": "Rose Horowitch", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T02:25:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080092", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d2716349854732e43ba6cc9e7d56603a32aa89dd/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Westfield is ceding control of its San Francisco mall, the latest business to leave the city as it struggles to recover its pre-pandemic commerce levels.

The mall\u2019s parent company has stopped making payments on a $558m loan and has started the process of ceding control of the property, the Chronicle reported. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield did not respond to requests for comment. Westfield\u2019s exodus comes as nearby stores and hotels have also left the area. Old Navy announced that it will close its Market Street store on 1 July. The owner of two of the city\u2019s most prominent hotels, the Hilton Union Square and Parc 55, said it would sell its properties. Nordstrom, which occupies nearly a third of the mall\u2019s retail space, said that it would close its store in August, when its lease expires.

The causes of the crash remain under investigation, and it is unclear whether passengers were wearing seatbelts. While declining to comment on the specifics of the crash, the premier, Chris Minns, was open to legal changes about seatbelts if the investigation showed they were needed. \u201cWe will be in constant communication with NSW police,\u201d he told the ABC on Tuesday morning. \u201c[If] there\u2019s a recommendation made to us about law changes in relation to safety on buses or coaches or in cars and vans in NSW, we\u2019ll of course, take action. \u201cIf there\u2019s seatbelts on a coach or a bus, you are legally required to wear them.\u201d Commuter buses in Australia are not required to have seatbelts, but national design rules mean they are now standard on coaches, according to Geoffrey Clifton from the University of Sydney\u2019s Transport and Logistics Management Institute. In buses fitted with seatbelts \u2013 which the Volvo coach involved in the Hunter crash reportedly was \u2013 everyone on board is required to use them. But it is not the driver\u2019s responsibility to ensure compliance. Clifton said Australia\u2019s road laws were broadly in line with international standards in comparable countries. He said local laws were broadly strengthened following a series of serious accidents in the 1980s and 90s. These include a 1989 crash in which 20 people died near Grafton in NSW, and then two months later, the collision of two coaches near Kempsey in NSW which left 35 dead \u2013 Australia\u2019s worst road disaster. But Clifton said enforcement of the seatbelt rules differs from state to state, and laws make it difficult to ensure compliance. Bus companies with vehicles equipped with seatbelts must ensure they are in working order. Drivers are required to wear their seatbelts, and are legally responsible for ensuring they comply themselves, but this responsibility does not extend to enforcing the rule for passengers. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the authority to force passengers to wear seatbelts,\u201d Clifton said. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to local police to enforce the laws, and they have the power to fine or penalise passengers for not wearing seatbelts. As part of a recent strengthening of the laws in NSW, school buses in regional areas of the state must have seatbelts, and drivers are required to verbally remind students they are required to use them. That is not the case for other buses, but Clifton noted all bus companies in NSW must have a management system in place that identifies hazards unique to their operations. On Tuesday morning the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said his government would \u201cof course take action\u201d if police recommended law changes to improve safety in the light of the Hunter Valley crash. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me more broadly about the wearing of seatbelts on coaches, it\u2019s really important that the message go out that if there are seatbelts on buses and coaches in New South Wales, you are legally responsible to wear them,\u201d Minns told the ABC. \u201cYou must wear them. It\u2019s the law in New South Wales that that\u2019s the case, and notwithstanding what\u2019s happened in the last 24 hours, that needs to be an unambiguous message to people in the state.\u201d Prof Teresa Senserrick, director of the University of Western Australia\u2019s Centre for Road Safety Research, said that while police could conduct checks to ensure buses passengers were wearing seatbelts, a more effective strategy to increase seatbelt compliance could be to set harsher fines or punishments and to strongly communicate them. \u201cCertainly advertising signage of what penalties will be, whether that\u2019s on signs in buses or other ways, could see people be more attune to the laws,\u201d she said. She raised the ideas following observations gathered by mobile phone detection cameras deployed in Queensland and NSW recently that detected a surge in non-compliance with seatbelts. \u201cIt was quite a surprise to everyone how many people were not using their seatbelts \u2026 We\u2019ve become quite complacent while we\u2019ve focused on speeding and drink driving.\u201d But Senserrick questioned whether conventional seat belts would have saved lives in the Hunter crash, because the bus rolled over after leaving the road. \u201cIt\u2019s the rollover crashes that are really problematic. A seatbelt can help in a lot of circumstances, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily help in a rollover crash, particularly when a vehicle has rolled over more than once. \u201cIf you want the highest safety standard, look to motor racing, where they have harness style belts,\u201d Senserrick said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/12/former-olympic-champion-tori-bowie-died-in-childbirth-according-to-autopsy", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Former Olympic champion Tori Bowie died in childbirth, according to autopsy", "lead": "The former Olympic and world champion sprinter Tori Bowie died in her home due to complications from childbirth", "author": "Tom Lutz", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T23:42:08Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080099", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ed4a18e043e1a80cb3e964a0cc06f1da79c6cfe7/0_45_2655_1593/500.jpg", "body": "The former Olympic and world champion sprinter Tori Bowie died in her home due to complications from childbirth, according to an autopsy report obtained by USA Today Sports.

Emergency crews were responding to a shooting on 24th Street shortly after 9pm in which nine people were injured. In a video posted to Twitter, a Cruise self-driving car is seen in the road as an officer approaches it and says it\u2019s \u201cblocking emergency medical and fire. I\u2019ve got to get it out of here now.\u201d In a statement, Cruise maintained that the car did not block emergency access to the scene \u201cat any point\u201d. \u201cOur car initially stopped as it was approaching an active emergency scene, then proceeded to perform a U-turn and pull over,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThroughout this time, all vehicles, including emergency response vehicles, were able to proceed around our car.\u201d Cruise did not directly respond to questions about how long the car was in place. A spokesperson told the San Francisco Chronicle that a lane of traffic was open beside the car. An employee moved the vehicle within half an hour, the company said. A spokesperson for the San Francisco police department said the department is \u201caware\u201d of an incident involving an autonomous vehicle and is \u201cactively investigating\u201d, but would not provide further details. The incident comes as state and local officials have raised broader questions about whether autonomous vehicles can safely respond to unpredictable situations. Cruise, which is owned by General Motors, and its competitor Waymo, operated by Alphabet, are seeking permission to operate round-the-clock robotaxis throughout San Francisco. Cruise is currently allowed to charge fares for driverless taxi rides between 10pm and 6am in some areas of the city. Waymo can only charge fares if a safety driver is in the car. But California\u2019s public utilities commission is considering whether to broaden permissions for both Cruise and Waymo. The commission will vote on 29 June whether to approve draft resolutions that would permit the companies to charge fares for robotaxi rides throughout San Francisco. The resolutions argued that the companies had detailed how they would minimize risk to passengers. Supporters of the proposal pointed to its potential benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. But opponents, including several city officials, have argued the cars often respond unpredictably in new situations. The San Francisco municipal transportation agency, the San Francisco county transportation authority and the mayor\u2019s office of disability opposed efforts to expand robotaxi service. They argued for incremental expansions of robotaxi service and said that the self-driving cars should prove they can operate in \u201cthe most demanding circumstances without compromising safety, equity, accessibility, and street capacity\u201d before they receive widespread approval. The city has evidence of \u201cdozens \u2013 perhaps hundreds or thousands \u2013 of incidents\u201d in which self-driving cars blocked traffic, drove erratically or interfered with emergency response vehicles, the officials claimed. The California Transit Association also expressed concerns about incidents when self-driving cars had blocked transit vehicles and emergency responders. The association pointed to two separate issues last year, one in which a Cruise vehicle obstructed a fire truck on its way to a three-alarm blaze and another when a Cruise car ran over a firehose during an active fire."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jun/12/trump-indictment-documents-florida-biden-mccarthy-politics-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Donald Trump arrives in Florida on eve of arraignment; Miami police say they can handle crowds of up to 50,000 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Former US president lands in Miami ahead of court appearance on Tuesday; Miami officials detailed security measures in press briefing", "author": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong (now) and Chris Stein (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T23:09:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080103", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0a8e72d0e207ab48acefc79279dfd24a49cafcfa/591_358_1717_1030/500.jpg", "body": "Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Donald Trump arrived in Florida ahead of an appearance in a Miami federal courthouse on Tuesday afternoon. The former president faces an array of charges over his retention of classified documents including national security information, under the Espionage Act and as laid out in the indictment dramatically unsealed on Friday. Police officials in Miami sought to assure local residents they would safely handle any protests. \u201cMake no mistake about it, we\u2019re taking this event extremely seriously and there\u2019s a potential for things to take a turn for the worse,\u201d said the city\u2019s police chief, Manuel Morales. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re bringing enough resources to handle crowds, anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000.\u201d Miami\u2019s mayor, Francis Suarez, said he was confident the city\u2019s police will be able to handle the crowds and any protests if they occur. \u201cI have full faith and confidence our police will have the right action plan and resources in place,\u201d Suarez said during the news conference. \u201cWe are prepared for what will happen tomorrow.\u201d The Republican presidential candidate, Nikki Haley, said Donald Trump was \u201cincredibly reckless\u201d with the country\u2019s national security if allegations in the indictment are true. The latest comments mark a shift in tone for Haley, who just days ago tweeted that indicting a former president is \u201cnot how justice should be pursued in our country\u201d. A vast majority of Republicans believe federal charges against Trump are politically motivated, according to a new poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll also found that the indictment did not appear to affect Trump\u2019s standing in the GOP presidential nomination race, where he remains far ahead of his nearest rival, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. Oklahoma\u2019s Kevin Stitt became the first Republican governor to back Ron DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, although polls consistently show Trump has the most support among the party\u2019s voters. President Joe Biden underwent a root canal procedure, forcing him to postpone a meeting with Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. White House doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor said the president complained of tooth pain on Sunday. During his interview on the rightwing outlet Radio Libre, Trump says the allegations made against him in the federal indictment are \u201cfalse\u201d. He says that under the Presidential Records Act, he is \u201callowed to do all of those things\u201d \u2013 a claim that Trump and his lawyers have used in the past. On Friday, the National Archives released a public statement rebuking these claims, while Jason R Baron, the former director of litigation at the National Archives, told CNN: Only during his time in office does a president have the right to go through his records to separate what may be \u2018personal records\u2019 of his, from official records within the scope of the Presidential Records Act. Trump is asked if he is being held to a \u201cdouble standard\u201d over his indictment compared to the investigation into Hillary Clinton for her handling of sensitive information (in which the state department concluded that it found \u201cno persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\u201d). Trump tells the reporter that her questions are \u201cso incredible\u201d and that he can see why she is so popular. He says: My people said this is an incredible person and incredible woman. I can understand that very well. He goes on to claim that there is a \u201ctwo-tiered system of justice\u201d where \u201cinstead of getting justice and instead of getting democracy and all the things that you want, it\u2019s just the opposite\u201d. Donald Trump is being interviewed on the Spanish language conservative show Radio Libre 790 in Miami ahead of his arraignment tomorrow. He starts off by describing the indictment against him as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d by the US justice department that has been \u201cweaponised\u201d by Joe Biden. Trump says there has been an \u201cincredible love fest\u201d between the Hispanic community and himself and that he has \u201cdone a lot for everybody in that community\u201d. A vast majority of Republicans believe federal charges against Donald Trump are politically motivated, according to a new poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which ran from Friday to Monday, found that 81% of self-identified Republicans said the former president is being unfairly targeted and that politics was driving the case. About 62% of respondents said it was believable that Trump illegally stored classified material at his Florida home, as alleged by prosecutors, according to the poll. The poll also found that the indictment did not appear to affect Trump\u2019s standing in the GOP presidential nomination race, with the former president far ahead of his nearest rival, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. As court officials set up barricades and police tape around the Miami courthouse where Donald Trump is due to be arraigned on Tuesday afternoon, police officials sought to assure local residents they would safely handle any protests. Miami police chief Manny Morales said the city was ready for protests of any size. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this event extremely seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing enough resources to handle crowds, anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000. We don\u2019t expect any issues,\u201d he added. The Democratic Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, spoke about Donald Trump\u2019s indictment in his remarks on the Senate floor. He said: No one is above the law, including Donald Trump. This case must be allowed to play out through the legal process without outside political or ideological interference. Schumer said he encouraged Trump\u2019s supporters and critics to \u201cmaintain the peace and let the justice system do its work\u201d. My colleague Richard Luscombe is outside the courthouse in Miami, where he says there have been no signs of demonstrators so far. The Republican presidential candidate, Nikki Haley, has said that if the indictment against Donald Trump is true, then the former president was \u201cincredibly reckless\u201d with the country\u2019s national security. Speaking on Fox News, Haley said that if Trump did store highly sensitive documents \u2013 including on US nuclear programmes, potential US military vulnerabilities, and plans for US retaliation in the event of an attack \u2013 then this \u201cputs all of our military men and women in danger\u201d. Haley said: If this indictment is true, if what it says is actually the case, President Trump was incredibly reckless with our national security. Her latest comments mark a change in tone for Haley, who previously served as UN ambassador under Trump. Just days ago she tweeted that indicting a former president is \u201cnot how justice should be pursued in our country\u201d. Public reaction to Trump\u2019s scheduled arraignment at the Wilkie D Ferguson federal courthouse may be a window into the shifting political character of Miami and Trump\u2019s strong support among Latino Americans. The Associated Press reported that Alex Otaola, a Cuban-born YouTube personality who is running for Miami-Dade county mayor, has rallied followers to show up in support of the former president. Otaola said in a YouTube clip: Those of us who believe that America\u2019s salvation only comes if Donald Trump is elected for a second term, we will gather on Tuesday. Demonstrators and supporters of Donald Trump have been gathering outside the Trump National Doral Miami golf course to greet the former president ahead of his federal arraignment tomorrow. The White House\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, was earlier asked if President Joe Biden had read the indictment against Donald Trump. My colleague David Smith reports that Jean-Pierre replied: I\u2019m just not going to comment. House Republicans are meanwhile keeping up their defense of Donald Trump. Politico reports that Jim Jordan, the judiciary committee chair and close ally of the former president, is considering calling for special counsel Jack Smith to appear before his committee. Appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland, Smith last week brought the federal charges against Trump over the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago. The justice department has typically declined to provide information about ongoing investigations, and it\u2019s unlikely to acquiesce to any request Jordan chooses to make: The Guardian\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong is now taking over the blog, and will keep you posted on the rest of the day\u2019s news. While House speaker Kevin McCarthy and other top Republicans have loudly decried the federal indictment of Donald Trump over the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago, one of the biggest names on Capitol Hill is keeping quiet. CNN reports that Mitch McConnell, the top-ranking Republican in the Senate, has refused to address the issue, despite the attempts of reporters: It\u2019s not too much of a surprise for the Kentuckian, who reportedly despises the former president for his role in the January 6 insurrection. It\u2019s also worth remembering the influential role Trump played in selecting Republican candidates for Senate seats in last November\u2019s midterm elections \u2013 most of which were defeated by Democrats, scuppering McConnell\u2019s hopes of retaking control of the chamber. At the White House press briefing, Karine Jean-Pierre said that Joe Biden\u2019s root canal was successful, and \u201cthe president is doing just fine,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports: Joe Biden has rescheduled his public events for Tuesday as he undergoes a root canal, Reuters reports. Biden was expected to later today meet with Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, as well as hold a reception for American diplomats. Vice-president Kamala Harris took his place in presiding over a celebration of college sports champions earlier today at the White House. Donald Trump has arrived in Florida ahead of his arraignment in Miami tomorrow, CNN reports, and with his legal team for the appearance still in flux: At the ongoing White House press briefing, national security council spokesman John Kirby was asked about the national security implications of the documents found in Donald Trump\u2019s possession at Mar-a-Lago. His response amounted to an elaborate \u201cno comment\u201d. \u201cI think the office of the director of national intelligence has already spoken to the fact that they were conducting a national security assessment, and I would refer you to them. I don\u2019t have any update on that one way or the other,\u201d Kirby responded. After the indictment was unsealed on Friday, the Secret Service released a statement that essentially said Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment would be handled like any other event he attends: Mayor Francis Suarez returned to the podium to say that Miami will draw on its experience from the protests that followed George Floyd\u2019s death in 2020 during Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment tomorrow. \u201cDuring the George Floyd protest, there were 10s of 1,000s or 1,000s of people on our streets in Miami. We were prepared. I think we were a model for how to deal with those protests in the country,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cAnd I have full faith and confidence that our department, as the chief just said, that has dealt with many, many kinds of protests that are very, very large, we\u2019ll have the right action plan and we\u2019ll have the right resources in place in the right place to make sure that there are no incidents.\u201d Up next is Miami police chief Manny Morales, who repeated that the city is ready for protests of any size. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this event extremely seriously. We know that there is a potential of things taking a turn for the worst, but that\u2019s not the Miami way,\u201d Morales said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing enough resources to handle crowds, anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000. We don\u2019t expect any issues,\u201d he continued. Florida mayor Francis Suarez starts the news conference by saying that preparations have already began for Trump\u2019s appearance in federal court tomorrow. He says officials will \u201cmake sure everyone has the right to peacefully express themselves and exercise their right to protest\u201d. Miami officials are due to hold a news conference regarding preparations and security measures for Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment in federal court on Tuesday. The press conference is scheduled to begin at 2pm EST. We\u2019ll be following it live on the blog. House speaker Kevin McCarthy has been speaking with reporters for the first time since news of Donald Trump\u2019s indictment, and was asked if it was a \u201cgood look\u201d for the former president to have allegedly stored boxes of classified material in a bathroom. McCarthy replied: I don\u2019t know. Is it a good picture to have boxes in a garage that opens up all the time? A bathroom door locks. According to the 49-page federal indictment unsealed Friday, the former president kept boxes of documents in various locations at his Mar-a-Lago estate, including an office space, his bedroom, a storage room, a bathroom, a ballroom and in the shower. Donald Trump has vowed to appoint \u201ca real special \u2018prosecutor\u2019\u201d to \u201cgo after\u201d Joe Biden and his family if he wins re-election next year. In an all-caps post on Truth Social, Trump said: Now that the \u2018seal\u2019 is broken, in addition to closing the border &amp; removing all of the \u2018criminal\u2019 elements that have illegally invaded our country, making America energy independent, &amp; even dominant again, &amp; immediately ending the war between Russia &amp; Ukraine, I will appoint a real special \u2018prosecutor\u2019 to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the USA, Joe Biden, the entire Biden crime family, &amp; all others involved with the destruction of our elections, borders, &amp; country itself! Donald Trump is getting ready for his arraignment on federal charges in Miami tomorrow. The former president has spent today thus far attacking his opponents, and looking for attorneys to represent him in what will be the second time this year he has had to appear in court to answer to criminal charges. Meanwhile in Washington, Joe Biden is undergoing a root canal, but is still expected to meet with Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg this afternoon. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt endorsed Ron DeSantis for president, drawing Trump\u2019s ire. With much of the American news media focused on Miami\u2019s federal courthouse tomorrow ahead of Trump\u2019s appearance, no-name presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said he would hold a press conference in the morning, before the former president\u2019s appearance. Tucker Carlson is back on Twitter, but Fox News is not having it, and wants him off the air. One of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest allies on the airwaves was Tucker Carlson, but his reign ended when Fox News cancelled his show in April. Carlson has reemerged with a Twitter broadcast that he says will be his new project, but as the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly reports, Fox is not pleased: Tucker Carlson\u2019s lawyer says he \u201cwill not be silenced by anyone\u201d after it was reported that Fox News had sent the primetime host it fired a letter demanding he cease and desist presenting a new show on Twitter. \u201cDoubling down on the most catastrophic programming decision in the history of the cable news industry, Fox is now demanding that Tucker Carlson be silent until after the 2024 election,\u201d lawyer Harmeet Dhillon told Axios, which first reported the Fox letter. \u201cTucker will not be silenced by anyone \u2026 He is a singularly important voice on matters of public interest in our country, and will remain so.\u201d Dhillon is a prominent Republican attorney who recently failed in an attempt to lead the GOP national committee. Fox fired Carlson in April, shortly after reaching a $787.5m settlement in a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the broadcast of Donald Trump\u2019s lies about electoral fraud in his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is nowhere in the polls despite a well-funded campaign and slew of media appearances, but he\u2019s looking to make the most of Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment tomorrow. He just announced that he would hold an event outside the Miami courthouse where Trump will appear at 10.30am Tuesday: It\u2019s not a bad bet for the biotech entrepreneur\u2019s quest to boost his candidacy, considering that Trump\u2019s court appearance will undoubtedly be the biggest news of tomorrow, and the courthouse surrounded by reporters. Here\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s convoy as it makes its way from his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club to the airport, where the former president plans to fly to Florida ahead of tomorrow\u2019s arraignment: The White House said Joe Biden will not be under anesthesia during his root canal today, meaning the 25th amendment won\u2019t be invoked. Ratified in 1967, the amendment is one of the most recent additions to the constitution, and outlines the procedure for the vice-president to temporarily assume the president\u2019s duties at the chief executive\u2019s request. In November 2021, Biden used its authority to hand power to Kamala Harris while he underwent a colonoscopy. Oklahoma\u2019s Kevin Stitt became the first Republican governor to back Ron DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, even though polls consistently show Donald Trump has the most support among the party\u2019s voters. Here\u2019s more from Stitt on why he chose to throw his support behind Florida governor DeSantis, who has become a prime target for Trump\u2019s vitriol ever since announcing his campaign last month: The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that Donald Trump is spending today assembling his legal team ahead of his Tuesday arraignment in Miami, where he\u2019ll enter the courthouse through a side door. Here\u2019s more from Hugo: Joe Biden will soon be doing one of the most unpleasant things a person can do: enduring a root canal. In a just-released letter from White House doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor, the president is revealed to have complained of tooth pain on Sunday, necessitating a root canal that will take place today. \u201cOur Presidential Dental Team from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was able to perform an examination, to include x-rays, in the White House Dental Operatory. They determined that endodontic treatment (root canal) was most appropriate. Initial root canal procedure was performed at the time, with a plan for specialized endodontal follow up in the near future. The President tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications,\u201d O\u2019Connor writes. \u201cHe is experiencing further discomfort this morning, which was anticipated. The endodontal specialty team from Walter Reed will complete the President\u2019s root canal today, at the White House.\u201d The White House just pushed its press briefing back to 2.15pm, so perhaps we\u2019ll hear more about the procedure then. Donald Trump is back at it with as much venom as ever on Truth Social this morning. Here he is with his usual rhetoric, in a post from about an hour ago: Getting ready to head down to Doral in Miami. We must all be STRONG and DEFEAT the Communists, Marxists, and Radical Left Lunatics that are systematically destroying our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! And taking out his anger on Kevin Stitt, the Oklahoma governor who over the weekend endorsed Trump\u2019s rival Ron DeSantis for president: Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, who I didn\u2019t know very well, called me before his last election to say he was in BIG trouble and very much needed my Endorsement. I LOVE Oklahoma &amp; won 76 out of 76 Districts, something that never happened before. Ronald Reagan was next with 56. Anyway, I gave him my endorsement, he immediately went way up, and won. Now, despite the fact that DeSanctimonious is losing to Biden, &amp; me, Stitt just endorsed him. Wow! He disliked \u201cthe Indians\u201d &amp; my great Senate pick! The scene of the action tomorrow will be Miami\u2019s Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr US courthouse, where photographers have captured a placid scene over the last few days. Including a crowing rooster: Expect that atmosphere to change once Donald Trump shows up. One of the most incendiary statements following Donald Trump\u2019s federal indictment came from Kari Lake, the Arizona gubernatorial candidate who famously refused to concede her election loss last November. A top Democrat in the state warns there\u2019s nothing funny about her comments, the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly reports: The Arizona Republican Kari Lake\u2019s vow of armed resistance over Donald Trump\u2019s indictment for retaining classified records \u201cthreatens the very core of our democracy\u201d, an Arizonan Democratic congressman said. Ruben Gallego is running to replace the former Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the US Senate next year. He said: \u201cI know this language isn\u2019t just hyperbole \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous and it threatens the very core of our democracy.\u201d The 38-count federal indictment against Trump was unsealed Friday. He is due to appear in court in Florida on Tuesday. Jack Smith, the special counsel, told reporters he would \u201cseek a speedy trial\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s allies spent the weekend railing against the federal charges announced against the former president, raising fears of a repeat of the violence that accompanied his departure from the White House, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Belligerent and conspiracy-laden rhetoric from high-profile Republican backers of Donald Trump has heightened fears that the former US president\u2019s campaign against his legal troubles could trigger political violence. Fewer than 24 hours after Donald Trump was indicted, Arizona congressman Andy Biggs went on Twitter and used violent language to call for retribution. \u201cWe have now reached a war phase,\u201d he said. \u201cAn eye for an eye.\u201d Clay Higgins, another Republican congressman from Louisiana, gave militaristic instructions to his followers. \u201cThis is a perimeter probe from the oppressors. Hold. rPOTUS has this,\u201d he tweeted, using an abbreviation to refer to Trump as the real president. Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment on charges related to hoarding secret government documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort is set for 3pm in Miami tomorrow, but many details of the appearance are currently unclear. Federal defendants typically have mugshots and fingerprints taken at their initial court dates, and many are handcuffed. But when Trump appeared at a Manhattan courthouse in April to answer an indictment brought by district attorney Alvin Bragg for allegedly falsifying business records, only his fingerprints were recorded. He was not handcuffed, and, despite what his campaign and other backers want you to believe, no mugshot was taken. So the big question of today is whether special counsel Jack Smith and his team of federal prosecutors will accord Trump the same arrangements. We\u2019ll keep an eye out for more about that. Good morning, US politics blog readers. After a weekend spent raging about last week\u2019s federal indictment both in person and on his Truth social account, Donald Trump will be back in Florida today to prepare for his arraignment in Miami on Tuesday. There, he\u2019s set to personally answer the federal charges related to keeping a trove of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort, the gravest legal threat the former president has yet faced. He clearly has no intention of showing up to the courthouse alone, telling his supporters \u201cSEE YOU IN MIAMI ON TUESDAY!!!\u201d in a Friday evening post that wasn\u2019t too far off in tone from the \u201cBe there, will be wild!\u201d message he sent out days before the January 6 insurrection. Today may well be the calm before the Tuesday storm, but there should be plenty of news about the logistics of Trump\u2019s court appearance, his second as a defendant after being indicted by Manhattan\u2019s district attorney back in March. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Joe Biden has a busy day at the White House, including a meeting with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg at 3.15pm eastern time, as well as celebrating College Athlete Day at 11.30am. Will he seize the occasion to comment on the charges against Trump? Probably not, but you can bet the White House press corps will be asking him about it. For days, the House of Representatives has been paralyzed by a revolt led by rightwing Republicans. Expect speaker Kevin McCarthy and his deputies to take another shot today at breaking the deadlock. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre briefs reporters at 1pm."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/13/home-office-expands-scheme-to-pardon-those-criminalised-for-gay-activity", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Home Office expands scheme to pardon those criminalised for gay activity", "lead": "Women will be able to apply for convictions and cautions under repealed or abolished offences to be wiped", "author": "Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T23:01:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080105", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2ea2e3e1d0c5815f209aaeedc3a11facbd4fb09a/0_107_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "A scheme to pardon people unjustly criminalised for alleged gay or lesbian activity has been expanded, the Home Office has announced. For the first time, women will be able to apply for their records to be wiped if they have been convicted or cautioned under any repealed or abolished offences relating to same-sex activity. Until now, only men have been able to apply to have convictions wiped under the government\u2019s disregards and pardons scheme. These largely focused on offences of buggery and gross indecency between men. From Tuesday, offences such as \u201csolicitation by men\u201d will be included. More army veterans will also be able to apply for convictions brought under service law to be erased. Under the plans, first announced last year, those who were unjustly criminalised will be pardoned and their convictions deleted from official records. The minister for safeguarding, Sarah Dines, said: \u201cThe appalling criminalisation of homosexuality is a shameful and yet not so distant part of our history. Although they can never be undone, the disregards and pardons scheme has gone some way to right the wrongs of the past.\u201d Since 2012, men have been able to apply to have their convictions or cautions for consensual sex with another man disregarded. Last year, changes were announced to widen the range of civilian and service offences under the scheme, as well as allowing women to apply. A disregard applies to offences where the other party was 16 or over and the activity is not a crime today. Craig Jones, the executive chair of the LGBT+ veterans\u2019 charity Fighting With Pride, and Caroline Paige, its chief executive, said: \u201cThis extension to the disregards and pardons scheme and its inclusion of female veterans is welcome and another small step in the right direction. \u201cWe will continue to work very closely with the Ministry of Defence and other government departments to ensure the vulnerable veterans in this cohort get all the support available to them.\u201d Women in the military who were dismissed on the grounds of their sexuality and anyone sacked for it will be able to have their service medals restored if they were taken away when they were kicked out of the armed forces. Gay rights campaigners welcomed the move as the \u201cfirst step on a journey\u201d but said that issues such as enduring criminal records, lost pension rights and still-blemished service records needed to be dealt with by the Ministry of Defence. By law, gay men and lesbian women were banned from serving in the British military until 2000. About 200 to 250 people were thrown out each year because of their sexuality, and frequently had their service medals removed."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/13/three-day-strike-doctors-england-expected-to-have-enormous-impact", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "Three-day strike by doctors in England expected to have \u2018enormous impact\u2019", "lead": "Junior doctors are seeking a 35% salary rise to restore the value of their pay to 2008-09 levels", "author": "Denis Campbell Health policy editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T23:01:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080108", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e024b661a7c8079aa08ffe90ea820c9e436b5b0e/0_0_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "Almost all routine NHS care in England will be disrupted for three days this week when junior doctors strike in their latest attempt to force ministers to increase their pay. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, said the stoppage would have an enormous impact and lead to huge numbers of patients missing out on planned care. Many thousands of junior doctors are due to stage a 72-hour walkout starting at 7am on Wednesday and continuing until 7am on Saturday. \u201cThe NHS has been preparing extensively for this next set of strikes,\u201d said Powis. \u201cBut we know that \u2013 with the sheer number of appointments that need to be rescheduled \u2013 it will have an enormous impact on routine care for patients and on the waiting list, as procedures can take time to rearrange with multiple teams involved.\u201d About 27,000 junior doctors stayed off work every day and 196,000 outpatient appointments and operations had to be postponed when they held their last strike, over four days in April. They are seeking a 35% salary rise to restore the value of their pay to 2008-09 levels. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, has said their claim was unreasonable. The British Medical Association\u2019s junior doctors\u2019 committee intends to start reballoting its members next week, seeking a new mandate for strikes for a further six months that, if enough doctors back renewed strike action to meet the legal threshold, could result in walkouts until early 2024. The union intends to stage a three-day stoppage every month for the foreseeable future. Speaking to Sophie Ridge on Sky News on Sunday, committee co-chair Dr Robert Laurenson defended its tactics, saying: \u201cOur members have given us a clear instruction: they would like us to pursue full pay restoration back to 2008 and that\u2019s what we intend to do in our representation of our doctors and our healthcare system.\u201d The NHS Confederation, which represents health service trusts, said patients\u2019 health could suffer because this week\u2019s stoppage would exacerbate the NHS\u2019s care backlog, which already stands at a record 7.4 million. \u201cThe delay to elective care is what concerns [trust] leaders most, and has a real impact on patients, many of whom will have already been waiting a long time only to see their operation cancelled,\u201d said Matthew Taylor, the confederation\u2019s chief executive. The impact of this can be significant, with patients potentially developing complications or their condition worsening as a result. \u201cIt also means that the waiting list, currently at 7.4 million, is likely to grow further and take longer to clear,\u201d he said. Fewer consultants are willing to work extra shifts to help cover for striking junior colleagues unless they are paid rates that the British Medical Association, the main doctors\u2019 union, believes are appropriate \u2013 but which many trusts see as excessive. Trusts plan to have as many staff on duty as possible during the strike. But hospitals lobby group NHS Providers voiced concern that too few may be available to work nightshifts. \u201cStaff groups including consultants, paramedics, pharmacists and community matrons will be able to support [services], though there\u2019s a worry around finding adequate night cover,\u201d said Saffron Cordery, the organisation\u2019s deputy chief executive. More than 542,000 consultations and surgical procedures have been rescheduled across the NHS since nurses, ambulance staff, junior doctors and physiotherapists began striking over pay last December. \u201cThis figure will now likely climb in the coming days and weeks, especially if nurses, consultants and radiographers soon vote in favour of industrial action,\u201d Cordery said. She urged the BMA and ministers to resume negotiations. \u201cThis can\u2019t continue,\u201d she said. \u201cWe risk sleepwalking into a summer of strikes if talks don\u2019t resume as a matter of urgency.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/13/hamilton-star-reuben-joseph-to-play-macbeth-for-the-rsc", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Hamilton star Reuben Joseph to play Macbeth for the RSC", "lead": "The West End actor says the Shakespearean role has \u2018the disastrous consequences of ambition\u2019 in common with Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical", "author": "Chris Wiegand", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T23:01:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080109", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7f318186610e3724c84fec9f61508b9824b5047d/596_931_5540_3324/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cThey think me Macbeth,\u201d sings Reuben Joseph in the West End production of Hamilton, quoting the Scottish king\u2019s famous line \u201ctomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\u201d in the song Take a Break.

Both are also making their debuts for the RSC. Kane said she was \u201cfascinated by the interplay of the feminine and masculine, both within her and within the play. The complexities of relationship dynamics, and the investigation of a woman\u2019s power in her marriage and in society, are so fertile here \u2026 As the only Irish actor in an otherwise all-Scottish company, there\u2019s an added dynamic to the Macbeth\u2019s relationship which I\u2019m looking forward to exploring in rehearsals; the idea of Lady Macbeth as other, as an outsider.\u201d Wilson said the production would be set in an imagined near-future: \u201cthe climate is more extreme, there\u2019s scarcity of resources and war. It\u2019s a play about choices, the choices the Macbeths make, the choices all the characters make, and it asks us to look at our own choices and where they might lead.\u201d Macbeth runs at the Royal Shakespeare theatre from 19 August to 14 October. The production will be designed by Georgia McGuinness, one of Wilson\u2019s regular collaborators, and choreographed by Julia Cheng, whose credits include the current West End hit Cabaret. In November, Ralph Fiennes and Indira Varma will play the lead roles in Simon Godwin\u2019s tour of Macbeth, which opens in Liverpool.

Amendments added to the economic crime and corporate transparency bill will bring a swift end to the vast majority of Slapps (strategic lawsuits against public participation), ministers claim. The government has been under pressure to legislate on the issue amid concerns Slapps are being used by wealthy individuals \u2013 especially Russian oligarchs \u2013 to stifle free speech and deter investigations into their affairs by journalists, writers and campaigners. The amendments create an early dismissal mechanism in the courts based on two tests: whether a case is a Slapp and whether the claim has a reasonable chance of being successful. The onus will be on the complainants to prove that their case has merit, rather than on the defendant. The justice secretary, Alex Chalk, said: \u201cThese measures will protect the values of freedom of speech that underpin our democracy and help better protect reporters who are shining a light on their crimes.\u201d The definition of a Slapp in the bill refers to behaviour by the claimant that \u201chas, or is intended to have, the effect of restraining the defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to freedom of speech\u201d. Their behaviour must also be intended to cause the defendant harassment, alarm or distress, expense or any other harm or convenience beyond that ordinarily encountered in litigation. The new law is limited to information in the public interest related to economic crime, which at least 70% of UK Slapps relate to, according to research from the Foreign Policy Centre (FPC), disappointing campaigners who want a broader application. The UK Anti-Slapp Coalition, co-chaired by the FPC, Index on Censorship and English Pen, welcomed the amendment but said it should protect all public interest speech. It also expressed concerns that it was contingent on the intent of the claimant, which it said could be a difficult, time-consuming and costly exercise to prove. Susan Coughtrie, the director of the FPC, said the amendments were \u201ca crucial step towards preventing those benefiting from proceeds of crime from being able to use them to shut down scrutiny into that wrongdoing by misusing UK law. Nevertheless, this is only a partial success story \u2013 the UK government must move as quickly as possible to ensure such protections are available to all those subject to Slapps, regardless of the subject matter.\u201d The amendments come days after the former cabinet minister David Davis used a point of order in parliament to hail a high court judge\u2019s decision to strike out a defamation claim brought by the Conservative party donor Mohamed Amersi against the former Tory MP Charlotte Leslie as \u201ca great victory for free speech\u201d. Davis called the case a Slapp, but this has been rejected by Amersi who said \u201cnothing could be further from the truth\u201d.

The report warns that the state is poorly prepared for the changes that AI could unleash. \u201cAI\u2019s unpredictable development, the rate of change and its ever increasing power means its arrival could present the most substantial policy challenge ever faced, for which the state\u2019s existing approaches and channels are poorly configured,\u201d says the report, titled A New National Purpose: AI promises a world-leading future of Britain. AI has shot up the political agenda in the UK and other countries after breakthroughs in generative AI, which can produce convincing text, images and even voice on command. Rapid developments in AI technology, pushed by factors such as greater computing power, breakthroughs in neural network design and the availability of datasets to build powerful tools like the ChatGPT chatbot, has prompted calls from senior figures in tech for a pause in building powerful systems. Concerns about AI range from the potential for generative AI to produce disinformation to AI technology developing beyond human control. Policy recommendations from the report by the Tony Blair Institute include requiring generative AI companies to label the media they produce as \u201cdeepfakes\u201d and for unlabelled deepfakes to be removed from the internet. The report also calls for publicly owned datasets to help build responsible AI systems, as well as the creation of a national laboratory focused on researching and testing safe AI, with the aim of it becoming an international AI regulator. The report also recommends that any entity wishing to access government-controlled computing power for use in building AI systems must show \u201cresponsible use\u201d of it. It says the UK is \u201coverly dependent\u201d on the Google-owned DeepMind, a world-leading AI company, and needs to develop more businesses like it. If the country does not adapt quickly, there is a risk of never catching up with other countries such as the US, home of the ChatGPT developer OpenAI, the report states. Keir Starmer will set out a stark warning about the risks that the technology poses when he speaks to the London Tech Week conference on Tuesday. The Labour leader will compare the possible effects on the British labour market to the deindustrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s, saying: \u201cThe question facing our country is who will benefit from this disruption? Will it leave some behind, as happened with deindustrialisation across vast swathes of our country? Or can it help build a society where everyone is included, and inequalities are narrowed, not widened?\u201d Lucy Powell, the shadow digital secretary, has called for a licensing model for those working on large datasets that can be used to train tools such as ChatGPT, while Labour is also considering whether a separate AI regulator may be needed. Starmer\u2019s tone is likely to differ noticeably from that of Rishi Sunak, who told the same conference on Monday that he was excited about the benefits the technology could bring. \u201cWe\u2019re harnessing AI to transform our public services, from saving teachers hundreds of hours of time spent lesson planning to helping NHS patients get quicker diagnoses and more accurate tests,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cAI can help us achieve the holy grail of public service reform: better, more efficient services.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/uk-innovators-get-43m-to-develop-space-based-solar-power", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "UK innovators get \u00a34.3m to develop space-based solar power ", "lead": "Minister says technology to collect energy and beam it to Earth could help boost UK\u2019s energy security", "author": "Linda Geddes Science correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T23:01:32Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080117", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ece419401f7ad080eb43d3f3311499335cb39b/0_1026_5604_3363/500.jpg", "body": "UK universities and tech companies are to receive \u00a34.3m in government funding to develop space-based solar power. The technology, which collects energy from the sun using satellite-mounted panels and beams it to Earth, had huge potential to boost the UK\u2019s energy security, the UK\u2019s energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said. Although the idea of building commercial power stations in space may sound far-fetched, the space industry has long been at the forefront of solar power development. Indeed, the need to power satellites was a key driver in increasing the efficiency of solar panels that generate electricity for homes and businesses, said Dr Mamatha Maheshwarappa, the payload systems lead at the UK Space Agency. Among the recipients of the funding from the government\u2019s space-based solar power innovation competition are Cambridge University, which is developing ultra-lightweight solar panels that can withstand the high radiation levels encountered in space, and Queen Mary University of London, which is developing a wireless system to allow space-harvested solar power to be safely beamed to Earth. This month, scientists at the California Institute of Technology in the US claimed to have successfully transmitted solar power to Earth from space for the first time, using a prototype spacecraft called Maple that was launched into orbit in January. It uses an array of flexible lightweight transmitters to convert electricity into microwaves before beaming them to a specific location on Earth \u2013 in this case, a receiver on the roof of a building on Caltech\u2019s campus in Pasadena \u2013 where they are converted back into electrical energy. Assuming that the technology can be made to work on a large scale, there would be some significant advantages to space-based solar farms. Because there is no atmosphere in space, the sun\u2019s light is undiluted, meaning each panel would be able to generate more energy compared with an equivalent panel on Earth. The solar energy would also be more predictable and continuous due to the absence of day-night cycles, cloud cover and seasonal variations in sunlight. A UK government-commissioned independent study in 2021 found that space-based solar power could generate up to 10GW of electricity a year \u2013 a quarter of the UK\u2019s power needs \u2013 by 2050. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has claimed it could create a multibillion-pound industry and up to 143,000 jobs across the country. Announcing the funding at London Tech Week, Shapps said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking a giant leap by backing the development of this exciting technology and putting the UK at the forefront of this rapidly emerging industry as it prepares for launch. By winning this new space race, we can transform the way we power our nation and provide cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy for generations to come.\u201d Other projects to be awarded funding are: Satellite Applications Catapult Ltd in Didcot, for an experiment to test the electronic steering and beam quality of its space satellite antenna technology; MicroLink Devices UK Ltd in Port Talbot, to develop the next generation of lightweight, flexible solar panels; and the University of Bristol, to produce a simulation of solar space wireless power transfer capability and provide further evidence on the performance, safety and reliability of space-based solar. Imperial College London and EDF Energy will also receive funding for studies to assess how electricity from space-based power stations could be integrated into the electricity grid alongside other low-carbon energy sources."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/12/kylian-mbappe-stuns-psg-with-formal-decision-not-to-renew-contract-real-madrid", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 stuns PSG with formal decision not to renew contract in 2024", "lead": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has shocked PSG by presenting a formal letter to the club, with a sale this summer \u2013 possibly to Real Madrid \u2013 now the most likely scenario", "author": "Michael Butler", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T22:35:08Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080127", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b215eaa7015f9b9dbcd8780bdab238860cbad3cf/0_178_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has stunned Paris Saint-Germain by presenting a formal letter to the club\u2019s hierarchy, informing them of his decision not to take up the option of a one-year contract extension next summer. Unless Mbapp\u00e9 is convinced to either reverse his decision or negotiate a completely new deal, the striker\u2019s contract will expire in June 2024, when the 24-year-old would be able to leave PSG on a free transfer. The club hierarchy are said to have taken the news in the letter badly, having previously thought that talks over a contract renewal were progressing well. The most likely scenario now appears to be a sale this summer, with PSG keen to avoid losing their star asset for free. Despite the contract situation, Mbapp\u00e9 would probably still demand an astronomical fee, perhaps even eclipsing the \u00a3166m that PSG paid for him in 2018. The news will interest every elite club in Europe, particularly in the Premier League. Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea have all been linked in the past but Real Madrid is the obvious destination now. The Spanish club have coveted Mbapp\u00e9 since his breakthrough season in 2016 at Monaco, and the feeling is mutual: the Frenchman was pictured as a child with Real posters on his bedroom wall, and even met Cristiano Ronaldo when he was 14. The void left by Karim Benzema\u2019s departure to Saudi Arabia only heightens the chances of Mbapp\u00e9 making the move to Madrid. Mbapp\u00e9 has long been admired by Madrid\u2019s president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, and even after the shock renewal of his PSG contract last year \u2013 a deal that was said to include a salary of \u00a320m after tax and a signing bonus in excess of \u00a3100m \u2013 the striker spoke openly about the idea of joining Madrid and called P\u00e9rez personally last year to explain his decision to stay. \u201cI have lots of respect for [P\u00e9rez] and for Real Madrid,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 said in May 2022. \u201cThey wanted to do a lot to make me happy. So I thank them for that. I\u2019d also like to thank Real fans. I hope they\u2019ll understand the fact I\u2019ve chosen to stay [at PSG].\u201d All that seems to have shifted now. Mbapp\u00e9 is determined to leave PSG, where he has already won everything domestically, including five league titles and the Ligue 1 top scorer award, also on five occasions. During his time at PSG, Mbapp\u00e9 has also won the World Cup in 2018, scoring in the final against Croatia, and hit a hat-trick in France\u2019s defeat by Argentina in the 2022 World Cup final. The Champions League is one trophy that has eluded Mbapp\u00e9, but PSG are expected to be a weaker team in Europe next season. Lionel Messi has already confirmed that he is joining Inter Miami and Neymar has also been heavily linked with a move away. PSG have not given up hope of convincing Mbapp\u00e9 to stay, but the letter represents a crushing blow to the club. Should Mbapp\u00e9 leave, PSG\u2019s dream of Champions League glory would surely be further away, not closer."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/12/new-york-police-chief-keechant-sewell-quits", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "New York police chief Keechant Sewell quits after 18 months", "lead": "Sewell, first woman to hold post, says \u2018my time here will come to a close\u2019 amid reports of tension with mayor Eric Adams", "author": "Guardian staff and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T22:30:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080130", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/90c4ca5ed61caad1a20bdcc2a8646556195259d6/0_0_3960_2376/500.jpg", "body": "New York City\u2019s police commissioner Keechant Sewell, the first woman to hold the position, is stepping down after 18 months on the job.

Sarah Beeny vs Cancer cracks open a window into a more personal area of her life. In August 2022, Beeny was diagnosed with breast cancer. At first, she thought she might keep it to herself and not go public with the news, but in this hour-long documentary about her diagnosis and treatment, she explains that she realised making a film about it might help her, and might help anyone else going through it, too. The film starts three weeks after Beeny\u2019s diagnosis. She has three lumps in her left breast, she explains, which are grade 3, \u201cthe most active type\u201d. Beeny\u2019s mother died of breast cancer at 39 and much of this film sees Beeny exploring her own treatment while comparing it with what her mother went through 40 years earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 40 years waiting to be told I have breast cancer,\u201d she says, while still joking with the camera crew that they didn\u2019t know what sort of film they were letting themselves in for. This is a story told with frankness and good humour, and is more sensitive and less combative than the title suggests. Beeny decides early on that \u201cbreast\u201d is too clinical a term and she will refer to them as \u201cboobs, actually\u201d. When she has reconstructive surgery, she likens it to \u201cstuffing a cushion \u2026 with memory foam\u201d. Her husband, Graham, calls her \u201ca force of nature\u201d and offers a useful perspective on what it is like to be the partner of someone receiving cancer treatment. Her four teenage sons do the same for children understanding and coping with a parent\u2019s illness. She decides to cut her hair off before it falls out and the boys help her. She donates it to a charity that will turn it into a wig for children. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad at all,\u201d she says. This \u201cinner steel\u201d sustains her for a while, but it certainly becomes much less of a steely film as it goes on. One of her great fears is that she won\u2019t be there for her sons. \u201cPeople need their mother,\u201d she says, her voice understandably cracking with emotion. She was 10 when her mum died. When she got her own diagnosis, she had spent so long anticipating it that she interpreted it as the doctors saying: \u201cWhich colour coffin do you fancy?\u201d One of the main threads of the documentary is how much has changed since her mum died in 1982, which she learns about through her mother\u2019s medical records. Later, she talks about the film as exploring the past (her mother) and the present (her own illness), but she also takes it into the future, meeting the inventor of a new technology that analyses tissue through the smoke produced when operating on it. She also hears that survival rates have vastly improved over the past 40 years. Beeny admits that she is confronting her fears and handling them by meeting them head-on. She is attempting to roll up her sleeves and get on with cancer, too. She says that she has a tendency to go into organisational mode in a crisis, which will not surprise anyone who has seen her property shows. Even here, we see her filming an episode of her afternoon series the day after she leaves hospital. Yet it doesn\u2019t shy away from how tough chemotherapy can be, nor does it ignore the \u201crollercoaster\u201d of treatment and the decisions that must be made. Beeny does not want cameras to show her first chemo session, but later, we see it. \u201cThis is it, really,\u201d she says, having a biscuit. She shows us the times she feels relatively OK afterwards, and the times she feels so awful that she has to go into A&amp;E. We see her undergoing an ultrasound to measure the tumours. After the mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, she says that \u201ceverything hurts, to be honest\u201d, and it takes her some weeks to start to feel well again. Her candour is a crucial element and it offers important balance. This is a well-rounded documentary that aims to be of some use to others, and is likely to fulfil that brief. In opening up about her own experiences, Beeny urges others not to be afraid. Don\u2019t be too afraid to get your breasts \u2013 sorry, boobs \u2013 checked, she says, as her own treatment reaches a sort-of endpoint, and she reminds viewers that progress is being made, every day. \u2022 Sarah Beeny Vs Cancer is on Channel 4."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/12/best-interests-review-sharon-horgan-is-magnificently-ferocious-as-a-mum-in-agony", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "title": "Best Interests review \u2013 Sharon Horgan is magnificently ferocious as a mum in agony", "lead": "Horgan and Michael Sheen star in this masterly and profoundly moving series about the terrible reality of having a disabled child in a world where you must fight constantly for them to live", "author": "Lucy Mangan", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T21:00:30Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080137", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/90dfaa96e9075c0124f25e9cffa81d4a8f474d5f/0_57_4500_2701/500.jpg", "body": "Primum non nocere \u2013 first, do no harm. Such a simple medical principle in theory, such a complex one in practice. And made even more so with every medical advance that allows us to keep people alive for longer. Best Interests is a four-part drama by award-winning screenwriter Jack Thorne about a parent\u2019s fight to stop the withdrawal of treatment from her daughter, who is comatose and brain damaged by the consequences of a rare form of muscular dystrophy \u2013 or, as the mother puts it, \u201cLetting her die\u201d. It is not based on any particular real-life case, though it of course brings to mind nearly one-year-old Charlie Gard and 12-year-old Archie Battersbee, whose fates had to be decided by the courts when doctors and their parents could not agree on a course of action \u2013 or inaction \u2013 for the children. Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen play Nicci and Andrew, the parents of young teenager Marnie (Niamh Moriarty, in her first screen role) and 17-year-old Katie (Alison Oliver, in only her second screen role after her debut in Conversations With Friends). Marnie was diagnosed with her life-limiting condition as a baby. We see this and many other vignettes of Marnie and the family\u2019s life in flashback. What begins with them trying to find the right room and wondering how to pronounce the doctors\u2019 names will end with them knowing every hospital ward like the backs of their hands, administering complex drug regimes and knowing some of the doctors for longer than they do some of their friends. Best Interests is bookended by scenes of Nicci speaking to the waiting press pack as she is about to enter the court hearing, watched from afar by Andrew. She says she is fighting for her daughter\u2019s life and the stage seems set for a simple tale of a mother\u2019s blazing, blinding love set against coldly correct science. But at the close of the episode we get her entire speech \u2013 delivered with magnificent ferocity by Horgan \u2013 showing the court case as only a continuation of the fight \u201cfor money, for wheelchairs, for breathing equipment, night-time support, educational support \u2026 while those in power tried to cheat us out of what our children need\u201d. The hour in between provides a masterly and profoundly moving examination of the many types of agony that arise when a child with a progressive illness reaches a point where palliative care becomes a consideration. There are no heroes and no villains here. When Nicci rages at Dr Samantha (Noma Dumezweni) after the latter introduces the idea of changing Marnie\u2019s care plan, the sense is not of battle-lines being drawn but of how quickly trust can break down and how devastating it can be for a doctor (and Samantha has cared for Marnie for seven years) to find themselves suddenly the face of evil in a parent\u2019s eyes. Thorne, a long-time supporter of disability rights who has explored the issue in his writing several times before, adds an often overlooked factor \u2013 the part that prejudice against disabled people, especially in straitened times and with a government that casts everyone not capable of maximum economic production as deadweight, plays in decisions that are made about their lives. As a result of Thorne\u2019s knowledge and experience, Best Interests is rich in the kind of detail that truly humanises and brings home the experience of a family with a chronically ill and increasingly disabled child as well as their current plight. It spends much time evoking Andrew and Nicci\u2019s years of watching and waiting, of hoping for the best but trying, if you ever can, to prepare yourself for the worst that have gone before this crisis point. It doesn\u2019t make her older, sidelined sister Katie into a rebel but shows the willing effacement that is so common and far more heartbreaking to watch in children with disabled siblings. Of course Katie yearns for more attention \u2013 and her parents yearn to give it to her \u2013 but she understands why it cannot be. It is a terrible truth that the child who is not dying has to give way to one that is. And that no parents, effectively grieving all their lives, can find the perfect way through. There is no perfect way through. Best Interests captures smaller moments of truth, too. The flood of memories that come in quiet moments, as when Andrew gets crisps at the hospital vending machine (and the importance of crisps from hospital vending machines). The bathroom cabinet full of drugs and spare tubes as well as toothbrushes and toothpaste. But suffusing it all is Nicci and Andrew\u2019s raging pain and sorrow. How does any parent bear it? Best Interests gets us closer than most dramas do to understanding all that \u201cit\u201d is. But its almost greater accomplishment is to show that the answer remains unfathomable. \u2022 Best Interests is on BBC One and iPlayer"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/morning-mail-hunter-valley-faces-bus-tragedy-poll-boost-for-albanese-berlusconi-dies", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Morning Mail: Hunter Valley faces bus tragedy, poll boost for Albanese, Berlusconi dies", "lead": "Residents grieve after wedding bus crash tragedy; Essential poll shows voters still trust Labor to handle the cost of living crisis", "author": "Martin Farrer", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T20:46:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080139", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6acf9b01a8a6407edeedbabee7db67c92e63a27a/481_497_5019_3012/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning.

A standing ovation had serenaded Phil Salt to his first Lancashire century, and his first Championship hundred since 2019, in the days when he wore a Sussex shirt. Daryl Mitchell biffed 68 blockbuster runs and George Bell made a stylish cameo, Organ wheeling away, while Mohammad Abbas and Keith Barker were furiously unlucky. Liam Dawson was shipped off to hospital for stitches in his top lip split after a ball deflected off third slip straight into his face. Fletcha Middleton and Nick Gubbins then took Hampshire to stumps, the deficit reduced to 113. The familar jingle of Essex\u2019s Simon Harmer running through a batting card from Chelmsford\u2019s River End returned to the Championship for the first time in 2023, with Somerset the unlucky opponents. Jamie Porter grabbed the first three Somerset wickets, before Harmer started his work (5-64). Sean Dickson carried his bat for 82. Essex, who had declared just before lunch, spruced up by a rapid 50 from Feroze Khushi, didn\u2019t enforce the follow on. Warwickshire have Nottinghamshire where they want them in the battle of the Midlands big dogs at Trent Bridge. After declaring on 571 for nine, Michael Burgess and Hasan Ali adding rapid morning runs for Warwickshire, whose bowlers then crunched through the Notts top order. Ed Barnard made the breakthrough when he had Ben Slater caught at first slip for 19, Hasan Ali rattled out two more and when Montgomery fell for eight, Notts had lost four for seven. Oliver Hannon-Dalby had time to join the wicket-taking club before Notts were rescued by an oncoming thunderstorm. Leus du Plooy and Haider Ali conjured a remarkable Derbyshire comeback out of a cold bowl of sick, adding an unbroken 231 for the fifth wicket from just 311 balls against Yorkshire. Derbyshire supporters, despondent at their team\u2019s 17 for four in their second innings and still 225 behind just after lunch, struggled to believe what was happening. Dawid Malan had earlier made 106. Another fightback at The Riverside, where centuries sensible (David Bedingham) and bold (Ollie Robinson) gave Durham the lead against Glamorgan. At Bristol, Gloucestershire\u2019s Ollie Price celebrated his 22nd birthday with a career-best 85 against Leicestershire, while Jake Libby dominated Worcestershire\u2019s innings against Sussex with an unbeaten 198. And Kent continued to rip up the form book, skittling Surrey for 145, declining to enforce the follow, and then building an intimidating lead. Fun, free and run by CCLive readers, what are you waiting for?! Click here to join. The code is YOZYDMWJ. In the words of Mes: all welcome! A last glance at the party division before I write up. Derbyshire doing a Leicester on Yorkshire. From 17-4, a mighty 229-4 has grown. Haider Ali 121 not out, Leus du Plooy 86 not out. The deficit only 13. Durham also in dream land, 290-5, Bedingham 118 not out plus a quick-fire 102 from t\u2019other Ollie Robinson, his second in Durham colours. They now trail Glamorgan by just 22. Gloucestershire have crept up to 330-8 at Bristol; while Jake Libby has guided Worcestershire to near parity at Hove, 167 not out. TIme for me to retire to a cooler part of the tent and write , BTL is open all hours. Sorry about the pause in updates, other tasks intervened. Hampshire have lost their first wicket here, Weatherley caught off Bailey for 12, as the sun at last loses some heat. Elsewhere, Kent have lost Compton, but at 69-1, lead the Division One leaders by 225. Somerset are in a bit lot of trouble, 159-9 against Harmer (5-60). It feels like the first time he\u2019s run through a side this season. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me if I\u2019m wrong. Incredibly, from this north-west costal perspective, bad-light has stopped play at Trent Bridge, where Notts have had a shocker, 82-5 against Rushworth, Hasan, Hannon-Dalby et al, still trail by 489. Loving Tom Hartley\u2019s red socks that suddenly come on show when he hitches his trousers up at third slip. Quite a different Lancs slip cordon to the identikit Jennings, Wells, Hartley trio that often crouch together. Today we haveMitchell, Jones, Hartley, Bell, pepper pots of different heights. Remember the Blast? It was all the rage just a few days ago. Here Gary Naylor sums up all you need to know about what\u2019s been happening. Forty overs still left of the day here at Southport as the sun creeps further into the tent. Bailey and Williams with the new ball. I see Kent decided not to enforce the follow on \u2013 I\u2019d have been tempted, but whadda I know . Kent\u2019s decision probably proved right when beaten into the ground Surrey dropped Ben Compton on 0, and they\u2019ve since moved along to 37-0 Felix Organ\u2019s 6-67 were his first wickets of the season, from four games DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 462-9dec v Somerset 123-6 Canterbury: Kent 301 and 34-0 v Surrey 145 Southport: Lancashire 374 v Hampshire 142 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 54-3 v Warwickshire 571-9dec Division Two Chesterfield: Derbyshire 111 and 167-4 v Yorkshire 353 Chester-le-Street: Durham 285-4 v Glamorgan 390 Bristol: Gloucestershire 307-8 v Leicestershire Hove: Sussex 348 v Worcestershire 205-3 Tea at Southport. I missed Felix Organ taking two in two when I popped to the loo, but got back in time to see Mason Crane spill a skier on the rope. Blatherwick last man out, for four. Organ 6-67 \u2013 a spinners wicket after all \u2013 but it helps if your batters get runs to start with. Lancs 374, a lead of 232. With the new ball proving tricky, this is going to be a nasty final session for Hampshire. Didn\u2019t expect three figures when I clicked on the score from Chesterfield. Well played du Plooy (56) and Haider (42), Derbyshire 110-4. Durham have pulled on their baz-balling pants: 234-4. Bedinghamand Robinson have put on 127 at quite a lick. Rain has again haunted Bristol, where Gloucestershire are 267-8, Ollie Price just out for 85; and Worcestershire 176-3, Jake Libby 86 not out, 172 behind Sussex\u2019s first innings. The second new ball does the business, Mohammad Abbas splitting the Mitchell and Bell partnership, Bell lbw for 45. And then another! This time Abbott, Mitchell lbw for 68. Walks off unhappily, trailing his bat. Lancs 336-7. And a fourth Hampshire slip catch goes down, Bailey edging to Vince who lets the buttery ball through his fingertips. Really time to look at Division Two now. India forfeited their entire match fee, Australia 80 per cent of their match fee, for slow over rates in the World Test Championship final. Shubman Gil was fined an additional 15 per cent of his match fee, for tweeting about the umpiring decision to give him out caught by Cameron Green. Penalty runs must be the answer, no? Mohammad Abbas has the new ball, he bowls an over with and then pulls on his jumper as he retreats to field at the rope. Man is made of ice. Bell and Mitchell have batted superbly, 73 in quick time in the hteat. Let\u2019s potter round the grounds Surrey are now eight down, for 122, but Abbott and Worrall can add big heavy runs so this isn\u2019t all over. The deficit 179 so the follow on still possible. A very pleasant scorecard for Warwicks fans in the big dog Midlands shoot out: Davies 93, Hain 100, Mousley 87, Burgess 77 not out, Hasan 54. Three wickets for the toiling Ball and four for 30-over Harrison. Notts 6-0 after five overs. \u201cWake up!!\u201d writes Brian Withington. Thank you Brian. \u201cSince you asked, how about keeping your eyes open long enough to report that Somerset are now looming untroubled and look set fair to bat all day and next?\u201d Oh yes, let me check. From humble beginnings, Dickson and Kohler-Cadmore actually are doing rather well \u2013 putting on 56 for the fourth wicket. Somerset 66-3. Fletcha Middleton will not be stamping June 11 and 12 into his scrap book. Another drops through his fingers at slip. Barker turns on his heel and trudges back to his mark. Abbott comes over to whisper fast-bowler repair work. At Chesterfield, Derbyshire are 36 for four. For variety, the first four wickets read: Coad, Fisher, Fisher, Coad. Whereas in the first innings, it was Fisher, Coad, Fisher, Coad. At Southport, Daryl Mitchell reaches fifty off 64 balls, and Bell pulls six into the outdoor practise nets. Sleepy afternoon cricket, Barker in, bowling into the dust. The heat drifts and hangs and presses. I must must not close my eyes. Send me sparky emails. Lancs 289-5, the lead 147. Somerset\u2019s reply started badly before lunch, losing two wickets in Jamie Porter\u2019s first over . They lost another in Jamie Porter\u2019s third over. Tom Kohler-Cadmore has crashed three fours in his 18 not out, Somerset 42-3. Two Abbas snorters pass the bat of Bell, much enthusiastic encouragement from the slips. Bell breaks the spell, sending him off his legs for four. Lancashire 279-5, as a seagull flies overhead. This morning I saw a evil-eyed one swallow an enormous rasher of bacon. Derbyshire now 5 for three; more remarkably, Surrey 60-7, Will Jacks joining his hot and bothered teammates back in the pavilion, bowled for six by Agar. At Chesterfield, Coad and Fisher are continuing where they left off yesterday morning. Derbyshire deep in the doldrums, 4 for two in their second innings, 238 behind. Yorkshire\u2019s long wait is nearly over. The broken spire droops a little more sadly. An email waves in from Ainsdale. Hello Daren! \u201cIt\u2019s baking hot in Southport again today after Saturday\u2019s 31C. Far too hot for working from home!\u201d From a little stroll around the ground, I concur. Lots of happy punters though, young men larking about with a moon ball, a long queue at the ice cream van and plenty of pints being gingerly carried across the parched outfield. Spectators arching their bodies towards any shade they can find, while Mohammad Abbas spent ten minutes of his lunchtime bowling in full sun. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 462-9dec v Somerset 10-2 Canterbury: Kent 301 v Surrey 60-6 Southport: Lancashire 260-5 v Hampshire 142 all out Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire 524-7 Division Two Chesterfield: Derbyshire 111 and 0-0 v Yorkshire 353 Chester-le-Street: Durham 119-4 v Glamorgan 390 Bristol: Gloucestershire 206-6 v Leicestershire Hove: Sussex 348 v Worcestershire 94-1 Love this from Arsheep Singh on why he joined Kent (this great franchise!?!). We need, as always, to thank Rahul Dravid. Lunch scores to follow: He split open his upper lip after that slip catch ricochetted into his face from Middleton\u2019s hand. Thought I should check in on Surrey, to find them in need of a cold flannel and salty snacks: 47-6, with only Rory Burns making double figures. Three for Quinn, one for Arshdeep Singh, as well as the couple for Agar. Obvs Kent recovered from 41 for five so perhaps Surrey just want to prove they can go one better. Yes, that\u2019s what it is. The recovery starts here. quite some time ago actually, he\u2019s since been out to Mark Watt (4-83) for 106. Revis still there, Yorks 353-8. The ECB have responded to Colin Graves interview on Sky this morning, where he described some of what went on as Yorkshire as\u201d banter.\u201d \u201cWe are disappointed to see the comments made by Colin Graves on the historical racist issues at Yorkshire County Cricket Club,\u201d read a statement. We must never again hear of accounts like Azeem Rafiq\u2019s, where racist slurs are used as part of normalised everyday language. These events, along with many issues experienced by Azeem and others during their time at Yorkshire have been upheld more than once, including during proceedings overseen by the Cricket Discipline Committee. We vehemently disagree that this is \u2018just banter\u2019 and believe that any debate in that regard should stop immediately. Racism isn\u2019t banter. Yorkshire is of huge importance to cricket in England and Wales with a deep history and an ability to inspire and connect all cricket fans. They are currently working hard to resolve their financial and cultural challenges and the club, and its new management, have our full support.\u2019\u2019 Yorkshire accepted four charges related to allegations of racism and bullying made by Azeem Rafiq in February. Graves was chairman of the club between 20212 and 2015 and said that, \u201cWhen I was chairman of the club, when some of these allegations were made, I can tell you now, nothing was brought up within the club.\u201d \u201cThere have been odd occasions where words have been said that people may regret afterwards. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was done on a racist, savage basis. I know people don\u2019t like the word banter, but I think there could have been a lot of banter in there about it. \u201cWhen you play cricket and you\u2019re part of cricket teams and you\u2019re in cricket dressing rooms, that\u2019s what happened in the past. \u201cBut the world has changed; society has changed. It\u2019s not acceptable. I understand that, I accept it, full stop.\u201d Last week Graves withdrew from the running to become new Yorkshire chairman. It\u2019s all been happening at Trafalgar Road while I wrote up that Test squad: Salt out for 103, caught at slip, though though he wasn\u2019t too happy about it, then Daryl Mitchell has come in and biffed 20, 18 of them off four balls, one six soaring over the press tent (I ducked, I\u2019m a coward) and thudding into something behind. Heather Knight (captain, Western Storm) Tammy Beaumont (The Blaze) Lauren Bell (Southern Vipers) Alice Capsey (South East Stars) Kate Cross (Thunder) Alice Davidson-Richards (South East Stars) Sophia Dunkley (South East Stars) Sophie Ecclestone (Thunder) Lauren Filer (Western Storm) Danielle Gibson (Western Storm) Amy Jones (Central Sparks) Emma Lamb (Thunder) Nat Sciver-Brunt (vice-captain, The Blaze) Issy Wong (Central Sparks) Danielle Wyatt (Southern Brave) Issy Wong returns to international duties after being left out of the T20 World Cup squad, Kate Cross has recovered enough from her parasite illness to be available, and England have picked two uncapped players: all-rounder Danielle Gibson and seamer Lauren Filer. The Test, at Trent Bridge, starts on June 22 and will run for five days for the first time in women\u2019s cricket. It is worth four points in the multi-format Ashes. A standing ovation for Salt, as he chivvies the ball down to the fine leg boundary. It\u2019s his first century for Lancashire in any cricket \u2013 and (thank you Paul Edwards) his fifth Championship century in all \u2013 he had two in 2018, two in 2019, both for Sussex. A super innings. He has a hug from Dane Vilas as the bottoms settle back in the warm fold-up chairs. Oh and that\u2019s nasty \u2013 the ball flies off Vilas\u2019s bat, is deflected off Fletcha Middleton\u2019s hand at third slip straight into second slip Liam Dawson\u2019s face. A change of bowling here at Southport, with Bohannon and Salt lucky to survive some tricky stuff from Barker and Abbas. Not had things quite their way. Barker replaced by Kyle Abbott \u2013 and the bowling change brings a wicket! Bohannon beautifully pouched at third slip by Dawson, for 39. Lancs 189-2. With forty minutes gone, the party poppers are already out in Division Two: Dawid Malan is 92 not out as Yorkshire build what threatens to be a bells and whistles lead over Derbyshire \u2013 already 194. Revis has contributed a handy 17 not out at No. 7. Durham have already lost a wicket at The Riverside, but its only their nightwatchman Stanley McAlindon. It\u2019s not raining at Bristol, but Gloucestershire have lost two wickets, Chris Wright grabbing both James Bracey and Graeme van Buuren. Sussex cobbled together another ten runs this morning before losing their last wicket, and Worcestershire have added 19 without loss. No play at Canterbury yet, but they\u2019re due to chug into action at 11.45 with Surrey 18-and let\u2019s say under the cosh, as there won\u2019t be many opportunities to type that this season. Critchley run out going for a fourth! After notching up two centurions yesterday, Essex\u2019s first ten minutes of the working week have brought them back to earth. First Ben Allison\u2019s stumps are splattered by Craig Overton, showing no signs of yesterday\u2019s foot injury, then Critchley is run out for 121. Essex 371-6. Phil Salt starts today as he did yesterday, a thick outside edge flying through the slips for four, accelerating through the heat. Lancashire have the lead. A fascinating interview with Mitchell Starc by Andy Bull \u2013 a modern cricket cut from a different cloth. The grass was brittle-dry at Southport, a hot-fire outfield begging for quick runs. And it was Lancashire who made the most of the conditions, first bowling Hampshire out for 142, with three wickets each for Will Williams and Tom Bailey, and then letting fly with the bat. Phil Salt, opening the innings for Lancashire for the first time in red-ball cricket, eyed up the Championship\u2019s best attack and advanced. He was dropped on four in the first over, off the hard working Keith Barker, and then pounced, combining flamb\u00e9ed attack with, as stumps approached, watchful defence. Lancs finished the day just three runs behind, with the loss of only George Balderson, to the approval of more than 1500 spectators in fold-up chairs and sunhats. At Canterbury, Jordan Cox turned Kent\u2019s day upside-down with a sparkling century, transforming a miserable 41 for five into a respectable 301 all out. Wes Agar then took two early Surrey wickets to further twist the tale. Sam Billings was left out of the Kent side after \u201cmutual discussions about form.\u201d Alastair Cook, an old-fashioned knight in a sudden surfeit, reached his 74th first-class century accompanied by heat and a welcoming Chelmsford pitch. He was joined in the three-figures club by Matt Critchley, whose gung-ho hundred wearied the Somerset attack. New Taunton signing Shoaib Bashir, a 19-year-old off-spinner, was put through his paces, fizzing down 29 overs. Yorkshire, winless in the first tranche of Championship cricket, had a good day. Perhaps buoyed by their T20 Blast successes, they filleted Derbyshire for 111, Matt Fisher picking up a career-best five for 30, Ben Coad three for 28. By the close, Yorkshire were already 161 ahead, with five wickets in hand. Shan Masood collected his highest score of the season, Dawid Malan unbeaten on 76. Elsewhere, Sussex fought back against Worcestershire, rain again haunted Gloucestershire, and a century from Sam Hain put Warwickshire in a strong position against Nottinghamshire. Kiran Carlson conjured up another bewitching century, his fourth of the season, as Glamorgan were all out just a sneeze short of 400 at Durham.

It\u2019s hot, hot, hot. I got up at six and walked around Southport\u2019s King\u2019s gardens. Had forgotten how lovely they are \u2013 there was even a rabbit hopping delicately about the miniature railway. Searched for the sea bathing lake, gutted to discover it was demolished in 1993. If there is a Southport millionaire out there with money on their hands \u2013 this is what you need to invest in. To the cricket - where Lancashire, to most people\u2019s surprise, are hugely on top. Hampshire misread the pitch. \u201cWe looked at the stats and it was very hot and the pitch looked quite hard so we thought if we batted very well it would set it up for us spinning them out on the last day,\u201d said Adrian Birrell.\u201cIt didn\u2019t materialise for us with the bat so we are in a bit of a hole and we\u2019re going to have to fight to salvage a draw or a remarkable win.\u201d Elsewhere, Kent pulled a rabbit out of a hat against Surrey, Yorkshire had a great day, Kiran Carlson (England radar?)- scored his fourth century for Glamorgan, Sussex fought back against Worcestershire, rain again haunted Gloucestershire, and a century from Sam Hain put Warwickshire in a strong position at Trent Bridge. I\u2019ve slathered on the suncream to walk to the ground.

On Sunday, she was arrested by police investigating allegations of financial misconduct. Sturgeon, who led the Scottish National party to electoral domination at Holyrood \u2013 the home of the Scottish parliament \u2013 was questioned by detectives \u201cas a suspect\u201d but was later released without charge, pending further inquiries, after voluntarily going to a police station. Who is Nicola Sturgeon? Sturgeon was a rare political constant during a turbulent era in British politics. During her tenure as first minister (the title given to the head of a devolved government in the UK), four UK prime ministers resigned as did two main opposition leaders at Westminster. As one of the few female world leaders, Sturgeon became internationally recognised. In 2016, she was ranked the second most powerful woman in the UK after Queen Elizabeth II by Forbes. Her political demise has been swift. She was first elected as an SNP member of parliament in 1999 and was elected deputy leader in 2004 on a joint ticket with Alex Salmond, who became SNP leader. Sturgeon became the de facto leader of the opposition in the Scottish parliament as Salmond was an MP in Westminster, not an MSP in Holyrood, and was not able to take up the role. In 2007, Salmond was elected to Holyrood following that year\u2019s Scottish parliamentary elections, which were an electoral breakthrough for the SNP. He became the first minister with Sturgeon serving as deputy. In 2011, the SNP scored their best electoral achievement ever, winning an absolute majority in Holyrood, the only party ever to do so since devolution in 1999. Salmond and Sturgeon were re-elected into their respective roles. The party had committed in its manifesto to hold an independence referendum. David Cameron, then the prime minister of the UK, agreed a deal with the Salmond administration in 2012 to hold an independence referendum. The vote was held in 2014 when 55% of Scots voted to stay in the union. Salmond resigned as a result. Sturgeon announced her run to become SNP leader without an opponent coming forward. She became the party\u2019s first female leader and thus first minister unopposed. Why was she arrested? Her arrest was shocking but not entirely unexpected. Fifty days after her resignation, Peter Murrell, Sturgeon\u2019s husband and a former SNP chief executive who had resigned his position weeks earlier after claiming \u201cresponsibility\u201d for giving false party membership numbers to the media, was arrested as part of Operation Branchform, a Police Scotland investigation into allegations that more than \u00a3600,000 in donations for an independence campaign was misspent by the party. Large forensic tents were erected outside the couple\u2019s home, which provoked a furious response from her allies. Colin Beattie, an MSP and the SNP\u2019s treasurer, was arrested less than two weeks later as part of the investigation. He resigned as party treasurer the following day. Sturgeon is the third senior SNP figure to be arrested as part of the operation. What does it mean for Scottish independence? Polling on the question of Scottish independence has remained largely unchanged since Sturgeon\u2019s resignation. There has not been a major dip since Sturgeon\u2019s successor as SNP leader and first minister, Humza Yousaf, took over. In fact, an Ipsos/STV poll carried out in May found that 53% of Scots support independence. However, difficulties may lie in falling support for the SNP. The party\u2019s vote share was 26 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives in the 2021 Scottish parliament elections. Recent polls put its lead over the Scottish Labour party in single or low-double digits. Apart from the Scottish Greens, no other major opposition parties support an independence referendum. If the SNP loses its dominance at Holyrood, the likelihood of another independence referendum greatly recedes. What could happen next? After Sturgeon\u2019s arrest on Sunday, her internal critics inside the SNP and opposition leaders have called on her to voluntarily stand down as an MSP or for Yousaf to suspend her pending the outcome of the police investigation. She has denied any wrongdoing, issuing a statement on Sunday night declaring: \u201cI know beyond doubt that I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing.\u201d Yousaf has refused to take any disciplinary action against her because she has not been charged with any offence. He said he believes people should be treated as innocent until shown to be guilty. The police investigation continues. Police Scotland has never disclosed exactly what it is investigating nor released the name of the lead detective. Earlier this month, the force\u2019s chief constable, Sir Iain Livingstone, said the search of Sturgeon\u2019s home was \u201cproportionate and justified\u201d. The police investigation, he said, had \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201crigour\u201d."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/12/kathryn-harries-obituary", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Kathryn Harries obituary", "lead": "Versatile singer whose roles ranged from Wagner and Jan\u00e1\u010dek to Dido in the first complete performance of Berlioz\u2019s Les Troyens", "author": "Barry Millington", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T19:58:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080150", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2a630ddddbe578524a2a82d2bed2b3b307da252e/304_275_2794_1676/500.jpg", "body": "The designation of voice types in opera is always a hazardous business, but a minority of singers simply defy categorisation. One such was Kathryn Harries, who has died aged 72 of cancer. When she auditioned as a teenager for the Royal Academy of Music in London, she told a sceptical panel that her range was from C below middle C to F above top C. That range of three and a half octaves enabled her to glide effortlessly through both soprano and mezzo-soprano roles, her best known including Sieglinde (Die Walk\u00fcre), Dido (Les Troyens) and Kostelni\u010dka (Jen\u016ffa). Although she later concentrated on a somewhat narrower pitch range, she continued to sing both soprano and mezzo roles, gradually settling more on the latter. Her tonal quality was similarly unique, as she was well aware: \u201cThey either like me or don\u2019t like me. It must be very nice to be Ren\u00e9e Fleming, because everyone loves you,\u201d she once said. It was not only that vocal quality but also her manner of delivery (in early years she was sometimes criticised as an overly cerebral performer) that polarised opinion. Nonetheless she remained faithful to her instinctive approach, winning countless admirers for her intelligent and psychologically penetrating portrayals. Despite her five years at the Royal Academy, she was a late starter in opera, making her stage debut at the age of 32 as a Flowermaiden in the Welsh National Opera Parsifal (1983). She had taken voice lessons from Constance Shacklock, with piano as a second subject, also studying harmony with Delius\u2019s amanuensis, Eric Fenby. Having taught singing and piano at Kingston Polytechnic, south-west London, she was selected in 1977 to present Music Time, a BBC schools television programme aired twice weekly requiring her and her co-host, Peter Combe (and later Andrew C Wadsworth), to sing, and play the guitar and piano. She remained in the job for four years until her colleague at Kingston, Meirion Bowen, steered her towards the Ingpen and Williams agency, who in turn landed her the Flowermaiden role. Unfulfilling as she found that, she underwent a baptism of fire when she was asked to deputise for Anne Evans as Leonore in Fidelio in Liverpool. By this time she was married with two young children, but her operatic career began to take off. She was noticed as a highly promising young Sieglinde in Welsh National Opera\u2019s The Valkyrie (1984), for which she was coached by Reginald Goodall, and within two years was singing Kundry in Parsifal at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, returning there as Gutrune in Die G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. Other roles she undertook for WNO included Adalgisa in Norma, Gutrune, and the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos. For English National Opera she sang a number of roles between 1983 and 1990, including Irene (Rienzi), the Female Chorus (Rape of Lucretia), Eva (Die Meistersinger), Donna Anna (Dargomyzhsky\u2019s The Stone Guest) and the title role in K\u00e1tya Kabanov\u00e1. For Scottish Opera she created the title role in Edward Harper\u2019s Hedda Gabler (1985), later singing Senta in Der Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder and Bartok\u2019s Judith. For Opera North (1986\u201388) she sang Donna Elvira (Don Giovanni) and Hanna Glawari (The Merry Widow). She first performed at Covent Garden as Sieglinde in the WNO Ring (1986) and made her Royal Opera debut as the Protagonist in Berio\u2019s Un Re in Ascolto (1989). Her searing Kostelni\u010dka in Jen\u016ffa was heard at Glyndebourne, as well as in mainland Europe and the US. Her Kabanicha in K\u00e1tya Kabanov\u00e1 also exploited the powerful chest range of her voice. In the role of Dido (which she sang in the first complete performance of Les Troyens in France at the 1987 Berlioz festival in Lyons, as well as for Scottish Opera and elsewhere) her regal bearing, gloriously golden tone and seamless legato were deployed to great advantage. She was born in Hampton Court, south-west London, to Welsh parents, and went to Surbiton high school. Her father, Stanley, was a pharmacist; her mother, Gwyneth (nee Hubbard), trained as a singer, but gave up the idea of a professional career in favour of her family and the pharmacy. Not all the roles Harries undertook were equally successful \u2013 her K\u00e1tya and Carmen were both criticised for different reasons \u2013 as she was the first to acknowledge. Harsh economic realities played their part in the choice of roles accepted, but coping with the pressures of balancing career and family, together with the resultant illnesses, also had a deleterious effect at some junctures in her career. In the 1980s she became susceptible to asthma, bronchitis and hayfever, necessitating slow-release steroid injections to get her through performances. By the end of the decade, the health problems, coupled with the financial drain of childcare, were reaching a crisis. In 1991, after an exhausting fortnight shuttling between a Covent Garden G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung (Gutrune) and Un Re in Ascolto in Paris (11 performances in 13 days), she succumbed to flu just as rehearsals were due to start for Les Contes d\u2019Hoffmann (Giulietta) at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet. Threatened with dismissal if she did not turn up for the first rehearsal, she coughed her way through the rehearsal period and the first night, only to burst a blood vessel in a vocal cord. Freely discussing the stigma attached to vocal problems among singers a decade later, she revealed then that things had settled down. With the children grown up, she announced that she was happily divorced, had weaned herself off steroids (thanks to the ministrations of a homeopath) and was living in what she described as \u201ca chocolate box cottage\u201d in the Surrey hills. It was there that she ran a festival called Coverwood Lakes Opera for more than 20 years. She became heavily involved in charity events of various sorts, raising \u00a386,000 for Speakability (a charity for people suffering from aphasia, now merged into the Stroke Association) in a sponsored walk from John O\u2019Groats to Land\u2019s End in 2001 and similar amounts in walks over London bridges for CRY (Cardiac Risk in the Young). From 2009 to 2017 she was director of the National Opera Studio, where she significantly developed the training programme and introduced a number of initiatives, including the intensive study of core roles for singers, piano and musicianship lessons for singers, as well as singing lessons for repetiteurs. Her marriage, in 1977, to Christopher Lane, ended in divorce in 1998. She is survived by her children, Victoria and William, and her brother, Keith. \u2022 Kathryn Harries, singer, born 15 February 1951; died 26 May 2023"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-destroying-another-dam-donetsk", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Ukraine accuses Russia of destroying another dam to slow counteroffensive", "lead": "A week after Kakhovka dam collapse, Kyiv says smaller dam along Mokri Yaly river in Donetsk region has been blown up", "author": "Julian Borger in Kyiv and Dan Sabbagh in Zaporizhzhia", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T19:57:59Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080153", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8a503ed34675d471952215b4f61d66a5503032c1/0_264_7895_4737/500.jpg", "body": "Ukraine has accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing a counteroffensive launched by Kyiv. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in Kherson region, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine\u2019s advances in western Donetsk. Ukrainian forces have moved along both sides of the river, southwards from the town of Velyka Novosilka, declaring the liberation of a string of villages: Blahodatne on the east bank; and Neskuchne, Makarivka and Storozheve on the west side. On Monday night, Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said three other settlements further west along the frontline \u2013 Novodarivka, Levadne in eastern Zaporizhzhia, and Lobkove in western Zaporizhzhia \u2013 had also been taken by Ukrainian forces. The armed forces have published pictures of their units holding up flags in what were claimed to be the recaptured villages. The claims could not be independently verified, but Russian military bloggers confirmed the Ukrainian advance and reported heavy fighting overnight and on Monday morning for the next village along, Urozhaine, on the east bank of the river, straddling the road south-east towards Mariupol. Valeriy Shershen, a Ukrainian military spokesperson for that sector of the front, told the Ukrainska Pravda news agency that a dam upstream along the Mokri Yaly had been blown up by occupation forces, causing flooding on both banks. Shershen said the Russian aim had been to \u201cslow down Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive\u201d but claimed it had failed. The dam appears to have been at the village of Klyuchove but its destruction could not be independently verified. On Sunday, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, celebrated the announcement of the latest village to fall, Storozheve, thanking the marines who recaptured it and adding: \u201cIt will be the same with every settlement until we liberate all Ukrainian land.\u201d Ukrainian officials have otherwise been tight-lipped about the counteroffensive, other than to note small territorial gains around Bakhmut, on the northern Donetsk front. The villages along the Mokri Yaly River mark the first settlements to be liberated after a week of counteroffensive, and Kyiv has made much of the capture of these small villages, aware that Ukrainians are nervous after seeing videos of wrecked Ukrainian tanks and armoured vehicles from failed assaults farther west along the line, in Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian military officials have privately called for patience and pointed out they had so far not committed the bulk of Kyiv\u2019s 12 brigade-strong western-armed assault force to the battle. \u201cBy the way, we didn\u2019t move our main forces yet,\u201d a Ukrainian officer texted from the southern front. \u201cSo there are grounds to believe in the best.\u201d Kyiv is frustrated that western capitals have so far not pronounced verdicts on responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Officials have pointed out that it would have been almost impossible to cause that amount of damage from external shelling to a structure designed to withstand a tactical nuclear bomb, that it must therefore have been blown up from the inside, and that the Russians had complete control of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station at the time. The Ukrainian security service has published an audio clip of what it said was two Russian soldiers talking about how a Russian sabotage unit had been responsible. Maliar said that in the wake of the disaster, Russia was moving its forces from the left (eastern and southern) bank of the Dnipro in Kherson region to other parts of the frontline. She suggested Russian forces had blown up the dam to make it much harder for Ukrainian assault troops to cross the flooded lower Dnipro, and therefore shorten the front they had to defend. Downstream of the wrecked dam, Ukrainian authorities said the flood waters were beginning to recede at up to 5cm an hour. Upstream meanwhile, the reservoir continued to drain, leaving vast expanses of mud flats and dead fish. According to officials in Kyiv, more than 72% of the reservoir\u2019s capacity, 14,395 cubic kilometres of water, had already been lost. In Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-controlled right (northern) bank of the Dnipro across from the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the water had receded so far that it was impossible to determine its level. Ukraine\u2019s environment minister, Ruslen Strilets, said that despite the disappearance of the reservoir, the nuclear plant had sufficient water to keep its reactor cores and spent fuel cool and prevent a meltdown. \u201cRegarding the power plant, the water level in the plant\u2019s ponds is stable and sufficient to meet the plant\u2019s needs. The situation is now under control,\u201d Strilets said in a television interview. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is due in Ukraine this week hoping to visit the plant. Grossi said on Sunday that his experts needed to check discrepancies in measurements of water levels of the reservoir."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/12/terry-brown-obituary", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "title": "Terry Brown obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Self-taught independent shoemaker who demonstrated a strong humility in all he did", "author": "Willem Montagne", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T19:52:39Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080155", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6637633531a4f839263e1149ed09fa6344f58c/532_1143_1296_777/500.jpg", "body": "My friend Terry Brown, who has died of cancer aged 71, was a self-trained shoemaker and founder of the company Roosters, making handmade shoes and boots to a high standard. Entirely self-taught, he began making shoes in the 1970s, and by the 80s was an influential member of the independent shoemaker community. He gave his company the name Roosters \u201cbecause roosters herald the breaking of a new dawn\u201d. A strong customer base was built up through regular stalls at fairs and music festivals, including Bromyard, Cambridge and Sidmouth folk festivals (he also noted that \u201croosters keep cropping up in folk song lyrics\u201d). Born in Ponteland, Northumberland, Terry was the son of Winifred (nee Waid), a draughtswoman for Harland and Wolff shipbuilders, who was originally from Belfast, and Vernon Brown, a civil servant. He had an older sister, Averil. After Walbottle grammar school, Terry took a degree course in geography and geology at Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, where we shared a house in the area. After graduating in 1973 he moved to Yorkshire, pioneering shared-living in various farmhouses with as much self-sufficiency as possible. In the early 90s he moved out of shared houses to live in Heslington, and established his workshop at Buttercrambe. His customers included many people with feet that did not fit commercially made footwear. It was typical of Terry\u2019s approach to life that he never had an online presence and continued to sell all his shoes through direct orders, festivals and fairs. Terry trod lightly on the earth, demonstrating a strong humility in all he did. He lived a frugal and austere life dedicated to growing fruit and vegetables, making bread and shoes, enjoying dancing and music, and the success of the Irish Rugby Union team. He created a home that reflected his values \u2013 handmade furniture, a small, eclectic selection of well-read books and a wood-burning stove to provide a warm hearth. He loved walking and explored many parts of France, Romania, the Picos de Europa and different paths across the Pyrenees. Later he followed various routes on the Camino de Santiago. Terry never flew, always undertaking his journeys by land, at a slow pace, and enjoying the many people he met along the way. In a time when we talk about our carbon footprint it would be hard to find anyone who had such a gentle impact on the world. Averil died in 2016.

But one egg remained intact, and he went to extraordinary lengths to try to save it in a saga that has captured national US media attention. Handling the surviving egg with great care, he held it in his hands to keep it warm \u2013 and he drove 500 miles to his home in Lufkin on the opposite side of the state. The journey took 11 hours. On the night of 30 May, the egg hatched. After scrambling to find a place close by that could suitably care for the bird, the man concluded there were none. So the man\u2019s wife drove 160 miles to a non-profit bird rescue center on the outskirts of Dallas in Hutchins, Texas. The bird\u2019s savior handed a box holding a small, newly born roadrunner to a volunteer at Rogers Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, the facility said in a Facebook post. The volunteer \u2013 70-year-old retired attorney Paula Hagan \u2013 was shocked by the lengths the couple went to in order to save this animal, she told the Washington Post. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it. It just tells me they\u2019re both very kindhearted,\u201d Hagan said, according to the Post. Despite great efforts to save him, the roadrunner Miles died at the center a few days later, the Post\u2019s report said. The Post recounted how Miles eventually stopped being able to eat and failed to gain the weight, which is not unusual for hatchlings. The roadrunner was reportedly named after the 1980s country song Miles and Miles of Texas by Red Steagall \u2013 a reference the pilgrimage he made to the rehab center before getting a few more days of life. For volunteers like Hagan, Miles and the efforts by the couple who tried to save the roadrunner provided motivation to continue doing animal rescue work.

Homes and businesses are likely to be flooded quickly in north-west England, the forecaster said, with damage to buildings expected as a result of the storm. Some communities are also likely to become temporarily cut off by flooded roads, with power cuts likely to occur along with difficult driving conditions and road closures. The London fire brigade said it had been called to several reports of flooding across the capital after thunderstorms affected both roads and properties. It said: \u201cNever drive through flood water \u2013 a foot of moving water at just 6mph is enough to float a car.\u201d North of the capital, Watford Junction station was shut for an hour this afternoon, with trains cancelled and roads closed. Drivers also struggled to drive along the north circular road, after a burst water main exacerbated the heavy rain. In Staffordshire, the Meir tunnel was shut after a flash flood, causing a buildup of traffic between Uttoxeter and Stoke-on-Trent. In Lincolnshire, shoppers at a Morrisons supermarket in Stamford had to be evacuated during a thunderstorm when water poured through from light fittings and parts of the shop\u2019s ceiling reportedly collapsed. A school was closed in Wantage, Oxfordshire, because of flooding. People were told to avoid the A&amp;E department at Luton and Dunstable university hospital \u201cdue to a localised flooding issue\u201d in the building. The Environment Agency has issued 14 flood alerts across the Midlands, saying heavy, thundery showers could produce large amounts of surface water. The Scottish Environment Agency has also issued flood alerts for 16 areas in Scotland. The amber thunderstorm warning covering parts of the West Midlands, north-west England and Wales is in place until 10pm. A yellow thunderstorm warning is also in place for thunderstorms and rain until 9pm on Monday, covering parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, much of southern England, Wales, and the Midlands \u2013 and includes London, Manchester and Bristol. Further thunderstorms are forecast on Tuesday in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. Meteorologist Grahame Madge urged people in warning areas to prepare themselves. He told PA News: \u201cWithin the area we are advising that people might want to think about how suddenly they can be subjected to flash flooding or a power cut. Are people prepared? Make sure mobile phones are charged and that sort of thing. \u201cBecause when you get these storms they can change your circumstances quite dramatically within almost a matter of minutes.\u201d Madge said heat rising from freshly ploughed fields or over a city area could trigger thunderstorms even when nearby areas remain dry. Higher temperatures are concentrated in the north, with Manchester, Leeds and Keswick in Cumbria between 30C (86F) and 31C, while south-central England remains in the high 20s, with London and Cambridge both reaching between 27C and 28C. Temperatures are going to decrease slightly towards Thursday and Friday but it will remain sunny and above 24C and 25C throughout the week, potentially reaching 29C in Bristol and Birmingham on Wednesday and Thursday. Cooler air from the North Sea will reach parts of the UK on Thursday and Friday, particularly areas along the north-east coast and the east of England."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/12/absolutely-buzzing-manchester-city-celebrate-historic-treble-victor", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "\u2018Absolutely buzzing\u2019: Manchester City celebrate historic treble in victory parade", "lead": "Thunder, lightning and torrential rain did not stop \u2018blue-shirt neighbours\u2019 from relishing triumph", "author": "Josh Halliday North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T19:27:54Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080162", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2898c0557bf07c12427e0944db6a4d7fb7deec00/539_1099_6444_3865/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cWe have a neighbour, and sometimes neighbours are noisy, but you can\u2019t do anything about them,\u201d said Sir Alex Ferguson in 2009, when Manchester United were champions of England and fought their squabbles with Europe\u2019s elite, not the blue-shirted big mouths next door. Fourteen years on, Manchester City are the greatest team in world football and, if that was not enough, their Champions League triumph on Saturday brought a deafening end to their red rival\u2019s claim to be the only English club to have won the coveted treble. Manchester City have not so much raised the volume as kicked down the fence and raided their neighbour\u2019s trophy cabinet. And in a victory parade interrupted by bursts of thunder, lightning and torrential rain, it was their turn to celebrate. \u201cMr Ferguson will be delighted because he will sleep well tonight if he\u2019s around here,\u201d said Gerard Visco, 85, shouting to make himself heard against a cacophony of hooters and fireworks. A lifelong City fan, Visco cheered the club\u2019s latest champions alongside his son, Dino, 51, and his grandchildren Jessica, 21, and Daniel, 17. \u201cI was here for the \u201868 side [who won the league championship] so I\u2019ve at least seen some success,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen us lose yet,\u201d he added, pointing to his grandchildren, \u201cand my son hadn\u2019t seen us win for 50 years!\u201d Cracks of lightning illuminated a sky that turned from blue to grey and back again as the smell of pyrotechnics filled the air and thousands of fans lined the streets. Erling Haaland, the club\u2019s 22-year-old Norwegian talisman, sent the rain-soaked crowd into raptures as he appeared shirtless and grinning while holding one of the club\u2019s three major trophies. The latest and most prestigious, City\u2019s first ever Champions League, came after an unexpectedly tense 1-0 victory over Inter Milan in Istanbul on Saturday. Only 20 years ago Manchester City were slugging it out with the likes of Walsall, Rotherham and Wimbledon in the second-tier of English football (the latter club no longer exists). Then came the takeover by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour in September 2008, transforming Manchester City into the world\u2019s richest club and beginning a new era of football that is largely dominated by state-backed owners and sovereign wealth funds. The only geopolitics of interest to City fans on Monday, however, was limited to getting one over on their Mancunian rivals. Jessica Visco, who works in a primary school, hailed the \u201cfantastic\u201d turnaround. \u201cI\u2019m probably in the last generation of children who were bullied in primary school for supporting City,\u201d she said. In assembly that morning children at the school where Visco works were asked if they watched the Champions League final on Saturday. \u201cOver half the hands shot up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken over, a lot.\u201d The Champions League triumph was the crowning moment for a celebration that started three weeks ago when City won the Premier League \u2013 their seventh in 12 years \u2013 followed by an FA Cup victory over (who else?) Manchester United last Saturday. \u201cThis means the world \u2013 I\u2019m absolutely buzzing,\u201d said Barry Dean, 73, draped in a huge blue flag. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting 55 years for this since my first game \u2013 against Leeds \u2013 when I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and that was me.\u201d Dean, known in his pub as Barry the Blue, spots a Manchester United shirt over the street and throws a good-natured jibe their way. \u201cManchester is blue!\u201d grins his daughter, Tina Craig, 54. \u201cThe city\u2019s been blue for the last five years,\u201d said Dean. \u201cThe bragging rights are ours. Beating them in the FA Cup as well \u2013 that\u2019s the pinnacle.\u201d So idolised are this team that there are calls for statues to be built outside the Etihad stadium. If anyone is to be immortalised in bronze \u2013 as Ferguson is at Old Trafford \u2013 then it is surely City\u2019s manager, Pep Guardiola, who smoked a cigar as he waved at fans on Monday night. Guardiola has won 12 major trophies since he took over in 2016 \u2013 accounting for 45% of all the major silverware won in the club\u2019s 143-year history.

The suspect, Dirk Raats, 70, originally from Antwerp in Belgium, has been officially put under investigation for the murder of Solaine Thornton and the attempted murder of her parents, Adrian and Rachel Thornton. Her eight-year-old sister, C\u00e9leste, was the only member of the family to escape injury in the attack on Saturday evening. The girls were playing on swings in their garden in the hamlet of Saint-Herbot, near Plon\u00e9vez-du-Faou in Brittany, west France on Saturday evening. The Thornton family, who bought a former sawmill in the village in 2019 and converted it into a home, had been enjoying a barbecue. At about 10pm, a man fired several shots into the property, killing Solaine and injuring her parents. Adrian Thornton, 52, was shot in the head and was taken to hospital where his condition was described as critical. His wife was shot in the back and the head but her injuries were not life-threatening. C\u00e9leste escaped to a neighbouring property and raised the alarm. Marguerite Bleuzen, the mayor of Plon\u00e9vaz-du-Faou, told journalists she was aware of a \u201cdispute between neighbours\u201d over a piece of land adjoining both properties and over noise that dated back three years. Neighbours described Raats and his wife as \u201creclusive\u201d and said he had been angry that the Thorntons had cut down trees on their property. He had complained about the noise from the chainsaw and that the felled trees had protected his property from view. In a hearing at a court in Brest lasting about 10 minutes on Monday afternoon, Raats told the judge: \u201cIt\u2019s so horrible what\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Camille Miansoni, the public prosecutor at Brest, confirmed on Monday evening that the shooting had been prompted by a dispute between neighbours. \u201cThe couple in question blamed their British neighbours for repeated and increasingly intolerable noise pollution,\u201d Miansoni told a press conference. On Saturday afternoon, Adrian Thornton was \u201cdoing some gardening work on the hedge\u201d separating his and the neighbouring property. This exasperated his neighbour who picked up a rifle and fired three or four shots hitting the victims, he added. Police called to the scene found three victims lying on the ground. Solaine was dead. Her father is in hospital with life threatening injuries and her mother was also injured and taken to hospital. \u201cThe couple\u2019s other daughter, aged eight, who saw what happened, is in a state of shock and has been taken to a children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Miansoni said. He said the suspected gunman and his wife had tested positive for cannabis and alcohol. Raats has been officially put under investigation \u2013 the equivalent of being charged \u2013 for murder and attempted murder. His wife, also Belgian, has been accused of \u201cconcealing an object relating to a crime in order to obstruct the course of justice\u201d. She allegedly put the gun away before the couple surrendered to police, who seized two rifles. The prosecutor said the man had been remanded in custody. It was clear he had fired in the direction of the family, but investigators would be questioning him over whether he deliberately aimed at them. The court heard Raats had arrived in France in 2017 and settled in Saint-Herbot. He had previously been a photographer and shepherd, before spending 25 years working in specialised establishment for severely disabled people. The public prosecutor told the court Raats should undergo psychological and psychiatric evaluation. Anne Guillerme, defending, said the attack \u201cgoes deeper than a neighbourhood dispute\u201d. She said: \u201cHis actions reveal exhaustion and a desire to end it all.\u201d The gun used to shoot at the Thornton family has been removed, the prosecutor said. Raats and his wife had at first barricaded themselves into their home until a police negotiator persuaded them to come out and hand over the weapon. The Thornton parents, originally from Oldham, had been living in France for a number of years before moving to Saint-Herbot. Both girls were born in France. Solaine was in the first year at the Jean-Jaur\u00e8s middle school where children and parents were said to be deeply shocked."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/12/arsenal-closing-in-on-100m-deal-for-west-ham-midfielder-declan-rice", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Arsenal closing in on \u00a3100m deal for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice", "lead": "A bid is yet to be submitted but clubs are set to agree a transfer fee, with West Ham asking for financial add-ons to be included in any move", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T19:22:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080166", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dc74ab1caa95f48c01ad5e4b1dc5bb1089c5d0fa/0_52_2742_1645/500.jpg", "body": "Arsenal are close to agreeing a fee with West Ham for Declan Rice and are expected to pay more than \u00a3100m for the midfielder if certain add-ons are achieved. West Ham have accepted they are going to lose Rice and Arsenal are ready to make him the most expensive player in their history. A bid is yet to be submitted but talks between the clubs are progressing smoothly and there is confidence that the deal will be finalised soon. Arsenal have made Rice their top target and will face no issues when it comes to personal terms. They are moving quickly in an effort to ensure the deal goes through without any hitch and have been keen to pay about \u00a390m for the 24-year-old. West Ham want as much money as possible and have asked for add-ons that would take the fee to more than \u00a3100m. Arsenal\u2019s transfer record is the \u00a372m paid for Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 in 2019. Sources believe the prospect of a rival club trying to sign the West Ham captain is receding. Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Newcastle and Manchester United have looked at signing Rice but Arsenal, who are looking for ways to move out P\u00e9p\u00e9 and C\u00e9dric Soares, have been the most aggressive in attempting to buy him. Mikel Arteta is a huge admirer of the England international and is determined to add him to his squad. Arteta believes Rice will be key to helping Arsenal to mount another challenge for the Premier League title and is prepared to make space for the midfielder by allowing Granit Xhaka to join Bayer Leverkusen. Arsenal are also considering bidding for the Brighton midfielder Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, who is wanted by Chelsea, and are trying to sign Manchester City\u2019s Ilkay G\u00fcndogan on a free transfer. Rice is a fan of Arteta\u2019s football and has rejected West Ham\u2019s attempts to keep him. David Sullivan, West Ham\u2019s largest shareholder, said last week that the player had turned down a contract extension worth \u00a3200,000 a week. Rice signed off on a positive note when he led West Ham to victory against Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. West Ham are looking at replacements for Rice and are interested in Ajax\u2019s Edson \u00c1lvarez, Fulham\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Palhinha and Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse.

Less than 24 hours after Nadine Dorries said she was standing down as its MP, the traditional Tory blue seat was engulfed in a yellow glow. Glorious rays of sunshine cloaked the leafy constituency on Saturday morning as at least 130 Liberal Democrat activists descended on the area before a crucial byelection that will test Rishi Sunak\u2019s grip on power. Two days later, the Lib Dem campaigners were still there but the weather had turned and the constituency, which Dorries held with a 24,000 majority in 2019, was now at risk of flooding. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, on Monday made his second trip to Mid Bedfordshire, this time squeezed into what he called his \u201csewage wellies\u201d. But minutes after dipping his hands into the River Lea as he warned about water pollution, he was forced to run out of the Barton Hills nature reserve as heavy downpours struck. The Lib Dem parade had quite literally been rained on, forcing its leader to take cover in his car beside St Nicholas church. \u201cNo,\u201d Davey sternly said, dismissing the suggestion that his party\u2019s optimism at taking the seat, where it trailed in third place behind Labour at the last two elections and has never got more than 12% of the vote, had been misplaced. \u201cThis weather is sending a signal that change is going to happen. And the change is in favour to us winning,\u201d he said. Davey, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat as the rain beat down on the windscreen of the stationary car, claimed that the party was \u201cin with a huge chance\u201d even though, in normal circumstances, it would be a huge majority for either main opposition party to overturn. He told the Guardian: \u201cWe need a much lower swing to win this byelection (23.6%) than what we historically achieved in Cheshire and Amersham. And from the conversations we\u2019ve been having, it\u2019s clear locals are fed up of the Tories and with having an absent MP. \u201cI might get told off for not managing expectations but we\u2019ve got a huge shot at this. I\u2019m extremely confident but am not complacent.\u201d Constituency level MRP polling by Savanta, however, suggests that Labour could win the seat with 41% of the vote at a general election. But the pollsters acknowledge the byelection picture could look quite different as Dorries\u2019 former constituency \u201cfeels more like a Lib Dem target\u201d than a Labour one in reality. In contrast to the bullishness of the Lib Dems, it is the Labour party that is managing expectations here, an approach many Labour frontbenchers believe worked for them in the run-up to the local elections in May. Rachel Hopkins, Labour MP for Luton South who is managing the party\u2019s regional campaign, admits it has a \u201cdifficult task ahead\u201d to overturn the Tory majority but is confident the party has a chance because people are fed up with the Conservatives. The party hasn\u2019t yet unleashed the scale of campaign already committed to by the Lib Dems but have been hitting the phones relentlessly, which they say gives a more realistic idea of how voters are feeling, particularly in Flitwick, one of the seat\u2019s larger villages. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anyone mention anything about the Liberal Democrats. They do mention how fed up they are with the Conservatives and are thinking about switching,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy but we\u2019re in it to win it. We\u2019ve come second in the last general elections and while lots of people voted for the independents at the locals, at parliamentary level those independent votes switch to the most credible opposition, and currently that is us\u201d. Voters in Mid Bedfordshire are not shy of tactically voting if it means getting the \u201cwrong person out and the right person in\u201d, local Mickey O\u2019Rourke, 55, says in the Bumble Bee pub in Flitwick. He has always voted Labour at general elections, but switches when it comes to locals or byelections. \u201cMy Labour votes began when I lost the home I was living in with my family,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a battle in this area that isn\u2019t Labour supporting but the mood has never been lower here. Everybody is fed up. The country is absolutely broken.\u201d He gets his wallet out. \u201cThirty years ago, sitting in this pub with you I\u2019d be able to show my wallet packed with wads of cash. Now look, I\u2019ve just one \u00a310 note to get me by. I\u2019ve got to pay for prescriptions, I can\u2019t see a doctor any more, we just can\u2019t get anything.\u201d Reflecting on Dorries, he adds, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her here,\u201d and he\u2019s lived in the area for his entire life. \u201cShe\u2019s too busy writing novels than spending time helping the locals. I\u2019ll vote for the Lib Dems at this byelection, unless Labour shows their candidate is best placed to win this and get the Tories out.\u201d Former jockey Robert Mason, 90, out for a walk in Flitwick, says many people he knows admit to voting tactically in the area, but it will always be the Conservatives for him, despite anger towards Boris Johnson. \u201cUs old racers always vote blue, it\u2019s what we do. I\u2019m just ashamed of Boris Johnson he let us down over Partygate, and even more so because he still doesn\u2019t acknowledge the wrong that he\u2019s done.\u201d He made no mention of Rishi Sunak. \u201cOf course Boris said he\u2019ll be back but it\u2019s like someone going to prison. They definitely will not have a comeback. Boris has ruined it for himself.\u201d Back by St Nicholas church, Davey ruled out any informal pact with Labour in the seat, where one of the parties would not campaign particularly hard so the other could win, and avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote. He says that if, by chance, he were to pick up a phone call from Keir Starmer, \u201cWe\u2019d have a civil conversation. But I know he wouldn\u2019t ask me to make a pact because he knows we\u2019ll fight just as hard.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/colombia-children-plane-crash-jungle-survivors", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Rescuers reveal tragic words of children who survived in Colombian jungle", "lead": "Siblings, who spent more than 40 days in Amazon after plane crash in early May, told of mother\u2019s death when search party arrived", "author": "Luke Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T19:00:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080170", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8e53e7004e65dff27d5d95a7bceac1df1658c67a/0_243_4368_2621/500.jpg", "body": "The tragic first words four Colombian children spoke after surviving for 40 days in the Amazon jungle have been revealed by their rescuers, as the youngsters recover at a military hospital in Bogot\u00e1. When a search party found the emaciated children on Friday, the first thing Tien Noriel Ranoque Mucutuy, four, said was: \u201cMy mother is dead.\u201d Hundreds of soldiers and an alliance of Indigenous communities had searched for the missing children for more than a month after their Cessna plane crashed into the jungle canopy on 1 May, leaving the children alone in the rainforest. The four \u201cmiracle children\u201d were found in a forest clearing without shoes, thin from malnourishment and too tired to walk, their family said. The first words from Lesly Mucutuy, the eldest child \u2013 who is credited with keeping the group alive during their ordeal \u2013 were: \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d More details emerged on Monday of how Lesly used the knowledge passed on to her by her Huitoto elders to bravely guide her younger brothers and sisters to survival \u2013 despite the torrential downpours, lack of food and dangerous animals in the virgin forest. It also emerged that Lesly pulled the youngest child, Cristin, from the plane after the crash, according to grandfather, Narciso Mucutuy. \u201cShe saw the feet of her littlest sister where the three dead were and she pulled her out,\u201d Mucutuy said in videos posted by the defence ministry at the Bogot\u00e1 military hospital where the children are being treated. However, at least one other family member said Lesly had told them that her mother, Magdalena Mucutuy, had fought to survive for four days after the plane crash. According to Manuel Roque, the father of the youngest two children, Lesley said her mother had hung on for four days but suggested her children leave her in the hope of improving their chances of being rescued. Lesly\u2019s Indigenous heritage as a member of the Huitoto people helped the 13-year-old make shelter out of the forest and discern the safe, nutritious fruits from poisonous ones. The children picked Couma macrocarpa, a creamy white Amazonian fruit, and Oenocarpus bacaba, tiny purple fruits resembling plums, family said. The children also reportedly found one of the 100 aid kits that were dropped by the military, and ate cassava flour from the crash. An alliance of Indigenous communities well-acquainted with the remote forests helped guide the search, alongside military forces and rescue dogs. The children \u2013 sleep-deprived and terrified of the myriad threats in the rebel-dominated jungle \u2013 ran away from the voices of the search party and the barking of search dogs, a grandfather of the four children told local reporters. \u201cThey were scared. They hid in the trees,\u201d Fidencio Valencia said. The children\u2019s father, Manuel Ranoque, told Bogot\u00e1-based W radio that the children survived thanks to the knowledge passed on to them by their parents, who always had the children alongside them while working on their farm and teaching them to eat wild animals. \u201cAlso, you have to say that they are strong. They have Indigenous blood,\u201d Ranoque, who served as governor of a Huitoto community, said, breaking into tears during the radio interview.

And throughout it was a loving, warm and mutually supportive relationship. After it ended, however, Elena began to misrepresent our interactions both privately and in front of groups of mutual friends.\u201d Huerta claimed that he hired a legal team a few months ago \u201cto commence the appropriate actions to protect my reputation and refute these irresponsible and false accusations that can cause great prejudice and damage\u201d, he continued. \u201cAlthough I am by no means perfect, I know that these allegations are simply untrue. And while I will always work to improve myself, I need to contest claims that are both false and offensive.\u201d R\u00edos, a professional saxophonist, accused Huerta of sexual assault in several tweets in recent days, in which she referred to him as a \u201csexual predator\u201d. She has become an anti-femicide activist after being permanently maimed in a 2019 acid attack organized by her ex-boyfriend, an influential politician in Mexico. Marvel has not confirmed whether Huerta will reprise his role as Namor in future Black Panther films. Huerta is not the first high-profile Marvel cast member to be publicly accused of sexual assault; in March, Jonathan Majors, who was poised to become a pre-eminent Marvel villain following the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was charged with assault and harassment after police responded to a 911 call about a domestic dispute in Manhattan. At the time of his arrest, his defense lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, claimed that Majors was \u201cprobably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows\u201d and said the victim was having \u201can emotional crisis\u201d. Chaudhry later released text messages intended to prove Majors\u2019 innocence, though many advocates viewed them as consistent with the words and behavior of domestic abuse victims. The following month, Majors was dropped by his PR team and his management. His future with Marvel remains unclear. Huerta added in his statement: \u201cI am deeply grateful to my family and the people who have supported me and greatly appreciate everyone who is willing to look at the facts and reflect before rushing to an untrue and unjust conclusion.\u201d Huerta is also known for roles in Narcos: Mexico and The Forever Purge.

There is an acceptance things will be different this time, however, as the tourists swiftly park their delight at victory in the World Test Championship final on Sunday and turn their attention to Friday, day one of the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, and an England side that bats like the clappers. Over the past two years Australia\u2019s bowling attack has conceded 2.9 runs per over, a figure in line with the 2019 Ashes campaign when Mitchell Starc \u2013 an attacking but profligate left\u2011armer \u2013 was forced to wait until the fourth Test at Old Trafford and the control of Peter Siddle and James Pattinson largely preferred by the management. But against India at the Oval, where the sun beat down and the outfield was lightning fast, they went at 3.97 runs per over \u2013 Starc\u2019s economy rate was 5.3 \u2013 and this may rise further in the coming weeks; under Ben Stokes, England have scored at 4.85 per over, a figure unrivalled in Test history and central to a run of 11 wins in 13 matches. \u201cMost of our bowlers went at above what they\u2019d usually go and we\u2019ve just got to get our heads around that the tempo will be slightly different [against England],\u201d said Andrew McDonald, Australia\u2019s head coach, after his side\u2019s triumph at the Oval. \u201cMitch went for a bit more than the others \u2013 he generally does \u2013 but they complement each other really well. His wicket-taking ability is second to none. We\u2019ve got to weigh all that up. But it\u2019s not a concern. We know what we\u2019re in for in the summer is a slightly higher run-rate and that\u2019s because of the grounds and the surfaces.\u201d While McDonald was right to stress that a compact five-Test series that is due to end on 31 July means rotation is inevitable \u2013 and his side has been augmented by the emergence of a genuine all-rounder in Cameron Green \u2013 the makeup of Australia\u2019s attack for Edgbaston will nevertheless be intriguing. From the outside, with Pat Cummins the captain and Scott Boland the form bowler in the side and England\u2019s nemesis 18 months ago, the final call appears a straight decision between Josh Hazlewood, who is expected to be fit after missing the WTC final with a side problem, and the more grooved Starc. By contrast, England must decide if Moeen Ali comes into the side after Jack Leach\u2019s back injury ruled him out of the series. The alternative is to play four seamers and rely on Joe Root\u2019s off-breaks for relief, with the ability of Stokes to overcome his longstanding knee injury and bowl another complicating factor. A week of hot weather in Birmingham makes an all-seam England attack less likely and means that one of Jimmy Anderson, Ollie Robinson, Stuart Broad and Mark Wood will have to make way. McDonald, noting Moeen\u2019s two-year break from Test cricket, is sensing a possible vulnerability here. McDonald said: \u201cMo hasn\u2019t played a red-ball game for an extended period of time, nNo doubt he\u2019ll be prepared, he\u2019s had a couple of weeks\u2019 notice. But Jack Leach really complemented that attack and his wicket\u2011taking ability and the way Ben Stokes has used him has been a little more aggressive and has reaped some great rewards. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same \u2013 they\u2019ll have to operate fractionally differently \u2013 no doubt about that.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/12/uefa-ticket-football-match-free-water", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "If Uefa can charge \u00a3600 for a ticket, why can\u2019t they give out free water to fans? | Will Dean", "lead": "The problems I and so many other Manchester City fans experienced in Istanbul made me wonder \u2013 how is Uefa so bad at this?", "author": "Will Dean", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T18:00:27Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080181", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/15b95e776708f4eab7bab198d3d963fc7b0904b7/0_262_5053_3031/500.jpg", "body": "The block across from us \u2013 full of guests of the potato chip brand Lay\u2019s \u2013 all had their phones ready to capture the big moment. Manchester City had just defeated Internazionale to become European champions and win the treble. Fans around us cried and hugged as Ilkay G\u00fcndogan walked up to lift his third trophy in a month. This was the endpoint of a wild journey for the team that I\u2019ve been watching since my first match in 1992. It was, as a football fan, as good as it could ever possibly get, but almost all I could think about was: how the hell can I get some water? In an attempt to keep the rival fans apart, beat Istanbul\u2019s impressively stubborn traffic and get everyone to their seats in time, Uefa had insisted that City\u2019s fans start heading to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium, in the far north-west of the city, from as early as 1pm. They were instructed to gather outside a grim \u201cfan park\u201d on the city\u2019s south coast to catch a supposed hour\u2019s shuttle bus to the ground. When we arrived outside the fan park at about 3pm (with kick-off still seven hours away) a giant queue snaked down the unshaded pavement in the baking heat. Of course the only toilets were located inside the fan park \u2013 which meant queuing up, going through airport-style scanners and having our water confiscated (why?) before finding the loos, buying more water and going back out to queue for the buses again. At the front of that queue our water was taken off us again by the police before we boarded a shuttle bus to another fan park outside the stadium. With traffic gridlocked for the entire 17-mile journey, the ride took more than two hours. For others it was longer. Friends witnessed people peeing in plastic bags: in the end many people were so desperate to escape they forced the bus doors and walked the rest of the way. We watched in amusement as they overtook us on foot as we crawled to the stadium. We arrived at the fan park just before 7pm \u2013 where, if we\u2019d had any water, it would have no doubt been confiscated. Giant screens soon informed us that the bars and food stands in the fan park were now closed and we would have to head into the stadium. Still, at least there were only three hours to wait before kick-off. The ticket system, at least, worked well \u2013 and the terrifying scenes outside the Stade de France last year when Liverpool fans with tickets were teargassed weren\u2019t repeated at the gates. However, once inside \u2013 and after having another bottle of water and a tiny bottle of suncream confiscated \u2013 we were desperate for food and water and trudged around only to find the few concession stands had giant queues. Due to a lack of card machines at this Mastercard-sponsored mega event, people were struggling to buy anything. I ended up queuing for an hour to pay \u00a338 for two hot dogs, some crisps and some water \u2013 and in my dehydrated state was grateful for that. In other parts of the ground, the queue was more than two hours. I was amused to note, just before Rodri\u2019s curling winner \u2013 and scenes of delirium in the City end \u2013 a sponsor\u2019s stunt to the left of us in the corporate section: someone having a JustEat delivery brought to their seats. A nice touch to remind us who this event is really for. Gone midnight, after the game and the hugs and tears of victory, things were much worse. City fans were directed to a car park and shuttle buses that either weren\u2019t there or couldn\u2019t move. People in wheelchairs were being lifted across rough terrain and I saw a man with crutches struggle in the queue. Older fans were on their feet for hours. My friend Nick and his 77-year-old father John ended up walking down to the gridlocked motorway and paying \u20ac100 for a taxi to their hotel. My friends and I \u2013 all youngish and able-bodied \u2013 ignored the official advice and made the half-hour walk \u2013 past the giant VIP tent and its well-managed coach park \u2013 to the metro station north of the stadium, which we\u2019d been told had been reserved for Inter fans. We got back to the centre of the city at 3am. Thankfully the party was still going and we were able to celebrate with other Blues. Many weren\u2019t so lucky and were waiting for buses until the early hours. How is Uefa so bad at this? Entrepreneurial young men selling bottles of water and cans of beer from plastic bags outside the gates provided a much more efficient (and cheaper) supply than anything provided by the governing body. Obviously I am under no illusion that this would be an event for lifelong fans but you\u2019d hope that an organisation that accrued \u20ac3.5bn in revenue from this season\u2019s club competitions would be able to make sure people stay hydrated. So here\u2019s just one extremely cheap and easy suggestion for Uefa for finals held in our increasingly warm continent: give fans at the ground free water \u2013 it\u2019s the least you can get for tickets that ranged from \u00a360 to \u00a3600. And it\u2019s so basic \u2013 especially compared with the herculean task of trying to outmanoeuvre notoriously bad traffic. And I know, I know, it feels extremely churlish to moan after being lucky enough to be at the match when others struggled in vain to get a ticket \u2013 and especially given what happened to Liverpool supporters in Paris last year. But that\u2019s how Uefa get away with it \u2013 how could fans possibly complain when they\u2019re so privileged to be there? Istanbul is a wonderful, tolerant, friendly city with one of the richest football traditions on the planet. It deserves to host these kinds of showpieces. And the atmosphere among both sets of fans, with the police and the locals, was great all weekend. So here\u2019s another suggestion for the next time Uefa wants to host a Champions League final in this glorious city. Right in the centre of Istanbul sits Besiktas\u2019s gleaming new 42,000-seat stadium. City and Inter were each given 20,000 of the total 72,000 tickets to Saturday\u2019s final and Uefa said another 7,200 were available to \u201cfans and the general public\u201d. Hold it at Besiktas instead and allocate half the capacity to each team\u2019s fans. Uefa\u2019s 25,000-odd guests can watch on TV with a JustEat delivery and a can of Heineken. I realise that\u2019s an impossible dream. But I once thought the same about Manchester City being kings of Europe. Uefa has been approached for comment.

But cardiologists warn the cardiac benefits do not mean we should ignore other dangers of alcohol. \u201cWe are not advocating the use of alcohol to reduce the risk of heart attacks or strokes because of other concerning effects of alcohol on health,\u201d said cardiologist Ahmed Tawakol, lead author of the study by investigators from Massachusetts eneral hospital. Researchers wanted to understand exactly how light to moderate drinking (one drink a day for women and between one and two drinks a day for men) reduces cardiovascular disease, as demonstrated by multiple other studies. If the mechanism was understood, the goal would be to find other approaches replicating alcohol\u2019s protective effects without the adverse impacts, said Tawakol, MD, co-director of the Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center at the hospital. The study, led by co-authors Kenechukwu Mezue and Michael Osborne, the findings of which are published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at 50,000 individuals enrolled in the Mass General Brigham biobank. Adjusting for genetic, clinical, lifestyle, and socioeconomic confounders, they found a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease events in light to moderate drinkers. They then examined a subset of 754 individuals, who had previously undergone brain imaging, to determine the effect of light/moderate alcohol consumption on resting stress-related neural network activity. The brain imaging showed reduced stress signalling in the amygdala, the brain region associated with stress responses, in individuals who were light to moderate drinkers compared with those who abstained from alcohol or who drank little. It\u2019s long been known that alcohol reduces the amygdala\u2019s reactivity to threatening stimuli while individuals are drinking, but this study is the first to indicate light to moderate alcohol consumption has longer-term neurobiological effects in dampening activity in the amygdala, which may have a significant downstream impact on the cardiovascular system. \u201cWhen the amygdala is too alert and vigilant, the sympathetic nervous system is heightened, which drives up blood pressure and increases heart rate, and triggers the release of inflammatory cells,\u201d says Tawakol. \u201cIf the stress is chronic, the result is hypertension, increased inflammation, and a substantial risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\u201d Finally, investigators found that, within the 50,000-patient sample, light to moderate drinking was associated with nearly double the cardiac-protective effect in individuals with a history of anxiety compared with others. The study also showed that any amount of alcohol increases the risk of cancer. And at higher amounts of alcohol consumption \u2013 more than 14 drinks a week \u2013 heart attack risk started to increase while overall brain activity started to decrease (which may be associated with adverse cognitive health), it said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/12/tennis-who-can-stop-djokovic-calendar-grand-slam", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Novak Djokovic takes aim at calendar grand slam \u2013 and who can stop him? | Tumaini Carayol", "lead": "The 36-year-old has won the first two majors of the year and the next generation do not look ready to challenge him in finals", "author": "Tumaini Carayol", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T18:00:26Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080185", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a53b8dbd196475bd4cc9da69304a07434f0e39b8/0_138_4676_2806/500.jpg", "body": "At the 2006 edition of the French Open, Novak Djokovic took one of the first great steps of his young career by reaching his first grand slam quarter-final at 19. He had already beaten three seeded players, including the explosive world No 9 Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, but greatness awaited. Djokovic stepped on Court Philippe Chatrier for his first quarter-final against Rafael Nadal, the 20-year-old defending champion. It was not quite the longest encounter of what became a 59\u2011match rivalry. Two sets in, Djokovic retired while trailing 6-4, 6-4 with a lower back injury. He said later that he had learnt from the match that Nadal was hardly unbeatable on clay and if his back had allowed him to serve properly he would have had his chances. \u201cI think I was in control because I think everything was depending on me,\u201d Djokovic said afterwards. \u201cHow I was playing, result was like that. Even with a sore back, I think I played equal match with him.\u201d Those comments led to widespread mockery and criticism and they helped to frame the early narratives around Djokovic as he struggled with his body and retired in numerous high-profile matches. Now, 17 years on, Djokovic has edged past Nadal in the all-time standings by achieving his record 23rd grand slam title at the same tournament and on the same court. In hindsight, his comments are testament to the unflinching self\u2011belief that has driven the 36\u2011year\u2011old all the way to his goal, even when few believed. Djokovic\u2019s physical frailty, which would hamper him for years, now contrasts dramatically with the unprecedented robustness it has taken to win a record 11 grand slam tournaments and counting in his 30s while still appearing far from finished. The gap between Nadal and Djokovic had initially only increased. By 2011, three turbulent years after the Serb had won his first grand slam title and remained in pursuit of a second, Nadal\u2019s grand slam title count was nine while Roger Federer had swept up 16. He has spent his entire career chasing them down. \u201cThose two guys were occupying my mind for the last 15 years quite a lot. In a professional sense,\u201d Djokovic said, smiling, on Sunday. \u201cSo it\u2019s amazing to know that I\u2019m one ahead of both of them in grand slams.\u201d As he discussed the feeling of finally crossing 23 grand slam titles during his lengthy post\u2011match press conference on Sunday \u2013 following victory in the final against Casper Ruud \u2013 Djokovic touched on his future unprompted, asserting he has no plans to stop anytime soon: \u201cIf I\u2019m winning slams, why even think about ending the career that already has been going on for 20 years?\u201d The next achievement for Djokovic is clear \u2013 another chase for the grand slam continues. This is the third time in Djokovic\u2019s career that he has started a season by winning the Australian and French Open, placing him halfway to winning the grand slam in a calendar year. The last attempt, when he also tried to win Olympic gold, ended with Djokovic completely running out of mental steam at the very last hurdle and he was defeated in straight sets by an excellent Daniil Medvedev in the 2021 US Open final. As he pushes for the ultimate achievement in tennis, it is unclear who could consistently stop him. Clay is actually one of the tougher and most competitive surfaces, where many of the players on tour learn their trade. But on grass there aren\u2019t many elite rivals who have demonstrated their level. The younger generations have simply not taken to the surface like previous eras, and many are still just learning how to effectively move and adjust their games to the surface. With the US lifting its ban on Covid\u2011unvaccinated visitors, Djokovic will be able to return to the US Open on his favourite surface. This is also undeniably a less competitive period on the ATP. The readiness of Carlos Alcaraz, the one player who seemed to be prepared to compete at Djokovic\u2019s level, was evidently overestimated. He was unable to last for more than two sets before suffering from cramps during their semi-final in Paris because of his tension and nerves. Medvedev, the other clear obstacle, remains a genuine rival but only on hard courts. Since he broke the record for weeks at No 1, Djokovic has cited the grand slam tournaments as his primary motivation. This clay season seemed like the first time those intentions were truly realised. After his dire struggles beforehand, the intensity and motivation with which he competed in Paris marked a stark contrast. The world No 1 will look to carry himself in a similar way as he chases the two grand slam tournaments remaining this year. \u201cI said in Monte Carlo, I don\u2019t count these tournaments: Monte Carlo, Rome, anything,\u201d his coach, Goran Ivanisevic, said. \u201c[The] only tournament that counts is this one.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/12/uk-teenager-accused-baby-death-says-she-did-not-know-she-was-pregnant", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "UK teenager accused of baby\u2019s murder says she did not know she was pregnant", "lead": "Paris Mayo tells court her son was not alive when she gave birth and she feels \u2018horrible\u2019 about his death", "author": "Steven Morris", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:58:15Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080188", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9df49e35a1280f17eada737a0823c95826acc456/67_172_3361_2016/500.jpg", "body": "A teenager accused of murdering her newborn son has said she did not know she was pregnant until the last moment and insisted the child was not alive when she gave birth. Paris Mayo, who was 15 when her son, Stanley, was born, told a jury that she loved her son and felt \u201chorrible\u201d about his death, wondering what he would have been like. She said she had begun to have sex when she was 13 because she was insecure about her body and saw it was a way of making people like her. The prosecution at Worcester crown court said Mayo gave birth to her son alone in the living room of her family home in Gloucestershire in March 2019. It claims Mayo assaulted the newborn, fracturing his skull, and approximately two hours later realised the infant was still alive and stuffed pieces of cotton wool down his throat to suffocate him, before placing the baby\u2019s body in a bin bag and leaving it outside the front door. Mayo \u2013 now 19 \u2013 told the court that when Stanley was born, he was silent and his eyes were closed. She said: \u201cI started to panic because he wasn\u2019t crying or making a noise and I got really scared. It all happened so fast, I don\u2019t really remember a lot about it. I just remember he hit his head and that was really it. The [umbilical] cord was around his throat.\u201d Her barrister, Bernard Richmond KC, told her Stanley had skull fractures and asked: \u201cDid you do them to him deliberately?\u201d Mayo replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Mayo accepts she put cotton wool balls into Stanley\u2019s mouth but says it was because fluid was coming out of his mouth. \u201cTo me it looked like there was stuff coming out of his mouth,\u201d she said. She told the court: \u201cIt makes me feel really horrible because I knew I didn\u2019t want to hurt him. I do feel stupid that I didn\u2019t go and tell anyone and get help. I loved him. I always think about what he would be like and how he would have been.\u201d Richmond asked: \u201cAt any stage did you actually think Stanley was alive?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. The court heard that Stanley was conceived in the summer of 2018 and by the autumn Mayo was suffering from sickness and back and abdominal pain. Mayo said she never knew for certain she was pregnant. At times she had suspicions but she explained away her symptoms. Explaining why she had started having sex at a young age, Mayo said: \u201cI just thought it was a way to get people to like me because I was quite insecure about the way I looked and the way I was made to feel about myself at home because my family situation was quite bad.\u201d She said her late father was a bully. \u201cHe thrived on us being scared of him,\u201d she said. Mayo, of Ruardean, Gloucestershire, denies murder.

Here is a roundup of the day\u2019s headlines: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Monday it was too soon to say exactly where Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive was going, but said Washington was confident that Kyiv would continue to have success in trying to take back its land seized by Russia. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, Blinken said the US was determined to maximise its support for Ukraine so that it could succeed on the battlefield. One man was killed and another was wounded in a Russian attack on the small town of Orikhiv, in the Zaporizhzhia region of south-east Ukraine, the regional governor, Yuri Malashko, said on Monday. Malashko said three bombs damaged private houses and communications in the small town, about 5 miles (8km) from frontlines. He said the man who was killed was 48 and the one who was wounded was 32, Reuters reported. Footage released by Ukraine shows marines in a village it claims to have recaptured in its counteroffensive against Russian forces. Soldiers held up the Ukrainian flag in Storozheve, in a video posted online. The defence minister thanked the 35th Separate Brigade of Marines for regaining control of the village. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Monday he was concerned that Russia would on 17 July quit a deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertilisers from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Moscow has been threatening to walk away from the deal, known as the Black Sea grain initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July last year, if obstacles to its own grain and fertiliser shipments are not removed. The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations are working on a scheme to combat the suspected theft of Ukraine\u2019s grain by using chemical identification of grain origin, Britain\u2019s food and farming minister, Mark Spencer, said on Monday. Spencer told an International Grains Council (IGC) conference in London that Britain was leading on the scheme and that G7 countries were also working closely with Ukraine, the world\u2019s fourth largest grains exporter. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing a counteroffensive launched by Kyiv. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in Kherson region, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine\u2019s advances in western Donetsk. The largest Nato military jet exercise since the foundation of the alliance was taking place today in the skies over Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. About 10,000 soldiers from 25 countries were involved, making use of 250 military jets \u2013 70 from Germany \u2013 to prepare for an attack on one of Nato\u2019s members. Although the exercise was planned long before Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it is nevertheless being viewed as a signal towards the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin marked Russia\u2019s national day on Monday by appealing to Russians\u2019 patriotic pride at what he said was a \u201cdifficult time\u201d for the country. However, speaking at a lavish award-giving ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin made no direct comment on the latest developments in Ukraine, where Kyiv\u2019s forces have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive and have retaken several villages in the eastern Donetsk region over the past few days. Ukraine\u2019s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and farther south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, and also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine\u2019s armed forces general staff said. US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had made \u201cvisually verified advances\u201d in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources \u201cconfirmed but sought to downplay\u201d those advances. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Ukraine\u2019s environment minister said on Monday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Donetsk, reported that Avdiivka was struck twice by rockets on Monday morning. A 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after the mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to do so. The signing followed an order that all \u201cvolunteer units\u201d should sign contracts by 1 July bringing them under the control of the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, as Moscow tries to assert its control over private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. The former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev celebrated Russia Day by posting a an edited image to Telegram that showed Kyiv\u2019s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message \u201cIndependence Square. Coming soon \u2013 Russia Square\u201d. Work has started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reported that the flood water level in Kherson had dropped by 64cm. That\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed from the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Lawyers for Ukraine at the top UN court have rejected Russia\u2019s account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a \u201crambling conspiracy theory\u201d, in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says Moscow violated a UN anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russia forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew, in July 2014, Reuters reports. Last November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had \u201coverall control\u201d over the separatist forces. Russia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the international court of justice, Russia said Ukraine\u2019s MH17 case was based on \u201cnonsense\u201d and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened. On Monday, Ukraine\u2019s lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been \u201csubjected to a rambling conspiracy theory\u201d about the shooting down of MH17 that would be \u201cbetter relegated to the darkest corners of the internet\u201d. Kyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and to order it to pay reparations. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Monday it was too soon to say exactly where Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive was going, but said Washington was confident that Kyiv would continue to have success in trying to take back its land seized by Russia. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, Blinken said the US was determined to maximise its support for Ukraine so it could succeed on the battlefield. He said a \u201crobust\u201d package of political and practical support for Ukraine could be expected at the upcoming Nato summit in Vilnius. Footage released by Ukraine shows marines in a village it claims to have recaptured in its counteroffensive against Russian forces. Soldiers held up the Ukrainian flag in Storozheve, in a video posted online. The defence minister thanked the 35th Separate Brigade of Marines for regaining control of the village. The location of the footage can be verified from the buildings, trees and road layout but the date the video was filmed could not be verified. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Monday he was concerned that Russia would on 17 July quit a deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertilisers from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Moscow has been threatening to walk away from the deal, known as the Black Sea grain initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July last year, if obstacles to its own grain and fertiliser shipments are not removed. \u201cI am concerned and we are working hard in order to make sure that it will be possible to maintain the Black Sea initiative and at the same time that we are able to go on in our work to facilitate Russian exports,\u201d Guterres told reporters. A fifth village has been liberated by Ukrainian forces as part of its counteroffensive, it has been reported. The Institute for the Study of War reported that Ukraine said earlier on Monday that Kyiv had reclaimed five towns and villages. Sky News has since reported: The fifth has now been corroborated by the Zaporizhzhia separate territorial defence brigade, which said they had taken Novodarivka. \u201cNumerous attempts by the enemy to return the settlement under control, which lasted several days, were unsuccessful,\u201d the Zaporizhzhia separate territorial defence brigade said. One man was killed and another was wounded in a Russian attack on the small town of Orikhiv, in the Zaporizhzhia region of south-east Ukraine, the regional governor, Yuri Malashko, said on Monday. Malashko said three bombs damaged private houses and communications in the small town, about 8km (5 miles) from frontlines. He said the man who was killed was 48 and the one who was wounded was 32, Reuters reported. Officials have said several hundred residents remain in the town, although infrastructure there has been largely destroyed by Russian forces, which seized most of the Zaporizhzhia region in the early months of its full-scale invasion last year. Ukraine says its troops have taken back four villages from Russian forces in the south-east after hitting back to try to recapture occupied territory. The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations are working on a scheme to combat the suspected theft of Ukraine\u2019s grain by using chemical identification of grain origin, Britain\u2019s food and farming minister, Mark Spencer, said on Monday. Spencer told an International Grains Council (IGC) conference in London that Britain was leading on the scheme and that G7 countries were also working closely with Ukraine, the world\u2019s fourth largest grains exporter. \u201cWe believe [chemical identification] will be an effective means for deterring further theft of Ukraine\u2019s grain,\u201d Spencer said. Britain announced a new wave of sanctions last month on Russia over its war against Ukraine, targeting \u201cshady individuals and entities\u201d connected to the suspected theft of Ukrainian grain, Reuters reported. Targeting entities involved in grain trading is unusual as such activity typically comes under humanitarian exemptions from sanctions. Russia and Ukraine are major grain exporters to developing countries in Africa and the Middle East. Suspilne reports that a man has died and private housing and communications have been destroyed as a result of a Russian attack. Citing a regional authority, it said: \u201cAs a result of a Russian strike with guided aerial bombs on Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, a man died, another was hospitalised. Destroyed private houses and communications.\u201d Vladimir Putin has said that Ukraine has been striking at civilian and humanitarian targets, and that it makes no military sense. In quotes carried by Tass, the Russian president is reported to have said: Why, frankly, is the enemy hitting residential areas? No logic. For what, why, what\u2019s the point? And obviously humanitarian targets \u2013 it\u2019s amazing. And there is no military sense, it\u2019s zero. He is said to have made the comments during conversations while giving out awards earlier today. As of May 2023, the UN had recorded 18,802 civilian casualties, including 6,754 killed, in areas of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv and attacked by Russian forces. Ukraine has launched some cross-border shelling into Russian regions bordering the country including Kursk and Belgorod, and is accused of launching drone attacks on targets within Russia\u2019s borders. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a video of the latest prisoner exchange on Twitter. To accompany the footage, Ukraine\u2019s president wrote: \u201cEvery time we bring our people back from Russian captivity, we remember our fundamental goal: we will not leave anyone of ours, nothing of Ukraine to the enemy. \u201cYesterday we returned 95 more of our guys, our warriors, from captivity. In total, since 24 February last year, we have already returned 2,526 Ukrainians. [\u2026] \u201cWe remember everyone, we are searching for each and every one of them, and we have to bring them all back. And we will!\u201d The largest Nato military jet exercise since the foundation of the alliance is taking place today in the skies over Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. About 10,000 soldiers from 25 countries are involved, making use of 250 military jets \u2013 70 from Germany \u2013 to prepare for an attack on one of Nato\u2019s members. Although the exercise was planned long before Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it is nevertheless being viewed as a signal towards Kremlin leader, Vladimir Putin. The manoeuvres, called Air Defender 2023, are taking place under German leadership. They are being interpreted, in Germany at least, as a chance for Europe\u2019s largest country to prove its military capabilities, even as it has been perceived as being reluctant or slow to provide full-blown support to Ukraine. However, recognised now as the second biggest provider of military support to Ukraine after the United States, German defence chiefs say it is a useful exercise not least in proving Germany\u2019s commitment to European and international security. Civilian aircraft are expected to be mildly affected by the exercises, with some delays due at airports in Germany. However, Ingo Gerhartz, inspector of Germany\u2019s air force, said delays would be kept to a minimum. The exercise had been deliberately timed to take place before the main holiday period to cause as little disruption as possible. However, Matthias Maas, the head of the German air traffic controller union, GdF, said he expected the exercise would have a \u201cmassive impact\u201d on the timetable of civil airlines. President Vladimir Putin marked Russia\u2019s national day on Monday by appealing to Russians\u2019 patriotic pride at what he said was a \u201cdifficult time\u201d for the country. However, speaking at a lavish award-giving ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin made no direct comment on the latest developments in Ukraine, where Kyiv\u2019s forces have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive and have retaken several villages in the eastern Donetsk region over the past few days. \u201cThis public holiday marks the inseparability of our centuries-old history, the greatness and glory of the fatherland,\u201d Putin told the assembled dignitaries. \u201cToday, at a difficult time for Russia, [feelings of patriotism and pride] unite our society even more strongly \u2026 [and] serve as a reliable support for our heroes taking part in the special military operation [in Ukraine],\u201d Putin said. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing a counteroffensive launched by Kyiv. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in Kherson region, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine\u2019s advances in western Donetsk. Ukrainian forces have moved along both sides of the river, southwards from the town of Velyka Novosilka, declaring the liberation of a string of villages: Blahodatne on the east bank and Neskuchne, Makarivka and Storozheve on the west side. The armed forces have published pictures of their units holding up flags in what were claimed to be the recaptured villages. The claims could not be independently verified, but Russian military bloggers confirmed the Ukrainian advance and reported heavy fighting overnight and on Monday morning for the next village along, Urozhaine, on the east bank of the river, straddling the road south-east towards Mariupol. Russia\u2019s defence ministry on Monday said Ukrainian forces had attempted to press their offensives in the south of the Donetsk region in the last 24 hours, Russian news agencies reported. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the battlefield reports. Swiss authorities said several government websites were targeted in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on Monday that was claimed by pro-Russian hackers. The attack comes as the Swiss parliament prepares for a video address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, scheduled for Thursday, and coincides with a national holiday in Russia, Reuters reported. Switzerland\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said that \u201cvarious websites of the federal administration and enterprises affiliated with the confederation were unavailable\u201d in the wake of the attack, claimed by the NoName hacking group. \u201cThe NCSC is analysing the attack together with the administrative units concerned and defining appropriate measures,\u201d it said in a statement. The NCSC, which did not link Zelenskiy\u2019s upcoming address to the attack, said the NoName group had also been behind a separate attack against the Swiss parliament\u2019s website last week. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces claim to have liberated several frontline villages in western Donetsk, almost a week after the launch of counteroffensive operations. Soldiers were shown in video footage raising the Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit\u2019s banner in Neskuchne. Later on Sunday, Kyiv said a third village, Makarivka, had been taken. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, announced the liberation of Storozheve by Ukrainian marines on Monday morning. Ukraine\u2019s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and farther south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, and also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine\u2019s armed forces general staff said.

Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reported that the flood water level in Kherson had dropped by 64cm. Three civilians were killed Sunday and 10 others wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reported. Two of the 10 people wounded were law enforcement officers. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt at the weekend to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, it said. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has reported that Avdiivka was struck this morning. He posted to Telegram: The terrorists hit the city again this morning, at 09.10am, with two rockets. According to preliminary information, there were no casualties; the wounded are provided with medical assistance in a local hospital. Kyrylenko posted images which he said showed damage to the House of Culture on Tsentralnyi Prospect, and damaged residential high-rise buildings. The claims have not been independently verified. Former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has celebrated Russia day by posting a photoshopped image to Telegram which shows Kyiv\u2019s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message \u201cIndependence Square. Coming soon \u2013 Russia Square\u201d. Russia\u2019s initial full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 included a failed attempt to take Ukraine\u2019s capital with forces launched from Belarus. Here are some more images that have been sent over the news wires of the flooding in Kherson James Waterhouse, the BBC\u2019s Ukraine correspondent, has this to temper enthusiasm for the news being released from Kyiv about the liberation of villages in Ukraine\u2019s south. He writes: The sight of soldiers once again liberating villages is an exciting one for Kyiv and its allies. What we will hear less about, is where progress has been slower or nonexistent. In the Zaporizhzhia region, a lot of men &amp; equipment have been lost as Ukraine probes for weaknesses. Lt Dmitry Mishov, a member of Russian service personnel who, rather than be sent to serve in Ukraine, defected to Lithuania and applied for political asylum, has given an interview to the BBC in which he said: I am a military officer, my duty is to protect my country from aggression. I don\u2019t have to become an accomplice in a crime. No one explained to us why this war started, why we had to attack Ukrainians and destroy their cities? In the military no one believes the authorities. They can see what is really happening. They are not some civilians in front of the telly. The military do not believe official reports, because they are simply not true. I was not refusing to serve in the army as such. I would serve my country if it faced a real threat. I was only refusing to be an accomplice in a crime. Had I boarded that helicopter [for an unspecified mission he suspected was deployment to Ukraine], I would have taken the lives of several dozen people, at the very least. I didn\u2019t want to do that. Ukrainians are not our enemy. The UK\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine is in the UK at the moment, and has tweeted indicating the psychological toll residents of Kyiv and elsewhere in Ukraine are under. Melinda Simmons wrote: I am in the UK for some meetings and how it feels to not be in Ukraine after living through nightly Russian airstrikes is beyond words. A motorbike backfires and hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Any kind of bang and my heart races. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Reuters reports Ukraine\u2019s environment minister said on Monday. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to do so.

In return, volunteer fighters would get the same benefits and protections as regular troops, including support for them and their families if they are wounded or killed. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. Emma Graham-Harrison reports for us on the likely destruction of Polina Rayko\u2019s house in Oleshky, Kherson, which famously housed her artwork painted all over the walls. It is thought to be under water after the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. Read more here: \u2018Masterpiece\u2019 house is latest victim of Putin\u2019s war on Ukrainian heritage Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, offers this update on developments in the last 24 hours: In the morning and at night, the Russian army attacked Kharkiv oblast: a man was wounded in Shevchenkove, another was injured during the shelling of Vilkhuvatka. In khorosheve, one two-story building was destroyed, the other was damaged. As of this morning, the average level of flooding in the Kherson region is 3.29m. Since yesterday evening the water has receded by 64cm. The Kakhovka reservoir has already lost more than 72% of its water. Over the past day, three people were killed and 12 injured in Kherson oblast due to shelling by the Russian army; one person died in Donetsk region, two others were injured; in Zaporizhzhia, a woman was wounded. The claims have not been independently verified. It is Russia day today, and in occupied Luhansk the Russian-imposed leader Leonid Pasechnik has issued a statement saying that the claimed annexation of the Ukrainian region by the Russian Federation had given it \u201ca new life\u201d. Tass quotes Pasechnik saying in a statement: Having reunited with Russia, we felt the attention from the state, the unity and mutual assistance of the peoples of a vast country. Social protection, large-scale construction, modernisation of education and healthcare, the revival of agriculture and industry \u2013 Luhansk region, without exaggeration, received a new life. Luhansk is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia claimed to annex late last year, despite not controlling the entirety of the territory. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Kherson over the news wires. Ukraine has issued this video which shows footage from the liberation of Storozheve. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has announced the liberation of Storozheve by Ukrainian marines on her Telegram channel. It is a really tiny place, a hamlet, across the Mokri Yaly river from Blahodatne, which was recaptured over the weekend. She wrote: The national flag is flying over Storozheve again, and it will be the same with every settlement until we liberate all Ukrainian land. Thank you Rear Adm Mykhailo Ostrogradskyi, 35th Separate Brigade of Marines. To be continued \u2026 Glory to Ukraine! According to Russian military bloggers, the battle is on now for Urozhaine to the south, as the Ukrainians fight their way village to village, on both sides of the river. Ukrainian officials say the Russians blew up a small dam on the Mokri Yaly upstream, in an effort to hinder the offensive. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that a 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. It cited the local authority as the source of the information. My colleague, Dan Sabbagh, has described the latest developments as \u201cincremental, but real progress\u201d for Ukraine, while posting an image which purports to show the liberation of the village of Storozheve. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukrainian forces gained territory over the weekend while carrying out counteroffensive operations in at least three areas of the frontline, the Institute for the Study of War has said. The US thinktank said Ukrainian forces had made \u201cvisually verified advances\u201d in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources \u201cconfirmed but sought to downplay\u201d those advances. The institute said in its update that Kyiv had reported that Ukrainian forces were conducting offensive operations in the Bakhmut area and that Russian sources had reported continued Ukrainian ground attacks on the northern and southern flanks of the city, in the Donetsk region. Geolocated footage and Russian sources indicated that Ukrainian forces liberated multiple settlements during continued ground attacks south, southwest and southeast of Velyka Novosilka in western Donetsk oblast. The institute quoted the Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, as saying Russian forces were transferring their most combat-capable units from the Kherson direction towards the Bakhmut and Zaporizhia areas. Ukraine\u2019s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots, a day after Kyiv said it had made the first modest gains in reclaiming territory from Russia in its counteroffensive. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and further south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, but also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine\u2019s armed forces general staff said. Reuters also reported that Ukraine had said on Sunday that its troops had made advances on three villages in Donetsk: Blahodatne, Neskuchne and Makarivka. The claims could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from Russian officials. Some prominent Russian military bloggers indicated that while Ukrainian forces took Blahodatne and Neskuchne, fighting for Makarivka was going on. Work has already started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. In his nightly video address on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said representatives of the court had visited the Kherson region in recent days. He said: On the very first day after the disaster, the general prosecutor\u2019s office sent a corresponding request to the international criminal court concerning an investigation of this disaster and the work has already begun. Zelenskiy said it was important that international legal experts saw the aftermath of the disaster, including incidents of shelling of flooded areas. Officials said three people were killed on Sunday in Russian shelling of boats carrying evacuees. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian rescue teams had evacuated about 4,000 residents from affected zones, including areas on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro River. Ukraine has said its troops have recaptured three villages from Russian forces in its south-east, the first liberated settlements it has reported since launching a counteroffensive last week. Kyiv\u2019s forces posted unverified videos showing soldiers hoisting the Ukrainian flag at a bombed-out building in the village of Blahodatne, in the Donetsk region, and posing with their unit\u2019s flag in the adjacent village of Neskuchne, Reuters reported. Valeryi Shershen, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cTavria\u201d military sector, said on television on Sunday: We\u2019re seeing the first results of the counteroffensive actions, localised results. Ukraine\u2019s army also retook Makarivka, the next village to the south, and advanced between 300 and 1,500 metres in two directions on the southern front, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said in a statement. She added: No positions were lost on the directions where our forces are on the defensive. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Friday that a Ukrainian military push was well under way but that it had failed so far to breach Russian defensive lines and had taken heavy casualties. Kyiv officials have imposed a strict period of operational silence and urged Ukrainians not to disclose any information that could compromise the operation. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Adam Fulton and here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments to bring you up to speed. Ukraine says it is seeing the first results of its counteroffensive and that its forces have recaptured three villages from Russia in south-eastern Ukraine. Kyiv\u2019s forces posted videos showing them raising the Ukrainian flag in the village of Blahodatne in the Donetsk region and posing with their unit\u2019s flag in the adjacent village of Neskuchne, while Kyiv said its troops had also retaken the village of Makarivka to the south. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the first results of the counteroffensive actions, localised results,\u201d Valeryi Shershen, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s Tavria military sector, said on television. Counteroffensive operations were launched last week. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said work had already begun in an investigation by the international criminal court into the Kakhovka dam disaster and the vast flood damage it caused. He said representatives of the court had visited the Kherson region in recent days after the dam breach, which Ukraine has accused Russian forces of causing. More on both those stories shortly. In other news: Three civilians were killed and 10 others wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reported. Two of the 10 people wounded were law enforcement officers. The head of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his fighters would not sign contracts with the Russian defence ministry, hours after the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, sought to bring volunteer detachments under its control. \u201cWagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\u201d Prigozhin said on Sunday, adding that the minister \u201ccannot properly manage military formations\u201d. Wagner was completely subordinated to the interests of Russia, Prigozhin said, but its command structure would be damaged by reporting to Shoigu. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet in Kherson region, where the Kakhovka dam breach led to major flooding. Russia also repelled three Ukrainian attacks in the Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said, while the Tass news agency reported Russian air defence systems shot down a Ukrainian missile near the Russian-controlled port city of Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, it said. Russian forces blew up the Khakhovka dam to prevent Ukrainian troops from launching an offensive and advancing in the southern Kherson region, according to Kyiv\u2019s deputy defence minister. Hanna Maliar said the action was also intended to help Russia deploy reserves to the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut areas. Russia and Ukraine have simultaneously swapped nearly 100 prisoners each. The Ukrainian prisoners included members of the national guard and border guards who had been in action in several places, including near the city of Mariupol and the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Russia\u2019s defence minister has awarded medals to soldiers after Moscow said its forces had destroyed four German-made Leopard tanks and five US-made Bradley fighting vehicles while repelling a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sergei Shoigu was shown on state television awarding the Hero of Russia gold star, Russia\u2019s highest military honour, on Sunday to soldiers who said they had destroyed enemy tanks and armoured vehicles. Two drones crashed early on Sunday in Russia\u2019s Kaluga region \u2013 one near the village of Strelkovka, another in the woods in the Medynsky municipal district, according to the region\u2019s governor, Vladislav Shapsha. There were no casualties and only minimal damage, he said on Telegram. A US citizen arrested in Russia on drugs charges this week is a military veteran and musician who has lived in Moscow for nearly a decade. Travis Michael Leake and a friend, Valeria Grobanyuk, were arrested in a drug raid that has the potential to further ignite tensions between Washington and Moscow. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m here,\u201d said a man shown on camera and identified by Russian state media as Leake. \u201cI do not admit my guilt.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/12/rishi-sunak-would-block-boris-johnson-comeback-as-tory-mp-sources-say", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Rishi Sunak would block Boris Johnson comeback as Tory MP, sources say", "lead": "PM has clashed publicly with predecessor over failed attempts to elevate several close allies to Lords", "author": "Pippa Crerar and Kiran Stacey", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:50:36Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080191", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9d61dc30e09a150b3e4f8ddbbe028d6cb6994151/1788_952_6249_3752/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak would block Boris Johnson from standing again as a Conservative MP before the next election, sources have told the Guardian, as the two men engaged in an extraordinary war of words. The prime minister clashed publicly with Johnson over his failed attempts to elevate several close allies to the House of Lords, accusing him of having lobbied to overturn due process to appoint the three Tory MPs. Johnson dismissed his claims as \u201crubbish\u201d. The exchanges brought into the open the bitter long-running dispute between the two politicians, which has caused a wider rift in the Conservative party and triggered a series of byelections that could test Sunak\u2019s grip on power. Johnson unexpectedly announced on Friday he would resign as an MP immediately after learning that the House of Commons privileges committee was to recommend he be suspended for at least 10 days for lying to MPs about Partygate. However, he hinted he could try to make a return to frontline politics, saying he was \u201cvery sad to be leaving parliament \u2013 at least for now\u201d, while close allies said he had felt cheated after being forced out of No 10. The committee is expected rule that the former prime minister was not advised by his officials to say that social distancing guidelines had been observed, contrary to a claim he made repeatedly to the House of Commons. Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters remained tight-lipped over whether Sunak, as Tory party leader, would block Johnson\u2019s return to the party\u2019s candidate list before the next election. However, one senior party figure told the Guardian: \u201cI can see no time when he will be a candidate this year or next.\u201d Another senior Tory insider added: \u201cIt\u2019s the leader who is in charge of the party. Why would Rishi let Boris on to the candidate list? It\u2019s pretty obvious to me that he won\u2019t. The party needs to move forward from this clown show. The vast majority of MPs agree.\u201d A poll by YouGov found there was little appetite among the public for Johnson to return to parliament, with just 25% wanting this to happen at some point in the future. A majority of Britons (56%) do not want Johnson to come back as an MP. Johnson formally stepped down as an MP on Monday, bringing down the curtain on a tumultuous second stint in the Commons that included him delivering Brexit, leading the country during the pandemic and supporting Ukraine, but was also plagued with scandal, cronyism rows and chaotic mismanagement. He has shown little sign of planning to go quietly, with his camp accusing the prime minister of having \u201csecretly blocked\u201d the peerages of three allies \u2013 the Tory former ministers Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams and Alok Sharma \u2013 from his resignation list. Speaking to TalkTV on Monday night, Dorries said she only learned she had not made the resignation honours list half an hour before it was published. The former culture secretary claimed she resigned as an MP after being \u201cbullied\u201d by No 10 as she accused Sunak of \u201cduplicitously and cruelly\u201d blocking her from getting a peerage. She said: \u201cI spoke to the chief whip in the morning and he said: \u2018No, everything\u2019s fine\u2019. He got back to me 30 minutes before the list was published and said: \u2018Actually, you\u2019re not on the list.\u2019\u201d She added she was first told the news by a Times journalist, Steven Swinford, on Thursday night and \u201cdidn\u2019t believe him\u201d. After remaining silent over the weekend, Sunak blew the row wide open when asked about it after a speech at London Tech Week, as he defended the decision of the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac) to block the MPs. \u201cBoris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn\u2019t prepared to do, because I didn\u2019t think it was right. That was either overrule the Holac committee, or make promises to people,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I wasn\u2019t prepared to do that, so I didn\u2019t think it was right. And if people don\u2019t like that then tough.\u201d Johnson hit back within hours, issuing a statement saying: \u201cRishi Sunak is talking rubbish. To honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac \u2013 but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality.\u201d His allies had claimed that Johnson reached a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d with the prime minister that he would wave through the honours list and allow the MPs to be re-vetted by Holac at a later date, so they would not have to stand down now. However, one Downing Street source said the Cabinet Office had made it clear to Johnson that there was no re-vetting process, while the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said it was \u201centirely untrue\u201d that Sunak or his No 10 team had removed names from the list. The privileges committee, which has a Tory majority, met on Monday to finalise and discuss its report into Johnson, who has dismissed the investigation as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. The MPs are expected to publish the report on Wednesday at the earliest. The committee has already decided its sanction for the former prime minister and this is not expected to change as a result of his comments impugning its integrity, which some Westminster figures had suggested may lead to a longer suspension. However, the Guardian understands that the MPs are likely to comment on his criticisms when they publish and could also warn Johnson\u2019s allies that some of their remarks questioning the impartiality of the committee are unacceptable. His allies have never forgiven Sunak for his decision to stand down as chancellor last year, a move they believe helped bring Johnson down as prime minister. Tensions were renewed in recent weeks over the honours list and the Covid-19 inquiry WhatsApp row. Tory MPs have been left despairing at the \u201cblue on blue\u201d in-fighting, which has threatened to plunge the party into civil war and which they fear will leave the public thinking they are more focused on internal matters than major issues such as the cost of living crisis."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/12/spain-pick-three-of-the-15-players-who-quit-national-team-last-year-for-world-cup", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup: Spain pick three of 15 players who quit national side in 2022", "lead": "Three of the 15 Spain players who staged a mutiny have returned to the squad in time for the World Cup", "author": "Sid Lowe in Madrid", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:47:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080193", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa3d837cc3192405b6a0fd1fd22ef68acec4571/1_0_3022_1814/500.jpg", "body": "Three of the 15 Spain players who staged a mutiny, writing to the federation to declare themselves unavailable for selection, have returned to the squad in time for the World Cup. The Ballon d\u2019Or winner Alexia Putellas has also been included in the preliminary list of 30 for Australia and New Zealand having finally overcome the knee injury that forced her to miss the European Championship last summer, as has Irene Paredes who first returned to the national team after a seven-month absence in March. Neither Putellas nor Paredes had sent the letter but both supported those who had. Aitana Bonmat\u00ed and Mariona Caldentey from Barcelona and Manchester United\u2019s Ona Batlle have been included in the initial squad, which will be reduced to 23 at the end of June. They had all previously spoken to the federation about a return. The other 12 players who pulled out in September last year \u2013 among them the Champions League winners Patri Guijarro, Mapi Le\u00f3n and Sandra Pa\u00f1os \u2013 have not been called up. In March, Le\u00f3n said: \u201cIt will really piss me off not to go to the World Cup but my values come first.\u201d The Spain coach, Jorge Vilda, gave no explanation for their continued absence and refused to discuss the conversations that have taken place over the past nine months or confirm whether the returnees had apologised, but described the squad as being made up of those who are \u201ccommitted\u201d. Vilda said he would not get into \u201chypothesis\u201d over who he would have selected had they all been available, saying he decided once he had \u201call the cards on the table\u201d. He also insisted that the federation had been \u201copen to dialogue\u201d and declared the issue was \u201cpractically resolved\u201d, although he admitted \u201ca few details\u201d remained. The 15 players simultaneously sent identical letters to the federation in September last year, insisting that the situation within the national team had affected their health and mental state and they would not return until there was a solution. They had hoped for the removal of Vilda but a statement from the federation described the mutiny as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and vowed \u201cnot [to] allow players to question the continuity of the coach\u201d. It warned: \u201cThe players who have presented their resignation will only return in the future if they admit their error and apologise.\u201d Putellas, who was injured at the time, did not send the letter. Nor did Paredes, although as captain she had been the spokesperson for tense discussions with the federation three weeks earlier. She denied then that the players had demanded that Vilda be removed but went seven months without being called up. Asked about discussions with those who had returned and those who had not, Vilda insisted: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think that is what matters; what matters is that they are here, which means they are committed to the national team and they can compete at the World Cup. I don\u2019t want to talk about that process.\u201d \u201cThere have been conversations but those will remain private as always,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the decisions that have been taken. Some [of the 15] are here and I am convinced they will work to be part of the group and that they will fight for the biggest thing there is in sport, which is to represent for your country. The 30 who come are sportspeople and they want to build a strong group, they want the best players alongside them. Living sport unites you. I am convinced there will be concordance, calm and harmony. \u201cSince September, things have happened but one of the best things that has happened is that 11 games were played, we won nine, drew one and lost one. We beat the US for the first time, got to sixth in the world ranking, which allowed us to be seeds for this tournament and we want to climb higher \u2013 which I am convinced we can with these players.

Nothing to see here. That was very much the subtext of Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech to open London Tech week. Rather he was just talking Tech Bro to Tech Bro. He was the man who really got AI. Understood both its risks and potential. Stick with him. The Tories were the party of the future. Only it wasn\u2019t long before the past caught up with him. It turned out that not everyone was quite as interested in what the prime minister had to say about AI as he was. Almost inevitably, first came a question about Boris Johnson and the resignation honours list. Just what had gone on that had led to Johnson standing down as an MP? Normally Rish! is one to duck confrontation. To say something bland and placatory. In between reeling off his five priorities to anyone who will listen. As if he believes that saying so will make them true. But this time Sunak chose to get stuck in. Fed up with Johnson undermining him from a distance, Rish! fought back. Johnson had asked him to do something with the honours list that felt wrong. That made him uncomfortable. He had wanted him to either overrule the House of Lords appointments committee (Holac) who had turned down peerages to eight people, including Nadine Dorries, or to give an assurance that their names could be resubmitted at a later stage. But Sunak had refused. He didn\u2019t have many principles, but this crossed a line. He wanted to do things differently. A new politics. Here was the first sign of the honesty, integrity and accountability we have heard so much about in the past eight months. It even drew some applause from the audience. The rest of the country is even more fed up with Johnson than the prime minister. But just how ethical had Rish! been? Was it not possible that he too was being a little casual with the truth? Hold that thought. Forget for a moment that Sunak and Johnson had a meeting about his honours list about 10 days ago. So that even if Rish! later refused to bend the rules he was prepared to have a meeting to talk about breaking the rules. Hardly Mr Integrity in action. Remember that although No 10 has denied ever doing a deal, Johnson was confident enough to message Dorries to tell her that her peerage was going through. Alas poor Nadine! All that time and money spent on commissioning a coat of arms. No ermine for her. Now consider this. Let\u2019s assume Sunak is telling the truth. That he made no bargain with Johnson. That he passed on the resignation honours list to Holac unamended and it was the committee alone that struck names up. In which case, it can only mean that Rish! had been entirely comfortable with all the other names that had appeared on the list. Peerages for two Downing Street insiders who had barely finished work experience. Knighthoods for Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Fabricant. For services to what exactly? Nannies and syrups? Those may stick in the throat but may be no worse than some other undeservings who have featured in previous honours lists. But what of some other gongs? An Order of the \u2018Champagne on Ice\u2019 in the Bath for Martin Reynolds. The Party Marty who actually organised some of the illegal parties in Downing Street. OBEs for at least two of No 10 communications team who were around during Partygate. Plus a host of minor gongs for Carrie Johnson\u2019s friends and other members of the Downing Street team that knew about the parties. Jennifer Arcuri must be gutted to have been overlooked. Then it looks like this honours list is a celebration of illegality. A confident two fingers to all of us suckers who bothered to obey the rules. And guess what? Sunak is happy about that. Enough for him not to have lifted a finger to stop it. Strangely, it was Michael Gove, as the government\u2019s spokesperson on the morning media round, who had been the more conciliatory towards Johnson. Then the Govester is a complicated man these days. He can scarcely be bothered to get out of bed for himself, let alone anyone else. His midlife crisis is deep and prolonged and his interest in the activities of his government are minimal. He\u2019s basically just looking forward to the next thrill. The next adventure. There again, perhaps Gove genuinely feels ambivalent about Johnson. He\u2019s certainly changed his mind about him enough. Comrades in arms on the Vote Leave battlebus. Deadly enemies in the subsequent Tory leadership campaign. The on-off relationship has continued ever since, but on Monday he was keen to not rock the boat. Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list was a private affair on which it was right for no one to intrude, he told the Today programme. Er, right, said the BBC presenter Mishal Husain. But surely precedent doesn\u2019t apply when you\u2019re talking about a prime minister who was forced out of office for lying about his own rule breaking during lockdown? Who lied in parliament to the committee investigating him for lying to parliament. Johnson at his most meta. Surely it would have made more sense to take a view on any honours list until such time the committee had actually submitted its report? Rather than look like you\u2019ve got something to hide by pre-empting the committee. Gove lapsed into familiar Gove speak. All fake politeness and pretend modesty. Everything had been done for the best. Precedent was precedent. And couldn\u2019t we just concentrate on all the things Boris had done well. The war in Ukraine and the vaccine rollout. Though you\u2019d have expected nothing less from any prime minister. For his appearance on Good Morning Britain, the Govester added Getting Brexit Done. Hmm. We\u2019ll be the judge of that. Then it looks like the game is up for Johnson. Nowhere left to hide. Not even a fridge. Jake Berry did say that Boris had been removed by the establishment \u2013 that\u2019s Sir Jake, the former chairman of the Tory party: you don\u2019t get much more establishment \u2013 but he stopped short of calling for his darling to make a comeback. There\u2019s friends and friends. Even Micky Fab has gone quiet on that. His loyalty to be resold to highest bidder. So Johnson is left to rage against the dying of the light. He will not go gentle into the night. He let it be known that Sunak double-crossed him. But really no one cares. He has been exposed as the charlatan and the fraud he is. His resignation honours list contaminating Sunak and the Tory party to the last.

Mikey, from Kingswood, south Gloucestershire, had just finished his GCSEs, Three boys \u2013 a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old from Wiltshire and a 15-year-old from Dorset \u2013 remain in police custody and continue to be questioned by detectives. Eight teenagers who were arrested within half an hour of the incident on a bus nearby have been released from custody and no further action will be taken against them. Det Insp Mark Newbury, of Avon and Somerset police\u2019s major crime investigation team, said the investigation into the killing \u201ccontinues at pace\u201d with a team of officers and staff \u201cworking tirelessly to piece together what happened\u201d. Last month Ben Moncrieff, 18, died after an incident in Bath city centre. A 15-year-old boy from south London was charged with murder and possession of a bladed article. Ch Insp Ronald Lungu, of the Bath neighbourhood policing team, said: \u201cI hear the community\u2019s concerns about this and other recent incidents and would like to reassure them we are doing everything we can to tackle knife crime in Bath, as well as in other towns and cities across our policing area.\u201d A friend of Mikey\u2019s, Chyna-Lei Patterson, 18, who visited the scene, said: \u201cHe was a really talented musician and dreamed of making a career as a rapper. He spent a lot of time in various music studios in and around Bristol.\u201d She said he was with friends on a day out to Bath on Saturday. \u201cSomeone found out that there was a house party in Weston and they decided to go along,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was planned, I think they just decided on a whim having seen it on social media.\u201d A crowdfunding page has been set up to help his family with the funeral arrangements. Its organiser posted: \u201cMikey was such a kind loving and thoughtful soul who cared so much about his friends and family. He was so funny and fearless.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/12/carlo-ancelotti-suing-everton-in-high-court-manager-real-madrid", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Carlo Ancelotti suing Everton in high court two years after leaving as manager", "lead": "Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid coach and former manager of Everton, is suing the Premier League club in London\u2019s high court", "author": "Simon Goodley", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:38:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080198", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/941f41b017d1e6782c3034b74ae4e8c7e1f1ee26/930_345_3424_2055/500.jpg", "body": "Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid coach and former manager of Everton, is suing the Premier League club in London\u2019s high court. The move appears to be the latest blow to Everton, who have endured a series of financial struggles in recent years including a three-year effort to raise funds to complete the building of their new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock. Ancelotti\u2019s lawyers filed the coach\u2019s claim against his former employers late on Friday, according to court records. It relates to \u201cgeneral commercial contracts and arrangements\u201d and is listed to be heard in the commercial court. There were no further details provided about the basis of Ancelotti\u2019s claim, which has kicked off two years after he left Goodison following an 18\u2011month spell. Ancelotti\u2019s lawyers said they had no comment. Everton have not returned the Guardian\u2019s calls requesting comment. News of Ancelotti\u2019s claim emerged on a day of upheaval at Everton, who announced that three directors had left. The chairman, Bill Kenwright, is also thought to be preparing to leave in the next 48 hours in what is seen as a signal on Merseyside that fresh investment may finally be on its way from the New York\u2011based MSP Sports Capital. The investment would end a long\u2011running effort by Farhad Moshiri, who owns 94% of the club, to attract funds for the new stadium and to strength a squad that avoided relegation from the Premier League on the final day of the season. Last month Everton took out a bridging loan \u2013 secured against the new stadium \u2013 to provide funds while negotiations over an investment deal continued. Sources close to the negotiations said an investment offer on the table would eventually result in Moshiri \u2013 who is estimated to have ploughed \u00a3750m into Everton \u2013 losing control of the club without being paid a penny."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/12/the-guardian-view-on-ofsted-radical-change-is-needed", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The Guardian view on Ofsted: radical change is needed | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Ruth Perry\u2019s death, after her school was downgraded, provoked an outpouring of unhappiness.

A new mechanism for reinspection, when a school is judged inadequate due to weak safeguarding, will be introduced following the death of Ruth Perry, who took her own life after the primary school she led in Reading was downgraded. This and other adjustments may slightly ameliorate the experience of being inspected. But it is disappointing that Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, have rejected the opportunity that the tragedy presented to overhaul a system that has outlived its usefulness. Teachers, headteachers and their unions have complained for years about the toll taken by Ofsted inspections, particularly since the imposition of a framework under which inspectors attempt a detailed evaluation of the quality of education. Years of underinvestment and the pandemic have further raised pressure on schools. Perry\u2019s death in January, following a report which judged her school inadequate, led to an outpouring of frustration. Her family\u2019s conviction that Perry took her life due to stress was echoed by school leaders across England who have found inspections close to unbearable. Events leading up to Perry\u2019s death will be scrutinised in an inquest. But there is no need to wait for the coroner\u2019s verdict to make the case that further reform of Ofsted is overdue. The argument in favour of the current one-word classifications of schools\u2019 performance, on a scale from outstanding to inadequate, has always been that these serve parents\u2019 need for the clearest information possible. Set against this is the damage caused by a negative judgment to morale and wellbeing. Given the current problems with recruitment and retention, it is a mistake by ministers to disregard growing evidence of the extent to which Ofsted puts people off working in schools. No one\u2019s interests are served by a system that is intolerable to teach in for more than a few years. Perry\u2019s school was one of a small minority judged inadequate, having previously been outstanding. It is not hard to imagine the shock and disappointment that must accompany such a fall from grace. The additional support that has now been promised to school leaders, and the speeding up of complaints, are useful steps that should ease difficulties. But the problems with Ofsted go deeper. The question isn\u2019t simply how to make the current process easier to tolerate, but whether it does more harm than good. Ministers should pay more attention to alternatives that have been put forward. The report card model proposed by Labour is worth testing. Just as children can achieve a range of levels in different subjects, so schools could be recognised as excelling in some areas while struggling in others \u2013 rather than receiving one overall grade. Another option would be a simpler framework and an end to the distinction between good and outstanding. Inspections are not, and have never been, the be-all and end-all in raising standards. Improvements are also driven by peer support arrangements between schools and specialist advice from local authorities and academy trusts. Yet while doubling down on a punitive inspections process, ministers are withdrawing funding from council education teams. This is the wrong approach. A robust but fair inspectorate that is capable of adapting to feedback should coexist with other systems to promote schools\u2019 progress.

The value of the settlement for a class of plaintiffs that has grown to encompass as many as 100 women or more is placed at $290m, said a source familiar with the terms. \u201cWe all now understand that Epstein\u2019s behavior was monstrous, and we believe this settlement is in the best interest of all parties, especially the survivors, who suffered unimaginable abuse at the hands of this man,\u201d JPMorgan said in a statement. \u201cAny association with him was a mistake and we regret it. We would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\u201d The proposed deal could begin to shut down weeks of embarrassing leaks about the extensive relationship that the bank had with Epstein, where the convicted sex offender was a client from 1998 to 2013 \u2013 seven years after he was first accused of soliciting a minor. The lawsuit claims that officials at the bank ignored warning signs about Epstein\u2019s abuse because he was a wealthy client who could introduce wealthy people to its private banking and investment arms. A previous agreement in a similar lawsuit against Deutsche Bank was resolved for a reported $75m. According to reports, the number of Epstein victims attached to the JPMorgan action could rise to more than 100. \u201cThe settlements that have been reached are both life-changing and historic for the survivors,\u201d said victims\u2019 attorney Sigrid McCawley of the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. \u201cMoney, which for far too long flowed with impunity between Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s global sex-trafficking enterprise and Wall Street\u2019s leading banks, is decisively being used for good. \u201cThe settlements signal that financial institutions have an important role to play in spotting and shutting down sex trafficking,\u201d McCawley added. Separately, Brad Edwards, attorney for other, unidentified claimants in the litigation, said he recognized \u201cthe importance of the government\u2019s continued litigation against JPMorgan Chase to prevent future crimes\u201d. While some of the law firms representing the plaintiffs were working pro bono, or under a percentage split of any settlement, Judge Jed Rakoff has yet to award legal costs ahead of any finalized settlement. The pending settlement is one part of a civil action brought against the bank that included the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein maintained a lavish home on a private island that had a long history of welcoming high-profile visitors. Monday\u2019s settlement could portend one with the USVI. A spokesman for the US Virgin Islands said the US territory would continue its claim against the bank \u201cto ensure full accountability for JPMorgan\u2019s violations of law and prevent the bank from assisting and profiting from human trafficking in the future\u201d. During a deposition two weeks earlier, plaintiffs asked JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon \u2013 Wall Street\u2019s top banker \u2013 what he knew of Epstein\u2019s relationship with the bank, which included large monthly cash withdrawals that triggered interest from compliance officers. Dimon was asked in his deposition if he had ever heard the name Jeffrey Epstein before authorities arrested Epstein, answering: \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d He said he first heard about Epstein \u201cwhen the story blew wide open\u201d. Dimon added: \u201cHe was arrested, and all the stories came out about all the people he knows. And the reason I remember that is I was surprised that I didn\u2019t know about it before.\u201d In the 416-page deposition, Dimon said that an email from Epstein\u2019s office that suggested he was scheduled to meet with Epstein and the former senior JPMorgan executive James \u201cJes\u201d Staley at Epstein\u2019s townhouse was inaccurate. \u201cI have never had an appointment with Jeff Epstein. I\u2019ve never met Jeff Epstein. I never knew Jeff Epstein. I never went to Jeff Epstein\u2019s house. I never had a meal with Jeff Epstein. I have no idea what they\u2019re referring to here,\u201d Dimon said. JPMorgan denies claims that it profited from Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking and has sued Staley, later the chief executive at Barclays, saying Staley hid Epstein\u2019s crimes to keep Epstein as a client. Staley has denied the claims and is due to sit for a deposition. The bank also filed a counterclaim against the US Virgin Islands\u2019 government alleging that the sex trafficker maintained a \u201cquid pro quo relationship\u201d with some of the territory\u2019s highest officials over two decades. Those claims center on Cecile deJongh, wife of the former US Virgin Islands\u2019 governor John deJongh, who JP Morgan says facilitated Epstein\u2019s abuse of women and girls by helping him influence local politicians, dodge the territory\u2019s sex offender laws, and obtain work and visas for his victims. According to the Associated Press, a spokesperson from the US Virgin Islands attorney general\u2019s office said in an email: \u201cThis is an obvious attempt to shift blame away from JPMorgan Chase, which had a legal responsibility to report the evidence in its possession of Epstein\u2019s human trafficking, and failed to do so.\u201d The civil actions against JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were surrounded by leaks from Epstein\u2019s business and social diaries that included meetings with prominent men after he pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. They included the director of the CIA, William Burns, and Kathryn Ruemmler, White House counsel during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, alongside lesser figures including the leftwing professor and activist Noam Chomsky, billionaire venture capitalist Reid Hoffman and Lawrence Summers, former Harvard president and director of the National Economic Council under Obama. In addition to the leaks, the lawsuit against JPMorgan threw out a wide net to bring prominent business people to be deposed on what they knew about the bank\u2019s relationship with Epstein. The legal trawl included the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Hyatt Hotels chairperson Thomas Pritzker, American Canadian businessman Mortimer Zuckerman, former CAA talent agent Michael Ovitz and Tesla CEO Elon Musk."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/12/the-guardian-view-on-radical-protest-a-lonely-voice-against-slavery", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The Guardian view on radical protest: a lonely voice against slavery | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Benjamin Lay was a revolutionary who battled for an unpopular cause that is today regarded as unquestionably just", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:30:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080204", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/64d8f31dcb152501575e0096ed8eaabc4d66e81e/207_0_5846_3508/500.jpg", "body": "Two hundred and sixty-four years after his death, Benjamin Lay has suddenly come into vogue. He is the subject of a new play opening on Tuesday at the Finborough theatre in London, which joins both a fine work of history and a graphic novel based on his life. Or perhaps we should say lives, because Lay was a shepherd, a glover, a sailor, an author, a bookseller. Most importantly, he was a revolutionary, who waged a lifelong battle for a cause that then looked hopeless but today is seen as unquestionably just. Half a century before William Wilberforce began cajoling fellow parliamentarians, Essex commoner Lay fought to stop slavery. For his pains, he was scorned and humiliated and spurned by his community. Yet in his life is a story for our times. Born in 1682 with dwarfism, and standing 4ft tall, Lay was raised as a Quaker and taught its principles of democracy and equality. Though he came from a village outside Colchester, he could never settle, switching jobs, moving to London and then taking to the sea. Over 18 months in the slave society of Barbados, he and his wife, Sarah, witnessed how Africans were whipped, starved and burned by their wealthy white enslavers. He befriended enslaved people and one, \u201ca lusty fellow\u201d, swore he would kill himself rather than be whipped again. After he did so, Lay left the island knowing \u201csugar was made with blood\u201d. The couple arrived in Philadelphia in 1732, where the most powerful Quakers were enslavers. In protest, Lay would stride into a Quaker meeting and spatter them with pretend blood \u2013 nearly three centuries before such tactics were employed by Extinction Rebellion. Or he\u2019d stand outside a meeting house barefoot in the snow, as a reminder of how enslaved people were forced to labour in freezing fields half naked. For all this, he was denounced and expelled by the Quaker community, and eventually withdrew to a cave. After his death, few remembered him until, a few years ago, the historian Marcus Rediker published The Fearless Benjamin Lay and rescued its subject from the injustice of obscurity. In the UK, the abolition of slavery is often framed as an Enlightenment project, pursued by silky liberal gentlemen. Yet it was enslaved people in Haiti who led the way: thanks to their rebellion, it became the first country to ban slavery permanently from 1804. For all its boasts, Britain did not ban slavery in most of the British empire until 1833. Even that was not simply the work of a beneficent elite but of figures including Olaudah Equiano, who bought his freedom and then vigorously campaigned for that of others, and Mary Prince, whose powerful account of life in slavery galvanised the cause. Lay, in the US, was an earlier and more quixotic figure. He was not alone in challenging a system many regarded as ineluctable, but his tactics were radical and shocking. Today\u2019s activists campaigning on everything from climate change to humane migration policies have much to learn from his life, while the \u201cQuaker Comet\u201d would recognise their disruptive righteousness and what Rediker terms \u201cguerrilla theatre\u201d. From the suffragettes to Mahatma Gandhi, those who take up a great cause are later remembered as saints or treasures, divested not only of their blood and suffering, but of controversy. Lay\u2019s example is a sharp reminder that yesterday\u2019s impossible causes can become today\u2019s inevitable principles \u2013 but that the journey is often made through shocking confrontation and personal sacrifice."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/12/mike-ashley-stretches-the-edges-of-frasers-ecosystem-with-ao-world-stake", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "Mike Ashley stretches the edges of Frasers\u2019 \u2018ecosystem\u2019 with AO World move | Nils Pratley", "lead": "Strategically questionable 18.9% stake in the white goods seller suggests the Sports Direct founder still can\u2019t resist a punt", "author": "Nils Pratley", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:23:48Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080206", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/870a4168680ba2a3fa759bb567feb64a6b7710f6/0_1_2300_1380/500.jpg", "body": "The elevation last summer of Michael Murray to be chief executive of Frasers Group \u2013 Sports Direct, as was \u2013 was supposed to signal a less freewheeling approach to buying other companies (and stakes in other companies), or so we thought. Whereas his father-in-law, Mike Ashley, seemed simply to like a punt on companies he judged to be undervalued, Murray spoke the language of investment discipline. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fit into sport, premium or luxury or add value to our ecosystem or platform,\u2009then we won\u2019t be buying it,\u201d Murray told the FT last year when aspiring to smoother relations with the City. The flexible word in that vision, it\u2019s now clear, was \u201cecosystem\u201d. If the edges of the landscape are sufficiently blurry, almost anything can be ruled in. Thus a week ago, the group increased its stake in struggling online fashion retailer Asos to nearly 9% for reasons that were not explained. From outside, it looked like a re-run of the old days when Sports Direct/Frasers was virtually guaranteed to turn up at the scene of any developing or unstable situation in retail-land. Now comes something odder \u2013 an entry into the world of fridges and freezers. Frasers has bagged a 18.9% stake in AO World, the online electrical appliances retailer, that has been shaken loose by the crisis at Odey Asset Management. It paid \u00a375m at a price of 68p a share. There is a school of thought that says AO, now that it has stopped throwing money away in the Netherlands and Germany and is focused on making profits in the UK, is an interesting stock. Yet it\u2019s hard to see, strategy-wise, how fridges fit into Frasers\u2019 clothing-dominated world. At least Murray attempted an explanation on this occasion. \u201cFrasers will benefit from AO\u2019s valuable know-how in electricals and two-man delivery, helping us to drive growth in our bulk equipment and homeware ranges,\u201d he said. Okay, Sports Direct sells gym equipment and sofa.com (a past Fraser acquisition) delivers sofas, but buying a one-fifth stake in AO is a roundabout way to request a lesson in the art of van logistics. You are allowed to just negotiate a deal with AO\u2019s established operation that services third parties. John Roberts, AO founder and chief executive, sounded enthusiastic about his new shareholder, it should be said, claiming a \u201cfantastic endorsement\u201d and talking up the \u201ccompelling strategic opportunities to explore\u201d. Well, maybe. It seems equally possible that this alliance becomes a time-consuming distraction for AO. It would surely be more logical for a public company to agree on the commercial opportunities before \u2013 not after \u2013 the stake-building happens. From the Frasers\u2019 end of things, outside shareholders in the 71%-owned Ashley firm have just had a reminder that the corporate instinct for opportunism is alive and well. Sometimes, the stake-building adventures pay off, as with Hugo Boss (where Frasers still has a 2.2% holding), and sometimes they go expensively wrong, as at doomed Debenhams. But Murray\u2019s promotion to public face of the company hasn\u2019t noticeably altered the scattergun approach to stake-building. Behind the bluster, one suspects Ashley simply thinks AO\u2019s shares are cheap and fancies a plunge."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/12/neighbour-trapped-mother-and-two-daughters-in-fatal-flat-fire-trial-hears", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Neighbour trapped mother and daughters in Nottingham flat fire, trial hears", "lead": "Jamie Barrow \u2018walked casually away\u2019 after setting flat alight with Fatoumatta Hydara and children inside, court told", "author": "Donna Ferguson and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:22:27Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080208", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ffea975500e3727c612869de5c8144e4c5ff6dcd/39_0_1800_1080/500.jpg", "body": "A mother and her two young daughters were murdered by a neighbour who set their flat on fire over a row about rubbish bags being left behind their building, a court has heard.

Since its debut at Sundance in January, Past Lives has accrued slow-rolling, deserved hype \u2013 as the year\u2019s first great movie, as an achingly effective love story, as a rare emotionally mature adult film somewhere between the romantic and the platonic. (I\u2019ll add that, secondary to the delicate narrative, Song\u2019s depiction of New York is the most lived-in, tangible and vibrant, that I\u2019ve seen in ages.) Many have focused, not wrongly, on Song\u2019s delicate rendering of both reconnection \u2013 the tender bond that comes from having known someone, in presence and absence, for almost as long as you\u2019ve known yourself \u2013 and of marriage. By the time Hae Sung visits New York in the present, well into their 30s, Nora is in a long-term, supportive, emotionally communicative relationship with Arthur (an excellent John Magaro), a fellow writer. But it\u2019s that Skype interlude that, for me, captures the film\u2019s quiet power: its mature, acute understanding of inexpressible feelings and undefinable relationships, ones fostered by the passage of time and the presence of screens. Back in 2011, freshly in touch in their early 20s, Hae Sung and Nora are stunned by the image of their screens: the face of a sweet spot and a question, beamed across the present and haloed by the laptop glow. They\u2019re both nervous, tentative. And then they fall into a new, intoxicating rhythm: rushing home to open the laptop, fumbling for the right angle on the webcam, curling into the languorous comfort of a long, ambling call. They talk about their days, their futures, their jokes, their old friendship. They miss calls and are distracted and have their offline lives warped by the weird, magnetic pulse of their long-distance, siloed correspondence. In a succinct, evocative sequence, Song conveys the cherished accumulation of their calls and messages, which recalled for me the many, many hours I used to spend on Skype \u2013 whole nights, like Nora\u2019s first call with Hae Sung, bingeing on digital conversation as if it was some novelty candy, with lovers and with friends, sometimes a mix in between. Talking online for two to six hours at a time, or with any regular rhythm tacitly understood by only two people, can have that muddling effect. The glitchy blur on the screen is a patina of tangible presence, but it\u2019s deeply intimate all the same. Nora gets confused, too. Her relationship with Hae Sung is not explicitly romantic, but too charged to be just friends. It\u2019s full of palpable, unspoken longing. When she cuts it off, knowing it will be at least a year before either can actually visit the other, it\u2019s viscerally devastating, all the more so as an end to something that was never officially started in the first place. Past Lives captures, better than most films I\u2019ve seen, this mundane, modern yearning \u2013 the kind greased by photos and relationship updates online, of paths not taken and intimacy lost, that doesn\u2019t so much rupture our lives as fold into the everyday. Hae Sung\u2019s visit to New York reactivates Nora\u2019s wistful streak but, to the film\u2019s credit, does not veer into the overly sentimental or melodramatic. \u201cWhat a good story this is,\u201d Arthur muses in bed. \u201cChildhood sweethearts who reconnect 20 years later and realize they were meant for each other.\u201d She laughs, warmly, and tells him to shut up. That the alternate course in Past Lives is overlaid with diasporic longing \u2013 Hae Sung is not only a childhood friend and crush, but a vision of Nora\u2019s life had her family stayed in Korea \u2013 heightens the stakes of their reunion but does not blunt the specificity. It\u2019s rare to see a film so accurately capture the type of unplaceable, digitally inflected relationships most people know on some level: heavily mediated by screens, warped by distance, shored up by some level of a digital footprint. The depth of connection not commensurate with the frequency of direct contact. A level of offline feeling that\u2019s more soaring, bruising and flickering, than the words or drama on the page. The film\u2019s climax, one that should be witnessed and not spoiled, is a measured and searing acceptance of that murkiness. There was a different path, a different life, a singular connection whose formativeness rendered it irreplaceable and irradiating. It\u2019s the type of relationship that\u2019s hard to explain but beautiful to watch three adults handle as adults, and more than deserving of a film smart enough to earn its unsaid yearning. Past Lives is out in US cinemas now and in the UK on 8 September"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/12/michael-gove-privileges-committee-boris-johnson-parliament-rishi-sunak-latest-politics-updates", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Boris Johnson formally quits as an MP, Treasury confirms, after day marked by war of words with Rishi Sunak \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Boris Johnson accepts post of crown steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds after accusing PM of talking \u2018rubbish\u2019", "author": "Andrew Sparrow", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:07:44Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080212", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba6361ffab0f1fbc778d04ab7a99dda11c6230c/0_141_3455_2073/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has formally stepped down as an MP, parliamentary authorities have announced, bringing down the curtain on a tumultuous second stint in the Commons. The news came towards the end of a day during which Johnson and Rishi Sunak engaged in an extraordinary war of words over the former prime minister\u2019s failed attempts to elevate several close allies to the House of Lords. The SNP has claimed that new regulations giving the police new powers to stop protesters (see 5.44pm) are a move in the direction of fascism. Opening the debate, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said the police did need more powers to deal with disruptive protests. She said: People have a right to get to work on time free from obstruction, a right to enjoy sporting events without interruption and a right to get to hospital. The roads belong to the British people, not a selfish minority who treat them like their personal property. The impact of these disruptors is huge. Over the last six weeks alone, Just Stop Oil (JSO) carried out 156 slow marches around London. This has required over 13,770 police officer shifts, that\u2019s over 13,000 police shifts that could have been stopping robbery, violent crime or anti-social behaviour, and the cost to the taxpayer is an outrage \u2013 \u00a34.5 million in just six weeks on top of the \u00a314 million spent last year. But Alison Thewliss, the SNP\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, said the new law took the government in the direction of fascism. My colleague Ben Quinn has the quote. Humza Yousaf has rejected growing calls from across the political spectrum to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from the Scottish National party after her arrest on Sunday. Scrapping single-word gradings for schools would not alleviate the \u201cunderlying discomfort\u201d teachers feel, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector has said, as she came under increasing pressure to reform the system after a headteacher\u2019s suicide. In the Commons MPs are debating the Public Order Act 1986 (serious disruption to the life of the community) regulations 2023. These are new rules that lower the threshold for what counts as serious disruption when the police have to judge whether they have the powers to intervene to stop a protest. They also allow the police to consider the cumulative effect of a protest when deciding whether campaigners are causing serious disruption. This measure is particular designed to stop slow-walking protests organised by groups like Just Stop Oil. These measures are particularly controversial because they were originally meant to be primary legislation \u2013 part of the text of the Public Order Act \u2013 but they were voted down by peers. Because the amendments were introduced when the bill was in the Lords, not the Commons, they could not be reintroduced when the bill went back to MPs. The Lords secondary legislation scrutiny committee raised concerns about this in a report published last month. Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, a member of the committee, said: \u201cAs far as we can ascertain, this is the first time a government has sought to make changes to the law by making those changes through secondary legislation even though those same changes had been rejected by parliament when introduced a short while before in primary legislation.\u201d Secondary legislation receives less scrutiny than primary legislation, it cannot be amended, and it is almost impossible to block. Opening the debate in the Commons, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said the government supported the right to protest, but that she was responding to police requests for greater powers. The Treasury has released two statements confirming that Boris Johnson and Nigel Adams are now longer MP. Here they are: The chancellor of the exchequer has this day appointed Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson to be steward and bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern. The chancellor of the exchequer has this day appointed Nigel Adams to be steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. Both press releases consisted of just a single sentence, and neither of them explained what this process actually means. See 11.56am for an explanation. People who attack institutions including parliament need to be \u201ccalled out,\u201d Penny Mordaunt has told a conference in London, where she also railed against those waging \u201cculture wars.\u201d Without specifically naming Boris Johnson or allies who have criticised the privileges committee investigation and its findings against the former prime minister, Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said that politics was a team game but \u201cquite often some people forget they are part of a team\u201d. Speaking at an even organised by the Centre for Policy Studies, she said that she would be going to the House of Commons where there would be a debate on standards \u201cand all sorts of things that have been in the news,\u201d adding: We have to be really strong about calling out people out who are attacking institutions. People who are attacking the house for carrying out its work. This included those who were attacking the media, she said, adding: I never thought I would be defending the BBC. We have to stand up for these things because the price of not doing so is going to be very grave indeed. Later, in a discussion which touched on Donald Trump and populism elsewhere, she said that she wanted to say something \u201cwhich applies to my colleagues in the Conservative Party today\u201d. She went on: We have to have the strength not to be pulled in particular directions by particular media groups or pander to particular constituencies. We have to have a real sense with what we are about. Mordaunt, who has been seen as a potential standard-bearer for the centrist wing of the Conservative party in a future leadership battle, also said she was \u201camazed\u201d at the continuation of a \u201cfailed model of leadership at the top\u201d revolving around one figure rather than \u201cthe team\u201d. I said to the PM: \u2018Your team is the nation.\u2019 That is why the culture wars and all that doesn\u2019t help. We are here for everyone. That is why I am unapologetic about talking about building more and taxing less and not talking about culture wars, because it doesn\u2019t move the country forward. Here is a question from a reader, prompted by the earlier post about the mechanism whereby MPs resign. If there are only two posts MPs can apply for if they want to resign, does that mean you can\u2019t have three MPs resigning at the same time? No. There is no minimum time period under which people can serve as crown steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or crown steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, and as soon as a new one is appointed, the old one lapses. The Treasury tends to alternate; one \u201cpost\u201d goes to one resigning MP, and the next MP to quit gets the other one. Eight unionists MPs got the Chiltern Hundreds job in a single day in 1985, when there were mass resignations to force byelections over the Anglo-Irish agreement. Another seven unionists got the Manor of Northstead job on the same day. Boris Johnson has now formally submitted his resignation as an MP, John Stevens from the Mirror reports. His resignation does not take effect until we get an announcement from the Treasury saying he has been appointed to an office of profit under the crown. (See 11.56am.) And Nigel Adams has done the same, Lucy Fisher from the FT reports. Downing Street has chosen not to escalate its war of words with Boris Johnson. After Johnson said this afternoon Rishi Sunak was talking \u201crubbish\u201d, after Sunak said this morning Johnson tried to get him to do something improper with his resignation honours, the PM\u2019s spokesperson was asked at the afternoon lobby briefing if he had a response. The spokesperson defended Sunak, summarising what he said earlier, but did not criticise Johnson directly. He said: You\u2019ve got the words from the PM this morning. I\u2019m not going to get into more detail. He was very clear he was not prepared to deviate from established convention or do anything unprecedented, which is why, in line with a long-standing custom, he forwarded the list unaltered. The line that Sunak was acting in line with \u201cestablished convention\u201d does rather undermine the claim he made this morning, when talking about this topic, that he wanted \u201cto do things differently\u201d because he wanted \u201cto change politics\u201d. (See 9.53am.) Sunak probably just meant he wanted to do things differently from Johnson. For anyone who likes their political history neatly arranged, it is fitting that Boris Johnson may be ending his parliamentary life (although his resignation has not been confirmed yet) on the day of Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s death. The former Italian PM was a prototype for the populist, norm-trouncing, egotistical, performance politics now represented by Donald Trump and Johnson. Berlusconi was probably at his most powerful in the early years of the noughties, when Johnson was editor of the Spectator. Johnson went to interview him in 2003, with Nicholas Farrell. At the time received opinion in London was that Berlusconi was too corrupt to be a respectable European political leader. But Johnson recognised a kindred spirit, and filed a glowing tribute. Here\u2019s an extract. It is hard not to be charmed by a man who takes such an interest in cacti and who will crack jokes at important EU gatherings, not only about Nazi camp commandants but also about whether or not his wife is running off with someone else. There is something heroic about his style, something hilariously imperial \u2013 from the huge swimming pool he has created by flooding a basin in the Sardinian hills, to the four thalassotherapy pools he has sunk for Veronica, powered by computers more advanced than those used on the moon shots \u2026 Suddenly, after decades in which Italian politics was in thrall to a procession of gloomy, portentous, jargon-laden partitocrats, there appeared this influorescence of American gung-hoery. Yes, he may have been involved in questionable business practices; he may even yet be found out and pay the price. For the time being, though, it seems reasonable to let him get on with his programme. He may fail. But then, of course \u2014 and this is the point that someone should write in block capitals, fold up and stuff in the mouth of Anna Lindh, Swedish foreign minister \u2014 he can be rejected by the Italian people. She may not like it but he was democratically elected and can be removed by the very people Anna Lindh insults. If we are obliged to compare Silvio Berlusconi with Anna Lindh, and other bossy, high-taxing European politicians. I agree with Farrell: as the narrator says of Jay Gatsby, a man Berlusconi to some extent resembles, he is \u2018better than the whole damn lot of them\u2019. UPDATE: Anna Lindh was stabbed to death very soon after the Johnson/Farrell article was published by a man who claimed to be hearing voices in his head. Sir Jake Berry, Conservative party chair when Liz Truss was PM and one of Boris Johnson\u2019s main supporters early in his leadership, posted a message on Twitter at the weekend saying Johnson had been forced out by the establishment \u201cblob\u201d. Asked today to defend his claim, Berry said people could look at the facts themselves. He told broadcasters: The establishment tried to block [Brexit]. I stand by that. That was definitely my experience working in Theresa May\u2019s government. And the establishment has seen Boris out of the door. I think if people look at the facts, they either will or won\u2019t agree with me. But Berry would not go as far as calling for Johnson to return as an MP. Asked if he would like to see him back in the Commons, Berry replied: Boris Johnson is a fantastic Conservative, a brilliant parliamentarian and appeals to the great British public in a way that I\u2019ve never really seen any other politician do. I think there is just something special about him. He is an extraordinary character. But, that said, I absolutely know and believe that under the leadership of Rishi Sunak, by pursuing bold, Conservative values, we can secure that general election. Would-be insurgent parties of the right, Reform UK and Reclaim, have announced a pact for the upcoming byelections in which they will allow each other a free one in the contests. Reclaim\u2019s leader and founder, Laurence Fox, will stand in Boris Johnson\u2019s seat of Uxbridge while Dave Holland, managing director of an IT marketing company, will stand in Mid Bedfordshire, which is being vacated by Nadine Dorries. Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK, said: This cooperation enables us to have extra focus on specific byelections. Many people feel totally let down by the two main parties that are both variants of socialism: high tax, nanny state, low growth and open borders. We stand for low tax, high growth and net zero immigration. My colleague Pippa Crerar says the Boris Johnson camp seem to have changed their story a bit over the past few days. Boris Johnson\u2019s comment today (see 2.48am) about his resignation honours, and his dispute with Rishi Sunak, suggests that what he actually wanted was two resignation honours lists. Given his cakeist philosophy on life (\u201cmy policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it\u201d), this would be characteristic. What seems likely to have happened is that Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams, Alok Sharma and probably Alister Jack, were on the list of names that went to the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac) \u2013 but that they were not approved because they would not agree to resign as MPs when their peerages were announced. If so, they would account for four of the eight names that were refused. Johnson is now implying that at some point in the future their names should have been resubmitted to Holac, not for a new reappraisal from scratch, but for revetting just on the resigning from the Commons issue. At that point the appointments might have gone through. Asking for a rethink was how Johnson got the Evgeny Lebedev peerage approved. The implication is that we might have had two Johnson honours list \u2013 the version out on Friday, and a second edition, or series two, much closer to the election, when the peerages might not have triggered byelections. Alternatively, Johnson was hoping that Sunak would promise to include his names on a subsequent honours list. A PM can announce peerages whenever they want, and there is normally a dissolution honours list at the end of the parliament. These names would have been in effect \u201cJohnson honours part 2\u201d, although perhaps not badged as such. Boris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of talking \u201crubbish\u201d about his resignation honours list. In a statement he said: Rishi Sunak is talking rubbish. To honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac \u2013 but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, has told the audience at a Margaret Thatcher-themed conference that the Conservatives are \u201cnot tribal\u201d on a day when Rishi Sunak hit back at Boris Johnson over the former prime minister\u2019s resignation honours list. In speech that was seen by some as setting out future leadership credentials, Keegan likened herself to the grocer\u2019s daughter Thatcher while growing up as \u201ca young working class girl\u201d in Knowsley. She learned the value of \u201ccommon sense\u201d while working in a shop and saw \u201cmilitant\u201d trade unions \u201cwreck\u201d the Liverpool in which she grew up, said Keegan. But the minister, regarded as being part of the one nation tradition of Tory MPs, also took a thinly veiled swipe at the economics of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, stressing the need to deal with inflation before cutting taxes. Addressing the Centre for Policy Studies\u2019 Margaret Thatcher Conference, she said: Whilst lower taxes are at the heart of Conservative economic thinking, Margaret Thatcher never thought that the way to achieve a low-tax economy was by dramatically increasing public sector debt and borrowing. She knew that you had to deal with inflation first otherwise every tax cut or spending pledge would be eaten by inflation. That focus, that grip, that is what this government is channelling. You can see it in the chancellor\u2019s focus on restoring economic stability, and in the prime minister\u2019s focus on driving areas where we can leverage a real competitive advantage. Speaking about her upbringing in Liverpool, where she left school at 16, she said she became disillusioned with politics while an apprentice at a car factory. \u201cMilitant trade unions downed tools at the drop of a hat,\u201d she said. She voted for Thatcher at the age of 19. When she did initially stand as a Tory candidate \u2013 describing herself as an outlier \u2013 Keegan said she had changed her name to her husband\u2019s \u201cto protect the innocent\u201d. Lord Marland, a Tory peer, former Conservative party chair and a supporter of Boris Johnson, has restated the Johnsonite claim that Rishi Sunak was to blame for blocking some of the former PM\u2019s resignation honours peerages. No 10 denies this. In a statement the PM\u2019s press secretary said: As is convention, the prime minister forwarded the former prime minister\u2019s peerage list to Holac [the House of Lords appointments commission] unaltered. Holac then passed back their approved list. The prime minister then accepted Holac\u2019s approved list and forwarded it unamended to the sovereign for their approval. He had no involvement or input into the approved list. It is a point of fact that it is made public by the commission if a prime minister overrules the commission\u2019s advice. But, in an interview on the World at One, Marland said there were \u201ceight people who Rishi decided not to support\u201d for peerages. When it was put to him that Holac has said it removed the names, Marland replied: No, they didn\u2019t. They had the names removed on the suggestion of elements of the civil service, the Cabinet Office or the Inland Revenue [as is] often the case, and then Holac don\u2019t have to adjudicate. Marland also said Sunak could have ensured that Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams and Alok Sharma, three of Johnson\u2019s nominees, got peerages if he wanted to. He said: It is in the remit of the prime minister that, if he really wants someone to become a peer, he can push hard for Holac to do it, as various prime ministers have done in the past. Marland is right to say that in the past prime ministers have got people into the House of Lords in the face of opposition from Holac. But the best example of a PM doing this is Johnson himself, and these appointments caused huge controversy. He put Peter Cruddas in the Lords despite Holac saying the appointment was unsuitable. (Cruddas is now leading a Tory group that in effect is pushing for Johnson to return as leader.) Johnson also successfully urged Holac to think again after it initially raised concerns about his plan to give a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev, the newspaper owner and son of a former KGB officer. Holac has not named the eight people who were not approved for peerages on Johnson\u2019s list and it says it won\u2019t discuss individuals. Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said he will not suspend his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP following her arrest yesterday as part of an investigation into financial misconduct by the party. She was released without charge. Yousaf said Sturgeon\u2019s arrest was \u201cpersonally painful\u201d. He said: I\u2019ll not suspend Nicola\u2019s membership. I\u2019ll treat her in the same way I\u2019ve treated, for example, Colin Beattie. Those that have been released without charge, I see no reason to suspend their membership. Earlier Ash Regan, who came third in the recent SNP leadership contest, Sturgeon should voluntarily give up her SNP membership while the investigation into the party\u2019s finances, and her role, continues. If Sturgeon did not do that, Yousaf should suspend her, Regan suggested. Severin Carrell and Libby Brooks have the story. A reader asks: When will The Tory Chief Whip be requesting a writ for the three by elections? What is the earliest date they can take place - middle of next month - assuming the motion is passed asap.? When is the likeliest date they will be taking place ? The party whose seat is vacant gets to move the writ for the byelection. Parties at risk of losing normally hold them as quickly as possible, to prevent having lots of time to campaign, or delay for as long as possible. But if the government delays, the byelections will happen in the autumn, when they could be more disruptive. So they are likely to hold them as soon as they can. First, though, the three MPs have to formally resign. (See 11.56am.) That has not happened yet, but could happen later today. The chief whip for the party defending the seat has to move the writ for a byelection in the Commons. Once that happens, a byelection should take place between 21 and 27 days later. In her London Playbook briefing for Politico, Rosa Prince says Thursday 13 July could end up as the date for the three byelections. Downing Street has defended the Commons privileges committee after it was described as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d by Boris Johnson in his resignation statement on Friday. Echoing what Michael Gove said in interviews this morning (see 9.19am), the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: This is a properly set-up committee that the house has voted to carry out their work. The government will in no way traduce or criticise the work of the committee who are doing exactly what parliament has asked them to do. Kitty Donaldson from Bloomberg says multiple Tories are telling her that, if Boris Johnson spends the next year attacking Rishi Sunak, the party will partly blame him if it loses the next election. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson was asked about the claim from the Boris Johnson camp this morning (see 11.01am) that Rishi Sunak went back on a deal with Johnson over his resignation honours list. Asked if this was correct, the spokesperson said no. He also said Sunak had commented on this this morning. (See 9.53am.) The spokesperson also said the House of Lords appointments commission had issued a statement saying that eight of Johnson\u2019s nominees were turned down. The spokesperson also said that, once Holac produced its list of approved nominations, the PM submitted that to the king without making any changes. He said: It is entirely untrue to say anyone from No 10 attempted to remove or change or alter Holac\u2019s list. The spokesperson refused to comment on what Sunak and Johnson said when they met earlier this month to discuss the honours list. He said that he did not comment on private conversations, and that Sunak had commented on this this morning. More than 600 people crossed the English Channel in small boats on Sunday in the highest number on a single day so far this year, new figures show. Home Office data released on Monday shows that 616 people, the vast majority of whom will claim asylum, were detected passing this year\u2019s previous high of 497 on Saturday 22 April. It means the number of crossings in 2023 now stands at a provisional total of 8,380, down from around 10,000 at the same point last year. The jump in numbers on Sunday follows a 21% per cent drop between January and May this year. Six days ago, Rishi Sunak claimed that government policies including threatening to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda and paying more money to the French authorities had \u201cstarted to work\u201d. Others claimed that the Channel had seen unusually windy weather during the Spring months. Despite the decline in numbers at the start of 2023, the biggest increase in the numbers arriving by small boats in 2022 happened during the summer months. This is typically when the weather is best for crossing the Channel. In total, the number who made the crossing last year reached a record 45,755, prompting Sunak to make tackling small boat crossings a priority for his Government this year. Twelve boats were detected crossing the Channel on Sunday, which suggests an average of around 51 people per boat. Boris Johnson, Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams have all said that they are resigning as MPs. But, as Steven Swinford from the Times reports, they have yet to formally submit their resignations. Unlike normal employees, MPs cannot resign just by writing a letter saying they are resigning. In theory they are not allowed to resign, and so if they want to leave parliament, they have to accept an \u201coffice of profit under the crown\u201d. That means they have to get appointed either as crown steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or crown steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. These used to be offices of profit, but now they involve no pay \u2013 and no other obligations either. The Treasury announces when these appointments have been made. Normally the chancellor signs it off as an MP writes to say they want to quit. A resignation only becomes operative once that appointment has been announced. I have corrected the post at 10.30am to take out a line wrongly saying the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac) had approved Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams and Alok Sharma for peerages. It hadn\u2019t. The EU has dashed UK hopes of an early review of the Brexit trade deal saying is unlikely to re-open talks until 2026. European commission vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, who leads for the EU on Brexit matters, said the deal was only in force for two years and it would be pointless re-opening it until its full potential was realised. The trade and cooperation agreement (the official title of the EU-UK free trade deal) says its implication can be reviewed from 2025, which had led to speculation a review might happen soon after the next general election. \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s remarks come just weeks after Keir Starmer said Labour would seek an \u201cimproved\u201d trade deal after Vauxhall\u2019s parent company warned it might have to quit the UK unless part of the pact was tweaked. The House of Lords urged the UK government to start working with EU capitals to remove Brexit barriers that block musicians, young people and professionals working easily in Europe. \u201cWe have received quite a lot of questions and I\u2019ve seen that there is increased interest in the TCA review. As far as our calendar goes, I think that it\u2019s more for 2026,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told the EU-UK forum. And he warned that wholesale stripping out of decades of EU law risks putting the trade deal in \u201cthe shredder\u201d creating more obstacles to cross-Channel trade not fewer. He said: If the decision is just to simply go for more divergence \u2026 some of the fundamentals of the withdrawal agreement and the TCA would be thrown into the shredder. An ally of Boris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of having \u201csecretly\u201d blocked peerages for Johnson\u2019s allies, PA Media reports. Responding to Sunak\u2019s comments this morning (see 9.53am), the ally told PA: Rishi secretly blocked the peerages for Nadine and others. He refused to ask for them to undergo basic checks that could have taken only a few weeks or even days. That is how he kept them off the list \u2013 without telling Boris Johnson. And here is some comment from journalists on Rishi Sunak\u2019s condemnation of Boris Johnson. From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell From the former Times political editor Philip Webster From Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen Keiran Pedley from Ipsos says Rishi Sunak is in a strong position to slap down Boris Johnson, because even people who voted Tory in 2019 think he would be a better PM than Johnson. In his morning interview round, speaking on behalf of the government, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, adopted a relatively non-confrontational approach when discussing Boris Johnson. While suggesting it was now time for the Conservative party to move on from Johnson, he avoided multiple opportunities to criticise him directly. (See 9.19am.) In his London Tech Week Q&amp;A, Rishi Sunak went much further, accusing Johnson of trying to do something improper with the honours list. By the standard of what some people say about Johnson, the words may seem almost anodyne. (See 9.53am.) But for Sunak, this was strong stuff. Until now, he has been reluctant to say anything very critical of Johnson in public, conscious that for a significant minority of Tory party members (but a much smaller cohort of Tory MPs), Johnson remains an idol, and a potential saviour. Sunak\u2019s comment also provides the first on-the-record confirmation as to what the Sunak/Johnson rift over the honours list was all about. Johnson wanted to offer peerages to three MPs particularly close to him: Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and his most loyal public defender; Nigel Adams, the former minister who was Johnson\u2019s key backroom fixer; and Alok Sharma, who worked as a junior minister for Johnson when Johnson was foreign secretary and who then chaired the Cop26 conference. (A fourth MP, Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary and a close friend of Johnson\u2019s, was originally on the list too, but ruled himself out.) But it would not have been possible for the MPs to be named as peers on the resignation honours list but delay taking their seats in the Lords until around time time of the elections, to avoid byelections that would be damaging for the party. A minister confirmed this in the House of Lords in November last year. Today Sunak confirmed that Johnson wanted him to either over-ruled Holac on this issue, or to give a private assurance that if Dorries, Adams and Sharma were left off the list, they would get a peerage later. (A PM can nominate peers whenever they want.) That is why Dorries and Adams resigned out of pique. (Sharma has not resigned, and while it is hard to see Sunak giving peerages to Dorries or Adams, it is quite possible Sharma could get a peerage from Sunak in the dissolution honours, because his handling of Cop26 was widely admired.) But what remains unexplained is why Dorries, and perhaps Adams too, only realised that their hopes of going to the Lords were dashed at the end of last week. On Friday morning Dorries said that she would not be resigning as an MP. When she did resign a few hours later, she said it was because \u201csomething significant happened\u201d, implying she had only just realised that Sunak was not promising her a peerage. Yet Sunak and Johnson met to discuss this seven days earlier. According to Tim Shipman\u2019s account in the Sunday Times, Johnson told Dorries afterwards that her peerage was safe. Shipman says: After the meeting with Sunak, Johnson messaged Nadine Dorries to say: \u201cJust finished the meeting with Rishi. List being published imminently. You\u2019re on it.\u201d When it finally dropped on Friday, it was shorn of peerages for Dorries, Adams and Sharma, as well as gongs for two Tory donors, David Ross and Stuart Marks. One explanation would be Sunak not being clear to Johnson at the meeting about his intentions. But in his report Shipman also says a Sunak aide took notes during the meeting, and those notes record Sunak telling Johnson: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave this room thinking I have made you a promise as that will be a problem in our relationship going forward.\u201d The alternative explanation would be that Johnson told Dorries something about the outcome of his meeting with Sunak that was not true, and that she only found out on Friday afternoon. If so, she would not be the first person let down by a Johnson promise. UPDATE: I have amended the post to take out a line wrongly saying that Holac had approved Dorries, Adams and Sharma for peerages. It didn\u2019t; they were not on the list of approved peers released by No 10 over the weekend. Here is the full quote from Rishi Sunak in his Q&amp;A on Boris Johnson and his honours list. When it comes to honours and Boris Johnson, Boris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn\u2019t prepared to do, because I didn\u2019t think it was right. That was to either overrule the Holac [House of Lords appointments] committee or to make promises to people. Now, I wasn\u2019t prepared to do that. As I said, I didn\u2019t think it was right. And if people don\u2019t like that, then tough. At that point there was a large round of applause. Sunak went on: When I got this job, I said I was going to do things differently because I wanted to change politics. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019m also keen to make sure that we change how our country works. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m here talking about today \u2013 making sure that we can grow our economy, that we can maintain our leadership in the innovative industries of the future. Why? Because it\u2019s going to create jobs for people, it\u2019s going to spread opportunity around. And it has the potential, as we\u2019ve been discussing, to transform people\u2019s lives. As prime minister, I want to make sure that that happens, because I want to make sure that I improve everyone\u2019s lives in this country and do it in a way that is right and is in accordance with my values. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to keep doing. There was another round of applause when he ended. At the London Tech Week event Rishi Sunak is now taking questions from journalists. Asked about Boris Johnson, he says Johnson asked him to do something that he was not prepared to do, because he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was right\u201d. He says Johnson wanted him to either over-rule the House of Lords appointments commission, or to make promises (to the MPs offered peerages by Johnson, who wanted to delay their resignations until later, so as not to cause byelections). This is the first on-the-record explanation we have had from Sunak about the rift with Johnson over the honours list. There is a round of applause for Sunak when he says this. (This is highly unusual in a Q&amp;A like this.) UPDATE: See 9.53am for the full quote. Sunak is now taking questions at the London Tech Week. He is in a Q&amp;A with Demis Hassabis from Google\u2019s DeepMind. He says the UK was at the forefront of inventions during the industrial revolution. Going forward, he says regulation is key; you need a balance between regulation that supports innovation but also puts appropriate protections in place. \u201cThe UK has a track record of getting that balance right,\u201d he says. And he says creative industries will be an important component of tech in the future. He says that is another areas where the UK is strong. This is from Sky\u2019s Rob Powell. Rishi Sunak is speaking at London Tech Week. In his opening remarks, he said the tech world was changing very quickly, and that the government could not afford to rest if it wanted to exploit the opportunities available. The UK was the third country in the world for unicorns (tech start-ups worth $1bn), he said. It was third in the world behind the US and China. Sunak also said the UK was the best country in the Europe for raising capital for tech. He went on: What\u2019s the single most important reason innovators like you should choose this country? The answer is leadership. Do you trust the people in charge to really get what you\u2019re trying to do With this government, and with me as your prime minister, you can judge us not by our words, but our actions. It\u2019s this government that\u2019s building the most pro-investment tax regime, that\u2019s increasing public R&amp;D investment to record levels, that\u2019s making our visa system for international talent one of the most competitive in the world, but overhauling our listing rules to make it easier for companies to raise public funding and changing our pension rules to unlock new private capital. Sunak said AI offered great opportunities. But it had to be developed in a way that was safe, he said, and he highlighted three government initiatives to achieve this. First, he said the government was working with companies to ensure they give early access to their models, so they can be evaluated. Second, the UK will host an international conference on AI regulation, he said. And, third, he said the government was investing in AI to ensure that it could be used to benefit public services. Good morning. At the end of last week Boris Johnson, and two of his most loyal supporters, resigned their Commons seats, unexpectedly and without any need to do so, triggering byelections that could destabilise Rishi Sunak\u2019s government. Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams offered no proper explanation for what they were doing, and Johnson (wrongly) claimed that he was being forced out because the privileges committee is due to publish a report saying he misled parliament. (He could have stayed in the Commons to defend himself, and only losing a recall election would have forced him out for good.) Johnson\u2019s resignation statement attacked the privileges committee, but the three resignations were also an implicit declaration of war against Sunak by a former PM whose only hope of returning to the political frontline rests on Sunak losing the next election. In this situation, what does Sunak do? Go on the offensive and seek to marginalise Johnson even more? Or calm things down, avoid antagonising the Johnson faction even further, and hope that mainstream party opinion will unite behind the leadership. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has been giving interviews on behalf of the government this morning, and he made it clear that No 10 is adopting the latter strategy. Here are some of his messages. Gove defended the Commons privileges committee, and condemned the fact that criticism of the committee means that its members have now been offered extra security. He told the Today programme: The people who served on that committee were asked by the House of Commons collectively to do a particular job. It\u2019s a job that has required careful work on their part and no little effort to make a series of significant judgments. So I have respect for the work that they have done. And I think that we need to respect again the integrity of the process, and wait until the report is published before then debating its conclusions and the consequences. The second thing that I want to say is that I do deprecate the fact that they are now in a position where, as reported, they have to seek or have been granted additional security. As someone who\u2019s been through that position myself in the past then I extend my sympathy to them and their families at this point. Gove did not explain why the MPs on the committee feel they are under threat. It is because Johnson has accused it of acting like a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, and suggested that it is ruling against him as part of some shadowy establishment plot to undermine Brexit, and because some Tory MPs, notably Jacob Rees-Mogg, have said much the same. The committee is meeting this morning to finalise its report into Johnson. Gove played down the significance of the three byelections, saying the party would unite behind Sunak. He told BBC Breakfast: Elections are part of political life. It\u2019s also the case I think that you do best in elections when you concentrate on good government. And we are united behind Rishi Sunak in making sure that we demonstrate that the priorities that the British public have are those which govern every waking moment that we have. Gove declined to criticise Johnson, Dorries or Adams explicitly. Asked repeatedly on the Today programme to acknowledge Johnson\u2019s faults, he said he preferred to remember his achievements, and in another interview he refused to criticise Dorries or Adams for standing down. Gove dodged questions about whether he would like to see Johnson return to the Commons in the future, telling Times Radio: I\u2019ve offered Boris advice in the past. He hasn\u2019t always taken it. And so therefore, I think Boris will make his own mind up. Some Tories want Sunak to declare that Johnson cannot stand again as a candidate, while Johnson\u2019s supporters are saying blocking him would be unacceptable. It is not surprising that No 10 currently seems to be sitting on the fence on this one. We should hear from Sunak on the topic of Johnson soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Rishi Sunak gives a speech on AI at the London Tech Week conference. Morning: The Commons privileges committee meets in private to discuss the final version of its report on claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby conference. After 3.30pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. Later there will be a debate on Public Order Act regulations, followed by a general debate on the principle of excluding MPs from the parliamentary estate if they are deemed a risk to staff because of accusations they face. 4pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee on the integrated review. Also, Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, will be campaigning today in Mid Bedfordshire, ahead of the byelection caused by the resignation of Nadine Dorries.

The first minister has been under pressure to suspend his predecessor and mentor after SNP parliamentarians and opposition leaders urged the party to take action or for Sturgeon to stand down voluntarily. Sturgeon has publicly said she is innocent of any wrongdoing and Yousaf told the BBC he would treat her in the same way as Colin Beattie, the party\u2019s former treasurer who was arrested and released without charge in the same police investigation in April. \u201cI see no reason to suspend their membership,\u201d Yousaf said. \u201cI have been leader now for 11 weeks. I have shown a consistency in terms of the approach.\u201d He added: \u201cOthers have been released without charge and I propose to treat Nicola Sturgeon exactly the same. I can\u2019t account for decisions that were made before I was leader of the SNP.\u201d His remarks came after Michelle Thomson, an SNP MSP who was forced to resign the whip when she was an MP eight years ago, said it would be consistent with the party\u2019s previous actions if Sturgeon voluntarily resigned the whip at Holyrood. Thomson, who was caught up in an investigation into alleged mortgage mis-selling but later cleared, said she was a strong believer in the presumption of innocence. Even so, the SNP\u2019s rules were clear, she said. \u201cAfter careful consideration, I feel that the right thing for the former first minister to do is resign the SNP whip. This is not because she doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated as innocent until proven guilty \u2013 she does, but because her values should be consistent.\u201d Thomson was the campaign manager for Kate Forbes, the former Scottish finance secretary who narrowly lost to Yousaf in April\u2019s SNP leadership contest. Her remarks echoed demands over the last 24 hours from other internal critics of Yousaf\u2019s leadership and from opposition leaders, who said the party had repeatedly suspended or forced out ministers and parliamentarians who were under investigation or accused of significant wrongdoing. During Sturgeon\u2019s period as leader, Derek Mackay was forced to quit as Scottish finance secretary, in 2021, after being accused of sending a 16-year-old boy inappropriate messages. In 2017, Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a minister after sending inappropriate messages to female staff. The SNP\u2019s wider divisions were further exposed when two allies of Alex Salmond, the former first minister who leads the rival and hardline pro-independence party Alba, called for Sturgeon to step aside. Ash Regan, a former minister who came third in the race to succeed Sturgeon as leader, told BBC Radio Scotland: \u201cNicola should perhaps consider voluntarily resigning her SNP membership until this is cleared up.\u201d If Sturgeon did not voluntarily step down, Yousaf should consider suspending her, Regan added. \u201cThe leadership need to think about taking decisive action,\u201d she said. Angus MacNeil, the MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar and one of Salmond\u2019s main allies inside the SNP, tweeted: \u201cThis soap opera has gone far enough, Nicola Sturgeon suspended others from the SNP for an awful lot less! Time for political distance until the investigation ends either way.\u201d Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said he would not comment on the SNP\u2019s disciplinary processes but said the crisis was a test of Yousaf\u2019s leadership and strength of character. \u201cThe question is for [Yousaf]: is he strong enough to take the action or is he too weak?\u201d Sarwar said. \u201cThe divisions between the Alex Salmond camp and the Nicola Sturgeon camp have caused real ruptures in the SNP. And whilst that was just about two individual personalities, it is now impacting on functional government, it\u2019s impacting on whether we have a functioning transport infrastructure, a functioning NHS.\u201d The SNP, meanwhile, confirmed Sturgeon was paying her legal costs. It had earlier said her husband, Peter Murrell, was not receiving any financial support to meet his solicitor\u2019s fees."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/12/minister-refuses-to-back-hancock-covid-claim-of-protective-ring-for-care-homes", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Minister refuses to back Hancock Covid claim of \u2018protective ring\u2019 for care homes ", "lead": "Helen Whately declines to endorse former health secretary\u2019s 2020 assertion as pandemic public inquiry begins in earnest", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T17:00:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080216", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8bd70b3928172365ae56acfabb0c1504f12de117/0_106_4250_2551/500.jpg", "body": "The care minister, Helen Whately, has declined to back Matt Hancock\u2019s claim that the government threw a \u201cprotective ring around care homes\u201d at the start of the pandemic. Whately worked under the former health secretary in the first 18 months of Covid, but she avoided endorsing her former boss\u2019s assertion, which will be tested at the public inquiry which starts in earnest this week. Asked whether Hancock was right in May 2020 when he told parliament \u201cwe absolutely did throw a protective ring around social care\u201d, Whately told the Guardian she wanted to \u201cuse my own words which is that I look back on doing everything I felt that we could to help care homes and social care more broadly at an incredibly difficult time\u201d. In the first wave of the pandemic there were almost 27,000 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in care homes in England and Wales compared with the 2015\u201319 average. The virus penetrated care homes so widely and spread so fast that 13 homes in England saw two dozen or more Covid deaths each in just 11 weeks at the start of the pandemic, official figures have revealed. Evidence sessions examining the UK\u2019s preparedness for the pandemic start this week and Hancock, who resigned from the government in June 2021 after breaking lockdown rules, is due to give evidence this month. Lawyers for trade unions are expected to highlight the chronic underfunding of social care and its fragmented provision in an opening statement to the inquiry this week. Government policy at the start of the pandemic of not requiring the isolation of untested hospital patients discharged into care homes has already been ruled illegal in the high court, where judges described it as \u201cirrational\u201d. \u201cI look back on it, how hard it was at that time when we were trying to get PPE out to social care,\u201d Whately said. \u201cWe had so few tests available.\u201d She added: \u201cI know looking back on it, it was very hard in the early days \u2026 We were really doing all that we possibly could. Still, it was really hard because people who were living in care homes were particularly vulnerable to Covid, as we know.\u201d Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, seized on the comments as an admission by the Conservatives of \u201cwhat the country could see: their \u2018protective ring\u2019 was an insult to the staff, families and care home residents who were not only vulnerable but voiceless\u201d. She said: \u201cFor the 43,000 families mourning the loss of a care home resident, nothing will bring their loved one back. But they will be looking to the inquiry for answers and lessons to be learned.\u201d Leaked WhatsApp messages have already revealed Whately warned Hancock against restricting visits to care homes in October 2020 saying it would be \u201cinhumane\u201d and some elderly people were \u201cjust giving up\u201d. Earlier, on 8 April 2020 she urged Hancock: \u201cWe should be testing all care home residents and staff who have had Covid contact, irrespective of symptoms.\u201d However, care homes were not able to start testing residents or staff without symptoms until the end of April. She also complained to Hancock that PPE supplies were \u201call over the place\u201d and that discharging hospital patients into care homes was \u201cmy biggest concern\u201d. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who preceded Hancock as health secretary, has also been called as a witness in the module starting this week on pandemic preparedness, alongside David Cameron and George Osborne, who are set to be asked about the impact of their austerity policies from 2010 onwards on the nation\u2019s readiness. The module on care homes is not due to start hearing from witnesses until spring 2025. Broader government handling of social care, which looks after over a million people in England, has been widely criticised. It is estimated that an extra 480,000 care workers are needed in England by 2035 and there are already 165,000 vacancies. In 2020 when Hunt was out of government under Boris Johnson and chaired the Commons health and social care select committee, he said the annual social care budget must rise by \u00a37bn by the end of 2024. The Health Foundation charity estimates the funding gap will be \u00a39.3bn by next year but last autumn the government raised spending by equivalent to \u00a33.75bn a year. Whately told the Guardian there had been \u201cbig, big workforce challenges\u201d over \u201cmany years\u201d. \u201cThe thing that I hear from the frontline is we need to be able to pay the care workforce better,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for that, we need better funding to come through from local authorities for the care rates.\u201d Asked if the latest \u00a37.5bn increase in central government funding over two years was the right amount, she said: \u201cI want to see social care really well funded, but I\u2019m not making the decisions for how all of government is funded. I will argue the corner for my sector.\u201d Today in England about 10,000 people live in the worst inadequate care homes, where problems are often caused by lack of staff. Asked if she accepted staff shortages were causing pain and suffering, she said: \u201cYou\u2019ll understand if I choose my own words, but I know \u2026 for some providers, staffing is one of their big challenges. Really good care homes have staff there for a long time but others are finding it really difficult. I think we\u2019ll see quality of care improve if we can help providers retain staff.\u201d She said increasing recruitment of care staff from overseas by adding them to the shortage occupations visa list was helping in the short term, but it was not a long-term answer. \u201cI want everyone to be in a good, if not outstanding, care home,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why I think the workforce reforms and the funding for social care are really, really important. But I don\u2019t think anybody sitting in my position could come in and fix it in 24 hours. This is a long-term problem.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/12/uk-heatwave-prompts-order-to-fire-up-coal-plant-to-meet-aircon-demand", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "UK heatwave prompts National Grid to fire up coal plant to meet aircon demand", "lead": "National Grid asks for two units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant to be brought into action after temperature tops 30C", "author": "Alex Lawson", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T16:55:11Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080218", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ad437f28ebce1ad832001d3de8ef48477c0fe5fa/0_384_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "National Grid has broken a 46-day run in which coal has not been used to generate electricity in Britain in order to meet extra demand for air conditioning as the country swelters in hot weather. The grid\u2019s electricity system operator (ESO) asked Uniper, the owner of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire, to start producing power from the coal-fired plant, prompting criticism from green campaigners. Temperatures broke 30C for the first time this year over the weekend and meteorologists forecast the chance of Britain experiencing a hot summer was 45% \u2013 2.3 times the typical figure. The hot weather is expected to push up demand for power, as households and businesses switch on air conditioning units. Air conditioning accounts for about a fifth of the total electricity used in buildings around the world. One unit at the Ratcliffe plant was brought into action on Monday morning, with a second unit warmed up to cover the evening peak in power demand. The consultancy LCP Delta said wind generation was low on Monday and planned maintenance at the Torness nuclear power station on the east coast of Scotland, which began on Sunday night, had reduced available generation by a further 1.3 gigawatts. Last week, a fault was found on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector that carries power between Norway and the UK, cutting electricity supplies. The power flowing through the 450-mile subsea cable has been reduced by half while the fault, discovered at an onshore facility in Norway, is repaired. The decision to turn to the fossil fuel angered green campaigners. Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK\u2019s political campaigner, said: \u201cIt is a sign of failure that the National Grid is turning to one of the most polluting forms of power generation to deal with a summer heatwave that we know has been made worse because of climate change.\u201d She added: \u201cThe government must get to work and upgrade our energy grid. In summer, we should be turning to solar power, yet we currently have renewable energy going to waste because our grid cannot transmit the power, and hundreds of renewables projects which are on hold because they can\u2019t get connected.\u201d National Grid has previously advised consumers to improve the energy efficiency of air conditioning by changing or cleaning the machine\u2019s reusable filter, closing windows and doors and by shutting curtains to block the sun\u2019s light and heat coming into the home. Ratcliffe-on-Soar was among the coal-fired power stations put on standby to provide extra power by the ESO over the winter amid concerns that a cold snap and a reduction in gas from Russia to Europe could lead to rolling blackouts. In the event, the plants were frequently warmed but only called into action in March, when EDF\u2019s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire began producing power before the coldest night of the year. Jess Ralston, the head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cCoal is playing a bit-part role in the electricity grid, and both here and in Europe its use is plummeting, partly because of its high emissions. \u201cWith more offshore wind, and solar particularly in the summertime, coal\u2019s back-up role will become redundant with smarter markets combined with batteries and other storage technologies.\u201d The life of Ratcliffe\u2019s fourth unit was extended for two years beyond its planned closure date last year, with all units now due to shut by September 2024 as Britain phases out burning coal for power generation. The ESO also called on households to save power by shifting their usage away from peak hours through its demand flexibility service.

His trip to the US had been a success, marking another incremental shift towards political order and competence. Precisely nine hours later, the chaos had returned. Nadine Dorries\u2019s tweet announcing she was standing down as an MP was the first indication of yet more turbulence, with another backbencher, Nigel Adams, resigning after their former boss and political hero, Boris Johnson, did the same. Sunak\u2019s Downing Street, already at war with the former PM over his evidence to the public inquiry into Covid, now faces not just three perilous byelections but also a very public slanging match with a man it would like, above all else, just to stay out of the news. The angst inside No 10 is palpable and understandable. More or less every Conservative minister and MP has been saying the same thing in private for months: the only possible escape from electoral annihilation for their party is a period of calm, in which Sunak quietly chalks up policy successes while inflation falls and growth improves. Sunak\u2019s talks with Joe Biden in the White House, followed by an arguably symbolic new deal on transatlantic relations, exemplified this tactic. Sunak himself concedes that few voters notice foreign policy, but the wider sense of progress, purpose and, above all, discipline is seen as an electoral balm. But now, once again, the man a Labour official once memorably described as a \u201chonking pudding\u201d, and one followed by its own travelling circus, has returned. This is not good news for Sunak, according to Rob Ford, a professor of politics at Manchester University, who called Johnson \u201can albatross around the neck of the prime minister\u201d. He said: \u201cEvery day that Boris Johnson leads the headlines on the news cycle is a good day for the Labour party. If you are Rishi Sunak, and you\u2019re trying to reboot a 13-year-old government, the last thing you need is everything in the news being about someone that people thought they got rid of. \u201cThe risk is we now have another long, hot summer of feuding. Sunak really needs to find a way to dial down the Boris soap opera.\u201d There is an argument that at least some soap operatics were inevitable. By resigning, Johnson has simply pre-empted a report on whether he misled MPs over lockdown parties, one which would most likely have ended in a tricky Commons vote over whether to suspend him for enough time to prompt a byelection. At least now Johnson is outside parliament, and an immediate route back via another seat seems tricky, with Conservative HQ saying any MP who quits has to apply to get on to the party\u2019s list of approved candidates, like anyone else. The one problem for Sunak is that Johnson does not rely on the Commons to get his message across \u2013 once removed from No 10 he barely appeared there \u2013 and has a ready megaphone through friendly newspapers and supportive MPs. Sunak\u2019s aim will be to quieten those MPs, although most else is largely outside his control. While polling shows Johnson is unpopular with voters, he is beloved by many Tory members, with a key test of his ability to foment chaos likely to come at the party\u2019s conference in October. Sunak is, of course, not the only major party leader to have faced a problematic predecessor. But the idea of him mimicking Keir Starmer over Jeremy Corbyn and ejecting Johnson from the party seems highly unlikely. \u201cThat would massively backfire,\u201d said Ford. \u201cIt would be open war, with Johnson as one of the participants. It would be the only story in town for months, and a colossal act of electoral self-harm.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/12/boris-johnson-formally-steps-down-as-mp", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Boris Johnson formally steps down as MP", "lead": "Confirmation of ex-PM resigning Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat follows period of frequent overseas trips and Commons\u2019 absences", "author": "Peter Walker and Rowena Mason", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T16:49:26Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080224", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/90adcf8b80290c2e46a616f5fecd506656ade94c/0_0_2042_1225/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has formally stepped down as an MP, parliamentary authorities have announced, bringing down the curtain on a tumultuous second stint in the Commons. Johnson has accepted the post of crown steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, the government said, part of the convoluted process under which MPs resign. It brings to an end his eight years as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London. Since being ousted in July last year Johnson has spent large amounts of time abroad earning money through speeches and going on holiday. He has made at least 10 trips outside the UK in the last year, spending about 70 days out of the country, including when parliament has been sitting, and leading to calls for him to spend more time representing his constituents in the Commons. The former prime minister has earned more than \u00a34m since leaving Downing Street from speeches and an advance for a book. He has been travelling in Singapore, India, Portugal, Nigeria and the US to make speeches, as well as taking holidays in Greece, Slovenia and at least four weeks in the Dominican Republic over the last year. He has also missed more than 100 parliamentary votes since September. Johnson will now lose his \u00a384,000 salary as an MP but keep the six-figure annual allowance available to all former prime ministers. The \u00a3115,000 a year payments are made for the specific purpose of former prime ministers \u201ccontinuing to fulfil public duties\u201d. Johnson\u2019s departure as an MP is the second time he has left parliament, serving first from 2001 to 2008 as the MP for Henley until he stepped down to take over as London mayor. Rules dating back to 1624 state that MPs can only leave their seats as a result of death, expulsion or disqualification and cannot voluntarily step down. They have to instead accept a paid crown office, which automatically disqualifies them. \u201cThe chancellor of the exchequer has this day appointed Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson to be steward and bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern,\u201d a statement by the Treasury said. Johnson announced on Friday evening he was stepping down as an MP to pre-empt a damning verdict from the Commons privileges committee into whether he misled parliament over lockdown-breaking parties. Also on Friday, two close allies of Johnson, Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams, resigned their seats after apparent confusion over whether they could be made peers in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list and remain in the Commons until a general election. Disagreement between Johnson and Rishi Sunak over these arrangements sparked a bitter war of words between the pair. A Treasury statement sent just before Johnson\u2019s announcement said Adams had been made steward and bailiff of the manor of Northstead, the other crown office used for such purposes. MPs stepping down only need to hold the posts momentarily, which means Dorries can formally leave the Commons very soon as well. The resignations set up a trio of difficult byelections for Sunak. Labour, which trailed Johnson by just over 7,200 votes at the 2019 election, are clear favourites for his seat, and are targeting Adams\u2019 Selby and Ainsty constituency despite his 20,000 majority. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats hope to push for the Mid Bedfordshire seat of Dorries, despite a near-25,000 majority, with the Lib Dems tipped by bookmakers as more likely to win."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/12/three-everton-board-members-leave-bill-kenwright-expected-to-follow", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Three Everton board members leave and Bill Kenwright expected to follow", "lead": "Everton have announced significant boardroom changes in developments that signal the arrival of fresh investment", "author": "Andy Hunter", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T16:44:02Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080227", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0b7e3799fc9ac23f6d5854b9d7b6df9aad688b4e/0_371_5568_3341/500.jpg", "body": "Three members of Everton\u2019s board left their roles on Monday and the chairman, Bill Kenwright, is expected to go in the next 48 hours in developments which signal the arrival of fresh investment.

Georgia Bilham, 21, from Chester, said she created a male alter ego called George as \u201can escape\u201d from her unhappy life, saying her mum would not have approved of her being in a lesbian relationship. She denies 17 counts of sexual assault against a young woman who was so shortsighted that she was legally blind. The complainant, who cannot be named, told police she would never have consented to sex if she had known Bilham was a girl. Giving evidence at Chester crown court on Monday, Bilham admitted having sexual activity with the woman when they were both 19, in the summer of 2021, but said the woman had figured out by then that she was not really a man. Bilham said she first encountered her alleged victim when she was 14 when they met through a mutual acquaintance, hanging around as a group outside McDonald\u2019s in Chester for half an hour. A few years later, in 2017, she created a Snapchat account in the name of George Parry and contacted the complainant and another girl, Nikita Hughes, who gave evidence last week. Bilham insisted she was not trying to trick the complainant into thinking she was a boy but rather did not want her to realise who she really was in case their friends and family found out. Asked by her barrister, Martine Snowdon, why she lied to the complainant, she said she did not want her to know \u201cthat it was me. Not that it was a girl. That it was me.\u201d Bilham said she considered herself straight now but that in retrospect she was not in 2021. Snowdon suggested Bilham may have not been open about her sexuality because her family would not accept it. \u201cHow do you think your mum would have reacted if she knew that you were in a same-sex relationship?\u201d the barrister asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think she would have been very happy about it,\u201d Bilham said. She admitted creating a false backstory for George, putting on a Brummie accent after claiming to be from Aston in Birmingham. The jury heard a recording of her pretending to be George, using a deep voice that veered between the Midlands and Merseyside. She said she always wore her hood up when meeting the complainant to hide her long blond hair, telling the complainant it was because George had got mixed up with some Albanian gangsters \u201cand was paranoid\u201d. She told the jury that when she was 18 she had an Albanian boyfriend called Denis, \u201cwho was involved in stuff he shouldn\u2019t have been doing\u201d. While posing as George, she suggested Denis was one of the gangmasters. Snowdon asked Bilham why she created the false profile and kept it a secret from her friends and family. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t happy with myself,\u201d Bilham said, adding that it was \u201cjust an escape\u201d. Snowdon asked: \u201cHave you ever thought that you wanted to change your gender and become a boy?\u201d Bilham answered: \u201cNo.\u201d Bilham said she assumed the complainant knew she was a girl after they were involved in a car crash in May 2021. She told the jury that a police officer told the complainant that Bilham, who had been driving, was a girl. The court heard that the complainant sent Bilham messages in the hours after the incident saying \u201cI\u2019m so confused\u201d and \u201cHow have you lied for so long and why?\u201d. Bilham replied saying she had only lied to the police, having been given a fake female driving licence by the Albanian gangsters. The complainant replied: \u201cAnswer this with yes or no: are you a girl? And if you are a girl why the fuck have you lied all this time?\u201d Bilham said she assumed from that point that the game was up but continued to pretend to be George after the crash. \u201cI was just trying to protect myself because I got myself caught up in the web of lies,\u201d she told the court. After the crash, the pair continued to see each other and the relationship turned sexual, the court heard. Anna Pope, prosecuting, asked why Bilham did not drop the George act. \u201cWas the benefit to you that you were getting a buzz out of deceiving her into thinking you were a man?\u201d Bilham said no.

Benton, known for her stage roles in Hamilton as well as Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, took aim at the Republican presidential hopeful and his policies attacking minority groups as she announced an award for theatrical excellence for a Florida high school teacher from the town of Plantation. She said: \u201cWhile I am certain that the current grand wizard, I\u2019m sorry, excuse me, governor of my home state will be changing the name of this following town immediately, we were honored to present this award to the truly incredible and life-changing Jason Zembuch-Young, enhancing the lives of students at South Plantation high school in Plantation, Florida.\u201d There were gasps from some in the crowd, followed by laughter and lengthy applause. DeSantis has curtailed Black voters\u2019 rights, restricted conversations of race and sexuality in Florida\u2019s classrooms and workplaces, and rolled back protections for the LBGTQ+ community and other minority groups as he attempts to prove his extremist credentials to Republican voters in pursuit of his party\u2019s presidential nomination. Benton\u2019s comments also came the day after a group of DeSantis supporters was spotted waving Nazi flags and banners supporting the governor at the entrance to Disney World in Orlando. DeSantis is feuding with the theme park giant over his \u2019don\u2019t say gay\u2019 law banning discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, and he has not responded to calls from Democrats or civil rights groups to condemn either Saturday\u2019s demonstration or previous gatherings of Nazi sympathizers in central Florida. He is also being sued for his \u201cunauthorized alien transportation program\u201d in which groups of South American asylum seekers have been moved around the country in planes chartered by the state of Florida and dumped in states and cities run by Democrats without prior notice. Critics have highlighted the parallels between the DeSantis program, which he sees as a protest to President Joe Biden\u2019s immigration policies, and the reverse freedom rides from the civil rights era of six decades ago. Similar to the false promises of accommodation, jobs, clothing and food allegedly made to lure the DeSantis groups of migrants, white supremacist groups in the 1960s \u2013 including the Klan \u2013 bussed Black families out of southern states to the north with assurances that a better life awaited them. Benton\u2019s comments on Sunday were broadcast live to the nation on a CBS telecast of the Tony awards from Manhattan. The 31-year-old actor was educated at Carnegie Mellon University, which partnered with the Tonys to honor Zembuch-Young for his work creating a diverse and inclusive theater at his school and in summer camps, including shows staged entirely in American sign language (ASL). \u201cI didn\u2019t start out with a mission of: let\u2019s be as inclusive as we possibly can.

At 92, he has not lost his power to make headlines, as shown by his decision to hand control of his multibillion-dollar Open Society Foundations to his son Alex, going back on a vow that it would not go to one of his children. It has been a long time since Soros was an active investor, and he has been focused on how to spend the fortune he amassed on his main areas of interest \u2013 building democracies and supporting human rights. Yet he will be forever known as the financier who broke the Bank of England by leading the speculative attack on the pound more than 30 years ago. And with good reason. Black Wednesday, as it became known, was a seminal moment. It was the classic demonstration of the power of financial markets. What\u2019s more, it led to a rethink of the UK\u2019s entire economic strategy and the establishment of the inflation-targeting regime still in place today. Soros has plenty of enemies. In recent years, those who turn up to his annual dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos have heard him warn that China\u2019s Xi Jinping will use artificial intelligence to cement a one-party state, and that Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may be the start of a third world war. In the US, Soros is loathed by many Republicans. In part, that is because he has never had any time for Donald Trump, but it is also because as a billionaire, Democrat-backing Jewish supporter of globalisation, he has become fodder for a host of increasingly wild antisemitic conspiracy theories. In truth, Soros is far more complex than this bogeyman image of a plutocratic financier would suggest. As a student at the London School of Economics, he was influenced by the philosopher Karl Popper, who said it was impossible to establish anything with absolute certainty and that ideologies that claimed to have found the secret to universal truth were making a false claim. Popper said that, because they were flawed, these ideologies \u2013 on the left and right alike \u2013 could only be imposed by force and would lead to tyrannical regimes. Popper\u2019s insight helped Soros develop a critique of financial markets known as reflexivity: that far from being perfectly rational, investors based their decisions on a perception of reality. These decisions then altered the reality through a feedback loop. Soros says his belief in reflexivity meant he was able to successfully predict the 2008 global financial crisis. Paradoxically, though, the financial bonanza for which he is best known was when the markets behaved with clear-headed rationality. Like other currency traders, Soros thought there was an obvious tension between the determination of John Major\u2019s government to defend the pound\u2019s value within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and the dire state of the UK economy in late 1992. Britain had joined the ERM less than two years earlier and was committed to keeping the pound within a set band against the German mark. The orthodox way of supporting a currency is to raise interest rates, but they were already at 10% at a time when unemployment stood at more than 3 million. The gamble Soros and his fellow speculators took was that the pound would eventually be devalued because there was a limit to how much pain the government was prepared to inflict on its own people. The gamble proved correct. After announcing that interest rates would be raised to 15% (a decision never acted upon), the government caved in and announced that Britain\u2019s membership of the ERM would be suspended. Soros cleaned up. Black Wednesday was a bruising and humbling episode but turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the economy. The pound fell sharply, which was good for exports. Interest rates were cut and a long 16-year boom followed. Yet despite Soros being a strong supporter of the EU, his activities arguably lit the long fuse of Euroscepticism that eventually led to the Brexit vote of 2016."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/silvio-berlusconi-press-and-politicians-reflect-on-his-legacy", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "\u2018Everything about him was excessive\u2019: Italy says farewell to Silvio Berlusconi", "lead": "The ex-Italian prime minister\u2019s career was beset with scandal but his vitality and humour won many over", "author": "Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T16:08:13Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080239", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d8a1b9ce5235cfd54d1a535a6de3c5671616f0c1/0_127_3200_1920/500.jpg", "body": "Silvio Berlusconi was certainly no angel and never considered himself to be one. Suffice to say, a Wikipedia page on a lifetime of legal cases against him runs to 18,000 words. But news of Berlusconi\u2019s death on Monday shook the country and moved millions of Italians. His career was tainted by sex scandals, countless allegations of corruption and a tax fraud conviction, yet many paid their respects to one of the dominant figures in Italy\u2019s postwar republic. Even the Milan prosecutor\u2019s office, to which Berlusconi gave so much work, paid its tribute a few hours after his death, citing \u201ca man who marked the history of Italy\u201d. Berlusconi was accused of false accounting, bribing tax officials and magistrates, and even of being involved in the mafia bomb attacks of 1992 and 1993. Yet, despite these very serious allegations, he continued to be successful in politics and to be seen as a charismatic and likable figure. One of the first messages of condolence was delivered by arguably his most bitter political rival, the former Italian PM and European Commission president Romano Prodi. \u201cWe represented different and opposing worlds but our rivalry never turned into sentiments of animosity on a personal level, and the debate remained within the sphere of mutual respect,\u201d Prodi said. From 9.30am on Monday, nobody in Italy spoke of anything other than his death, with the newspapers working frantically to report the dozens of reactions arriving from around the world. Some of them came from the world of finance, where, a few minutes after the announcement of the tycoon\u2019s passing, shares in Mediaset, Italy\u2019s largest commercial broadcaster, of which Berlusconi was the controlling shareholder, rose by over 5%. There were also messages from both Karima El Mahroug, who had attended Berlusconi\u2019s \u201cbunga bunga\u201d parties, and Pope Francis. The Italian press spoke about the end of an era. The national newspaper La Repubblica, wrote: \u201cIt is now difficult to imagine an Italy without Berlusconi. In the last 50 years, there hasn\u2019t been a day in which his name hasn\u2019t been mentioned, on TV, in the newspapers, in parliament, in bars and at the stadium.\u2019\u2019 \u201cEverything about him was excessive,\u201d added the paper in its editorial. \u201cAt one point, his popularity was such as to be identified as a symbol of the Italian, around the world.\u201d But if the rightwing newspapers have praised Berlusconi, calling him a \u201cvisionary\u201d and even a \u201cbuilder of modern Italy\u201d, other newspapers have underlined the other side of the coin: the judicial inquiries, shadows on his political career and questionable business dealings. Il Fatto Quotidiano, one of the newspapers that most criticised and attacked Berlusconi and investigated the corruption allegations, wrote on its homepage: \u201cSilvio Berlusconi is dead, first of the populists and record holder of investigations, from corruption to the mafia.\u201d \u201cThis was Berlusconi,\u201d the former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said, \u201cloved by many and hated by many.\u201d Internationally, Berlusconi embodied the stereotype of a certain type of Italian man: sexist, a womaniser, politically incorrect, lover of good food and football and known for his vitality, friendliness, sociability and sense of humour. He managed to win over not only Italians but numerous international leaders, first of all Vladimir Putin. The Russian president was among the first foreign heads of state to pay his respects, in a rare, lengthy letter \u2013 released late in the morning. \u201cFor me, Silvio was a dear person, a true friend,\u201d wrote Putin. \u201cI have always sincerely admired his wisdom and his ability to make balanced, far-sighted decisions, even in the most difficult situations. During each of our meetings, I was literally charged with his incredible vitality, optimism and sense of humour. His death is an irreparable loss and great sorrow.\u201d Berlusconi had become so powerful and popular that despite his physical ailments, he was perceived in the eyes of many as an immortal figure, something he loved to joke about. One joke the media tycoon told concerned his own death and his search for a tomb. The joke is that Berlusconi, after refusing to be buried among the popes in St Peter\u2019s in Rome, began to think of buying the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, where the body of Jesus had been brought after the crucifixion. The problem, however, was the cost, because Berlusconi would have had to pay $2bn to be buried there. \u201cDo I really have to pay so much? For what, to stay there for only three days?\u201d Berlusconi said, jokingly comparing himself to Jesus. The late Don Luigi Verz\u00e8, one of the founders of the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, revealed that Berlusconi had told him \u201cthat he wanted to live to be 150 to put Italy right\u201d. After Berlusconi\u2019s death, the popular Taffo funeral services, a long-established Italian funeral home, which has developed a humorous and ironic approach to death posted on social media: \u201cRIP Berlusconi. You were funnier than us.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/12/did-you-solve-it-police-academy", "primaryCategory": "science", "title": "Did you solve it?

Police chase The streets of the city are a square grid that extends infinitely in all directions. One of the streets, Broadway, has a police offer stationed every 100 blocks. A robber is somewhere in the city. Can you devise a strategy that guarantees the criminal will be spotted by the police at some point in time? Relevant information: The robber and the police officers are in a street at all times. The robber has a finite maximum running speed, which is faster than any officer\u2019s. The police can see infinitely far. Solution You need to devise a system with two elements: first, in which officers are placed on every intersection on Broadway. If this is the case, officers will be able to see down every perpendicular, meaning that the robber cannot escape down any perpendicular. Second, officers need to walk down all the roads perpendicular to Broadway, which enables them to look down all the streets that are parallel to Broadway. If this is the case, all streets are covered and the robber has nowhere to hide. First, some terminology. Let\u2019s call the roads parallel to Broadway \u201cavenues\u201d, and those perpendicular to Broadway \u201cstreets\u201d. And lets number the streets from \u2013infinity to +infinity. We begin with police officers stationed on Broadway at streets 0, +100, -100, 200, -200 etc. Step 1. At the moment the search is announced, let the officers on the \u2018odd hundreds\u2019 (i.e. +/-100, +/-300, +/- 500\u2026) start walking towards Street 0. And let the officers on the \u2018even hundreds\u2019 (i.e. 0, +/-200, +/-400, \u2026) stay put. Wherever the robber is, they are now constrained by a section of the city that is 200 blocks wide, since whenever they cross a street that is a multiple of 200 they will be seen by the officer at the intersection of that street and Broadway. Step 2. Let the officers from the \u2018odd hundreds\u2019, i.e. the streets numbered +/-100, +/-300, +/- 500,\u2026, stop walking down Broadway when they reach Street +/-1, Street +/-2, +/-3, ..and then tell them to turn right, and carry on walking. The officers from the + streets will walk one way, and the officers from the \u2013 streets will walk in the opposite direction. As each of them walks down their respective streets they will be able to look down every avenue as they pass them. Since there are an infinite number of police officers, there will eventually be officers walking down streets +/-1, +/-2, +/-3.. +/-n for all finite n. In other words, at some point all the streets in the 200 block where the robber is will have officers in them. In order for the robber not to be caught, the robber must hide in an avenue. Sooner or later, as the officers move away from Broadway, checking every avenue as they pass it, the robber will be caught. I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s puzzle. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks.

In her new book \u2013 I Didn\u2019t Even Say Half Of It \u2013 Fischer, who played 194 times for her country, described the process, which was conducted by a female physiotherapist on behalf of the doctor, as humiliating. The gender tests were carried out around the 2011 tournament in Germany after protests from Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana relating to allegations that the Equatorial Guinea squad included men. \u201cWe were told that we should not shave \u2018down there\u2019 in the coming days and that we will show our genetalia for the doctor,\u201d Fischer writes. \u201cNo one understands the thing about shaving but we do as we are told and think \u2018how did it get to this?\u2019 Why are we forced to do this now, there has to be other ways to do this. Should we refuse? \u201cAt the same time no one wants to jeopardise the opportunity to play at a World Cup. We just have to get the shit done no matter how sick and humiliating it feels.\u201d In an interview with the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, Fischer detailed the process in more depth. \u201cI understand what I have to do and quickly pull down my training pants and underwear at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe physio nods and says \u2018yup\u2019 and then looks out at the doctor who is standing with his back to my doorway. He makes a note and moves on in the corridor to knock on the next door. \u201cWhen everyone on our team is checked, that is to say, has exposed their vagina, our team doctor can sign that the Swedish women\u2019s national football team consists only of women.\u201d Asked how it felt, Fischer said: \u201cWe had a very safe environment in the team. So it was probably the best environment to do it in. But it\u2019s an extremely strange situation and overall not a comfortable way to do it.\u201d Two weeks before the 2011 World Cup began, Fifa issued its current gender recognition policies, which require teams to sign a declaration guaranteeing that players chosen for the World Cup are \u201cof an appropriate gender\u201d. Those rules state that: \u201cIt lies with each participating member association to \u2026 ensure the correct gender of all players by actively investigating any perceived deviation in secondary sex characteristic.\u201d It is unclear why Sweden\u2019s players were given a physical exam when a buccal swab test \u2013 a cheap and non-intrusive way to collect DNA from the cells on the inside of the cheek and determine a person\u2019s sex \u2013 has been used widely for decades. Sweden\u2019s team doctor in 2011, Mats B\u00f6rjesson, said the tests took place after Fifa demanded immediate testing when rumours began circulating about Equatorial Guinea\u2019s team. \u201cFifa doesn\u2019t do this to be mean to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sports world has tried to create fairness for girls so that they don\u2019t train their whole lives and then someone comes in with an unreasonable advantage.\u201d Fifa said it had \u201ctaken note of recent comments made by Nilla Fischer around her experiences and gender verification testing conducted by the Swedish national team at the 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup\u201d."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/12/football-daily-email-manchester-city-inter-big-cup", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Manchester City toast treble but fans suffer another Uefa Big Cup shambles", "lead": "<strong>In today\u2019s Football Daily: </strong>Jack Grealish\u2019s long weekend, City fans\u2019 long journey home and farewell Silvio Berlusconi", "author": "Barry Glendenning", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:58:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080246", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3d521b9ba45e954ccb3556df4405c8fbd5b322c0/0_350_5248_3149/500.jpg", "body": "BLUE MOON RISEN Watching the players and staff disembark from the plane carrying Manchester City\u2019s squad home from Big Cup final on Sunday, it was hard not to sympathise with Jack Grealish. Having spent the previous night wandering the bars and foyer of an Istanbul hotel in full kit looking for his clothes, it seemed the 27-year-old had finally found some civvies but was clearly suffering from the effects of what must have been extreme turbulence on the flight home. Unsteady on his feet as he descended the steps, Grealish\u2019s attempt to walk from the plane to the airport terminal resembled a cross between Neil Armstrong\u2019s moon walk, the video for Jamiroquai\u2019s Virtual Insanity and a slow-motion replay of Jack Grealish attempting to walk from a plane to an airport terminal while all those around him were perambulating in real time. It is to be hoped that somebody sat the poor fella down once he reached the baggage carousel and administered a stiff drink. Ideally a mug or two of strong coffee. There will be plenty more roistering to be done in the coming days ahead, as Jack and his teammates celebrate their Big Cup triumph over Inter in Istanbul on Saturday night. While the final was no classic and it could be argued that the Italians were the better team on the evening, City did what needed to be done and finally harpooned that elusive white whale. \u201cThe greatest story in club history has an ending,\u201d exclaimed BT Sport\u2019s commentator in the game\u2019s aftermath, his words almost drowned out by the loud trumpeting of 115 elephants. \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff you dream of,\u201d blubbed a tearful Jack into Jake Humphrey\u2019s microphone, only to tweet later that it was \u201cthe stuff I couldn\u2019t even dream of\u201d. Make your mind up, Jack! Having wrapped up the treble, City\u2019s players, manager, coaching staff, advertising department and bookkeepers have certainly earned Monday\u2019s open-top bus parade through the streets of Manchester. With huge crowds expected, their progress is likely to be as slow as that endured by fans trying to get to and particularly from the Ataturk Stadium on Saturday night. Located an hour\u2019s drive from Istanbul city centre on a good day, fans left the ground long after midnight and many were left trapped in stationary or slow-moving shuttle buses for hours, without access to so much as a bottle of salty tears from the eyes of jealous rival fans to slake their thirst, let alone a few glugs of life-giving water. It is clear now that Uefa, in their infinite wisdom, once again elected for political expediency over fan convenience by hosting their flagship European final in a stadium that could scarcely be less fit for purpose \u2013 but happens to be located in a country ruled over by the Uefa crony, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. While some fans embarked on the 15-mile walk home, others, including the elderly and wheelchair users, were forced to rely on the charity of strangers or local taxi drivers charging eye-wateringly extortionate sums long after midnight. \u201cIt was a shambles,\u201d City fan Steve Redmayne told Big Paper, having travelled to Turkey with his 74-year-old father and 14-year-old son. \u201cWhen we finally got on a shuttle bus back, it sat for 90 minutes without moving. We got back after 3am.\u201d For now, as is customary, Uefa has apparently absolved itself of all blame for what sounds like a complete cluster-eff, a stance which can be charitably viewed as an improvement on this time last year, when they were quick to point the finger at Liverpool fans for various shortcomings of their own making in Paris. Three months ago, Uefa was accused of bearing \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d for the potentially catastrophic scenes which marred last season\u2019s Big Cup final between Liverpool and Real Madrid at the Stade de France. To nobody\u2019s great surprise, few if any lessons seem to have been learned. DON SILVIO The political career of Silvio Berlusconi, who has died at the age of 86, was beset by scandals but in the football world at least, the memories are more wholesome. \u201cToday\u2019s sadness doesn\u2019t erase the happy moments spent together,\u201d wrote Carlo Ancelotti, on hearing the news about his former employer at Milan. Berlusconi, who helped rebuild the Rossoneri into a trophy-winning machine, was good for football but the game was good to him, too, providing a launch pad for those wider ambitions.

But as the media descended, looking for Sarwar\u2019s reaction to the arrest of the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon in Police Scotland\u2019s investigation into the finances of the party she previously led, it was clear that the significance of this seat in the political landscape had again been heightened: once more the SNP was in turmoil and Scottish Labour primed to seize the momentum. \u201cLook at the last 48 hours in British politics,\u201d Sarwar told reporters, pointing to the \u201cclown show\u201d of Boris Johnson and the \u201cabsolute meltdown\u201d in Scotland under the SNP. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of why we need change right across this country, both in Scotland but across the UK.\u201d Last Friday, South Lanarkshire council confirmed the public petition to recall Ferrier would be open from 9am on 20 June, with constituents able to sign the document at seven different local amenities including leisure centres and Rutherglen town hall. The petition was triggered after MPs voted to suspend Ferrier \u2013 who was elected for the SNP but had been sitting as an independent \u2013 from parliament for 30 days following a recommendation of the Commons standards committee. If the petition is signed by more than 10% of eligible voters in the constituency within six weeks, Ferrier will be removed from her seat and a byelection called. This contest was already seen as a test of an apparent sea change in Scottish politics, with strong indications from recent polling that voters are now less likely to choose which party to back based on their constitutional preferences, as well as drifting support for the SNP following Sturgeon\u2019s resignation, the bruising leadership campaign to replace her, and the stark questions about transparency and governance raised by the police investigation. Labour has been pouring resources into the constituency, with visits from Keir Starmer and other senior figures from the UK shadow cabinet, while local activists have been handing out glossy leaflets \u2013 labelling Ferrier \u201ca criminal SNP MP who put lives at risk\u201d \u2013 carrying a QR code for voters to add themselves to Labour\u2019s email alerts once the recall petition goes live. Activists who knock doors regularly in the constituency report a tangible shift in reception on the doorstep since the start of the year, with people who voted the SNP into power 16 years ago now giving them a hearing. But this byelection is also a test for the new SNP leader, Humza Yousaf, after a gruelling start. While most SNP politicians and activists had anticipated their former leader would be spoken to by detectives in some capacity, the reality of her arrest was still a shock and left many frustrated and even despairing that \u2013 despite Yousaf\u2019s best efforts to get on with the day job of government \u2013 the focus was again on the police inquiry. Following reports of Yousaf\u2019s discontent with the calibre of potential candidates, the SNP selected a local councillor, Katy Loudon, for the seat on Friday. Party activists are well aware of the difficulties they face, but argue the time it has taken for Ferrier to be subject to a recall petition means voters have already made a distinction between her behaviour and the party she used to represent. The \u201cclown show\u201d Sarwar referred to brings his party another challenge in Rutherglen \u2013 with three other byelections required across the UK, will Labour resources and focus be split? On Monday morning, Sarwar would do no more than accept that the timing of the other byelections would be \u201cinteresting\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we can get the necessary signatures required for that recall petition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then go the other side of summer recess and it\u2019s on the SNP to move the writ and set the date for that byelection. We would obviously urge them not to delay in that process.\u201d Shanks and his team will keep knocking on doors. \u201cWe\u2019re confident of getting a good result,\u201d said Sarwar, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got to do the hard work.

Age: Its roots extend back to the midpoint of the 20th century, with adherents in Britain, Japan and Australia. Appearance: People just doing nothing. I understand. I don\u2019t dig gardening either. It\u2019s not a matter of not liking gardening; you just do it without digging. Gardening without digging? That\u2019s like no-wash laundry, or no-read book club. It may sound like some lazy oxymoron, but it\u2019s a genuine technique, pioneered by gardeners such as Charles Dowding. How does it work? Instead of disturbing the natural structure of the soil by turning it, you just keep adding more organic material on top, letting the worms pull it in. What about weeds? The thick layer of mulch kills the weeds by cutting out light. When the time comes, you simply plant. It\u2019s better for the gardener\u2019s back, the soil and the environment. How long do we give this fringe idea? It\u2019s actually pretty mainstream. Some say it\u2019s the future of British gardening. Like who? Like Tim Clapp, head of the horticulture and garden care range at Kingfisher, the parent company of B&amp;Q. Home of digging implements? Yes, but they\u2019re looking at the bigger picture. Clapp says B&amp;Q is preparing to \u201cbring no-dig gardening to the masses\u201d. What are they really doing? They\u2019re launching a range of sustainable gardening products. I see. Are there any other outdoor activities that involve zero activity? You could try transforming your lawn into a wildflower meadow. By sourcing plants and seeds and relandscaping the whole area? No, you just stop mowing it. Then what? That\u2019s it. Let nature take its course. I\u2019ve heard of No Mow May, but this is June. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 hold your nerve and just keep on not doing anything. My neighbours might have something to say about the long grass. That\u2019s because they hate nature. Suddenly it seems I might have a bit of time on my hands this summer. If you\u2019re not busy, you could set about creating some wildlife habitats for beneficial insects and hibernating creatures. Sounds ambitious. What do I do? You know those piles of dead leaves, fallen petals, old branches and other detritus piling up in the corners of your garden? Yes? Leave them there. I\u2019m beginning to get the hang of this. Can I leave my dog\u2019s turds in the park? No, you have to pick them up. Do say: \u201cThis is a dedicated wildlife conservation area \u2013 please do not disturb the person in the hammock.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019m also really getting into no-work employment this year.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/12/womens-cycling-tour-feminin-international-des-pyrenees", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "\u2018Not the Tour de France\u2019: women\u2019s race director\u2019s safety remarks spark anger", "lead": "A race director in France has provoked anger after accusing professional female riders and teams of having safety expectations \u201cnot in line with their level\u201d", "author": "Luke McLaughlin", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:45:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080251", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9b0404f715c7397475334f9f57f59bf1bbfe02f4/0_439_5000_3001/500.jpg", "body": "A race director in France has provoked anger among cycling fans and media after accusing professional female riders and teams of having safety expectations \u201cnot in line with their level\u201d. The third and final stage of the Tour F\u00e9minin International des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es was cancelled on Sunday morning following a vote, conducted by the women\u2019s arm of the Cyclistes Professionnels Associ\u00e9s (CPA), in which 17 of 23 competing teams said the race was too dangerous to continue. The first two stages were marred by numerous near-misses as the peloton raced on roads that were open to other traffic. Video from the first stage, between Argel\u00e9s-Gazost and Lourdes in south-west France, showed vehicles including a coach travelling in the opposite direction to the speeding peloton on narrow roads. Cars nearly pulled out into the path of the riders, with motorbikes, pedestrians and other road users also coming dangerously close to the competitors. The first 25km of Saturday\u2019s second stage was neutralised as a result after discussions between the Cyclistes Professionnels Associ\u00e9s (CPA), the UCI and the riders and teams. But the safety measures were not enough to save the race. \u201cTo maintain the safety of the riders, the UCI has taken the decision to stop #TourPyrenees,\u201d the sport\u2019s governing body, the UCI, said on Sunday morning. \u201cAfter consulting with key stakeholders of the event, including @women_cpa, @cpacycling @HansenAdam, teams, commissaires, and the organising committee, today\u2019s stage will not go ahead.\u201d The race director, Pascal Baudron, sparked anger among the cycling community by seeming to suggest \u2013 before the decision to abandon the race \u2013 that the riders and teams did not have the right to expect a completely safe race. \u201cThe girls have demands that are not in line with their level,\u201d Baudron said. \u201cThey imagine that they are on the Tour de France and that all the roads must be closed, that everything must be locked down. But in France, we can\u2019t do that.\u201d Following the news that the third stage would not go ahead, Baudron was quoted as saying: \u201cQuite honestly, I tell myself it is not worth organising a race to see all those months of effort ruined for the whims of spoiled children.\u201d Speaking on Monday, the head of the CPA, Adam Hansen, told the Guardian: \u201cHis [the race director\u2019s] rolling closure was not up to standard, that\u2019s the main problem ... The UCI regulations on rolling closure are that they must take all the cars off the route ... so that means any moving car has to be taken off.\u201d Asked if Baudron\u2019s words risked sending the wrong message in relation to equality for women in cycling, Hansen said: \u201cFor sure, and that\u2019s why the CPA made sure women\u2019s races must be on the same level as the men\u2019s. A lot of the women\u2019s races are at the same level as the men \u2026 This is the first race I\u2019ve had to do anything regarding safety for the riders.\u201d Professional cycling has been troubled occasionally by safety concerns this season. Disaster was narrowly averted at the men\u2019s Paris-Nice in March, when a car suddenly appeared travelling in the opposite direction to the riders on a descent. Meanwhile the reigning Tour de France champion, Jonas Vingegaard of Jumbo-Visma, wrapped up victory in the week-long Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 on Saturday, a key warm-up race for the the three-week men\u2019s Tour de France, that begins on 1 July.

Zaha, who will be a free agent when his contract with Crystal Palace expires at the end of the month, held more talks with Al-Nassr last week as they attempt to improve their squad after missing out on the Saudi title to Al-Ittihad. The 30-year-old is being offered a two-year contract worth about three times the \u00a3200,000 a week on the table from Palace, but it is understood he would prefer to stay in Europe. He has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain in recent days. The French champions are yet to submit an offer to the Ivory Coast international but informal talks with his representatives are believed to have taken place. Reports in France on Sunday claimed that PSG\u2019s football adviser Luis Campos was an admirer of Zaha\u2019s \u201cgame changing\u201d ability. Marseille are also believed to be interested. Zaha missed the end of the Premier League season with a hamstring injury but is understood to be almost back to full fitness. The four-year offer from Palace would make him by far the highest-paid player in the club\u2019s history. It remains to be seen whether Zaha will remain at Palace, who are yet to confirm whether Roy Hodgson will be offered another year in charge after steering them to safety. Modric, who joined Madrid from Tottenham in 2012 for \u00a330m and has won the Champions League five times, had looked set to agree a year\u2019s extension to his contract.

Steven Gerrard has flown to Saudi Arabia for talks after being offered the chance to coach Al-Ettifaq.

Santander became the latest major lender to temporarily pull its mortgage deals for new borrowers from sale. Santander told mortgage brokers that it would stop accepting new applications for its \u201cnew business\u201d residential and buy-to-let fixed and tracker rates at 7.30pm tonight, with deals not becoming available again until Wednesday. The move shows that the turmoil in the home loans market shows no signs of abating, coming just days after HSBC temporarily withdrew its offers as borrowers raced to secure a deal. NatWest announced sweeping increases to its mortgages rates. It is putting up the rates on selected products for house purchases and remortgages, and some aimed at first-time buyers, by 20 basis points (0.2 percentage points). But landlords face sharper increases, with two-year fixed deals for Buy to let purchases increasing by up to 157bps. One mortgage broker said the move could be \u201cthe death knell for buy-to-let, at least with NatWest.\u201d The market has been destabilised by the UK\u2019s higher-than-expected inflation, which is likely to lead to more interest rate increases. Today, Bank of England policymaker Jonathan Haskel said that \u201cembedded inflation would be worse\u201d than the current high interest rates, which may head higher this year. Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College\u2019s business school, said the Bank of England recognised the pressure households and businesses were under, but warned persistently high inflation had wider economic costs as well. He wrote in The Scotsman: \u201cAs policymakers, we are required to make difficult judgements. \u201cMy own view is that it\u2019s important we continue to lean against the risks of inflation momentum, and therefore that further increases in interest rates cannot be ruled out.\u201d Wholesale borrowing costs have kept rising today, with the yield (or interest rate) on U two-year debt hitting 4.6% today, the highest since last autumn\u2019s market panic. That could push mortgages prices higher in coming days, as people warn that rising costs are already unaffordable: The average rate on a new two-year fixed mortgage has continued to creep up and stood at 5.86% on Monday, according to the financial data provider Moneyfacts, compared with 5.26% at the start of May. The financial markets indicate the Bank of England is certain to raise interest rates again when it meets later this month. A quarter-point rise is seen as a 75% chance, with a 25% possibility of a half-point hike, to 5%. Elsewhere today\u2026 Brexit, rising corporate taxes, growth concerns and political turmoil are causing US businesses to lose confidence in the UK as a place to invest, a new report shows. Strikes by security guards at Heathrow Airport planned for June 24 and 25 have been postponed following an improved pay offer\u2026.. \u2026.as storms have led to thousands of easyJet passengers flying to and from Gatwick have had their flights cancelled due to storms in the last 24 hours. National Grid has asked a coal-fired power station in the east Midlands to warm up to cope with extra electricity demand for air conditioning as much of Britain swelters in the heat. More than 2,000 workers are set to lose their jobs at delivery giant Tuffnells as the business fell into administration. Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group has taken an 18.9% stake in the online electricals retailer AO World in a \u00a375m deal involving buying out shares held by crisis-hit Odey Asset Management. One factor pushing up UK mortgage rates is that UK government bonds are falling in value, pushing up borrowing costs (the yield on the bonds). Those two-year gilts, now yielding 4.62% today, are used to price fixed-rate mortgages. It appears that NatWest is temporarily scaling back its buy-to-let lending activities and redirecting its focus towards residential applications. So says Anil Mistry, director and mortgage broker at RNR Mortgage Solutions, judging by the sharp rise in some buy-to-let mortgage rates announced today (see details). Mistry adds: It looks as if this is a strategic decision that aims to ensure that service levels remain unaffected during this period. UK mortgage brokers are concerned by NatWest\u2019s mortgage rate increases, which they say will hurt the buy-to-let market in particular. Lewis Shaw of Riverside Mortgages, says: I\u2019m no longer sure what level of reality I\u2019m meant to be operating on. This could sound the death knell for buy-to-let, at least with NatWest. Something has clearly spooked the money markets around 2pm today, and the 2-year gilt yield has shot above its peak following the mini-Budget in September. This is extremely worrying and I don\u2019t know where it ends. Riz Malik of R3 Mortgages warns that landlords face more \u2018hardship and pain\u2019: The considerable rise in mortgage rates on buy-to-let properties underlines the flux in the market at present and introduces yet more hardship and pain for numerous landlords. With each passing day, the financial calculations seem to make less sense. This a significant blow for the entire UK buy-to-let market. Last autumn, we warned that amateur landlords face a financial cliff edge from rising borrowing costs\u2026. NatWest are also adjusting their mortgage rates, upwards, joining the rush by lenders to reprice their loans amid the turbulence in the market. The bank says: \u201cEffective 13th June we\u2019re making changes to our end dates and rate changes to our new and existing customer product ranges\u201d The changes include some large increases for buy-to-let loans, with products increasing by up to 1.57 percentage points \u2013 a really hefty rise, which will hit landlords looking to remortgage. There are also smaller increases for other mortgage products. This shows that the increase in wholesale borrowing costs today (see earlier post) is having a ripple impact on mortgages, on top of Bank of England policymaker Jonathan Haskel warning that further interest rate increases can\u2019t be ruled out\u2026. Here are the details of NatWest\u2019s changes. New Business Rate Changes Purchase: Rate increase of 20bps on selected 2 year and 5 year deals. Remortgage: Rate increase of 20bps on selected 2 year and 5 year deals. First time buyer: Rate increase of 20bps on selected 2 year and 5 year deals. Shared equity - purchase: Rate increase of 75bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Buy to let \u2013 purchase: Rate increase of up to 157bps and 122bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Buy to let \u2013 remortgage: Rate increase of up to 124bps and 114bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Help to Buy shared equity - remortgage: Rate increase of 20bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Green - purchase: Rate increase of up to 20bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Green - remortgage: Rate increase of up to 20bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Buy to Let green - purchase: Rate increase of up to 138bps and 115bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Buy to Let green - remortgage: Rate increase of up to 107bps and 110bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Existing Customer Rate Changes Switcher: Rate increase of up to 35bps and 30bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. Switcher - tracker: Rate increase of up to 55bps on selected 2 year deals. Buy to Let - switcher: Rate increase of up to 42bps and 26bps on selected 2 and 5 year deals. The financial markets indicate the Bank of England is certain to raise interest rates again when it meets later this month. A quarter-point rise, lifting Bank Rate from 4.5% to 4.75%, is seen as a 75% chance. But the money markets indicate there\u2019s a 25% possibility of a half-point hike, to 5%. Newsflash: The first summer strikes at Heathrow Airport, involving over 2,000 security officers, have been postponed. Security officers at Terminal Three and Five as well as campus security workers were due to walk out on Saturday 24 June and Sunday 25 June. But the Unite union has announced the industral action has been frozen, after Heathrow Airports Ltd (HAL) made an improved pay offer. This follows \u201cextensive talks\u201d with Unite last week, says the union. Unite regional co-ordinating officer Wayne King said: \u201cFollowing extensive negotiations last week a new offer was put forward by HAL. Members will now be balloted on the latest offer and they will decide whether or not it meets their expectations.\u201d As we reported earlier, Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye had said this morning that strikes were unlikely to cause flight cancellations. Wholesale borrowing costs are continuing to rise today, putting more pressure on the mortgage market. The yield, or interest rate, on UK two-year government bonds has risen to 4.6%, for the first time since last September, when the mini-budget chaos was rocking the markets. These two-year gilts are used to price fixed-term mortgages, so this could lead more lenders to temporarily withdraw their deals and reprice them, higher\u2026. Stock markets are making a cautiously upbeat start to the new week. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has opened 63 points higher at 33,940 points, up 0.2%, with the tech-focused Nasdaq up 0.5%. Investors are eyeing US inflation data due tomorrow, and then the next Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is a little higher too, up 13 points or 0.17% at 7575 points. Over in Madrid, ministers are maintaining tax cuts on basic foods ahead of a general election in July. With elections looming next month, the Spanish government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez plans to extend tax breaks on staple foods until living costs ease further, Bloomberg reports. Economy Minister Nadia Calvino told reporters Monday at the headquarters of Sanchez\u2019s Socialist party in Madrid. \u201cWe will maintain a lower value-added tax on basic food items for as long as we don\u2019t reach adequate price levels.\u201d The government unveiled a multi-billion-euro package in December to ease the burden of surging prices by cutting VAT on some foods as well as electricity bills, and subsidizing some public transport. The decision to extend the tax reduction on foods comes as Sanchez faces a tough fight to stay in power against a resurgent People\u2019s Party, which opinion polls show could be on track to win the July 23 vote. Last week, major food manufacturers in France pledged to lower prices on hundreds of products next month after pressure from the government. One of those feeling the pinch from high UK inflation and mortgage rates is Clara, a 42-year-old secondary school teacher and mother of two teenagers. She rents a three-bedroom house in Hemel Hempstead for \u00a31,450 a month. \u201cThe rent makes up 40% of mine and my partner\u2019s joint take-home income,\u201d she says, which puts it above the 30% threshold that the Affordable Housing Commission defines as affordable. \u201cOur rent just rose again a month ago, because the landlord\u2019s mortgage payments increased. \u201cRents here have always been quite high, but have gone up a lot in the area over the last 10 years. There is a very large and growing group of people here who earn too much to access any form of housing benefit, but not enough to pay rent and the bills.\u201d JPMorgan Chase has announced a tentative settlement in a legal claim brought by a woman who said that the US banking giant profited from sexual abuse that she and others suffered at the hands of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. \u201cThe parties believe this settlement is in the best interests of all parties, especially the survivors who were the victims of Epstein\u2019s terrible abuse,\u201d JPMorgan said in a statement. The proposed deal could begin to shutdown weeks of embarrassing leaks about the extensive relationship that the bank had with Epstein, where the convicted sex offender was a client from 1998 to 2013 \u2013 seven years after he was first accused of soliciting a minor. Here\u2019s the full story. Back on mortgages\u2026.Nicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at broker John Charcol, said money market swap rates \u201chave continued to see a steady increase, with no sign of falling, which is pushing lenders to continue to reprice\u201d. He added: \u201cLast week Halifax and HSBC increased their fixed rates, with rates near or over 5% depending on the LTV [loan-to-value]. The pressure is on for homeowners to ensure they are quick to secure a rate if they are approaching the end of the their fixed rate or in the midst of a purchase application.\u201d More than 2,000 workers are set to lose their jobs at delivery giant Tuffnells as the business fell into administration. Administrators are set to keep just 128 of the business\u2019s staff after being appointed on Monday, PA Media report. The Sheffield-headquartered company has 33 depots across the UK, and handles logistics to more than 160 destinations around the world. The business has been under pressure since it was taken into independent ownership in 2020, hit by Covid-19 pressures, rising costs and increased competition, administrators at Interpath said. Rick Harrison, managing director at Interpath Advisory, said: \u201cUnfortunately, the highly competitive nature of the UK parcel delivery market, coupled with significant inflation across the company\u2019s fixed-cost base in recent times, has resulted in the company experiencing intense pressure on cashflow. \u201cToday\u2019s news will be particularly devastating for Tuffnells\u2019 2,200 dedicated employees. \u201cRegrettably, with deliveries suspended and with no prospect of them resuming in the immediate term, we have had to make the majority of staff redundant. \u201cOur utmost priority will be to provide all those impacted with every support they need in making claims to the Redundancy Payments Office and minimising disruption to customers. Media watchdog Ofcom has confirmed that it is a victim of a cyber-attack by hackers linked to a notorious Russian ransomware group, the BBC reports. Confidential data about some companies regulated by Ofcom, and personal information from 412 employees was downloaded during the mass hack. A number of firms, including British Airways, the BBC and Boots, have been affected by the software breach. Ofcom said it had \u201cswiftly\u201d alerted all the companies that it regulates, and also referred the matter to the data and privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). Mortgage rates are continuing to rise today, industry data snows. The Daily Mail reports that average mortgage rates are closing in on 6% for a two-year fixed deal today - while the number of products available has fallen again. They say: The average rate on a new two-year was today at 5.86 per cent - up from 5.83 per cent last Friday, 5.72 per cent last Monday and 5.33 per cent a month ago. Meanwhile a five-year deal was at an average of 5.51 per cent today - up from 5.48 per cent yesterday, 5.41 per cent last Monday and 5.03 per cent a month ago. The data provided by financial experts at Moneyfacts also revealed the number of mortgage products available stood at 4,952 today, falling from 5,056 last Friday - although up from 4,686 last Monday. However it was down from 5,300 a month ago. Mortgage broker Justin Moy says there is still time to get a Santander mortgage on current rates, if you\u2019re quick\u2026. On Santander temporarily pulling its mortgage deals for new borrowers off sale, a spokesperson says: \u201cWe continually review our products in light of changing market conditions. As we prepare for a relaunch of a full range of mortgage products from Wednesday morning, we will not be accepting new applications via intermediary and online channels temporarily from this evening. Our product transfer range remains fully available and customers who have already applied will not be impacted.\u201d The Bank of England looks certain to raise rates by another quarter of a percent, from 4.5% to 4.75%, when it meets next week. So says Rupert Thompson, chief economist at Kingswood, who predicts that a further couple of hikes likely to follow over subsequent months. Thompson says: The recent ratcheting up of rate expectations has fed through to mortgages and much of the pain from higher rates has still to be felt on the housing market. Still, the surprise if anything so far has been how resilient house prices have been. The Nationwide index shows prices down only 2.5% from their peak last summer and the Halifax index 4.3% lower. To put this in perspective, according to both indices, this still leaves prices up 20% or so on their levels at the start of 2020. Santander is the latest major bank to announce it is temporarily pulling its mortgage deals for new borrowers off sale as the turmoil in the home loans market shows no signs of abating. My colleague Rupert Jones reports: Days after HSBC temporarily pulled down the shutters, Santander told mortgage brokers that it would stop accepting new applications for its \u201cnew business\u201d residential and buy-to-let fixed and tracker rates at 7.30pm on Monday, with deals not becoming available again until Wednesday 14 June. The move applies to applications made via mortgage brokers and online, though Santander said new deals for existing customers remained available, and that those people who applied before 7.30pm would not be affected. But there is more positive news for borrowers, Rupert adds: TSB will on Tuesday reduce the cost of some of its new deals by up to 0.4 percentage points. HSBC\u2019s UK boss has insisted the bank is \u201ctrying to limit the pain\u201d from rising mortgage prices. Ian Stuart told Sky News that 300,000 of HSBC\u2019s customers are coming off fixed rate deals this year, so will be hit by the increase in rates. Stuart says: \u201cIf you took a mortgage maybe two years ago or five years ago, myself included, you will come off a mortgage rate of around 1.5% and your new mortgage is going to cost something closer to 5%. \u201cThis is not a subject to be flippant on. This is a very, very important topic in UK society today.\u201d Stuart criticised some of the media reporting of HSBC\u2019s decision to temporarily stop selling \u201cnew business\u201d residential and buy-to-let products to mortgage brokers late last week. He says HSBC felt a significant spike in demand for mortgages last Thursday, so it paused \u201cfor a couple of hours\u201d, with mortgages now available again. Stuart says: I apologise to the brokers. I\u2019m sorry if we let you down. We could not cope with that demand. But I\u2019m not going to apologise for trying to look after our loyal customers in what I think is a very difficult sitution with rates continuing to increase. When asked if he was chasing market share for mortgages, Stuart pointed out that quite a lot of market headed HSBC\u2019s way last week anyway. Borrowers are being warned that mortgage rates are set to rise further, as turbulence continues to hit the market. David Hollingworth, of broker London &amp; Country, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the pace of change in rates has been \u201cpretty relentless\u201d. Lenders have been removing products from the market and replacing them with new offerings at typically higher rates. Hollingworth explained that a couple of weeks ago, the best rates for five-year fixed mortgages were around 4%. Today, a couple of deals are available around 4.5% but most are at 4.75%. Hollingworth predicts: I think this week is going to bring more of the same. Hollingworth explains that mortgage rates are rising because bank borrowing costs are increasing (as the financial markets expect UK interest rates to kee rising). But, lenders are also finding that the market is shifting around them, as rivals push up their own rates. Hollingworth said: Therefore there\u2019s a tidal wave of business coming their way\u2026..they need to protect service, and borrowers of course are rushing to grab a rate now. We\u2019re back to that phase where you can\u2019t hand around if you\u2019re looking at a fixed rate. Hollingworth is also hopeful that rates will \u2018find a level\u2019, meaning things start to calm down in the near future.\u201d More than 15,000 easyJet passengers have been hit by flight cancellations due to severe weather, PA Media reports. The airline axed 54 flights scheduled to take off or depart from Gatwick Airport on Sunday because of storms, with a further 55 grounded on Monday. Gatwick warned that more storms are expected on Monday. An easyJet spokeswoman said: \u201cThunderstorms in the Gatwick area which restricted the number of arrivals and departures on Sunday unfortunately resulted in disruption at London Gatwick Airport, including some diversions and cancellations which is having a knock-on impact this morning as a number of aircraft are out of position. \u201cWe are doing all possible to minimise the impact on our customers, providing those on cancelled flights with options to rebook or receive a refund as well as hotel accommodation and meals where required. \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of customers and crew is easyJet\u2019s highest priority and, while this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused.\u201d Brexit, rising corporate taxes, growth concerns and political turmoil are causing US businesses to lose confidence in the UK as a place to invest, a new report shows. The latest Transatlantic Confidence Index has found that US companies\u2019 confidence in the UK business environment dropped for a third year in a row. The survey, from BritishAmerican Business, the transatlantic trade association, and management consultancy Bain &amp; Company, found: \u2026A continuing toll from Brexit on American business sentiment towards the UK is aggravated by US firms\u2019 anxieties over political stability, economic growth prospects and corporate tax. On the Index\u2019s 1 to 10 scale, the average business confidence rating for the UK dropped by almost a full point, to 6.5 for 2023 \u2013 which is nearly double the half-point decline to 7.3 in 2022\u2019s results. Following the signing of the Windsor Framework agreement between the UK and EU in March, survey respondents acknowledged improvements in the UK-EU relationship. Confidence in this measure rose to 5.6 this year, up from 5.1 in 2021. Jonathan Frick, partner at Bain &amp; Company in London, said the transatlantic economic relationship and wider UK-US partnership are \u201ccrucial anchors for the security and prosperity of both nations\u201d, adding: \u201cWhile it\u2019s heartening to see the continuing vitality of the relationship between Britain and America, our findings also show important challenges, on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially in respect of US investors\u2019 confidence in the UK. These are a call to action for both governments as well as businesses in the two countries to work together proactively to further strengthen our transatlantic ties.\u201d In the financial markets, the pound has hit a one-month high against the US dollar today. Sterling has been lifted by hopes that Britain\u2019s economy will avoid a recession, and expectations that interest rates will keep rising for longer in the UK than the US. The pound hit $1.2595 this morning, the highest since 11 May, taking some support from Jonathan Haskel\u2019s warning that future rate rises can\u2019t be ruled out. The CBI has revised up its growth forecasts for the UK this year, from a 0.4% decline to show growth of 0.4% this year. But, the CBI adds that 2023 will be challenging for households and businesses. For the first time since the recession of the early 1980s, it expects real household incomes \u2013 a measure of living standards \u2013 to fall for two successive years. 2023 will remain challenging for the CBI too, despite the embattled lobby group winning a crucial confidence vote last week. Bloomberg reports that the CBI has been abandoned by major sponsors of its annual conference, saying: Recruitment specialist Hays Plc sponsored the conference for about a decade but has since quit the CBI and won\u2019t take part this year, a spokesperson said. The other leading sponsor, Accenture Plc, terminated its membership in April. Rishi Sunak may have wanted to talk tech today, as he spoke warmly of the entreprenurial attitude in California today, and the UK\u2019s pioneering role in the Industrial Revolution. Asked about how to grow UK tech, Sunak says: Fundamentally it requires entrepreneurs to just keep going, to be not content with building the \u00a3100 million business and then the \u00a31 billion business but just to keep growing. \u201cThat, I found in California, is very much the attitude, the sky is the limit. Everyone thinks they can create a 100 billion-dollar company and actually changing that culture is tough for government to do.\u201d He also cited his push to make everyone learn maths until the age of 18 (despite criticism of the plan), saying the UK is currently an outlier on this issue. But he couldn\u2019t avoid the current political turmoil. He was asked at London Tech Week about former PM Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list, published hours before Johnson stropped out of parliament after receiving the privileges committee findings into the Partygate scandal. Sunak says that he refused a request from his predecessor to intervene, saying: \u201cBoris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn\u2019t prepared to do, because I didn\u2019t think it was right. That request was either to overrule the House of Lords Appointments Commission (which did not support eight of Johnson\u2019s nominations for peerages) or to make promises to people, Sunak says, adding: \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared to do that because I didn\u2019t think it was right, and if people don\u2019t like that, then tough.\u201d This wins some clapping, with Sunak adding: When I got this job, I said I was going to do things differently because I wanted to change politics, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Our Politics Live blog has more details: Asked about the opportunities of AI, Sunak suggests it could allow a \u2018personalised tutor\u2019 for students, and also reduce teachers\u2019 workload, and help with marking and lesson planning. Rishi Sunak then tells an anecdote about how he recently saw a letter from Charles Babbage, the inventor, from the 1830s thanking the then-chancellor for funding his Difference Engine. That letter, in a British Library collection, showed that the government broke with convention by funding this cutting-edge idea, Sunak says. That was a decisive moment. The British government broke with the conventions of the time, and for a decade backed this breakthrough technology. He\u2019s determined that future researchers in 200 years will find evidence that the current government, and the tech sector, met the current opportunities with the same \u201ccourage, vision and determination\u201d. Babbage\u2019s largest project, the Difference Engine no. 1, was a machine intended to save the government money by preventing critical errors in tables calculated and copied by hand. Effectively it would have worked as a calculator. However, the story doesn\u2019t have a happy ending, as the Whipple Museum reminds us. Funding was officially cut off in 1842 at which time he [Babbage] had spent over \u00a317,000, ten times as much as originally intended. Somewhat embarrassingly, the British government purchased a difference engine based on Babbage\u2019s original design made by Swedes Georg and Edvard Schuetz, which they demonstrated at the World\u2019s Fair in 1855. Difference Engine no. 1 remained unfinished in Babbage\u2019s lifetime, as he moved onto an even more challenging idea, the Analytical Engine, which actually included its own memory. Sunak then announces the launch of HSBC Innovation Banking, following the rescue of tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. This new unit will focus on banking services to the startup, investor, and wider tech community. On AI, Sunak then pledges to \u201clead\u201d on the issue at home, where the government is working with artificial intelligence firms\u2026. \u2026and abroad, by hosting a global AI summit later this year (which he compares to the COP summits on climate change). Prime minister Rishi Sunak is speaking at London Tech Week now. Sunak says we are at at \u201cmoment of huge opportunity\u201d, with the \u201ctechnonic plates of technology\u201d are shifting (he cites AI, quantum computing, synthetic biology and semiconductors\u201d. We must act, and act quickly, if we want not only to retain our position as one of the world\u2019s tech capitals, but to go even further and make this the best place in the world to start, grow and invest in tech businesses. Sunak says he feels a sense of urgency about this, as it can help grow the economy. He then suggests that artificial intelligence could surpass industrial revolution in the speed and breadth of the changes it will bring, as he pitches the UK as the home of artificial intelligence (AI) regulation (see earlier post). He then pitches the UK\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d as an asset when trying to attract tech investment (after a weekend where his government came under pressure following the resignation of Boris Johnson, and two other MPs). Sunak says: Do you trust the people in charge to really get what you\u2019re trying to do. With this government and with me as your prime minister, you can. In the travel sector, the boss of Heathrow has pledged that strikes by security guards at Heathrow are unlikely to cause flight cancellations. More than 2,000 members of the Unite union will walk out for 31 days from June 24 in a dispute over pay. For the first time, security officers based at Terminal 3 will join their colleagues from Terminal 5 and campus security who have already taken industrial action. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said that having kept running through earlier strikes over Easter, the airport is well-prepared. \u201cWe have delivered excellent service to passengers, with no cancellations, over eight days of strikes on the busiest days in May, and do not anticipate cancellations as a result of strikes during the summer holiday getaway.\u201d Last week, Mr Holland-Kaye urged Unite to put the airport\u2019s latest proposal of a 10% pay increase and \u00a31,150 lump sum to a vote of its members. He claimed: \u201cWe know that most of our colleagues would accept the offer that we have on the table\u201d. Rishi Sunak will tell technology leaders he wants to make the UK both the intellectual and the geographical home of artificial intelligence (AI) regulation. In a speech to open London Tech Week on Monday, the Prime Minister is set to say that the \u201cextraordinary\u201d possibility of AI advances must be carried out \u201csafely\u201d as he positions Britain as a potential home of a global regulator. It comes after the Conservative Party leader used a trip to the US last week to announce that the UK will host the first global summit on AI safety. The Prime Minister, in pre-briefed comments ahead of his appearance at the 10th London Tech Week, will say: \u201cAlready we\u2019ve seen AI help the paralysed to walk and discover superbug-killing antibiotics \u2014 and that\u2019s just the beginning. \u201cThe possibilities are extraordinary. But we must \u2014 and we will \u2014 do it safely. \u201cI want to make the UK not just the intellectual home, but the geographical home of global AI safety regulation.\u201d Interest in AI across politics has soared (as in the financial markets), as fears grow that the technology\u2019s rapid advancement could spin out of control. The UK government hope to persuade other countries to use the UK as a base for a new global AI regulator, but experts have warned that success is unlikely\u2026. Sticky UK wage growth means no rate cuts for the Bank of England until this time next year, analysts at ING have predicted this morning. In a new research note, ING say that last month\u2019s \u2018shock inflation reading\u2019 of 8.7% sent Bank of England expectations soaring. ING believe that the UK could be closer to the peak in interest rates than markets are assuming [the City is anticipating four more rate hikes from 4.5% to 5.5%]. They say: A 25bp rate hike in June could easily be the last \u2013 if not, in August \u2013 and it will depend on how many more CPI [inflation] surprises we get through the summer. But, the \u201cslow downtrend in wage growth\u201d suggests that rate cuts are unlikely to be a story for this year. ING adds: We\u2019ve pencilled in the first cut for around this time next year, though eventually, we do expect a series of rate cuts that take Bank Rate down to the 3% area \u2013 some distance further than markets are currently pricing. Homeowners are being hit with a \u201cTory mortgage penalty\u201d of \u00a37,000 per year, with interest rates triple what they were two years ago, the Labour party have warned. Analysis by Labour suggests the average homeowner is forking out an extra \u00a3150 every week since what officials called the \u201ckamikaze mini-Budget\u201d in the autumn. It means the average household with a mortgage now pays \u00a3223 a week in mortgage interest payments \u2013 an increase of \u00a37,000 per year, party officials said. Labour said those with a 75% loan to value (LTV) ratio mortgage faced average interest rates of up to 4.63% in April. The same deal had an interest rate of 1.49% in April 2021, said the party \u2013 a third of what it increased to 24 months later. Pat McFadden, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has blamed what he called the \u201creckless economic gamble\u201d taken by the Conservatives during September\u2019s mini-Budget. \u201cThis Tory mortgage penalty has increased the cost of home ownership by thousands of pounds a year, causing huge worry for families, while putting the prospect of owning a home further out of reach for many others. \u201cRishi Sunak might want to forget the economic misery the Conservatives have inflicted, but the public can\u2019t forget about it as their outgoings soar. \u201cLabour will make our economy stronger and more secure, and stop working people paying the price for 13 years of Tory failure.\u201d Economists at KPMG are also warning that UK interest rates will continue to rise this year, due to stubborn inflation. Their latest economic forecasts, released this morning, show a brighter growth picture -but high inflation for longer than hoped. KPMG say: Given the latest surveys, we no longer expect a recession in the UK, but growth is forecast to remain sluggish by historical standards. Inflation is on the way down, but the pace of moderation is slower than we previously thought. This will likely necessitate further interest rate increases and more pain to come for borrowers. The upside revision to our forecast means no plain sailing. Risks remain skewed to the downside, with ongoing fragilities potentially yet to be fully uncovered. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a slightly stronger momentum for the UK economy but risks are still elevated on the downside. A stickier inflation will see monetary policy tightening even further, increasing the risk of unwelcome side effects among other potential headwinds.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK borrowers face further interest rate hikes this year as the fight against inflation continues. A Bank of England policymaker is warning this morning that the UK central bank may need to make \u201cfurther increases\u201d to borrowing costs as it tries to ease the cost of living crisis. Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, suggests that more than one increase in interest rates may be needed. Writing in The Scotsman today, Haskel says the BoE mustn\u2019t allow inflation to become \u2018embedded\u2019 in the economy, saying: We are monitoring indicators of inflation momentum and persistence closely. My own view is that it\u2019s important we continue to lean against the risks of inflation momentum, and therefore that further increases in interest rates cannot be ruled out. As difficult as our current circumstances are, embedded inflation would be worse. Expectations of higher interest rates has caused turbulence in the mortgage market in recent weeks. Ian Stuart, CEO of HSBC UK Bank, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that inflation is looking sticky, and probably won\u2019t fall \u201cquite as fast\u201d as hoped. That means that borrowing costs are unlikely to start falling again soon. Stuart explains: Well, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But\u2026. inflation is not falling as quickly as a lot of people have predicted. So as long as that is the case, then our house view is that rates will probably increase a little bit more and will probably stay a little bit higher for longer. Bank of England base rate is currently 4.5%, the highest level since 2008. The money markets are anticipating that rates could hit 5.5% by the end of the year, meaning people who must remortgage their loans face higher repayment costs. Stuart says: So, not the mortgage news we\u2019d be looking for. He doesn\u2019t believe rates will fall back to 1%, and warns that rates won\u2019t start to fall until inflation is much lower than it is today (it was 8.7% in April). Stuart explained that HSBC was forced to \u2018put a pause on business\u2019 coming in from brokers last Thursday, due to a supply and demand issue as people tried to secure mortgages. The Nationwide Building Society raised its mortgage rates last week, adding to the pressure on the market. New analysis suggests that around 2.6 million households with a mortgage could have to pay thousands of pounds more in repayments next year. The Times reports today: City figures said the mortgage market was going through a \u201ccomplete reset\u201d and that only a third of borrowers who are on cheap fixed-term deals had come off them so far. Analysis by Capital Economics found that a third of such households, equivalent to 3.2 million, are paying interest rates of 3 per cent or more. By the end of next year that will have risen to 5.8 million as the impact of higher interest rates passes through to the market. Also coming up today London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II Centre is hosting London Tech Week, the 10th gathering of the UK\u2019s largest technology event. PM Rishi Sunak, chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Chloe Smith are attending, as Britain pitches itself as a tech superpower and \u201cthe best place in the world to invest\u201d. Asia Pacific (APAC) investors with over \u00a3100bn of funds will be there, the government reports, and could put money into fintech, clean tech, life sciences and Artificial Intelligence firms. An \u2018elevator pitch\u2019 will be run at the London Eye, where 25 tech firms will have 30 minutes to pitch their latest innovations to investors before their pods circle back to the ground\u2026..

Since we only have the bookies\u2019 word for it, it is, of course, entirely possible that the \u201cgamble\u201d on Desert Crown in the latter part of last week was more of a defensive manoeuvre on their part and involved very little actual cash. But even before it emerged that Richard Kingscote, the colt\u2019s Derby-winning rider, had been \u201cjocked off\u201d in favour of Dettori, the hype machine was at full throttle, as rumours emerged of a scintillating exercise gallop by the four-year-old in Newmarket on Wednesday. So some punters, at least, are surely now in the unfortunate position that sees them heading into Ascot week already in the red. The rest of us, meanwhile, have had a useful and timely reminder of the extent to which markets can react to a jockey booking - and a Dettori-booking in particular - ahead of his swansong at the Royal meeting. Everyone who backs horses on even a fairly casual basis will have a view on how much difference a jockey can, or might, make. For some, it is a relatively minor factor, and for others, a point of primary significance when deciding whether or not to have a bet. And this range of opinion is, for the most part, reflected by the prices on offer. A handful of riders throughout the sport\u2019s history, though, have had an extreme - and often disproportionate - effect on the markets, and Dettori joined a list that includes legendary jockeys like Fred Archer, Sir Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott on the extraordinary afternoon at Ascot in 1996 when he went straight through a seven-race card. He also had the layers peering into a very deep abyss at the Royal meeting four years ago, when he rode the first four winners on Gold Cup day before finishing second by a head in the Britannia Handicap. But with the possible exception of Saeed Suhail, Desert Crown\u2019s owner, no-one would ever consider Dettori to be \u201cunbeatable\u201d at Royal Ascot, and his miserable run of form and fortune at last year\u2019s Royal meeting is also hard to overlook. Dettori struggled to get a blindfold off Lord North before the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes, then found trouble in running \u2013 for the second year in a row \u2013 on Stradivarius in the Gold Cup, and while the apparent split with Gosden was soon mended, he will be desperate to avoid any similar mishaps next week. It could also be pointed out that while Dettori\u2019s 30 wins at the Royal meeting in the last decade have taken him to 77 in all over the course of his career, and second only to Piggott in the all-time list, Ryan Moore has ridden no fewer than 55 in the same period. Moore is now on 73 in all, and if he does not overhaul Dettori this year, he looks sure to do so within a season or two at most. With Dettori now several months into his pre-retirement tour, however, and with big-race wins in the 2,000 Guineas and Oaks already in the bank, the likelihood is that none of this will matter once the meeting is underway, not least if he can get off to a flying start on Tuesday, when his book of rides is due to include Inspiral, the second-favourite, in the opening Queen Anne Stakes, and Chaldean, the 2,000 Guineas winner and current favourite, in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. The current betting, after the scratching of Desert Crown, rates Dettori as the 7-4 second favourite behind Moore (at 5-4) to be the meeting\u2019s leading rider, while William Buick, the current champion on the Flat, is a 4-1 shot. Oisin Murphy, who won the award when he last rode at the meeting two seasons ago, is also a live contender at around 12-1. It promises to be a fascinating subplot as the meeting unfolds, and Dettori could scarcely be in better form going into the week. Few would argue that a glorious farewell at the Royal meeting would be a no more than Dettori deserves. But 7-4 to be the top jockey? Punters who back with their head and not their heart may well be looking elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/12/tucker-carlson-twitter-show-fox-cease-desist", "primaryCategory": "media", "title": "Tucker Carlson \u2018will not be silenced\u2019 as Fox News seeks to ban Twitter show", "lead": "Fox News has reportedly sent a cease and desist letter to its former host but his lawyer says show will go on", "author": "Martin Pengelly", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:21:13Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080259", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/391cc5257e512f42de7f6321851b9ff11af45034/0_0_2227_1335/500.jpg", "body": "Tucker Carlson\u2019s lawyer says he \u201cwill not be silenced by anyone\u201d after it was reported that Fox News had sent the primetime host it fired a letter demanding he cease and desist presenting a new show on Twitter. \u201cDoubling down on the most catastrophic programming decision in the history of the cable news industry, Fox is now demanding that Tucker Carlson be silent until after the 2024 election,\u201d lawyer Harmeet Dhillon told Axios, which first reported the Fox letter. \u201cTucker will not be silenced by anyone \u2026 He is a singularly important voice on matters of public interest in our country, and will remain so.\u201d Dhillon is a prominent Republican attorney who recently failed in an attempt to lead the GOP national committee. Fox fired Carlson in April, shortly after reaching a $787.5m settlement in a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the broadcast of Donald Trump\u2019s lies about electoral fraud in his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. Fox has called reports that claim Carlson\u2019s firing was linked to the settlement \u201ccategorically false\u201d. Dominion has said the settlement was closed six days before Carlson was ousted. Axios said the cease and desist letter, marked \u201cnot for publication\u201d, came as Fox continued to pay Carlson, whose contract runs to the end of next year. Other outlets confirmed the letter. Lawyers for Carlson have said Fox is seeking to deny his first amendment right to free speech. A Fox spokesperson did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment. Carlson debuted his new show, Tucker on Twitter, last week. His first 10-minute monologue concerned Ukraine and Russia, media coverage of that conflict and complaints about coverage of other issues including UFOs, Jeffrey Epstein and 9/11. By Monday, Twitter said the first video had been viewed nearly 115m times. The second show, 12-and-a-half minutes long, was entitled \u201cCling to your taboos!\u201d and included complaints about affirmative action, supposed acceptance of child abuse and the prosecution of January 6 rioters. By Monday, Twitter said it had reached nearly 55m views. Carlson\u2019s producer, Justin Wells, tweeted: \u201cNext Episode of Tucker on Twitter coming Tuesday: Tucker\u2019s response to the indictment of President Donald Trump.\u201d Axios said Carlson planned to vary the content of his show, with \u201cbig names lined up\u201d to appear.

The billionaire media tycoon and former AC Milan owner who entered politics at the head of his own Forza Italia in the 1990s as the traditional parties of the right collapsed led three governments between 1994 and 2011 and succeeded in making a comeback in 2017 despite a career tainted by sex scandals, allegations of corruption and a tax fraud conviction. He died at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, where he had spent six weeks this spring undergoing treatment for a lung infection linked to a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia before being readmitted. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, whose governing coalition includes Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia as a junior member, said on Monday: \u201cSilvio Berlusconi was above all a fighter. He was a man who was never afraid to stand up for his convictions, and it was exactly that courage and determination that made him one of the most influential men in the history of Italy.\u201d The two had recently disagreed over the war in Ukraine and Berlusconi\u2019s friendship with Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who had sent him bottles of vodka for his most recent birthday. On Monday, the Russian embassy in Rome described Berlusconi as a great statesman and visionary, while Putin, in what appeared to be a deeply personal statement, said he was a \u201cdear person, a true friend\u201d. Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister, described Berlusconi as \u201ca great friend and a great Italian man\u201d. Italy\u2019s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, described Berlusconi\u2019s death as \u201ca great, enormous pain\u201d. \u201cHe leaves a huge void because he was great. An era is over, an era is closing. I loved him very much. Goodbye Silvio.\u201d The former prime minister\u2019s funeral is to be held on Wednesday in Milan \u2013 a city deeply associated with Berlusconi \u2013 when Italy will also mark a national day of mourning. Supporters draped in the flags of Forza Italia and AC Milan, which he owned between 1986 and 2107, gathered on Monday outside the Milan hospital where he died. Born in Milan in 1936 to a middle-class family, Berlusconi began his business career in property development before going on to found Mediaset, Italy\u2019s largest commercial broadcaster. In 1994 Forza Italia was founded and Berlusconi became the first prime minister to be elected without previously having held a government office. His second term in office, between 2001 and 2006, was the longest served by any Italian leader since the second world war. He returned to power in 2008 but was forced to resign in 2011 amid an acute debt crisis and facing allegations he had hosted \u201cbunga bunga\u201d sex parties with underage girls, something he denied. He was acquitted on appeal on all charges related to the parties, but was convicted of tax fraud in late 2012, for which he served his year-long sentence doing part-time community service at a residential home in Milan. His ban on running for office was lifted in time for the general elections in 2018, when Forza Italia ran in coalition with the League and Brothers of Italy but the parties fell short of the 40% required to govern. In 2019, Berlusconi won a seat in the European parliament, and in general elections in October 2022 his party returned to power in a coalition led by Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy. Berlusconi was also elected as a senator. Often criticised for his arrogance, sometimes obscene language, chauvinism and blurring the lines between business and politics, his rivals, too, united in paying tribute. Italy\u2019s former prime minister Matteo Renzi described Berlusconi as a history-maker. \u201cMany loved him, many hated him; today everyone must recognise that his impact on political life but also on economic, sporting and television life was unprecedented.\u201d Karima El Mahroug, an Italian-Moroccan woman and former dancer, known as Ruby, who attended Berlusconi\u2019s \u201cbunga bunga\u201d parties wrote \u201cFarewell, President\u201d over an image of a broken heart after the death of the media mogul. One of the first to react was the former European Commission president Romano Prodi, perhaps Berlusconi\u2019s bitterest political foe. \u201cWe represented different and opposing worlds, but our rivalry never turned into sentiments of animosity on a personal level, and the debate remained within the sphere of mutual respect,\u201d Prodi said. The secretary of the centre-left Democratic party, Elly Schlein, expressed her party\u2019s \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d. \u201cEverything has divided us and divides us from his political vision, but the human respect to a person who was a protagonist of our country\u2019s history remains,\u201d she said. \u201cDeepest condolences from the Democratic party.\u2019\u2019 Pope Francis sent a telegram of condolences to Berlusconi\u2019s family voicing \u201cheartfelt participation in the mourning for the loss of a protagonist of Italian political life, who held public responsibilities with energetic temperament.\u201d Nicknamed Il Cavaliere (the knight), Berlusconi was often considered the \u201ckingmaker\u201d in Italian politics. In 2016, he had surgery to replace a faulty aortic valve, and was admitted to hospital with Covid in September 2020. He had lingering complications related to the virus, an experience he described as \u201cthe worst of my life\u201d. He married twice, and was in a relationship with Francesca Pascale, 37, for seven years before a relationship with 33-year-old Marta Fascina, an MP with Forza Italia with whom he had a \u201csymbolic marriage\u201d in March 2022. He is survived by five children. The world of sport also paid tribute. \u201cI have lost my brilliant friend,\u201d said the former football coach Arrigo Sacchi, whose Milan team won the Champions League in consecutive years. Franco Baresi, a former Milan footballer, said: \u201cI feel more alone now. He was like a father to me, a unique president who was affectionate to everyone.\u201d Berlusconi left AC Milan ownership in 2017 and bought the Monza football club, taking it from Italy\u2019s second division to the top flight. A statement from Monza said: \u201cForever with us. A void that can never be filled. Thanks for everything, president.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/12/cleopatra-60th-anniversary-elizabeth-taylor-richard-burton", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "Cleopatra at 60: the expensive epic that almost tanked a studio", "lead": "The notoriously overpriced biopic, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, carried an infamous legacy but is it any good?", "author": "Guy Lodge", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:11:23Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080262", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/029ea7c2590d58185772ed1edc1a9262b1e048d8/0_158_1864_1118/500.jpg", "body": "As I prepared to write on the 60th anniversary of Cleopatra, I asked a few friends and relatives if they had ever seen it. Some had, but more hadn\u2019t: life, even or perhaps especially for the well-versed cinephile, is short, and four-hour-plus Hollywood follies with steadily mouldering reputations quite reasonably aren\u2019t high on everyone\u2019s catch-up list. But more than one person told me that they weren\u2019t actually sure: \u201cI definitely feel like I have,\u201d said one film writer, citing the reams of well-publicised lore on its tortured production and imposing industry legacy, the popularly cemented visual iconography of Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s lavishly eyelinered Egyptian queen, and the film\u2019s status as the origin of the most glamorously turbulent romance in showbiz history. \u201cBut have I actually watched the whole thing? If so, I\u2019ve forgotten all the connecting tissue between its most famous images.\u201d It was a response that to me captured the odd cultural status of a film that is at once a vast Hollywood behemoth and a dust-gathering curio, one that pretty much everybody knows something about, but precious few who weren\u2019t alive for its noisy initial release have seen. I explicitly remember seeing it as a teenager, because doing so required some complicated VHS-era organisation: when it was broadcast at an inconveniently late hour on South African TV, I watched the first half-hour so the rest could fit on to a four-hour video cassette, and then dutifully trudged through it in instalments. For years afterward, I maintained that the film was significantly better than its musty reputation \u2013 though perhaps at some level I was simply justifying to myself the time and effort spent on watching the damn thing. And like my uncertain colleague, whether he had seen it or not, I too formed few memories of the dramatic specifics on either side of its most extravagant set pieces. Revisiting it last week, it was clear enough why. Scripted, often quite literately but most inconsistently, by a hotchpotch of writers that included Lawrence Durrell, with eventual director Joseph L Mankiewicz finally claiming chief credit, Cleopatra rambles in a manner few blockbusters this expensive \u2013 $31.1m in 1963, over $300m adjusted for inflation \u2013 would dare today. It\u2019s a more loquacious film than you might guess or recall: Mankiewicz, a director whose best work (All About Eve, The Ghost and Mrs Muir, A Letter to Three Wives) thrives on smaller-scale verbal tension and sparring, has immense faith in the power of conversation and argument to enliven Roman history, and to animate the two marriages \u2013 Cleopatra\u2019s chilly, calculated arrangement with Caesar, and her more passionate union with Mark Antony \u2013 that essentially form the film\u2019s two vast halves. As producers shovelled money into such spangly, jaw-dropping centrepieces as Cleopatra\u2019s arrival in Rome \u2013 an exquisitely choreographed and costumed ceremonial parade that puts certain real-world coronations to shame \u2013 you can\u2019t help sensing that Mankiewicz would rather have made a chamber piece. The upside of this focus on human smallness amid all the spectacle is a jagged quippiness: the chief surprise of the film, to the uninitiated, is how archly funny it is. \u201cYou dare ask the proconsul of the Roman Empire,\u201d Antony bristles, when the queen instructs him to kneel before her. \u201cI asked it of Caesar, I demand it of you,\u201d she purrs in response. Later, when he professes a love for \u201calmost all Greek things\u201d, her comeback is as delicious as it is inevitable: \u201cAs an almost all-Greek thing myself, I\u2019m flattered.\u201d Still, there\u2019s an awful lot of hot air here, and Mankiewicz might have shed some of it by fudging a date or two. As the film lumbers rather methodically through history, beginning with Julius Caesar\u2019s victory at Pharsalus and arrival in Egypt, winding languidly to Cleopatra\u2019s snake-assisted death, and taking in assorted military battles and personal contretemps along the way, the film\u2019s grasp of the facts is surprisingly solid in a genre given to radically rewriting the record. But its conscientiousness in this regard also yields a torpid evenness of pacing, a dull resistance to climax. Rest your eyes for 20 minutes at any point in the proceedings and you\u2019ll miss a fair bit of incident, but no real gear changes, and you can carry right on. The iconoclastic Thai auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul has long claimed his films are built to accommodate intervals of sleep; so, in its way, is Cleopatra, though perhaps less by design. The film\u2019s compensating pleasures, then, alongside its ripeness of dialogue and performance \u2013 Rex Harrison\u2019s brittle, prissy Caesar landed one of the film\u2019s somewhat grudgingly given nine Oscar nominations, and deservedly so \u2013 are entangled with its Hollywood mythos. Though the romance between Cleopatra and Antony is as sluggishly dramatised as everything else, the palpable tinderbox chemistry between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton \u2013 then both married to other people \u2013 jolts the film awake; you can\u2019t watch them together and not think of the stars\u2019 affair and the attendant scandal, and that heat folds back into the seduction on screen. Taylor, then halfway between her two Oscars and at the zenith of her stardom, may not be the optimal screen Cleopatra, but neither can you take your eyes off her: her styling may be distinctly 60s-accented, her diction vampishly modern, but there\u2019s a certain historical integrity to casting the untouchable queen of one realm as that of another. When Harrison\u2019s Caesar disrupts her bathing, Taylor mutters, \u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d with a diva\u2019s withering disdain, seemingly directed as much at the galumphing production around her as anything in the world of the film itself. That is as it should be. If Hollywood has since failed to produce another, equivalently high-profile Cleopatra biopic \u2013 even as mooted new versions and appropriate casting debates flare up every few years \u2013 that\u2019s perhaps down to the scarcity of stars of Taylor\u2019s magnitude, supernovas who feel both up to the job and liable to float entirely above it all. Angelina Jolie, this generation\u2019s Taylor proxy, was floated a few years back; even that glitzy prospect failed to materialise. After all, anyone attempting a new Cleopatra has to bear the white-elephant associations that come with the very title: the 1963 film is best remembered as the film that nearly tanked 20th Century Fox, more so than its conflicting/corresponding status as the highest-grossing film of its year. To this day, Cleopatra\u2019s reputation is caught between poles of success and failure, dazzle and dullness, prominence and obscurity: yet for now, at a time when studios will only lavish queen-size budgets on franchisable fantasy, Mankiewicz\u2019s epic remain Hollywood\u2019s last, very wordy, word on its fabulous subject."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/canada-fires-quebec-western-evacuations", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Quebec fires weakened by rain as blazes in western Canada force many to flee", "lead": "More than 14,000 remain under evacuation as nearly 450 fires burned across the country on Sunday, with 220 out of control", "author": "Leyland Cecco in Toronto", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:02:30Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080263", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e34b3b975cf5fd389e50bab5631d298d16770ef4/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Overdue rains and cooler temperatures have given Quebec fire crews a chance to launch their assault on dozens of wildfires, but the reprieve for one part of Canada comes as fires in the west of the country have once again forced residents to flee their homes. The country has been struggling with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d wildfire season, with nearly 450 forest fires across the country on Sunday, 220 of which were burning out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In Quebec, crews are hoping to attack dozens of blazes that have been temporarily weakened by favourable weather. \u201cWe went from a reactive mode to an offensive mode,\u201d Quebec\u2019s forestry minister, Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina, said in a weekend news conference. But more than 14,000 residents remain under evacuation as the mix of domestic and foreign firefighters and Canadian armed forces members tackle the blazes. The 117 wildfires across Quebec underscore the record-breaking nature of the spring fire season that has displaced tens of thousands and choked the air of more than 100 million people in eastern North America. Quebec wildfires have already scorched 740,000 hectares of boreal forest, more than 300 times the average during the spring season over the past decade. In the coming days, nearly 350 firefighters from the EU will join nearly 1,000 personnel already on the frontlines. Nearly 100 firefighters from Spain and 140 from Portugal will arrive in Quebec City on Wednesday. \u201cThere is this solidarity,\u201d Claire Kowalewski, the European Union Emergency Response Coordination Centre\u2019s liaison officer, told the Canadian Press. \u201cToday, unfortunately, it\u2019s Canada that is facing these terrible fires. But last year in Spain, it was also a terrible year.\u201d Despite progress in Quebec, officials in western Canada have watched as new blazes crop up and move dangerously close to populated areas. The Alberta town of Edson was evacuated on Friday for the second time this year after a nearby fire crossed fireguards and moved perilously close to the community. \u201cWe\u2019re in a little bit of a lull right now but we do expect things to progress if the temperatures come up and the winds come up, so we\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d Edson\u2019s mayor, Wade Williams, said in an update on Sunday, telling residents they could not yet return to their homes. Neighbouring British Columbia is also dealing with new fires that have pushed residents from their homes. In the north-eastern pocket of the province, officials warned of \u201cimmediate danger to life safety\u201d and ordered evacuations of the Peace River regional district and the district of Tumbler Ridge. Officials issued new evacuation orders linked to the Donnie Creek fire, which has grown to more than 350,000 hectares in size and broached containment lines constructed by fire crews. On Vancouver Island, a region of the province that typically sees high levels of spring rainfall, a wildfire has severed access to Tofino, a popular beachfront community. The main highway that serves the communities has been closed down for more than a week. The province has created a temporary detour, but the journey adds four hours of travel and traverses forestry service roads. About 4.8 million hectares have burned this year across Canada, the most active start to a wildfire season on record."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/12/i-have-met-boris-johnson-twice-the-ugliness-was-always-obvious-beneath-the-bonhomie", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "I have met Boris Johnson twice.

Perhaps that\u2019ll come back to bite me: it could be important for the historical record. Right now, though, I\u2019m struck by the new consensus that Johnson is an unlikable man, without friends or allies, whose only discernible mark on the universe is a trail of the betrayed and disillusioned. This is now apparently an obvious thing, completely common knowledge among the Boris-watchers who five seconds ago were telling us that he was the most genial man in British politics. A little bit of consistency would be nice, or at the very least some acknowledgment that they\u2019re now saying something different from what they said before. But never mind that, because it\u2019s also a relief. It\u2019s quite discombobulating when opinion is united on the amiability of a man who you can see, from a distance and close up, and at every proximity in between, is not amiable. The first time I met Johnson was at a Spectator lunch in 1999, shortly after he had become editor. Magazines had dining rooms then, or maybe they still do; I haven\u2019t been invited to one of these things since the time I went to a New Statesman lunch and thought \u201cChatham House rules\u201d meant you were allowed to smoke while other people were still eating. I deduced that logically from the fact that as soon as Geoffrey Robinson said it, everyone immediately started smoking. Anyway, I was sitting next to Johnson, and he said, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d There was an unspoken second half to that sentence, which wasn\u2019t: \u201cWe\u2019re rightwing and you\u2019re leftwing.\u201d I was just a kid writing on the Evening Standard then and nobody knew which wing I was on. It was: \u201cYou don\u2019t sound posh and you\u2019re not pretty, so \u2026 why are you here?\u201d I said: \u201cYou tell me \u2013 you invited me,\u201d which ended the exchange, but it turned into an existential question. Why was I there? It was a room full of sycophants, all their attention trained on a man who could generate gales of mirth, despite being \u2013 of this I was as sure as I\u2019d ever been of anything \u2013 not at all funny. Maybe it was time to start asking: \u201cDo I want to hang around supercilious, trivial people I don\u2019t care about, even if there is wine there?\u201d, before saying \u201cyes\u201d to invitations. Almost a decade later, in 2008, Johnson was launching his new Routemaster bus in Flitwick, Bedfordshire. He was fresh from his mayoral victory a few weeks previously, and if I hadn\u2019t met him once before, I\u2019d have said he had ego over-supply; instead I knew that was his default state. \u201cI remember you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wrote that horrible thing about me.\u201d And this was true: in a bid to deter London voters, I had written something horrible about him, drawing entirely on things that he himself had written, which were horrible. I didn\u2019t want to get into a fight with the guy; I wanted to have a go on the bus. So I said: \u201cThat\u2019s journalism,\u201d and that seemed to satisfy him. The day stuck in my mind because I was on the same train back to London as Johnson, and he got mobbed by enthusiastic teenagers. It was, I suppose, proof of concept: he must have that magic quality, whatever you want to call it, charisma, magnetic affability. Sure, Mid Bedfordshire was a constituency that reliably voted for Nadine Dorries, so it was as Tory as they get; nevertheless, aren\u2019t all teenagers supposed to hate Conservative politicians? How had Johnson penetrated their consciousness as a celebrity, rather than a suit? What struck me, watching the interaction, was Johnson\u2019s disgust, palpable beneath the pantomime bonhomie. He really likes votes; I\u2019m not sure how much he likes voters. Anyway, finally, we\u2019re all on the same page: not a fun, likable person \u2013 the opposite. It won\u2019t necessarily mitigate the damage of his next act, but it\u2019s something. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Armed with irresistible charm and determination, Alexis was at the heart of a huge public shift in attitudes towards animals in entertainment in Latin America and leaves a legacy of legislation in many countries. A chance encounter in an Indian restaurant in Brick Lane, London, with Jan Creamer and Tim Phillips, founders of the animal welfare organisation Animal Defenders International, saw him recruited by ADI in 2003 as an undercover investigator. Despite Alexis turning up hours late for his first meeting in ADI\u2019s west London offices, it was the start of a 20-year-long working relationship and friendship. Alexis began investigating animal circuses touring England, often setting up with his guitar at the entrance to play as audiences arrived, while monitoring the animals. Working out of ADI\u2019s London headquarters, he then operated in Ireland, Spain and Portugal, living for months in a van going from circus to circus getting jobs. He then returned to South America, and the investigation he co-ordinated from there provided the vital evidence of animals being beaten, kicked and punched that drove changes in the law in many countries. Working in secret, he often put himself at risk; workers in one circus broke his leg. Bolivia banned animals in circuses in 2009, but the circuses defied the law. By then ADI\u2019s Latin America manager, Alexis co-ordinated actions in Bolivia, where ADI raided every circus and rescued all the animals. Twenty-nine lions were airlifted to US sanctuaries \u2013 a mission recounted in the award-winning 2013 documentary Lion Ark. Even bigger operations followed in Peru and Colombia, and more than 100 animals were rescued from circuses, with a record-breaking 33 lions on one flight to South Africa, while an operation in Guatemala later rescued 17 lions and tigers. Born in Lima, Peru, to Rosa Limaco and Luciano Canchaya, both teachers, Alexis grew up between Lima and Ayacucho, going from secondary school at Colegio La Merced to study philosophy at San Marcos University from 1991. As a student, he participated in demonstrations against the corruption and autocracy that plagued Peruvian governments. To support himself, Alexis busked on buses, playing the traditional flute. In 1992 he followed his brother Chano to Britain, where they worked together playing music. Alexis continued to travel in the 90s, spending several years in New Zealand. He returned to London in 2000 and worked as a painter in the years before he joined ADI. Alexis is survived by Rosa, Chano (my former husband), his sister, Patricia, and a son, Alejandro, from a short relationship.

Asked about the controversy during a speech at London Tech Week, Sunak defended the decision not to include those names, given that the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac) recommends that any MP recommended for a peerage should stand down to take up the new position within six months. \u201cBoris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn\u2019t prepared to do, because I didn\u2019t think it was right. That was either overrule the Holac committee, or make promises to people,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I wasn\u2019t prepared to do that, so I didn\u2019t think he was right. And if people don\u2019t like that then tough.\u201d Johnson hit back within hours, issuing a statement saying: \u201cRishi Sunak is talking rubbish. To honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac \u2013 but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality.\u201d Johnson\u2019s allies have never forgiven Sunak for his decision to stand down as chancellor last year, a move that helped bring down Johnson as prime minister. Tensions were renewed over recent weeks over both Johnson\u2019s honours list and the decision by the Cabinet Office to withhold some of the former prime minister\u2019s communications from the Covid-19 inquiry. Johnson unexpectedly announced on Friday he would resign as an MP immediately after learning that the House of Commons privileges committee was set to recommend he be suspended for at least 10 days for lying to the house about Partygate. Dorries and Adams also resigned, setting up three difficult byelections for the Conservatives within the next few months. Dorries told the Times on Monday she believed Downing Street had \u201cwithheld information\u201d, leading her to believe incorrectly that she would be given a peerage Sunak\u2019s allies toured the broadcasting studios on Sunday and Monday trying to draw a line under the affair, with both Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, and Michael Gove, the communities secretary, suggesting it was time to move on from the drama of the Johnson years. Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson said on Monday it was \u201centirely untrue\u201d that the prime minister or his No 10 team removed names from Johnson\u2019s peerages list. Downing Street received the final list from Holac, which confirmed at the weekend it had rejected eight of the proposed peerages, in February. Since then, the government has been waiting for the Cabinet Office to finish vetting names put forward for other honours. Initially, the delay was attributed to the large number of honours Johnson wanted to bestow on his close friends and confidants, reportedly including a knighthood for his father, Stanley. Downing Street also defended the work of MPs on the privileges committee, which has been the focus of attacks by Johnson and his allies. Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cThis is a properly set-up committee that the house has voted to carry out their work. The government will in no way traduce or criticise the work of the committee who are doing exactly what parliament has asked them to do.\u201d Asked about reports that committee members had been offered security as a result of the attacks, the spokesperson added: \u201cClearly, any threats against any MPs are completely unacceptable.\u201d Some of Johnson\u2019s parliamentary allies rallied to his cause later in the day, with Jake Berry, the Tory backbencher, telling reporters on Monday: \u201cThe establishment has seen Boris out the door.\u201d However, a wider rebellion by Johnson supporters seemed to have been averted, with little sign that Sharma or others were prepared to resign their seats in protest at Downing Street."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/12/eat-pray-love-author-withdraws-new-russia-set-novel-from-publication-elizabeth-gilbert-the-snow-forest", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "Eat, Pray, Love author withdraws new Russia-set novel from publication", "lead": "Elizabeth Gilbert says now is \u2018not the time for this book to be published\u2019, following anger from Ukrainian readers over The Snow Forest, set in Siberia", "author": "Sarah Shaffi", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:26Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080271", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fe387bb26547fca509bf54d052683c01f9b680bf/1366_0_4504_2702/500.jpg", "body": "Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert is pulling her new novel from publication after Ukrainian readers expressed \u201canger, sorrow, disappointment and pain\u201d about her decision to set a book in Russia. Gilbert\u2019s The Snow Forest is a historical novel set in Siberia, and follows a family of religious Russian fundamentalists who have lived isolated and undetected for 44 years since retreating from the world in the 1930s. When they are discovered in 1980 by a team of Soviet geologists, a scholar and linguist is sent to the family\u2019s home to bridge the chasm between modern existence and their ancient, snow forest life. Gilbert announced just last week that the book would be released in February 2024. However, today she released a video statement on her Instagram account, saying she was \u201cremoving the book from its publication schedule\u201d. She said over the course of the weekend, after announcing the book, she had \u201creceived an enormous, massive outpouring of reactions and responses from my Ukrainian readers expressing anger, sorrow, disappointment and pain about the fact that I would choose to release a book into the world right now, any book, no matter what the subject of it is, that is set in Russia\u201d. \u201cAnd I want to say that I have heard these messages and read these messages and I respect them,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd as a result I\u2019m making a course correction and I\u2019m removing the book from its publication schedule. It is not the time for this book to be published. \u201cAnd I do not want to add any harm to a group of people who have already experienced and who are all continuing to experience grievous and extreme harm.\u201d Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and the countries have now been at war for almost 500 days. Ukraine\u2019s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Gilbert said that she had \u201cother book projects that I\u2019m working on and I\u2019ve made a decision to turn my attention to working on those now\u201d. Literary agents and authors told the Observer that an appetite for escapist fiction in Russia had led to enticing offers for foreign rights. But many authors felt it was not right to take Russian money while the war with Ukraine was ongoing. In addition, authors including Linwood Barclay, Stephen King and Joe Abercrombie have previously publicly said they will not be renewing book contracts in Russia because of the war."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/sourdough-may-be-a-star-carb-but-watch-the-ingredients", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Sourdough may be a star carb but watch the ingredients | Gabrielle Chan", "lead": "Some shop-bought loaves amount to \u2018sourfaux\u2019 because of the additives.

I realise we are well out of lockdown and sourdough is pass\u00e9. But just as the Australian wheat crop is forecast to decline off record highs, the urge to bake has lately taken hold of me and may never let go. Like all of my past and present pursuits \u2013 horses and yoga among them \u2013 it shares commonalities. You can approach these three hobbies expecting the same result day after day but you will rarely achieve it. A horse that is impeccably behaved one day may not behave the same way the next day, particularly if you don\u2019t have your Zen on. On the yoga mat, you can exhale the rubbish of the day, stand on one leg in tree pose, as steady and straight as spotted gum. The next day, you can\u2019t balance to save yourself. So it is with sourdough \u2013 a hobby I have taken up 25 years after moving to a wheat farm. Basic sourdough has only three ingredients: flour, water and salt. As a fermented food, it requires a good starter, which is also made from flour and water. In theory, with so few ingredients and a basic recipe, you should be able to turn out a reasonable loaf every time. Right? Wrong. The thing about sourdough baking is that temperature, time and flour are ever-changing. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter For the ordinary home baker, while achieving consistency is a struggle, the variables compel you forward, to the point where you are getting up to stare lovingly at your fermenting loaf at 1am in the morning. Ask Kate Reid, the former Formula One aerospace engineer who simply set out to create the perfect croissant. She is now the queen of the damn-near-close-to-perfect croissant, sent out daily through her Lune bakeries. While perfect can be the enemy of the good, a recent paper by University of New South Wales dieticians Jaimee Hughes and Sara Grafenauer shows most sourdoughs ain\u2019t even close to sourdoughs. Their analysis collected ingredients, nutrition information and on-pack claims from a range of products at four Sydney supermarket chains (Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and IGA) and a Baker\u2019s Delight franchise. It found 83% of sourdough bread contained a range of additional ingredients not traditionally found in sourdough. These included yeast (44% of sourdough products), wheat malt flour (49%), wheat gluten (30%), emulsifiers (24%), vinegar (15%), lecithin (7%), raising agents/baking powder (6%), acidity regulators (3%), preservatives (3%), bread improver (3%), humectant (2%) and stabilisers (1%). The reason, presumably, is that sourdough is a growing market, something of a star carbohydrate among consumers, many of whom remain locked in a cycle of torment over what to eat. To carb or not to carb, that is the question. The eating public seems to like the idea of an old-fashioned fermented bread because of what the authors call a \u201chealth halo\u201d, even though it may not be the product they imagine. \u201cConsumers may believe these products are better for health, regardless of whether this can be validated through claims or other labelling information,\u201d the authors write. In Australia, we are not prescriptive about our sourdough. In Europe, definitions change across countries. Austrian and German bakers can\u2019t use yeast in loaves claiming to be sourdough. Spain needs a sourdough loaf to have at least 15% starter but Spanish bakers can use yeast. Given bread is such a staple in many cultures, there are various movements to create a rulebook of sorts. The Real Bread Campaign in the UK is pushing an Honest Crust Act designed to stop misleading customers with loaves that amount to \u201csourfaux\u201d, using extra additives. They also want bread \u201cfree of pesticides and other agrochemicals\u201d. For Grafenauer though, it comes down to authenticity. She is hoping the research inspires \u201ca little more care\u201d about brand claims and marketing, because the big move for consumers is knowing where your food comes from. So if you are standing in the bread aisle at your local supermarket, Grafenauer\u2019s best advice is to go for wholegrain, for the higher dietary fibre, higher plant protein and lower salt \u201cwhether it\u2019s sourdough or a normal yeast loaf\u201d. \u201cIf you are looking for sourdough because you really love that taste, turn over and read the ingredients. If you\u2019re legitimately looking for something that is sourdough, you do need to look to see that it is just flour, salt, water \u2013 a hint \u2013 and the leaven or leftover starter,\u201d she says. Personally, I will be found with a light dusting of Australian wheat flour down my front, stretching and folding a large dough baby and hoping Australian wheat forecasts do not decline too far this year.

With this in mind, start-ups and scientists are racing to recreate diamonds, silk and leather in laboratories. If they can succeed \u2013 at scale \u2013 it will make a difference, says Christine Goulay, the founder of Sustainabelle Advisory Services. \u201cLab-grown materials can help eliminate supply chain risks related to human rights, animal welfare, and biodiversity loss,\u201d she says. But that is a very big \u201cif\u201d. Nina Marenzi, the founder of Future Fabrics Expo which will take place in London this month, says as lab-grown materials come to market, it is vital to ask the right questions \u2013 otherwise they will wind up perpetuating the problems they were meant to solve. Synthesised silk Traditional silk relies on a process known as sericulture where silkworms are raised until they have cocooned, then they are boiled, killing the moth inside. After this, the silk is extracted from the cocoon. A lab-grown alternative is appealing from an animal cruelty perspective, and may use less energy than industrial silk production. A few years ago, a textile called Microsilk started getting attention in the industry. Developed by Bolt Threads (which also produce Mylo, a vegan leather), it is brewed in a lab using a technique called precision fermentation. Genetically modified yeast cells are mixed with sugar and water, and this mixture is left to ferment in large tanks until it becomes a liquid protein that can be extracted, spun then woven into a textile. Like silk, the fabric is a protein, and it shares some physical properties with real silk: it is lightweight, smooth and biodegradable. Between 2016 and 2019 the company that makes Microsilk received a $700m evaluation; made two dresses in collaboration with Stella McCartney; and released a tie and beanie under its own label. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning But currently there are no Microsilk products on the market. This is because subtle changes in temperature and pH levels can upset the fermentation process, which makes it difficult to produce at scale. Even if these issues can be ironed out, Marenzi has concerns about the ingredients used to brew the silk. The main input is sugar, which typically comes from corn, which is generally grown as a genetically modified monocrop. In an ideal world, the inputs required to brew the protein \u2013 which are known as feedstocks \u2013 would not come from industrial agricultural systems where monocultures and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are prevalent and pose a threat to biodiversity. Tara St James, the senior director of sustainability at Canadian outerwear brand Moose Knuckles, points out it\u2019s worth considering whether feedstocks could be put to better use, like energy or food. Brewed Protein is another material emerging in this space \u2013 also made through precision fermentation. It is produced by Japanese company Spiber Inc and can be made into a variety of textures including fleece, denim and fur. The company combines synthesised DNA with a feedstock of sugar and corn. Their website outlines a desire to move to circular inputs, and improve the way their corn and sugar are farmed. In 2022 Spiber Inc started building its first large-scale plant in Thailand. They have released a very limited run of products with The North Face and Junya Watanabe, and there is currently a 12% Brewed Protein, 88% cotton hoodie for sale from Pangaia for A$625. Lab-grown leather Not to be confused with the many vegan leather alternatives already on the market, scientists are working on leather cultivated in a lab using cells of animal origin. The resulting hides should share the properties of real leather: a combination of fat, protein, breathability and flexibility that has to date been basically impossible to replicate using plants or plastic. Goulay says by \u201creplicating the structure of skin and using the same type of collagen\u201d, lab-grown leathers are able \u201cto get as close as possible to their naturally occurring counterparts\u201d. There are a few companies working in this space, including New Jersey-based Modern Meadow, and California-based VitroLabs, which received a $46m series-A funding round last year from investors including luxury conglomerate Kering. To cultivate their leather, VitroLabs takes a small biopsy from a real cow and combines the harvested cells with nutrients to grow sheets of leather that then go through a simplified tanning process. VitroLabs says the nutrients consist of amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates and vitamins that are sourced from commercial vendors. While VitroLabs\u2019 pilot manufacturing facility has been in operation for about a year, and are actively seeking partnerships with businesses, there are no items on the market yet. If lab-grown meat\u2019s slow journey to market is any indication, a commercially viable product could be a long time away \u2013 although it will likely face fewer regulatory hurdles since it is intended for wearing, not eating. St James says using fewer animal products reduces issues around \u201cresource extraction, risks to biodiversity degradation, animal cruelty, and links to deforestation issues in the supply chain\u201d. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Since these products are nascent, Goulay says: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to make any sweeping declarations about one thing being more \u2018sustainable\u2019 than another \u2026 Just because something is lab-grown doesn\u2019t eliminate the need to collect and analyse data.\u201d Meanwhile, those wondering exactly how many cows it takes to lab-grow leather should note that foetal bovine serum is widely used in cell cultivation. No-mine diamonds Lab-grown diamonds are already widely commercially available. Unlike natural diamonds, which were forged billions of years ago under intense pressure and heat from the earth, the lab-grown versions develop much faster through processes that replicate these conditions. The result is \u201cchemically identical to naturally mined stones,\u201d Goulay says. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to tell the difference.\u201d The Natural Diamond Council disputes this, and claims all laboratory diamonds can be detected using professional verification equipment. \u201cLab-grown diamonds remove concerns related to conflict minerals and the huge potential negative environmental impacts of mining,\u201d Goulay says. However, there are concerns about the amount of energy it takes to produce them. Livia Firth, founder of Eco-Age, says sustainability claims made by lab-grown-diamond companies should be questioned. \u201cLab-grown diamonds and diamonds are two completely different things. And they equally have rights to exist. But I\u2019m not sure lab-grown diamonds are more sustainable.\u201d She says many factories\u2019 claims around renewable energy are likely overblown. \u201cSolar panels are not able to power the entire factory,\u201d she says. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201cjust 10%.\u201d Firth says the traditional diamond trade does not always deserve its unethical reputation, and can provide significant livelihoods for communities that rely on it. She visited diamond mines in Botswana for a documentary series released in 2020, and says \u201cevery single person from the school teacher to the truck driver, to the shop owner, to the restaurant waiter, tells you how proud they are to be a product of their economy, a product of the diamond industry.\u201d Firth also believes the mass production of lab-grown diamonds does nothing to address the issue at the heart of fashion\u2019s carbon footprint: overconsumption. People get \u201cengaged with a ring that belongs to their grandmother, you pass diamonds down,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t buy a new diamond many times.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/first-world-problem-solved-nsw-public-transport-users-can-tap-off-with-locked-iphones", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "First-world problem solved: NSW public transport users can \u2018tap off\u2019 with locked iPhones", "lead": "Exclusive: State strikes deal with Apple allowing digital payments without device being unlocked", "author": "Elias Visontay Transport and urban affairs reporter", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080275", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9535f6c679dacdb8337d2d6bbd1e3866d4217b85/0_217_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "It\u2019s the ultimate first-world problem in Sydney.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Since all Opal readers were upgraded to allow taps-on with credit cards in 2019, passengers who have added payment cards into their digital wallet have also been able to tap on with their smartphone or smartwatch. Smartphones treat this in the same way as any financial transaction, so users have had to unlock their device to authorise the tap. However, under a new deal struck between the NSW government and Apple, passengers who use digital payment cards on their iPhones or Apple watches to tap on to public transport will no longer have to unlock their device with a passcode or biometric recognition. The feature will work even if an iPhone or Apple watch has run out of battery, the state\u2019s transport department said. The capability is already active on some Opal readers, and will be fully rolled out to all 25,000 readers across the bus, train, light rail and ferry networks in the coming weeks. Passengers will need to update their device\u2019s software, activate express transit mode and nominate from which payment card they want Opal readers to deduct. The initiative only benefits Apple users. Samsung devices have already had the feature, but this hasn\u2019t yet extended to all Android devices. Digital Opal cards have previously been trialled by the NSW government but have not yet been introduced. This means those with concession and senior Opal cards still require physical cards to access the cheaper fares. Despite being limited mostly to Apple devices, the NSW government believes the initiative will speed up public transport by making it easier for passengers to get off buses and through station turnstiles. Almost 2 million public transport users in NSW use digital credit cards on their devices to tap on, according to the department. Transport for NSW\u2019s chief of technology, Kurt Brissett, said Apple\u2019s market share is so pronounced the feature could have a tangible impact on speeds. More than 65% of credit card tap-ons on the Opal network are now made using digital wallets, and the \u201cvast majority\u201d of these tap-ons were made with Apple devices, he said. \u201cThis means the upgrade provides access to a seamless tap-on and tap-off experience for most of our passengers,\u201d Brissett said. \u201cThis really is amazing technology that will deliver a simple time-saving solution with fewer hold-ups and more peace of mind.\u201d The transport minister, Jo Haylen, said: \u201cWe know it can hold things up when you\u2019re trying to quickly use Touch ID or Face ID to unlock your device at the reader.

Definitely one for the poolside chair. \u2013 SC The Year My Family Unravelled by Cynthia Dearborn Memoir, Affirm Press, $34.99 In 2007, Cynthia Dearborn was told she would be solely responsible for the care of her father, who had vascular dementia. She uprooted from Sydney to Seattle, leaving her partner and job behind to launch headfirst into what became a year of full-time caregiving. In this warts-and-all memoir, Dearborn deftly weaves between her time as a first-time caregiver as well as her tumultuous upbringing and her experience with a flawed medical system. \u201cI realised I had to become not just my father\u2019s caregiver,\u201d she wrote in a reflection for Guardian Australia, \u201cbut his care advocate.\u201d \u2013 MS The Days Toppled Over by Vidya Madabushi Fiction, $32.99, Vintage Thirty-six-year-old Malli has been selectively mute for 15 years, and lives a small life in a retirement village in Bangalore. All she has to look forward to is a weekly (one-sided) call from her brother Surya: an international student in Sydney living in squalor above the restaurant he works at, desperately trying for a permanent visa \u2013 before, one day, he suddenly disappears. Vidya Madabushi\u2019s lively debut flits between Surya and Malli\u2019s narration as we follow her journey to Sydney to find him \u2013 and learn from him what has happened. With vivid characters and big heart, it speaks to the precarious existence of international students: a skyrocketing demographic seen as cash cows by a country which is leaving them hungry, homeless and at risk. \u2013 SH"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/labor-guarantees-minimum-500m-each-year-for-housing-in-bid-to-win-greens-support", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Labor guarantees minimum $500m each year for housing in bid to win Greens support", "lead": "Housing minister says work for social and affordable homes can begin as soon as future fund is established but Greens say it should begin now", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080278", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d8ba254b1da9d61629170467b2e535219a7429bf/0_277_6969_4182/500.jpg", "body": "Labor has guaranteed a minimum of $500m will be paid out of the Housing Australia Future Fund every year in a last-ditch bid to win Greens support for the bill to help build social and affordable housing. The housing minister, Julie Collins, wrote to the crossbench on Monday offering a \u201cguaranteed fixed disbursement\u201d of $500m from 2024-25, with a new power for the treasurer and finance minister to increase the amount by regulation, making it a floor not a ceiling. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But the offer, made before the Greens party room meeting on Tuesday, still falls short of the minor party\u2019s calls for up to $2.5bn of direct spending on housing and extra funds to incentivise the states to freeze rents. The Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, immediately poured cold water on Labor\u2019s offer, saying it had \u201cdone nothing more than partly close a loophole that could have seen no money spent on housing at all\u201d. \u201cWhat Labor is offering is a housing plan that won\u2019t spend money until 2024-25 then locks real-term cuts for six years and does nothing for renters,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is billions of dollars of investment in public and affordable housing immediately and an emergency freeze on rent increases.\u201d After voting with the Coalition to prevent the bill coming to a final vote in May, the Greens now have a final parliamentary sitting fortnight to decide whether to back the bill before the future fund\u2019s intended start date of 1 July. Labor has won support from state and territory housing ministers, the Jacqui Lambie Network and senator David Pocock for the bill, despite Pocock, the construction union and some housing groups backing calls for it to lift its ambition. In her letter, seen by Guardian Australia, Collins said the Albanese government had provided \u201clong overdue national leadership on renters\u2019 rights\u201d by putting it on the agenda at national cabinet. She added that the budget had increased the maximum rate of commonwealth rent assistance by 15%, set to help about 1.1 million people. Collins implicitly rejected claims the Greens have made publicly that the government has not invested directly in new housing, saying $575m would be allocated from the national housing infrastructure facility for social and affordable homes, as would $350m through the national housing accord for 10,000 new affordable rental homes. Collins cited other concessions to the crossbench including: indexation of payouts from the Housing Australia Future Fund from 2029; a review to be completed by December 2026; energy efficiency standards in new homes; and $200m from the fund for the repair, maintenance and improvement of housing in remote Indigenous communities. Collins said Housing Australia \u201chas already begun preparatory work\u201d meaning work can begin \u201cimmediately\u201d as soon as the fund is established, with contracts to be signed in the 2023-24 financial year. \u201cHowever, recognising the reality that homes take time to build, any further delay will mean people in need will wait longer for the homes the Housing Australia Future Fund will provide, including women and children fleeing domestic and family violence and older women at risk of homelessness.\u201d Earlier in June the Greens scaled back their demands but have still been pushing for interim direct spending on housing rather than waiting for returns from the future fund, which Chandler-Mather argues could mean no houses are built before 2025. \u201cThe Greens want to negotiate, but Labor is refusing to shift on the two key demands we\u2019ve made clear for the last eight months, more guaranteed money for public housing and a nationally coordinated freeze on rent increases,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/tony-abbott-and-john-howard-join-jordan-peterson-led-group-looking-at-meaning-of-life", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "Tony Abbott and John Howard join Jordan Peterson-led group looking at \u2018meaning of life\u2019", "lead": "Alliance for Responsible Citizenship includes prominent Brexit voices and Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, who has questioned the urgency of the climate crisis", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Paul Karp", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:24Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080282", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0aa144fa749efc05bdce5e0686aa88169d34d70b/1871_648_1344_807/500.jpg", "body": "The former prime ministers Tony Abbott and John Howard are among six Australians who have joined a global group fronted by Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson and backed by a pro-Brexit hedge fund billionaire and a Dubai-based investment group. The group \u2013 The Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (Arc) \u2013 has been gathering high-profile figures from politics, industry, academia and thinktanks for an inaugural three-day conference in London in late October. Peterson has said the conference would look at \u201cissues metaphysical, cultural and practical\u201d and \u201cissues pertaining to the meaning of life\u201d but also to \u201cbecome practical with regard to the realisation of policy\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Danish political scientist Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg and the American commentator Michael Shellenberger, who have both questioned the urgency of the climate crisis compared with other global problems, are on the group\u2019s advisory committee. Also on the committee are Australia\u2019s shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, and a former deputy prime minister, John Anderson. Company records in the UK show Arc has two shareholders \u2013 the Dubai-based investment management group Legatum Ventures and the British investor and Brexiter Sir Paul Marshall. According to The Times Rich List, in 2020 Marshall was worth about $1.1bn and is co-founder of Marshall Wace, reported to be one of the world\u2019s biggest hedge funds. Legatum and Marshall are major investors in GB News, the rightwing and partisan alternative news outlet launched in 2021. One of Legatum\u2019s four founders, the billionaire Christopher Chandler, told the Guardian in 2018 he made \u201chundreds of millions\u201d from investments in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and at one point owned 4% of the gas giant Gazprom with his brother Richard Chandler. The businessman was already rich when he invested in Russia soon after the end of the USSR. A \u201cstatement of vision and interpretation\u201d for Arc includes six \u201cfundamental questions\u201d around energy, environmental stewardship, families and societies. Discussing the questions, Peterson has said there are \u201cno excuses for putting forward energy policies that punish those who are absolutely poor\u201d. \u201cWe have no right to deny the developing world the opportunity to pursue the opportunities that we have been blessed to pursue.\u201d The vision document says: \u201cWe at ARC do not believe that humanity is necessarily and inevitably teetering on the brink of apocalyptic disaster. \u201cWe posit, instead, that men and women of faith and decisiveness, made in the image of God, can arrange their affairs with care and attention so that abundance and opportunity could be available for all.\u201d The document asks how it might \u201ceffectively conceptualise, value and reward the sacrificial, long-term, peaceful, child-centred intimate relationships upon which psychological integrity and social stability most fundamentally depend.\u201d Peterson has said a model for this was \u201csomething approximating the nuclear family\u201d with \u201clong-term, committed, stable heterosexual marriages sanctified by the community\u201d. A spokesperson for Hastie said the MP was \u201chonoured\u201d to be part of the Arc advisory board. \u201cHe is standing alongside a diverse, global group of eminent leaders from across all areas of human endeavour and public policy. \u201cMr Hastie is looking forward to building a new narrative for politics that goes beyond the soulless, values-free, consumer-focused politics of corporatist progressivism. \u201cMr Hastie is looking forward to policy discussions on increasing home ownership, affordable zero-emissions energy, education and national security.\u201d Anderson told Guardian Australia he joined the group at the urging of the UK House of Lords member Lady Philippa Stroud. Anderson said Arc would investigate a \u201crange of topics\u201d including: family formation, describing depopulation as \u201ca huge challenge in coming decades\u201d; building prosperity and overcoming young people\u2019s cynicism about capitalism; \u201cthe west\u2019s confidence in its own core values and its willingness to defend them\u201d; and rising energy and fertiliser prices. Anderson said Arc did not oppose decarbonisation but would call for \u201ctransparency and honesty \u2026 about the sacrifices that will be needed, and the need to do it in a way that shares the burden fairly\u201d. Anderson said Lomborg \u201cdoesn\u2019t deny the importance of solving climate change\u201d but rather \u201cif you set back alleviation of hunger and poverty you\u2019ll end up with a whole chunk of people who don\u2019t care about climate and the environment\u201d. Anderson said others involved in Arc were \u201cvery honourable people\u201d, defending Chandler\u2019s involvement with Gazprom. \u201cLots of Australians have been on Chinese business boards and might have a different view now.\u201d Howard told Guardian Australia he was invited by the group\u2019s founders and would take part in the conference because he \u201cbroadly\u201d shared Arc\u2019s objectives. \u201cOn climate change, I have said on numerous occasions that I am an agnostic. I have always supported Britain leaving the European Union and was very happy when the British public voted in favour of that occurring.\u201d Other Australians on the group are the former LNP senator Amanda Stoker and the Howard-era chief scientist Prof Robin Batterham.

The poll of 1,123 voters, published on Tuesday, found 60% of respondents were in favour of the voice, up one point on the previous survey, while 40% were opposed to it. The yes vote still leads in all major opinion polls, but voice supporters and senior Labor government figures have raised concerns about the vigour of the yes campaign as the no campaign grows in volume. A Resolve poll for the Nine newspapers, published on Monday, showed 42% in favour and 40% against with 18% undecided \u2013 but when forced to make a yes or no decision only 49% supported the change while 51% opposed it. Last week\u2019s Newspoll showed 46% support, 43% against and 11% undecided. The psephologist Kevin Bonham calculates average support to be in the mid-50s, after Resolve and Newspoll recorded the biggest declines for the yes vote. But the Essential poll is more optimistic for the voice, with support steady at 59% or 60% in the past four polls. In the latest poll, voters who opposed the voice were given four potential reasons for why they did so. About 34% said it would \u201cdivide Australians\u201d, 33% said \u201cit will give Indigenous Australians rights and privileges that other Australians don\u2019t have\u201d, 26% said \u201cit won\u2019t make a real difference to the lives of ordinary Indigenous Australians\u201d and 7% said \u201cIndigenous Australians don\u2019t agree on it\u201d. Most respondents were unfamiliar with the Uluru statement from the heart, which called for Indigenous recognition in the constitution through a voice to parliament. Only 12% said they \u201cheard someone read it out, or read it myself\u201d and a further 21% said \u201cI haven\u2019t read it but know what\u2019s in it\u201d. About 36% said \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it but don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it\u201d and 31% had not heard of the Uluru statement. The Indigenous leader Noel Pearson, a key architect of the voice, has warned that the yes campaign has \u201ca lack of clarity\u201d and called for supporters to focus on the constitutional recognition element of the proposal rather than the voice itself. The yes campaign is gearing up for a fresh advertising blitz and will roll out a series of nationwide public events in July as it moves to shift attention away from the parliamentary arena. Yes23 campaign leaders believe support will rise quickly once the voice debate shifts beyond Canberra, as federal parliament moves towards passing the referendum legislation bill. Meanwhile, the Uphold &amp; Recognise group, co-founded by the Liberal MP Julian Leeser, on Monday said it would share staff and resources with the newly formed Liberals For Yes group to campaign for the voice. On the no side, the conservative lobby group Advance, led by the Nationals senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, will soon launch the next stage of its \u201cFair Australia\u201d campaign against the voice, with a spokesperson saying it would continue to criticise the voice as divisive. \u201cWe will focus our resources on innovative, targeted and effective ways of reaching Australians who are open to hearing the side of the story the yes campaign would rather keep hidden,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cIn some cases, this will be through TV and digital advertising, in other cases through other campaign tactics such as high-impact, high-visibility field activity.\u201d The no campaign will focus on smaller states Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.

There are expectations the prime minister may announce the referendum date, tipped as 14 October, at Arnhem Land\u2019s Garma festival in August. But government sources suggested Albanese would not seek to make himself the referendum figurehead so as to stress the voice was not an invention of politicians, but instead an idea sprouted from grassroots consultation with Indigenous communities. Government sources said it couldn\u2019t be \u201cLabor\u2019s campaign\u201d. The Liberal party has taken to describing it as \u201cLabor\u2019s voice\u201d or \u201cAnthony Albanese\u2019s voice\u201d. The government is also mindful that a sustained major focus on the referendum could be met with claims that Albanese is not focused on issues such as the cost of living or inflation. The Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, has been busy travelling to promote the voice, which was a Labor election pledge. Burney last month said she had \u201cabsolute faith in\u201d the yes campaign. The Senate will this week continue debating the constitutional alteration bill to set up the referendum, with an aim for it pass by mid next week after dozens of speeches. To be successful the referendum will require a national majority plus a majority of at least four out of six states."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/12/hunter-valley-bus-crash-locals-await-details-of-tragedy", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "After a bus crash \u2018too horrific to contemplate\u2019, Hunter Valley locals await details of tragedy", "lead": "Flowers have been laid at the site of the crash that killed 10 and injured more than 20", "author": "Natasha May", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:24Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080285", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6acf9b01a8a6407edeedbabee7db67c92e63a27a/481_497_5019_3012/500.jpg", "body": "Jess Wishart and her two children came home early from their long weekend camping trip at Lake Liddell.

Only a laminated sign hinted at the tragedy which unfolded for the guests who left Sunday night\u2019s celebrations: \u201cOut of respect Wandin Valley Estate will be closed today.\u201d Dan Repacholi, the federal MP for Hunter, said the entire community was devastated. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to hear this anywhere in Australia, let alone here in the Hunter Valley, which is the one of the most picturesque places in the world.\u201d A local woman who declined to be named said she was still \u201crattled\u201d from the news. In her house two streets away from the expressway where the accident unfolded, she was woken at 12.45am by helicopters trying to land nearby.

Because you would just go on a dating app if that\u2019s all you wanted.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Australia first met Chatfield when she was a contestant on The Bachelor in 2019, a reality dating show she decided to enter \u201cfor an experience and a laugh\u201d \u2013 not for the promise of everlasting romance. Through her quick wit and natural charm, she parlayed that platform into an incredibly successful media career that today includes a radio show, a popular podcast and her recent live Trauma Dump tour. But Chatfield has gone back to her reality TV roots on FBoy Island Australia: a local take on the US dating show (currently at the centre of a copyright dispute) that\u2019s dropping weekly on Binge. That gig, though, is a little different to her first, The Bachelor. For one, Chatfield is there as the host. For another, only some of the contestants are pretending to be there for the \u201cright reasons\u201d. FBoy Island follows three single women and a group of 24 men vying for their affections, but with a twist: half are \u201cnice guys\u201d allegedly seeking a relationship, and the other half are only in it for a cash prize (these are the self-confessed \u201cFBoys\u201d, a lightly sanitised abbreviation you can probably figure out). If the women choose a \u201cnice guy\u201d at the end, she wins $50,000 to split with him. If she selects an FBoy, though, he gets the $50,000 and can decide whether to keep it all himself. Instead of competing against each other then, the three female leads must work together to try to sort the bad men from the at least marginally-less-bad men \u2013 calling out the \u201cshitty behaviour\u201d as it happens. \u201cI think it is such an amazing, progressive format,\u201d says Chatfield, who would stay up until 4am bingeing the US version, and was \u201ccompletely obsessed\u201d with it before signing on. The format also ensures there\u2019s no unexpected \u201cvillain edits\u201d of the sort she received on The Bachelor: \u201cLike, if you\u2019re choosing to apply as an FBoy, you can\u2019t really act blindsided when you aren\u2019t seen in the best light.\u201d Chatfield is speaking to Guardian Australia from a treadmill, half out of breath as she multitasks on a promo day. She defines an FBoy as \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t know who they are, is trying to figure it out, and is doing it in a very toxic way \u2013 basically, someone who needs therapy\u201d. Single women may know them as the guy who pretends to be sweet only until he gets laid; the type who struggles to view women as whole human beings; or, perhaps, simply the one wearing boat shoes. Chatfield has encountered many. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all known fuck boys,\u201d she says with a laugh. Being savvy, single and sex positive has become a key part of Chatfield\u2019s brand. A former real estate analyst, she applied for the Bachelor at age 23, initially dividing viewers and clashing with castmates for daring to speak openly about her desire for sex. But off the show, she amassed a devoted following with her clever clapbacks to slut shaming, becoming a litmus test for the way you view women: to feel rankled by Abbie suggests you may have some inner work to do. Outside more TV appearances on shows such as Bachelor in Paradise, I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! and The Masked Singer, Chatfield scored a nightly national radio show, Hot Nights \u2013 and her podcast It\u2019s a Lot, in which she discusses topics including sex, mental health and the patriarchy, ranks in the country\u2019s top 10 most listened to. She has her own vibrator, beer and clothing line (currently on pause due to her workload) in an empire that seems to be growing by the day. But it is her experience in both dating and reality TV that makes her perfectly suited to this particular gig, says Sophie Braham, one of FBoy Island\u2019s writers. (Yes, reality TV has writers; Braham worked with Chatfield on her quips for scenes such as the eliminations.) \u201cAbbie herself has such credibility as somebody who understands the ins and outs of modern dating,\u201d Braham says. \u201cShe really typifies the modern reality TV fairytale, which is not finding love, it\u2019s finding success \u2026 instead of just doing tooth-whitening ads on Insta.\u201d And FBoy Island is, as Braham puts it, \u201cin on the joke\u201d \u2013 a show that leans into the fact that it is constructed. When two contestants are told they\u2019re going on \u201ciconic reality TV dates\u201d, they pinch one from the Bachelor: breaking the Guinness world record for longest on-screen kiss. Mid-make-out, the camera pans back from the pashing couple to reveal the guys holding boom mics awkwardly standing by. \u201cWhile this is reality TV, we\u2019re aware that we are contriving things to a certain degree,\u201d Chatfield says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a real place called FBoy Island, you know what I mean?\u201d (The show was actually filmed in Casuarina, a coastal town in northern New South Wales.) \u201cBut I think the self-awareness makes it so much more fun.\u201d Brahams sees FBoy Island as a necessary evolution of the typical dating show: reality viewers are more savvy about the formats today, and dating itself has changed dramatically since The Bachelor debuted in 2002. \u201cThere\u2019s this amazing bit where the girls internet stalk the guys \u2013 it\u2019s one of my favourite parts, because I\u2019m just like, yes, this is exactly what happens [in real life],\u201d Braham says. But FBoy Island isn\u2019t just slyly clever \u2013 it\u2019s also very funny. Chatfield says \u201cit\u2019s a comedy first and foremost, and reality show second\u201d. The fact that it was destined to run on streaming service rather than free-to-air gave it freedom to get silly. (\u201cDo you want a nice boy who respects everything that comes out of your mouth?\u201d Chatfield asks in one scene. \u201cOr do you want an FBoy, who only cares about what he can put in it?\u201d) Chatfield believes the ultimate point is not to scold women for choosing the wrong men, but for men to realise their bad behaviour. She is also proud of FBoy Island\u2019s casting \u2013 almost 30% of contestants are people of colour, she says, which she thinks makes it \u201cthe most racially diverse dating cast in an Australian TV show\u201d. So after having been both a contestant and a host on reality TV, which gig is better? \u201cThe host, babe. The host,\u201d Chatfield answers. \u201cI get to have my phone.\u201d FBoy Island Australia is airing now on Binge"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/coalitions-wounded-feelings-over-brittany-higgins-will-sink-debate-to-new-lows", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Coalition\u2019s wounded feelings over Brittany Higgins will sink debate to new lows ", "lead": "The opposition is out for vengeance over what it sees as \u2018collusion\u2019 and \u2018weaponisation\u2019 but Labor will no doubt push back", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:23Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080288", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2038182ef7d241016c967ed3aab55bac7be73380/0_503_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "What an edifying spectacle parliament is going to be this week. The Coalition\u2019s two-year-old wound caused by accusations it mishandled Brittany Higgins\u2019 rape allegation has been reopened, and they\u2019re out for vengeance. The target is the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who told Senate estimates in June 2021 that \u201cno one had any knowledge\u201d of Higgins\u2019 allegation before it was aired. That comment has been called into question by text exchanges between Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz. Gallagher has denied misleading parliament, admitting that she was \u201caware of some allegations in the days leading up to the choice of Ms Brittany Higgins to make those allegations public\u201d but explaining she \u201cwas responding to an assertion that was being made by Minister Reynolds at the time that we had known about this for weeks and had made a decision to weaponise it\u201d. \u201cThat is not true, it was never true,\u201d she said at a Labor women\u2019s conference on Saturday. To the Coalition, contextualising away the blanket denial of \u201cany knowledge\u201d by claiming she was only refuting the specific claim of a few weeks advance knowledge is the stuff of Trumpian alternative facts. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Labor has offered up another half-defence: the aged care minister, Anika Wells, noted on Sunday that Gallagher \u201cwasn\u2019t answering questions as a minister, she was the person asking the questions in the first place\u201d. This one doesn\u2019t really fly. The clerk of the Senate, Richard Pye, told Guardian Australia: \u201cSenators are accountable to the Senate for their remarks in the Senate and its committees, regardless of whether they are ministers.\u201d He said the Senate privileges committee had investigated about 18 matters involving possible false or misleading evidence, mostly from witnesses, at least once from a minister, and one case in 1997 about misleading the Senate about use of travel allowances. None resulted in a finding of contempt of the Senate. Labor and the Greens have a majority on the privileges committee and, with the Greens backing Labor that nothing they\u2019ve heard suggests the need for an inquiry, the alleged mislead will be tried in the court of public opinion only. It\u2019s unclear whether the National Anti-Corruption Commission will take on the case of the finance department settling Higgins\u2019 personal injury claim, which Gallagher denies having a role in. That leaves question time, where the opposition will seek to broaden the attack to examine Gallagher\u2019s claim that she \u201cdid nothing with that information\u201d after she became aware of Higgins\u2019 complaint. Why do the text messages suggest Gallagher had follow-up questions on the matter? Did she tell Anthony Albanese or others? If not, how did Linda Reynolds come to be warned Labor would go after the issue before The Project went to air? Despite all the lack of transparency on their own side, not least of which is the failure to release the Gaetjens report into what Scott Morrison\u2019s office knew, we know the Coalition will go there. The shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, has told us so: arguing Gallagher\u2019s explanation is \u201cflimsy\u201d, accusing Labor of first \u201cweaponising\u201d Higgins\u2019 allegation and suggesting there was \u201ccollusion\u201d with senior Labor members. Of course Labor didn\u2019t weaponise the allegation itself. Bruce Lehrmann, the man who was accused and denied the rape, had long since been sacked when the matter became a public controversy. He\u2019d later be tried, but the case was dropped after jury misconduct. Lehrmann has consistently denied the accusations against him. No, Labor probed what it perceived as a Morrison government cover-up of the complaint or what was, at best, an attempt to respect Higgins\u2019 privacy that happened to align with institutional incentives to hush it up. That\u2019s why you can expect Labor\u2019s defence this week to be: so what? We got a foretaste of that in Albanese labelling it \u201cbizarre\u201d that Labor is under attack for \u201callegations by a Liberal staffer that another Liberal staffer had a sexual assault in a Liberal minister\u2019s office\u201d. Gallagher and others stress it was Higgins\u2019 decision to make the complaint public. Once you let go of any sort of paternalistic notion that Labor ginned the complainant up, all you\u2019re left with is Gallagher wanting to support a young woman alleging she had been raped, and an opposition wanting to hold the government to account about what it did about it. Reynolds continues to feel aggrieved over the way she was portrayed as unsympathetic to Higgins. And that\u2019s the scariest thing about the week in prospect: there really is no bottom to how low the debate could go, because both sides think the other is the one politicising the complaint."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/melbourne-bookstore-accuses-employee-of-breaking-confidentiality-by-discussing-pay-rise", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Melbourne bookstore accuses employee of breaking \u2018confidentiality\u2019 by discussing pay rise", "lead": "Worker launches court action over termination from Hill of Content, after also being accused of upsetting colleague and reducing her shifts", "author": "Adeshola Ore", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:23Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080289", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/58c09f02c12594bdb30e5f9c250ca0c4366bc6dc/0_76_3500_2099/500.jpg", "body": "Natasha Seymour had always dreamed of working in publishing. But when her bookshop employer terminated her employment after she discussed her pay with colleagues, Seymour says she feared for her future in the industry. \u201cIt felt like not just a rejection from the bookshop but from the industry as a whole, given how small it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried about my chances of finding other work.\u201d Seymour\u2019s employment at Hill of Content, which refers to itself as Melbourne\u2019s oldest bookstore, ended after her employer accused her of breaking \u201ctrust and confidentiality\u201d in discussing her wage increase and associated back pay with other employees. It also accused her upsetting a senior staff member and reducing her shifts once she was awarded back pay to take on another job. Her case will come before the federal circuit court later this month in what is expected to be a test of new laws that prevent employers gagging workers for speaking about their pay. The federal industrial relations changes came into effect in December and aim to reduce pay secrecy to help close the gender pay gap. Seymour, 29, joined the bookshop in July as a casual retail assistant, working an average of 26 hours a week. After her employer agreed to move Seymour to a higher pay level under the retail award, she received a back payment in January of $659, dated back to mid-September. She says she subsequently spoke to two fellow casual employees about her pay. In Seymour\u2019s termination email, sent in February, Hill of Content co-owner Duncan Johnston said he was \u201cextremely upset\u201d at Seymour\u2019s \u201ctotal disregard for confidentiality in anything that occurs between employer and employee\u201d. \u201cYou broke our trust and confidentiality in talking to other junior staff about your back pay and wage increase,\u201d he wrote. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Johnston said that the pay increase had been provided not because her duties aligned with a higher level under the award but as a promotion granted because they viewed her as \u201cfuture assistant management material\u201d. \u201cTo be a level-three payment recipient you have to do a majority of the items in level three, not just one item,\u201d he said. Seymour\u2019s representation of her pay increase to colleagues had \u201ctotally unsettled our other staff and undermined our relationship with them\u201d, Johnston wrote. He also said Seymour went on to reduce her shifts after she had secured the pay increase and back payment. While not wishing to speak about matters before the court, Johnston told Guardian Australia the bookshop was a small family-owned business that had \u201calways treated our casual staff fairly and as part of the family\u201d. \u2018Empower workers to speak up\u2019 The director of the Young Workers Centre, which is representing Seymour, Felicity Sowerbutts, said the case was \u201csignificant for all workers\u201d. \u201cWe want it to empower workers to speak up,\u201d she said. Speaking generally, Sowerbutts said only employers benefited from pay secrecy. \u201cPay secrecy is one of the reasons we have a gender pay gap and a racial pay gap,\u201d she said. The gender pay gap in Australia is 13.3%, which is a record low but means women continue to earn 87 cents for every dollar of their male counterparts. Sowerbutts said allowing workers to discuss pay would boost transparency to ensure they get paid the same amount for doing the same job. There is no allegation of a gender or racial pay gap at the Hill of Content bookstore. Seymour\u2019s legal team allege in court documents her dismissal breached her workplace right to discuss pay, as granted by Fair Work Act changes that took effect in December. From 7 June, pay secrecy terms were no longer allowed to be included in any employment contracts. While Guardian Australia has seen the statement of claim filed in court, the bookshop is yet to file its submissions. Michelle Brown, professor of human resource management at the University of Melbourne, said international research suggested improving pay transparency was \u201cpart of the toolkit of reducing the gender pay gap\u201d. Studies in the UK, US, Canada and Denmark have all reported a decline in the gender pay gap due to legislation that promotes pay transparency. Seymour, who nows works in publishing, said she was not aware of the new pay secrecy reform when she received the email saying she would not receive further shifts. But she is hopeful her case could have flow-on effects for other workers to improve pay transparency. \u201cIf that becomes more visible, the right to talk about your pay and know what other people at your workplace are getting paid, that would be good.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/calls-for-restorative-justice-after-dehumanising-incidents-in-victoria-mental-health-care-system", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Calls for restorative justice after \u2018dehumanising\u2019 incidents in Victoria\u2019s mental health care system", "lead": "\u2018I chewed my way through the restraints in front of two security guards who were laughing at me\u2019, one woman says", "author": "Adeshola Ore", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T15:00:23Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080292", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/735eaf799e019f3d45a288556aa95aa04a77dead/0_224_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "When Victoria\u2019s mental health royal commission made landmark findings of systemic human rights breaches in 2021, there was little that surprised Anna*.

A report commissioned by the state\u2019s health department has recommended that the government formally apologise for harms caused by the system, along with a truth-telling process to hear and document those it says are unresolved. It points to a variety of mistreatment in the mental health system such as the use of practices like seclusion and restraint and making the loved ones of clients feel invisible. The state\u2019s royal commission into the issue found clients continued to have their human rights breached through compulsory treatment and the use of seclusion and restraints. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The inquiry recommended the government stamp out seclusion and restraints within a decade. But Victoria is still secluding and restraining people more frequently and for longer than national averages. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep going with the same system that has caused these harms,\u201d Anna said. She said an apology would allow people like her to begin trusting mental health institutions. Simon Katterl, a mental health and human rights advocate who led the project, said the report was the first in the world to recommend a formal \u201crestorative justice\u201d mental health process to a government. He said the royal commission was policy focused, but had not adequately investigated harm and human rights breaches. \u201cUntil we resolve this, we\u2019ll have the same issues coming up. We need to deal with the harm first before we can reach the future mental health system we all want to get to,\u201d he said. Co-author Lorna Downes, who has been a carer, said it was vital the report recommendations included the perspective of carers and recognised that family and friends were often made to feel invisible. \u201cIf they\u2019re communicated with at all, it\u2019s around practical matters, not around their own support needs or the impact of witnessing harm to their family member in the system, \u201d she said. Chris MacBean, a co-author of the report with lived experience of the mental health care system, said: \u201cI have seen harm that I would never want to see again\u201d. The report said the restorative justice process should be led by commissioners with lived experience at the state\u2019s mental health commission. It said after this, the Victorian government should issue apologies to consumers and carers in the mental health system in parliament. The National Mental Health Consumer Alliance supports the report\u2019s recommendations and said a restorative justice process would help create a \u201cmore fair, inclusive and equal relationship\u201d between mental health providers and those who use the system.

Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought the charges and who continues to investigate Trump\u2019s election subversion, told reporters on Friday he would seek \u201ca speedy trial \u2026 consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused\u201d. Trump responded with anger and defiance. Smith has also become a target for the former president\u2019s competitors in the Republican primary he dominates. From Trump\u2019s closest challenger, Ron DeSantis, to his former vice-president, Mike Pence, major and minor candidates have criticised the special counsel and claimed Trump is being treated unfairly. So have Trump allies in Congress, notably including the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who spilled into anger during an interview with ABC on Sunday. \u201cI think Donald Trump is stronger today politically than he was before,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an election, and we\u2019ll have a trial, but I promise you this: most Americans believe, most Republicans believe, that the law is used as a weapon against Donald Trump.\u201d Graham also said that though he was \u201cnot justifying [Trump\u2019s] behaviour\u201d, he would \u201cnot change my support for Donald Trump\u201d. Republicans in a House caucus dominated by the far right have flocked to Trump\u2019s defence but senior senators have long taken a more distant approach. Responding to the indictment, the Utah senator Mitt Romney, a former presidential nominee, said: \u201cMr Trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/12/met-police-just-stop-oil-protests-cost-millions-pounds", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Met says Just Stop Oil protests have cost it more than \u00a34.5m in six weeks", "lead": "Force says daily climate marches have taken up \u201813,770 officer shifts\u2019 as MPs prepare to debate new powers", "author": "Damien Gayle Environment correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T14:55:36Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080298", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/511342269aadb5f0bf8f808ef4d03ab25f9ef2c2/0_158_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Police have said climate activists\u2019 daily slow march protests through London have cost them millions of pounds and thousands of officer hours in the past six weeks. As MPs prepared on Monday to debate new police powers to curtail the Just Stop Oil demonstrations, the Metropolitan police said maintaining order around them had cost more than \u00a34.5m and the equivalent of almost 13,770 officer shifts. Since the end of April, Just Stop Oil\u2019s supporters have been causing rush-hour tailbacks by staging daily go-slow protest marches in the capital, alongside disruptive protests at high-profile sporting and cultural events. They have said they will wage \u201can indefinite campaign of civil resistance\u201d using the tactic until the government agrees to its demand of a moratorium on new oil and gas projects. \u201cIn deploying the new tactics of moving slowly in front of traffic along highways, Just Stop Oil\u2019s intent has been clear on disrupting road users,\u201d said the deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan. \u201cThis has caused significant impact to the public and officers have been responding as swiftly as possible once aware of the incidents.\u201d A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: \u201cThis is what happens when a criminal government pursues ever more repressive laws to silence dissent. The government has the power to stop this huge waste of police time and resources immediately, by ending new oil and gas. The money would be far better spent on protecting the British public by leading a rapid transition away from deadly fossil fuels.\u201d MPs are to debate a statutory instrument to amend the meaning of \u201cserious disruption\u201d in the UK\u2019s public order regime, lowering its threshold from \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cprolonged\u201d disruption to \u201cmore than minor\u201d. Despite a host of new powers conferred by the recent Public Order Act 2023, police have so far used longstanding public order powers to tackle the go-slow marches. \u201cIn a lot of cases, putting in conditions from section 12 of the Public Order Act [1986] has encouraged protesters to exit the highway within minutes,\u201d the force said. On Monday morning, Just Stop Oil\u2019s supporters were on the streets once again, beginning what the campaign said was the eighth week of daily protests. The campaign said 65 supporters marched in four groups in Lambeth, Victoria and Earl\u2019s Court. Just Stop Oil said one of the marches was stopped by police within five minutes, with the rest of them also placed under section 12 orders by 8.46am. The Met said of 156 slow marches since the end of April, 125 had been limited or ended after police issued section 12 orders. Eighty-six arrests had been made over the campaign, mostly for breaching these orders, the Met said. Supporters of Just Stop Oil had been charged 49 times. Sometimes officers have also arrested passersby or drivers caught behind marches who have confronted and attacked protesters. Adelekan said: \u201cWe know this action has been very frustrating for the public who just want to carry on with their day-to-day business. We would urge the public not to intervene or take matters into their own hands but to call the police, let us know where the incident is and we will get to the scene quickly. It may look like we are not responding quickly enough, however policing protests is complex and there are steps officers must take to make sure our response is lawful and appropriate.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/12/festival-premieres-aldeburgh-harrison-horne-matthews-finnisy-coll-miller-kolesnikov", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Aldeburgh festival premieres review \u2013 new music and new thinking illuminate opening weekend", "lead": "Works by Sadie Harrison, David Horne, David Matthews, Michael Finnisy, Francisco Coll and Cassandra Miller were given their first performances over a captivating opening weekend", "author": "Rian Evans", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T14:53:28Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080300", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e83d1074f199465aa219f0fac694bba161272061/0_640_5149_3090/500.jpg", "body": "New music featured prominently in the Aldeburgh festival\u2019s opening weekend. And, given both the Britten legacy and the super-intent listening the Snape audiences afford such works, it\u2019s clear that Aldeburgh\u2019s platform continues to be of particular significance to composers. The Kreutzer Quartet\u2019s fundamental commitment to new music was palpable in their two recitals. In the four movements of Sadie Harrison\u2019s The River Dreams of Winter, the descriptive flow inspired by the paintings of the Kreutzer\u2019s first violinist Peter Sheppard Sk\u00e6rved made for even closer connections. But in this first public performance it was Harrison\u2019s addition of a final movement reflecting on the death of George Floyd that made an emotional mark. As though building up a head of steam, the quartet\u2019s decision to place David Horne\u2019s quintet, Different Ghosts, with clarinettist Linda Merrick, and David Matthews\u2019 Quartet No 17 at the very end of their respective recitals was clever. They brought a fierce energy to these first hearings, present even in the evanescence of some of Horne\u2019s sounds and in the vibrancy of Matthews\u2019 string writing. Not all premieres were of living composers. Exaudi sang songs by Orlando Gibbons, arrangements by their director James Weeks, delivered with the fantastic flair that is the Exaudi\u2019s gift, as was Michael Finnissy\u2019s extraordinary Cipriano and the touching encore, a first performance of his Reges Tharsis. In the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra\u2019s concert under John Storg\u00e5rds, the novelty was composer Francisco Coll\u2019s wonderfully idiomatic arrangement of Manuel de Falla\u2019s Fantas\u00eda B\u00e9tica written originally for pianist Arthur Rubinstein. Featured composer Cassandra Miller\u2019s propensity is for using \u201cfound\u201d musical material and the sound of the Genovese Trallalero singing was the starting point of her piece La Donna. The initial element of the BBC Philharmonic\u2019s brass braggadocio was arresting but, in this quarter-of-an-hour score, it was the languid winding down of the last minutes, like an old gramophone gradually running out of steam, whose effect was quietly captivating. Pianist Pavel Kolesnikov\u2019s artistry is consummate, but he is also a thinker, always questioning and pushing boundaries. Inspired by the artist Joseph Cornell\u2019s Celestial Navigation, his performance had no premieres, but it offered a remarkable first in terms of his approach to presenting music, a collaboration involving light and design from architect Sophie Hicks with text curated by Martin Crimp. In a darkened Snape Maltings, with the evocative projections of sun and moon seen on the back wall \u2013 its proportions mirroring the box in which Cornell created his piece \u2013 sequences of music by Couperin, Messiaen, Chopin, Thomas Ad\u00e8s and later Schubert were simply mesmerising. With his back to the audience \u2013 no trace of ego but some gestures catching the light to give a more theatrical feel than usual \u2013 Kolesnikov\u2019s playing was exquisite. \u2022 The Aldeburgh festival runs until 25 June. Pavel Kolesnikov\u2019s concert is broadcast on Radio 3 on 13 June and is then available on BBC Sounds for 30 days. The BBC Phiharmonic\u2019s concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 at a future date."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/12/peter-green-obituary", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "Peter Green obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives: </strong>Artist, printmaker and educator who was a pioneer of design education in the early 1970s", "author": "Nathaniel Hepburn", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T14:53:19Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080301", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b8a07bfe5c579a1a902dac02b8c07d9d7ab97d94/0_0_1280_768/500.jpg", "body": "Peter Green, who has died aged 89, was a printmaker and pioneer of design education. Despite leaving school aged 15 without any formal qualifications, Peter received recognition across two distinguished careers, being elected as an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers in 1958 and appointed an OBE for services to art and art education in 1988. Peter joined the army printing unit during his national service in 1953. There he learned the skills of his trade alongside colleagues who had mostly undergone seven-year apprenticeships. At the end of the second world war he enrolled at Brighton College of Art, where he completed his art teacher\u2019s certificate. From 1957, he worked at Ockendon Courts secondary school in Essex, while living in Upminster, east London, before being appointed senior lecturer at Hornsey College of Art in north London, which in 1972 became part of Middlesex Polytechnic (now Middlesex University London). While teaching at Hornsey, he and Maurice de Sausmarez developed a philosophy of \u201cbasic design\u201d, which informed the work with their students and Peter\u2019s great passion, a regular Saturday morning art class for more than 200 children a week. His books on design and printmaking remained influential in art education for many decades. Peter\u2019s educational career led to senior roles, including dean of the faculty of art and design and professor of art and design at Middlesex Polytechnic, until he retired in 1991. Peter\u2019s own practice transformed alongside his teaching as he moved from editioning small wood engravings at the kitchen table to wanting to show students \u201cthat you could print enormous things without a press\u201d. His work became more abstracted, influenced by his involvement in design education and knowledge of European modernism, including the Bauhaus movement. In 1978 he met Linda Smith at Middlesex, and they married in 2000. She became a collaborator who would co-sign editions. Unusually, it is Peter\u2019s late work that is most highly sought after. In these, he brought together his early interest in the neoromantic work of artists such as John Craxton and Graham Sutherland with his knowledge of European modernism and design. From 2010, Peter\u2019s acclaimed late works were exhibited across the UK, at the Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh, Towner Eastbourne, Yorkshire Sculpture Park and Bankside Gallery in London. I met him in 2014 when curating an exhibition that included his work. His prints are also included in the collections of the V&amp;A Museum in London and the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. Born in Hove, East Sussex, to Ivy (nee Hall), a clerk bookkeeper, and George Green, a church verger, Peter attended several secondary schools in east London owing to being evacuated and his family moving around during the war years. Apart from a 10-year period from 2002 when Peter and Linda lived in a house called Goose Barn, near Stamford, Lincolnshire, where they had a studio, Peter spent his life in London, returning to live in St John\u2019s Wood in 2012. Peter is survived by Linda, his son, Simon, and his granddaughter, Maya."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/12/keir-starmer-moment-thatcherism-collapsed-tories-existential-crisis", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "This is Starmer\u2019s moment.

Whipping and dangling ministerial office no longer work as the necessary force holding the party together. Johnson loyalists may be few, but their noise is amplified by a Tory press infected with the same virus, bewailing his departure. Newly knighted Jacob Rees-Mogg writes in the Mail on Sunday that Johnson is \u201cin pole position for a future leadership contest\u201d. Johnson ally James Duddridge tells the Telegraph, \u201cHe will be back. Full stop. As a matter of fact.\u201d Nigel Farage claims he is in talks with Johnson aides to set up a new party to \u201cdefend the Brexit legacy\u201d.

Who is in charge here \u2026 The voters or the blob?\u201d Fantasy or not, such outbursts get megaphone treatment from those taking Johnson\u2019s popularity on his own assessment, as laid out in his resignation letter: \u201cWhen I left office last year the government was only a handful of points behind in the polls. That gap has now massively widened.\u201d Not so. He was ousted because Labour was 11 points ahead, widened now to 16. Johnson\u2019s personal ratings are abysmal: Ipsos\u2019s Ben Page says he tops the list of prime ministers who did a \u201cbad job\u201d. But the Torysphere has its fingers in its ears, not listening to voters, obsessed by woke conspiracies, blobs, remainers, the \u201cestablishment\u201d, the liberal elite or any other \u201cthem\u201d they can find to avoid looking in the mirror. They are the cause of their own downfall. You might think this is only the usual turmoil that happens when the pendulum swings against a government too long in power. But this time it\u2019s different. Under its feet the ground is shaking, tectonic plates are on the move, all its belief systems are crumbling. The aftershocks of a financial crash, austerity, Covid and Brexit have set off a tidal wave sweeping away four decades of the Thatcher creed that has dominated the Tory party since her reign. The party is stranded on a far shore, with too few believers ever to return to power on a raft of those old ideas. The Thatcher revolution of 1979 left a long legacy, its chickens coming home to roost one by one. Just about every one of her totemic policies is profoundly unpopular now. Sewage has been such a good metaphor for utility privatisations, with energy companies equally reviled. The loss of 4m council homes, unreplaced, is keenly felt. The \u201cbig bang\u201d ignited dangerous dependence on finance and an explosion in obscene top salaries. Her industrial sabotage still resonates in desolate, left-behind zones; industrial policy, meanwhile, is popular, with investment in green growth, gigafactories, wind turbines, carbon capture and green hydrogen no longer dismissed as \u201cpicking winners\u201d. Only old ideologues believe Thatcher\u2019s mantra that all this should be \u201cleft to the markets\u201d. Her outsourcing of services deliberately avoided trade unions, cementing the bottom half of wages to the floor. She caused inequality to soar, never to return to its 1970s level, with hard-won working rights lost to zero-hours contracts, a gig economy and freelance insecurity. Yet, despite the recent strikes, more people think unions play a positive rather than a negative role in Britain today. David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s austerity was inspired by Thatcher: the smaller the state the better, they insisted. For decades, the UK collected far less tax than equivalent EU countries \u2013 and now pays a heavy price in a failing NHS, social care, education and everything else. But Tory MPs are blind to the seismic change in public attitudes: they put their faith in Sunak\u2019s promised tax cuts as the party\u2019s salvation, expecting a 2p income tax cut next March, and demanding more. Polling in key seats shows that that is no life raft, however. Just 12% prefer cutting taxes and spending less on public services, with 38% wanting to keep tax and spending as they are. Another 36% want taxes raised, with more spent on public services. Labour will be wary of trusting such public altruism, but it shows an extraordinary shift in sentiment, with Labour being more trusted on solid economic management. After the crash, austerity, Brexit and Covid, the public is rejecting old Thatcherite nostrums. Michael Ashcroft\u2019s polling for the Mail on Sunday shows that people are most concerned about the cost of living and the NHS, followed equally by the economy and climate change. Yet the current Tory trope is that net zero should be dropped as unpopular. Immigration is not in the top five issues, with Brexit now marked as a negative against the Tories, says Ashcroft. Brexit broke their party and it may take a political generation to get it out of their bloodstream, while the young who voted overwhelmingly to remain will not forgive or forget. Brexit\u2019s only blessing is that it may have vaccinated the UK against the nationalist populist wave sweeping some countries. Now Britain has seen the Brexit fallout, even if not quite Bregretters, it\u2019s hard to imagine any UK demagogue winning on an isolationist, Little England, pull-up-the-drawbridge message. Courtesy of Boris Johnson, we\u2019ve been there, done it, and learned our lesson. Onward, a Tory one-nation thinktank, warns of the party\u2019s existential collapse. Millennials are the first demographic cohort not to become more likely to vote Conservative as they age, they find, and \u201cthis situation is worsening.\u201d Each cohort is more educated, and the more educated are less likely to vote Tory, or turn Tory later, either. Campaign group Next Gen Tories, trying to win that cohort back, says: \u201cAge is the new dividing line in politics. It is now a stronger indication of voting intention than class, gender or race. For every 10 years younger a person is, they are nine points less likely to vote Conservative.\u201d It is a culturally different generation: more green, less capitalist as they have less capital of their own, sunk by childcare costs, needing good, affordable state nurseries and services. Though none of this guarantees the permanent triumph of social democracy, Labour needs to seize the monumental meaning of this turning point. This is not 1997, when Thatcherism still had to be accommodated. This is 1979 reversed. Don\u2019t expect the speakers contending to be their idol\u2019s heir at Monday\u2019s Margaret Thatcher conference to face the fact that Thatcherism is finally dead, her policies electorally toxic. The party that selected Johnson and Liz Truss, the party with Suella Braverman as home secretary, will be a long time recovering. The party in which every candidate to be an MP has to worship at the Thatcher shrine may take many election losses to flush Thatcherism and Brexit out of their veins before they can re-emerge as an electably modern, internationalist, one-nation Conservative party.

Videos taken on Ukrainian-held and Russian-occupied sides of the Dnipro where the reservoir used to be, show skulls scattered in the ooze, one wearing a second world war helmet. The footage could not be independently verified due to fighting in the area. Historians say some of the remains may be of people who died in a huge battle fought 80 years ago over the same terrain now at the centre of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive against Russian occupation, around Nikopol and Kamianka-Dniprovska. The Battle of the Dnipro (or Dnieper, in the Russian version) was the focus of one of the biggest military operations of the second world war, the Soviet army\u2019s counterattack against the German army, involving more than 6 million troops. In late 1943, the focus was on Nikopol, on the right bank of the river, the site of metal ore mines that Hitler was determined to hold on to. Today, Nikopol is a frontline town held by Ukrainians, looking across the mudflats where the reservoir was and the Dnipro, at the occupied town of Kamianka-Dniprovska and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In late 1943, the Wehrmacht struggled to hold out against troops of the Soviet Southwest Front, led by Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, and they were forced to abandon the town in February 1944. Andrii Solonets, a historian at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, said: \u201cThe losses of Soviet troops ranged from 30,000 to 60,000 people. The losses of German and Romanian troops were up to 20,000 people. So in theory this video showing the helmet and skull could be linked to those events.\u201d An expert on German military relics in Ukraine, Oleksii Kokot, said that while dead Red Army soldiers were buried in the ground, \u201cdead German soldiers were just left lying in the fields \u2026 therefore, these could really be German soldiers\u201d. Many of the German bodies were left lying in marshes, which were then submerged with the building of the Nova Kakhovka dam in 1956. Recovering the Wehrmacht remains would involve the German War Graves Commission, but that may have to wait until the current war on the Dnipro has ended."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-mayor-sees-opportunity-chaos-nova-kakhovka-collapse-local-history-dnipro-river", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "\u2018We can rebuild\u2019: Ukrainian mayor sees opportunity amid dam chaos", "lead": "Fearing Nova Kakhovka could one day collapse, Andrii Seletskyi began project on local history in 2020.

The young mayor\u2019s town is 60 miles (97km) north-east and upstream of the now ruined Nova Kakhovka dam, and he does not know where the riverwaters will finally settle. It is a prospect that would prompt many to despair. But not Seletskyi, even though last week\u2019s events will bring a dramatic change in the geography and hydrology of his town, Novovorontsovka. As a student of history, he has been thinking ahead and sees opportunity amid the chaos. \u201cIn depth, the water has gone out over five metres; in width it is going out about 50 to 70 centimetres an hour,\u201d the mayor says, standing on the old riverbank as the falling levels leave behind a bed of silty mud and a dominating musty, rotten smell. \u201cIt would be far worse if it was warmer,\u201d he adds; the temperature has dropped about 10 degrees today and a rain storm sweeps in. In his office Seletskyi explains further. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the water will stop,\u201d he begins, but then he heads to the wall and the past to offer a prediction. \u201cIn 2020, we started a project of local history, and we bought from the United States aerial photographs taken by the Luftwaffe in 1943.\u201d These showed the topography of the region before Nova Kakhovka was completed in 1956. He started the project because he believed \u201cthere would be an emergency or explosion and the dam could be damaged\u201d, but says no one took him very seriously. The regional governor in Kherson was completely dismissive until after the disaster, says Seletskyi. \u201cHe called up and said: \u2018Can you show me those plans again?\u2019\u201d Before the dam was completed, there were a series of smaller rivers lying in a floodplain, the nearest of which was the Bystryk. Its banks were 1km away from Novovorontsovka, Seletskyi says, pointing out the distance on the wartime photograph. The retreat of the Dnipro will require the town to find other water sources, he says, as he does not expect the dam to be rebuilt. There is no immediate water crisis, fortunately, but to ensure a sustained long-term supply, engineers will have to complete pumping works on two remaining usable wells before an existing reservoir runs dry \u2013 assuming, that is, the town can get the money its needs to complete the work. Money has been promised by Kyiv but the project could take six months or more, Seletskyi says. Complicating the picture further is the fact that the water infrastructure and Novovorontsovka remain in range of Russian guns across the river. Fear is as much of a problem as the danger of enemy shelling. \u201cThe day before yesterday, workers trying to repair water pipes evacuated a couple of times because they thought that river gulls flying towards them were Russian drones,\u201d Seletskyi says. Mines from the current war and even old explosives from the second world war remain a danger \u2013 specialist teams have been deployed five times so far to tackle contemporary and historic weaponry. The Dnipro was scene of a vast battle in late 1943, and military helmets and skulls, thought to be from that time, have ghoulishly appeared on the surface of the mud left be the receding waters. Seletskyi hopes it may be possible to create a local museum of all the objects rapidly being uncovered. \u201cWe have a unique opportunity to dive into our history,\u201d he says \u2013 and a duty to ensure that people do not steal or sell the artefacts that are revealed.

Huafa Tianfu, a developer in the eastern city of Hangzhou, has been offering up to a kilo of gold bullion to tempt people into buying its flats. According to local media reports, the amount of gold ranges from 700g of gold for an 89 sq metre flat, to just over 1kg for a 100 sq metre apartment. Property prices in the development range from 2.2m yuan (\u00a3245,500) to 2.5m yuan. The promotion does not state the purity of the gold, but if it were 24 carat the 1kg bar would be worth about 450,000 yuan, or 18% of the value of the accompanying flat. Another developer in the city has launched a similar promotion, offering free decoration services, parking spaces, up to five mobile phones and a 10-year stay on management fees to prospective buyers. The stunts come as developers struggle to rebuild confidence in a market that has been hammered by three years of economic pain. On Monday, the US bank Goldman Sachs said China\u2019s property sector was likely to experience \u201cpersistent weakness\u201d for years, especially in smaller cities. After signs of a moderate recovery earlier in the year, property has slumped. In a survey of 40 cities by China Index Holdings, an independent real estate company, new home sales during the five-day Labour Day holiday in May were 22% below their pre-pandemic average. In third- and fourth-tier cities, sales were down by 42%. Part of the reason that property developers are struggling to shift stock is that several cities, in an effort to stabilise the market, have banned developers from cutting prices. But investors do not expect such price floors to stay in place and predict property prices will fall, says Dan Wang, the chief economist in China for Hang Seng bank. \u201cThere is simply not enough demand to sustain high prices,\u201d Wang added. Young people, faced with a bleak jobs market, have been putting off home buying and other life milestones \u2013 such as marriage and children \u2013 that may necessitate moving out from their parents\u2019 homes. Another significant factor weighing down on the real estate sector, which makes up 20-25% of GDP, is the spectre of a property tax. In April the government announced that it had completed a national registration system for 790m properties, allowing it to figure out who really owns them. The registration system is the first step towards a proposed property tax that would provide much-needed cash for China\u2019s heavily indebted local governments. The policy has been piloted on mansions in Shanghai and Chongqing but technical \u2013 and political \u2013 barriers have previously prevented it from being rolled out more widely. A property tax is a \u201cnuclear weapon equivalent in housing markets\u201d, said Wang, adding that it could cause house prices to drop by 50%. In China there is the added complication that it would expose the number of homes owned by government officials. However, with the local government\u2019s revenue stream from land leases drying up, many analysts see the tax as inevitable, making property a less attractive investment in the near term. All this means that even the offer of solid gold is not enough to convince most would-be homebuyers. And several customers have complained that after buying a flat from Huafa Tianfu, their gold failed to materialise. A sales representative for the firm told Chinese media that fluctuating gold prices made the bars hard to come by."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/12/crispin-odey-asset-management-name-removed-hedge-fund", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "Crispin Odey\u2019s name to be removed from hedge fund he founded", "lead": "Odey Asset Management plans complete rebrand after Tory donor forced out over misconduct claims", "author": "Rupert Neate", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T14:43:46Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080311", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4325aa6077a8b63c86d926be5457cbff52b48094/0_43_4000_2399/500.jpg", "body": "Crispin Odey\u2019s name is to be permanently removed from his eponymous \u00a33.5bn hedge fund after he was forced out of the firm by its board over the weekend after allegations of sexual misconduct by him against junior female members of staff.

It is understood the Odey name will be completely stripped from the firm, which operates from a townhouse in Mayfair, as soon as this week.

The mother of three received the medication under the \u201cpills by post\u201d scheme, which was introduced during the Covid pandemic for unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks, after a remote consultation. Prosecutors said the woman had knowingly misled the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) by saying she was below the 10-week cut-off, when she believed she was about 28 weeks pregnant. Doctors later concluded the foetus was from 32 to 34 weeks\u2019 gestation (between seven and eight months) at the time of termination. In England, Scotland and Wales, abortion is generally legal up to 24 weeks but is carried out in a hospital or clinic after 10 weeks. The woman, 44, pleaded guilty in March under the Offences against the Person Act, legislation that dates back to 1861, and will serve half of her 28-month sentence in custody and the remaining under licence. Originally, she had pleaded not guilty to a charge of an offence of child destruction. The judge in the case said the woman felt \u201cvery deep and genuine remorse\u201d and was racked with guilt and plagued by nightmares over her actions. Justice Pepperall said: \u201cThis case concerns one woman\u2019s tragic and unlawful decision to obtain a late-term abortion. In my judgment your culpability was high \u2026 because you knew full well your pregnancy was beyond the limit of 24 weeks, and you deliberately lied to gain access to telemedical services. \u201cI accept that you feel very deep and genuine remorse for your actions. You are racked by guilt and have suffered depression. I also accept that you had a very deep emotional attachment to your unborn child and that you are plagued by nightmares and flashbacks to seeing your dead child\u2019s face.\u201d He added that if the woman had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity at magistrates court, the custodial sentence could have been suspended. The number of women and girls facing police investigations and the threat of life imprisonment under current abortion laws has risen over the past three years, according to BPAS. In 2022, a woman who used abortion medication in a failed attempt to end her own pregnancy was reported to the police by her medical team. Stoke-on-Trent crown court heard how the woman discovered she was pregnant in December 2019 before arranging a telephone consultation with BPAS in May 2020. She took the medication at home, and was later admitted to hospital after calling emergency services. Police were called to her bedside by hospital staff. The prosecution said the woman told police in an interview that she had lied to BPAS about how far along her pregnancy was to obtain the pills. The court also heard that the woman had made Google searches, including: \u201cI need to have an abortion but I\u2019m past 24 weeks\u201d and \u201cCould I go to jail for aborting my baby at 30 weeks.\u201d There was no sign the foetus took an independent breath, according to the coroner\u2019s report. The judge said there were no sentencing guidelines for the offence, but that the maximum sentence was life imprisonment. The defence, Barry White, said the woman needed \u201cfamily and support\u201d rather than a jail term. A mitigation plea was sent to the judge in April 2023 signed by groups including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives. \u201cWe plead to Your Honour to consider leniency in this case \u2026 we are fearful that if the case before you receives a custodial sentence it may signal to other women who access tele-medical abortion services, or who experience later gestation deliveries, that they risk imprisonment if they seek medical care,\u201d it said. The judge said the letter was \u201cinappropriate\u201d, adding that he \u201cdoes not accept that imprisonment in this case is likely to deter women and girls from lawfully seeking abortion care within the 24-week limit\u201d. After the sentencing, Clare Murphy, the chief executive of BPAS, said she was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the custodial sentence, adding: \u201cIn their sentencing remarks, the judge made it clear that women will only be protected from prosecution if MPs bring forward legal change. There has never been a clearer mandate for parliamentary action, and the need has never been so urgent. \u201cOver the last three years, there has been an increase in the numbers of women and girls facing the trauma of lengthy police investigations and threatened with up to life imprisonment under our archaic abortion law.\u201d Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, said: \u201cI am devastated for the woman at the centre of this case, and for her children, who have been forcibly separated from their mum \u2026 \u201cThis conviction serves no one, not her, not her children, not the public interest. All it does is punish a woman for seeking healthcare in the middle of a pandemic and risk deterring women who want or need an abortion from seeking that care in future. No one deserves to be criminalised for seeking healthcare, which is a human right.\u201d The Labour MP Stella Creasy said: \u201cIt is an hangover from another era that our abortion laws are based not on healthcare considerations, but first and foremost criminal sanctions. \u201cThis case shows that the failure to address this has very real modern-day implications. In the light of repeated attacks on women\u2019s rights and the lack of compassion this case shows, it\u2019s never been more urgent to ensure it is a formal human right of all women in the UK to access a safe, legal and local abortion if she chooses.\u201d In his sentencing remarks the judge made reference to Sarah Catt who in 2012 was originally sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment after aborting her unborn baby within a week of a due date, although her sentence was reduced to three and a half years on appeal."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/12/low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltn-may-lead-people-drive-less-london", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Low-traffic neighbourhoods may lead people to drive less, data suggests", "lead": "Residents in London borough cut their driving by nearly a mile a day after LTNs introduced, says study", "author": "Peter Walker Acting deputy political editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T14:30:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080316", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/da955250434624c6cc81f62695ceee395368ff5c/0_301_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "Low-traffic neighbourhoods seemingly can prompt residents to drive less, with a study showing people in one London borough cut their driving by nearly a mile a day on average after LTNs were introduced. While the research covers only four LTNs created in 2020, it is potentially significant because it contradicts the objection from opponents of the schemes that they make people drive further on less direct routes. It comes at a crucial time for the future of the schemes, with the Department for Transport under Mark Harper appearing unsympathetic towards them after negative coverage in some newspapers. Filters on smaller residential streets that allow bike and pedestrian access but prevent through-traffic by motor vehicles have been used in the UK for decades, but became controversial after a number were installed at the start of the Covid pandemic, branded as LTNs. Proponents say they make smaller roads quieter and more tempting for walking and cycling, and also make it less convenient to drive, thus prompting a shift in behaviour by some people for briefer trips. Opponents say they simply lengthen and displace motor vehicle journeys. The new study, published in the journal Transport Findings, used mileage data logged as part of MOT tests from thousands of vehicles in Lambeth, south London. It showed an average decline in driving of 0.7km (0.4 miles) a day for every vehicle inside LTNs, two years after they were installed, compared with a rise of 0.6km for streets 200 metres or more outside their boundaries, for a net 1.3km (0.8 miles) reduction, or 6.4%. The authors of the study, led by Dr Anna Goodman, an epidemiologist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the increase in average driving outside the LTNs appeared to be due to Covid and other external factors, rather than people skirting the LTNs. People living the closest to the LTNs, within 200 metres of their edges, who would be expected to be most affected by such changes to driving trips, recorded an increase in their average driving levels, but by less than those further away. The study, also involving academics from the University of Westminster and Imperial College London, linked the mileage data logged in annual MOT tests \u2013 mandatory for all cars or vans three years old or more \u2013 with information about residents\u2019 parking permits to estimate average distances driven each year per vehicle. This was initially calculated for 2018 to 2020, to take into account the position before the LTNs were installed, and then between 2021 and 2023. The data covered just over 8,500 cars and vans for the first period, and more than 10,000 for the second. Adding to the expectation that the net reduction in driving was caused by the LTNs is the fact that the data from 2018 to 2020 showed no difference in trends between the areas subsequently covered by the zones and those outside. Similarly, the decrease in mileage was seen in households with the same vehicle registered in 2020 and 2023, indicating the change was not caused by people who drive more frequently simply moving out but by a change in behaviour. The areas within and outside the LTNs had largely similar demographic and socioeconomic profiles, while the changes in driving were seen in more deprived and more affluent areas, the study found. The overall 1.3km-a-day reduction covers all journeys, including longer-distance ones, meaning the effect on reducing local car and van trips could be even greater. Goodman said: \u201cTo achieve an estimated 6% relative decrease in total annual driving is really impressive. Moreover, for shorter and more local trips it is plausible that the relative decrease in residents\u2019 driving is even greater than 6%. \u201cThis matters because, while reducing driving of any type is good news in terms of carbon emissions, reducing driving within cities brings large additional health benefits in terms of air pollution, noise and road safety.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/12/trump-civil-war-chances-documents-indictment", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "There will be no civil war over Trump.

In a Saturday speech to the Georgia Republican party, Trump characterized the entire American justice system as deployed to prevent him from winning the 2024 election. \u201cThese people don\u2019t stop and they\u2019re bad and we have to get rid of them. These criminals cannot be rewarded. They must be defeated.\u201d Once again, Trump is demanding that Americans choose sides. But in his deranged mind, this \u201cfinal battle\u201d is not just against his normal cast of ill-defined villains. It is between those who glorify him and those who detest him. It will be a final battle over \u2026 himself. \u201cSEE YOU IN MIAMI ON TUESDAY!!!\u201d he told his followers on Friday night in a Truth Social post, referring to his Tuesday arraignment.

At the Georgia Republican party convention on Friday night, the Arizona Republican Kari Lake \u2013 who will go to Miami to \u201csupport\u201d Trump \u2013 suggested violence. \u201cIf you want to get to President Trump, you\u2019re going to have to go through me and you\u2019re going to have to go through 75 million Americans just like me,\u201d Lake exclaimed to roaring cheers and a standing ovation. \u201cMost of us are card-carrying members of the NRA,\u201d the National Rifle Association gun lobby. \u201cThat\u2019s not a threat, that\u2019s a public service announcement.\u201d Most Republicans in Congress are once again siding with Trump rather than standing for the rule of law. A few are openly fomenting violence. The Louisiana representative Clay Higgins suggested guerrilla warfare: \u201cThis is a perimeter probe from the oppressors. Hold. rPOTUS [a reference to the real president of the United States] has this. Buckle up. 1/50K know your bridges. Rock steady calm.\u201d Most other prominent Republicans \u2013 even those seeking the Republican presidential nomination \u2013 are criticizing Biden, Merrick Garland and the special counsel Jack Smith for \u201cweaponizing\u201d the justice department. All this advances Trump\u2019s goal of forcing Americans to choose sides over him. Violence is possible, but there will be no civil war. Nations don\u2019t go to war over whether they like or hate specific leaders. They go to war over the ideologies, religions, racism, social classes or economic policies these leaders represent. But Trump represents nothing other than his own grievance with a system that refused him a second term and is now beginning to hold him accountable for violating the law. In addition, the guardrails that protected American democracy after the 2020 election \u2013 the courts, state election officials, the military, and the justice department \u2013 are stronger than before Trump tested them the first time. Many of those who stormed the Capitol have been tried and convicted. Election-denying candidates were largely defeated in the 2022 midterms. The courts have adamantly backed federal prosecutors. Third, Trump\u2019s advocates are having difficulty defending the charges in the unsealed indictment \u2013 that Trump threatened America\u2019s security by illegally holding (and in some cases sharing) documents concerning \u201cUnited States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack\u201d, and then shared a \u201cplan of attack\u201d against Iran. Republicans consider national security the highest and most sacred goal of the republic. A large number have served in the armed forces. Trump\u2019s own attorney general, Bill Barr, said on Fox News Sunday that he was \u201cshocked by the degree of sensitivity of these documents and how many there were, frankly \u2026 If even half of it is true, then he\u2019s toast. I mean, it\u2019s a very detailed indictment, and it\u2019s very, very damning. And this idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch-hunt, is ridiculous.\u201d None of this is cause for complacency. Trump is as loony and dangerous as ever. He has inspired violence before, and he could do it again. But I believe that many who supported him in 2020 are catching on to his lunacy. Trump wants Americans to engage in a \u201cfinal battle\u201d over his own narcissistic cravings. Instead, he will get a squalid and humiliating last act.

Regardless, the London gallery clearly saw a need to update their offering to reflect how the story of contemporary British art has evolved \u2013 and to encompass the many important players who had previously been left out. Familiar names such as Tracey Emin and Antony Gormley remain, but they are now on an equal footing with less exposed artists such as Donald Rodney and Ingrid Pollard. One particularly exciting addition is the little-known Pakistani-born artist Hamad Butt, whose striking 1990 installation Transmission has been given a whole room. Created at the height of the Aids epidemic in Europe and the US, Transmission evokes multiple terrors. Donning safety goggles at the entrance, you encounter a darkened space with nine open glass books, lit by UV lamps, arranged in a circle on the floor as if for some cabalistic ritual. Through the eerie glow, an etching looms on each book of a triffid, the giant carnivorous plants that overrun Earth after a blinding meteor shower in John Wyndham\u2019s 1951 sci-fi novel The Day of the Triffids. On the wall, nine cryptic statements pronounce things like: \u201cWe have the eruption of the Triffid that obscures sex with death\u201d and \u201cWe have the blindness of fear and the books of fear\u201d. The piece explores fears of the foreign invader, of deadly desire (through the distinctly phallic-looking triffid), of literal blindness as well as blind faith, the open tomes recalling a madrasa or a witch\u2019s coven. Butt attended Goldsmiths College in London alongside many of the Young British Artists (YBAs), yet blazed his own trail in his brief life, cut short by Aids. He created lyrical, dangerous works around themes that still preoccupy us today: precarity, the spread of viruses, homophobia, racism. \u201cI honestly think Hamad Butt is the closest thing I\u2019ve met to a genius in my life,\u201d says Stephen Foster, former director of John Hansard Gallery in Southampton, who staged a 1992 show of Butt\u2019s work. For the director of Whitechapel Gallery, Gilane Tawadros, who has championed Butt since the 1990s, what distinguishes him is \u201cthe way he seamlessly weaves popular culture, scientific knowledge, artistic understanding and social and cultural insights into works which are poetic and edgy, and completely unlike any others made by his contemporaries at the time.\u201d Tate\u2019s rehang positions Butt\u2019s work as a linchpin in British contemporary art. Transmission is sandwiched between a 1990s room featuring the work of YBAs alongside artists such as Sutapa Biswas and Mona Hatoum, and another spanning the 2000s to the present that showcases artists such as Rene Mati\u0107 and Kudzanai-Violet Hwami. \u201cThere was so much about Transmission that was of the 1990s moment but still so incredibly relevant to questions being raised in contemporary British art,\u201d says curator Nathan Ladd. \u201cEven the title Transmission felt such a pertinent and poetic metaphor for this global pandemic we\u2019ve all gone through.\u201d So why haven\u2019t we heard of Butt before? His lack of visibility is partly due to the complex and hazardous nature of his works, and the fact he died in 1994 aged 32, when the YBA phenomenon was in full swing and institutional interest was dominated by their eye-catching, confrontational art. Butt\u2019s profile is set to rise, however, with at least two museum shows in the offing and a scholarship under way around his artistic output. Born in Lahore to strict Muslim parents, Butt was the second of five children. The family moved to England in 1964. As a child, he would cover walls and cupboards with paintings and drawings, which his parents would take down, struggling to see art as a viable career option, his brother Jamal says. Butt\u2019s journals from that time reveal his emotional turmoil as he sought to reconcile his sexuality and desire to pursue art with his religion and his family\u2019s expectations of a career in science. A degree in biochemistry to placate his parents was soon dropped. Butt attended Goldsmiths from 1987 to 1990, during which time fellow student Damien Hirst organised the storied 1988 warehouse show Freeze which launched BritArt. But his work was never an easy fit. \u201cHamad could in that period have been seen as almost not relevant to those who expected things to be spelled out in a very clearcut way,\u201d says Butt\u2019s former tutor Sarat Maharaj. \u201cHis subtlety and the deliberate opacities and obscurities of his work must have baffled quite a lot of people.\u201d Transmission was first shown in June 1990 for Butt\u2019s degree show. That version featured the glass books, a video of a triffid and a wall cabinet containing fly pupae and sugar-soaked paper written with the nine enigmatic statements. The flies hatched, ate the paper and died in a symbolic performance of human history, repeating \u201can endless cycle of information being literally eaten, digested and passed on\u201d, as Butt explained in a home video made by Jamal. Butt reportedly destroyed his fly piece and since then Transmission has only been shown without the insect component. In July 1990, Hirst exhibited his own live fly work A Thousand Years at the exhibition Gambler, curated by the gallerist Carl Freedman. Hirst\u2019s work centred on the fly life cycle as a metaphor for human existence and included a rotting cow\u2019s head and an Insect-o-Cutor. A Thousand Years is arguably Hirst\u2019s most critically acclaimed work and cemented his position as an artist to be reckoned with. He declined to be interviewed for this article. During this period Butt was dealing with HIV-related health issues that he couldn\u2019t share with most of his family. \u201cBeing gay and having Aids were not subjects easily raised among the elder family members, especially in Asian families,\u201d Jamal says. This was before antiretroviral medication became widespread; Aids was perceived as an automatic death sentence. \u201cSadly Hamad was given triple therapy just as his immune system began to shut down.\u201d Aware the clock was running down, Butt threw himself into his next, three-part project, Familiars (1992), for Southampton University\u2019s John Hansard Gallery. Like Transmission, the title is a wordplay, Familiars referring to witches\u2019 demons, sexual intimacy and the halogen family in the periodic table. Where Transmission carried an implicit risk through UV light and glass that could blind and cut, Familiars took the danger to another level. Fascinated by metamorphosis and alchemy, Butt created three elegant sculptures using solid iodine, liquid bromine and chlorine gas. Cradle was a monumental variation on the desk toy Newton\u2019s Cradle, but rather than metal balls that knock against each other, it comprised 18 vacuum-sealed glass baubles filled with lethal chlorine gas which would smash if set in motion. Hypostasis consisted of three vicious-looking bowed glass spears with orange liquid bromine tips. The third work was Substance Sublimation Unit \u2013 a perilous ladder with rungs made from vials containing heat lamps and iodine crystals, which transformed into a gorgeous violet vapour as they were heated, ascending like an otherworldly stairway. Butt\u2019s dark humour is evident in these visceral sculptures that invite participation but can also kill. Once these highly toxic works had been fabricated for the show by scientists at Imperial College, London, Butt and Foster, the gallery director, drove them in a van to Southampton. \u201cWe pulled up at some traffic lights and as I was easing forward very, very slowly, we went over an empty plastic bottle which exploded under my car tire,\u201d Foster recalls. \u201cI nearly died.\u201d In that show the sculptures were fenced off and Foster remembers hanging hazmat suits around the walls \u201cin case anything got released\u201d. In contrast, photos show people drinking and milling around the noxious works when they were displayed in 1994 at the legendary squat-cum-gallery Milch. They were presented a year later with alarms and sensors at Tate\u2019s exhibition Rites of Passage. Even so, the Tate was evacuated at least once over leakage fears. \u201cEverything he touches has got this critical life-death thing about it,\u201d says Butt\u2019s friend the artist Angela Bulloch. \u201cIt\u2019s dicing with death.\u201d In his final years Butt\u2019s close friend, artist and photographer Diego Ferrari, became responsible for installing his work; Butt would sketch out instructions when they met in hospital or in cafes. \u201cHe was fragile, he was losing his life, but he didn\u2019t want pity so we kept working until almost the last month,\u201d Ferrari says. \u201cHe had an incredible sense of his own work. He wanted it to permeate the social tissue, then and in the future. He was very clear about that.\u201d This may yet happen. Dominic Johnson, professor at London\u2019s Queen Mary University, is writing a book on Butt, whose work he considers \u201cthe most sophisticated response we have in British art to HIV/Aids\u201d. \u201cHe produces these environments that are both fearful and seductive, and that just seems so fertile for thinking about sexuality in that moment. At the same time he\u2019s thinking about his own body as a vector of fear, as an HIV-positive body, a brown body, a Muslim-appearing body \u2013 all these other ways in which he\u2019s this fearful outsider figure,\u201d he says. \u201cAll that makes the work very powerful; it\u2019s also really beautiful.\u201d In uniting seemingly opposing ideas such as science and the supernatural, emotion and intellect, the sacred and profane, high art and gothic horror, Butt\u2019s work feels astonishingly fresh and resonant today. Restlessly curious, he understood that science did not have all the answers and was equally invested in art and alchemy. In a poignant moment of Jamal\u2019s home video, Butt laments the disappearance of demons, familiars and magic in the shift from \u201cmedieval alchemical witchcraft to modern rationalistic chemistry\u201d. Despite his weak condition, he laughs, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s this dangerous spirit that I like and think should be revived.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/12/mike-ashley-frasers-group-takes-stake-in-ao-world", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group takes 19% stake in AO World", "lead": "Move to buy \u00a375m of shares in UK\u2019s biggest seller of large domestic appliances", "author": "Mark Sweney", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T14:10:36Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:19:27.080321", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6f2565c6e19d408239de48a577129c3eeaf392b4/710_549_4940_2964/500.jpg", "body": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group has taken an 18.9% stake in the online electricals retailer AO World in a \u00a375m deal involving buying out shares held by the crisis-hit Odey Asset Management.

Fleetwood and Nick Taylor, who was playing in front of a rowdy home crowd at the Canadian Open, were on the fourth playoff hole when the title was decided. Taylor made a 72ft eagle putt to win the tournament, then tossed his putter into the air and jumped into the arms of caddie Dave Markle. He became the first Canadian in 69 years to win the tournament. It was also the longest successful putt of Taylor\u2019s PGA Tour career. \u201cThank you Canada for an amazing atmosphere,\u201d Fleetwood wrote on Twitter after the tournament. \u201cCongrats [to Taylor], what an unbelievable 3 days of golf you\u2019ve just played and what a moment for you and your country! We\u2019ll start again tomorrow. See you at work.\u201d Fleetwood told reporters on Sunday that his performance had encouraged him in the run-up to the US Open, which starts on Thursday. \u201cI played great today, even though I missed some chances, if you like, on those playoff holes,\u201d Fleetwood, who has won six times on the European tour, said. \u201cYeah, it was close. I just have to take the positives from it and start practicing tomorrow. I got a major [starting on Thursday]. So can\u2019t dwell on it too much.\u201d Taylor admitted he couldn\u2019t remember sinking the putt. \u201cI blacked out when that ball went in with Dave. So I\u2019m curious to watch that, what we did,\u201d Taylor said. The last player from Canada to win the Canadian Open was Pat Fletcher in 1954 at Point Grey in Vancouver. Taylor was loudly cheered by Canadian fans during the playoff. \u201cIt was the most incredible atmosphere I\u2019ve ever been a part of and it\u2019s not even close. I think even walking the first tee today, walking to the first green, there\u2019s ovations on every single tee and green,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen Tommy would miss and they would cheer, I kind of felt bad for him. But I knew just how pumped they were and they were trying to put every ounce of energy into it to help me pull it through.\u201d Fleetwood needed a birdie on the reachable par five to win in regulation, but he missed his tee shot right, laid up into an awkward lie in the right rough and two-putted for par to force the playoff in rainy conditions. The players traded birdies on their first time playing No 18 in the playoff. They parred 18 and the par-three ninth before heading back to 18 for what proved to be the deciding hole. Taylor\u2019s tee shot found a divot in the fairway, but he hit his second shot 221 yards to the front of the green, while Fleetwood laid up after his drive found a fairway bunker.

The alleged incident occurred after a rally to mark the anniversary of the 2019 protests for democratic changes in Hong Kong.

The group Hongkongers in Britain said: \u201cAs Hongkongers, we have witnessed first-hand the erosion of civil liberties and the suppression of democratic values in Hong Kong. The right to peacefully protest and advocate for one\u2019s beliefs is a fundamental human right that should be protected and respected by all. \u201cThe assault in Southampton is not only an attack on the individuals involved but also an affront to the principles of democracy and human rights.\u201d The footage showed a group of three men kicking out at, and manhandling, a man and a woman on a street in the city. A sixth person could be seen looking on but did not appear to be actively involved in the altercation. One of the attackers, some of whom were said to be University of Southampton students, could be heard shouting in Mandarin: \u201cHong Kong belongs to China\u201d and waving what appeared to be the Chinese flag. According to Hongkongers in Britain, the incident was an example of the sort of repression of freedom of expression seen in Hong Kong in recent years, brought to British streets. \u201cThe attack on Hong Kong protesters by pro-Chinese Communist party Chinese students in Southampton is an alarming display of aggression and intolerance,\u201d said Simon Cheng, a former British consulate employee and the group\u2019s founder. \u201cIt is a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and the right to protest.

Thank you President.\u201d Within football, as the depth of tributes that poured in from the Italian game\u2019s leading figures show, Berlusconi\u2019s golden era is remembered as a time of progression and modernisation, rather different perhaps to that within political spheres. In many senses, \u201cDon Silvio\u201d was good for football but the game was good to him, too, providing a launch pad for wider ambitions. Still, there are few questions against Berlusconi being a football man. Even as his health and political horizons dwindled, his money and influence helped to make Monza a Serie A club for the first time. That last December he was filmed promising Monza players \u201cnow you will play Milan, Juventus, if you win against one of these top teams, I\u2019ll bring a bus of whores into the locker room\u201d suggested the \u201cbunga bunga\u201d stylings that made him globally notorious had not dimmed. Football established Berlusconi\u2019s worldwide reputation, as the media tycoon who bought an ailing Milan in 1986 and, in choosing Arrigo Sacchi as his coach, soon established a dynasty. Sacchi, with no playing career behind him, was chosen after making the previous backwater of Parma a growing force. Parma beating Milan over two legs in a 1987 Coppa Italia tie made Berlusconi\u2019s decision for him. \u201cWhen he brought me on board, I said to him: \u2018You\u2019re either crazy or a genius,\u2019\u201d Sacchi said on Monday in remembering his \u201cbrilliant friend\u201d. The former shoe salesman proved an inspired choice. The team Ancelotti graced as an attacking midfielder contained three brilliant Dutchmen in Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard at a time of limitations on foreign players, backed by a defence marshalled by Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta and featuring a young Paolo Maldini, all three Milan youth products. A Serie A title was collected at the end of the 1987-88 season before two European Cups in 1989 and 1990, Sacchi\u2019s pressing game overpowering opponents, an attacking style revolutionary within Italian football, where defensive catenaccio had ruled for decades. Milan squeezed their opponents and their all-star attack, Van Basten at an all-too-brief peak, did the rest. In the 1991-92 season, with Fabio Capello having replaced an exhausted Sacchi, whose fire would never burn so bright again, Milan went the league season unbeaten, a run eventually stretching to 58 matches. Milan offered a framework for the great teams that would follow, from Real Madrid\u2019s collection of gal\u00e1ctico superstars to Barcelona under Pep Guardiola. Manchester City\u2019s all-conquering coach has co-opted much of Sacchi\u2019s pressing, based on the Dutch Total Football, honed in a cage built in a gym in the Milanello training complex that Sacchi said was \u201clike being inside the Sing Sing maximum-security prison\u201d. Guardiola has never disguised the influence of Sacchi on his coaching; the two remain confidants, regular dining partners. Meanwhile, for Berlusconi, success in business and football set him on his way to a political career. His move into frontline politics in 1994 came while he was recognised as the owner of the club renowned as the biggest and best in the world. That May, Milan destroyed Johan Cruyff\u2019s Barcelona 4-0 in the Champions League final in Athens, the Dutchmen now out of the picture, Dejan Savicevic, Zvonimir Boban and Marcel Desailly the new leaders. Those bemoaning the overbearing presence of geopolitics within contemporary football may have forgotten that the Forza Italia leader, the four-times prime minister of Italy, his country\u2019s presence in the negotiations before the Iraq War, also happened to own Milan, a club that collected five European Cups under his ownership. Serie A\u2019s dominance of the European game, attracting global audiences to a division where the world\u2019s prime talent had been collated, would pioneer a template followed by Spain\u2019s Liga and the English Premier League. Milan would be overtaken by Juventus and Inter at home, and the English and Spanish clubs in the continental sense, but under Ancelotti\u2019s coaching, with Andrea Pirlo, Andriy Shevchenko and Kak\u00e1, two more European crowns were collected in 2003 and 2007. Berlusconi would remain forthright in his opinions, unafraid of the consequences of making big calls. \u201cWe lost the title because of Ancelotti,\u201d he said in May 2009. Ties were cut soon enough, though bitterness between the pair was not sustained. It was in 2017 that Berlusconi\u2019s Fininvest holding company relinquished control of Milan, diminishing returns ending three decades of glory and, yes, regular scandal, selling to a Chinese consortium that would later default. His love of football would soon enough take him to Monza the year after, back in tandem with Adriano Galliani, his right-hand man at Milan since 1986, who on Monday echoed many within Italian football: \u201cDevastated, speechless, with immense pain, I mourn my friend, the master of everything.\u201d"}]
