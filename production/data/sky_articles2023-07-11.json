No further contact was attempted until 6 June, when the BBC says it attempted to call the complainant on the phone.

He also refused to speculate on when - or if - the presenter could be back on TV.He confirmed that the BBC Group chief operating officer Leigh Tavaziva has been tasked with assessing whether its protocols and procedures are appropriate in light of the case.When asked by the media why no contact was made with the complainant for more than a month, Mr Davie said \"thousands\" of complaints are made and it is \"appropriate\" there is a verification process.He said: \"Some verification of that claim is appropriate once the corporate investigations team has taken something on, they do some due diligence on what is being alleged.\"Because if we work this through, you'd be in a situation where anyone can ring anything in and you're taking that straight to presenters or whatever and having that duty of care issue there and a whole load of issues.\"He would not say if the presenter in question had offered to resign, and when asked if support was being offered to the presenter, he said the corporation was \"excellent\" at offering the right support, and duty of care was one of their \"highest priorities\".Later speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, Mr Davie admitted that there had been, over time, a \"mix of quite difficult and painful affairs and storms, conceding, \"these are clearly damaging to the BBC\".He went on to acknowledge that \"it's not a good situation,\" but said he believes the corporation has been \"as transparent as we can be\".Claims of explicit photos and video calls in underwearThe unnamed male presenter has been accused of paying the youth more than \u00a335,000 for explicit pictures.Live updates: BBC presenter row latestAccording to The Sun, which broke the story last week, the presenter first requested images in 2020 when the youth was 17 and made a series of payments over the years.The youth is now understood to be 20.They reportedly used the money to fund an addiction to crack cocaine that \"destroyed\" their life.It was also alleged the presenter stripped to his underwear during a video call.However, on Monday, the BBC reported a statement from the young person's lawyer, saying their mother's claims were \"rubbish\" and \"totally wrong\".The letter said nothing unlawful or inappropriate took place.

Nearly seven in ten of those deaths were attributed to synthetic opioids like fentanyl and a growing number were linked to xylazine.The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has seized xylazine-fentanyl mixtures in 48 of the 50 US states. And according to the DEA laboratories, in 2022, 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl tablets contained xylazine.Spelling out the scale of the crisis, Dr Gupta said: \"As a physician, I've never seen one this bad, at this scale\u2026 I visited the wound care clinic in Kensington neighbourhood of Philadelphia, one of the hardest hit communities in the nation.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added: \"So what I want everyone to understand is this: if we thought fentanyl was dangerous, fentanyl combined with xylazine is even deadlier.\"Read more:How drug leaves million-dollar streets strewn with bodies'Tranq' designated 'threat to the nation'What is fentanyl? \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:01\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is 'Tranq'? The new drug emerging in America\n\n\n\nThe streets of PhiladelphiaIn March, Sky News revealed the scale of the xylazine crisis in the northeastern city of Philadelphia, where the drug cocktail first emerged, with a report that exposed the true cost of America's evolving drug challenge.On block after block in the Kensington district we saw people suffering from addiction who were increasingly finding their opioid supply was being cut by dealers with xylazine.We saw the open wounds, the rotting skin and the volunteer outreach workers overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge.Speaking to Sky News four months since we visited, one of the volunteers we met said the situation is now much worse.\"The hospitals can't keep the patients comfortable - because of their addiction - to keep them long enough to get the wounds under control,\" Ronnie Kaiser told me.When the wounds caused by the xylazine get to a certain stage, the user may either admit themselves to the hospital or be taken to hospital. But their urge for another 'hit' will often be greater than the recognition that the wounds need to be treated. It is a cruel and vicious cycle of addiction.\"There's always new people and sadly some we've seen for years and, of course, there's some who passed.\" Ronnie said. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSky News visited Kensington in Philadelphia to investigate the impact of Tranq\n        \n\n\n\nThe White House six-point planAccording to Neera Tanden, the domestic policy adviser at the White House, the new six-point plan seeks to: \"Aggressively expand access to prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery support for those with substance use disorders. And [take] bold actions to disrupt the supply of illicit drugs, especially fentanyl that is harming communities or all across the country.\"The plan, released on Tuesday, focuses on six pillars of action: testing, data collection, evidence-based prevention, harm reduction/treatment, supply reduction, scheduling (categorising the drug) and research.The White House's drug policy director, Dr Gupta said: \"We're calling on Congress to fully fund President Biden's historic $46.1bn (\u00a335.7bn) budget request for national drug control programs, including key funding to address illicit fentanyl and emerging threats like xylazine.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nRonnie, who runs the Philadelphia-based charity Angels in Motion, speaking to Sky News earlier in 2023\n        \n\n\n\nThe reaction on the streetsRonnie, who runs the Philadelphia-based charity Angels in Motion, welcomed the fact that the federal government was finally recognising the scale of the crisis.\"Perhaps awareness is there now. It's good that solutions are being looked at,\" she said.But she questioned the practicalities of the proposals: \"Test strips? Why? Do they think the dealer will take the bag [of drugs] back if it comes up positive?!\"\"We need more help with prevention, harm reduction, rehab and recovery houses - these should be the absolute solution now!\" she said.\"Those of us on the ground know that these are the things needed. Unfortunately, I think funding goes to certain people, not so much to the boots on the ground.\"She pointed to the perennial American problem of medical insurance and the 'for profit' medical facilities. Even those living on the streets and suffering from addiction are required to navigate the country's complex health system if they are to stand a real chance of recovery.\"We need federal rehabs, federal recovery houses, the ability for longer rehab stays and definitely all insurances to be accepted at all rehabs,\" she said.\"That's what we need so that all 'for profit' places go away. There are recovery houses that are so bad - throwing people out because they can't find a job to pay fast enough.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsToo late for AmericaIn February, Philadelphia's substance use prevention and harm reduction chief, Dr Andrew Best, warned that cities across America should brace for xylazine and called on the federal government to do more.\"Right now there's no state or federal funding available,\" he told Sky News. \"I don't want this to spread to other cities.\"The new data shows it's too late, and in May the first UK death linked to xylaxine was announced.The Biden administration has also announced plans to disrupt the supply of both fentanyl and xylazine into the country. The precursor products come from China and are mostly converted to tablet or powder form by cartels in Mexico as Sky News exposed earlier this year.The fear now, given the ever-growing supply of xylazine-adulterated fentanyl, is that it will infiltrate other sectors of society.In May, Sky News saw how small-town communities were struggling with accidental fentanyl overdoses by children in schools\n"}, {"_id": "64ad6ece51ac3318d665d2d7", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/deividas-skebas-man-deemed-unfit-for-trial-found-to-have-killed-nine-year-old-lilia-valutyte-in-the-street-12919143", "primaryCategory": "home", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man who killed nine-year-old girl given indefinite hospital order", "lead": "A man who killed a nine-year-old girl by stabbing her in the heart as she played in the street has been given an indefinite hospital order.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 15:47:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:01:34.275543", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-courts-crime_6215502.jpg?20230711150549", "body": "\nA man who killed a nine-year-old girl by stabbing her in the heart as she played in the street has been given an indefinite hospital order.Deividas Skebas was unanimously found to have physically committed the act of killing Lilia Valutyte, despite a court deciding he was unfit to plead or face a conventional trial due to his mental health.Lilia suffered a single stab wound to the chest in Boston, Lincolnshire, on the afternoon of last 28 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nDeividas Skebas outside Lincoln Crown Court in August\n\n        \n\n\n\nShe was playing with a hula hoop at the time.Jurors took around 15 minutes to find Skebas, 23, was the girl's attacker after a two-day trial of the facts at Lincoln Crown Court.The court heard Skebas, from Lithuania, came to the UK for a second time from his home country on 20 July last year and six days later was seen buying a Sabatier paring knife from Wilko in Boston town centre. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nA forensic officer near the scene of the killing\n        \n\n\n\nCCTV footage captured him walking around Boston before running towards Lilia at about 6.15pm as she played with a hula hoop outside the shop where her mother worked in Fountain Lane.He pulled a knife from behind his back before stabbing the girl and running past an off-duty police officer, who was about to follow but stopped after hearing screams.Lilia was pronounced dead at Boston's Pilgrim Hospital at 7.11pm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLilia Valutyte.

Any nation, like Ukraine, that is not a member is not afforded this protection.The overtures to Ukraine are expected to take two, separate forms.Firstly, there will be a commitment by allies in a final communique at the end of the summit to some kind of route for NATO membership that goes further than a general pledge made in 2008 that the door to joining the alliance was open. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nUS President Joe Biden arrives in Vilnius\n        \n\n\n\nAs part of this, allies are expected to ditch a requirement for Ukraine to complete a process known as a membership action plan that involves lengthy political and military reforms.They will also convene the first meeting of a NATO-Ukraine Council, a new arrangement designed to let Kyiv deal with allies on a more equal footing.Read more:Ukraine will be offered 'whole collection of deliverables' at NATO summit, US ambassador saysWhy tensions are escalating at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plantWhy 'steel rain' cluster munitions won't break NATO unityAll this falls well short of a clear invitation to join the club that Ukraine had been seeking.But NATO is an alliance that works by consensus so can only ever move at the pace of the most reluctant - as demonstrated most recently by Turkey's behaviour over a historic bid by Sweden to become a member state.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan only lifted his veto on Swedish membership on the eve of the summit, despite a large majority of allies backing Stockholm's bid.

This was first raised by Mr Biden in an interview with CNN at the weekend.It is not clear whether the allies involved in this initiative - which is separate but complementary to the NATO discussions - will reach an agreement before the summit concludes but Vilnius would provide a timely backdrop to offset Ukrainian disappointment over its NATO aspirations.\n"}, {"_id": "64ad6ed351ac3318d665d2ea", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/six-killed-after-nepal-tourist-helicopter-crashes-near-mount-everest-12918932", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Six killed after tourist helicopter crashes near Everest", "lead": "Six people have been killed in a helicopter crash near Mount Everest after returning from a sightseeing tour.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 14:33:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:01:39.798319", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-nepal-everest_6215464.jpg?20230711143320", "body": "\nSix people have been killed in a helicopter crash near Mount Everest after returning from a sightseeing tour.The aircraft came down on Tuesday morning near Likhu - just north of Nepal's capital Kathmandu.\n\n\n\nFive Mexican tourists and their Nepalese pilot died, according to Kathmandu airport official Teknath Sitoula.Authorities said the victims had already been recovered.The helicopter was operated by Manang Air, which runs tourist flights, search and rescue operations and expedition flights to Everest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The helicopter took off... in good weather,\" said a company spokesperson.\"The weather was not bad.

Nearly seven in ten of those deaths were attributed to synthetic opioids like fentanyl and a growing number were linked to xylazine.The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has seized xylazine-fentanyl mixtures in 48 of the 50 US states. And according to the DEA laboratories, in 2022, 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl tablets contained xylazine.Spelling out the scale of the crisis, Dr Gupta said: \"As a physician, I've never seen one this bad, at this scale\u2026 I visited the wound care clinic in Kensington neighbourhood of Philadelphia, one of the hardest hit communities in the nation.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added: \"So what I want everyone to understand is this: if we thought fentanyl was dangerous, fentanyl combined with xylazine is even deadlier.\"Read more:How drug leaves million-dollar streets strewn with bodies'Tranq' designated 'threat to the nation'What is fentanyl? \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:01\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is 'Tranq'? The new drug emerging in America\n\n\n\nThe streets of PhiladelphiaIn March, Sky News revealed the scale of the xylazine crisis in the northeastern city of Philadelphia, where the drug cocktail first emerged, with a report that exposed the true cost of America's evolving drug challenge.On block after block in the Kensington district we saw people suffering from addiction who were increasingly finding their opioid supply was being cut by dealers with xylazine.We saw the open wounds, the rotting skin and the volunteer outreach workers overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge.Speaking to Sky News four months since we visited, one of the volunteers we met said the situation is now much worse.\"The hospitals can't keep the patients comfortable - because of their addiction - to keep them long enough to get the wounds under control,\" Ronnie Kaiser told me.When the wounds caused by the xylazine get to a certain stage, the user may either admit themselves to the hospital or be taken to hospital. But their urge for another 'hit' will often be greater than the recognition that the wounds need to be treated. It is a cruel and vicious cycle of addiction.\"There's always new people and sadly some we've seen for years and, of course, there's some who passed.\" Ronnie said. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSky News visited Kensington in Philadelphia to investigate the impact of Tranq\n        \n\n\n\nThe White House six-point planAccording to Neera Tanden, the domestic policy adviser at the White House, the new six-point plan seeks to: \"Aggressively expand access to prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery support for those with substance use disorders. And [take] bold actions to disrupt the supply of illicit drugs, especially fentanyl that is harming communities or all across the country.\"The plan, released on Tuesday, focuses on six pillars of action: testing, data collection, evidence-based prevention, harm reduction/treatment, supply reduction, scheduling (categorising the drug) and research.The White House's drug policy director, Dr Gupta said: \"We're calling on Congress to fully fund President Biden's historic $46.1bn (\u00a335.7bn) budget request for national drug control programs, including key funding to address illicit fentanyl and emerging threats like xylazine.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nRonnie, who runs the Philadelphia-based charity Angels in Motion, speaking to Sky News earlier in 2023\n        \n\n\n\nThe reaction on the streetsRonnie, who runs the Philadelphia-based charity Angels in Motion, welcomed the fact that the federal government was finally recognising the scale of the crisis.\"Perhaps awareness is there now. It's good that solutions are being looked at,\" she said.But she questioned the practicalities of the proposals: \"Test strips? Why? Do they think the dealer will take the bag [of drugs] back if it comes up positive?!\"\"We need more help with prevention, harm reduction, rehab and recovery houses - these should be the absolute solution now!\" she said.\"Those of us on the ground know that these are the things needed. Unfortunately, I think funding goes to certain people, not so much to the boots on the ground.\"She pointed to the perennial American problem of medical insurance and the 'for profit' medical facilities. Even those living on the streets and suffering from addiction are required to navigate the country's complex health system if they are to stand a real chance of recovery.\"We need federal rehabs, federal recovery houses, the ability for longer rehab stays and definitely all insurances to be accepted at all rehabs,\" she said.\"That's what we need so that all 'for profit' places go away. There are recovery houses that are so bad - throwing people out because they can't find a job to pay fast enough.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsToo late for AmericaIn February, Philadelphia's substance use prevention and harm reduction chief, Dr Andrew Best, warned that cities across America should brace for xylazine and called on the federal government to do more.\"Right now there's no state or federal funding available,\" he told Sky News. \"I don't want this to spread to other cities.\"The new data shows it's too late, and in May the first UK death linked to xylaxine was announced.The Biden administration has also announced plans to disrupt the supply of both fentanyl and xylazine into the country.

with climate change.Yesterday a new study revealed more than 61,000 people died in Europe last summer as a result of extreme heat.Meanwhile another heatwave is sweeping through southwestern USA, with residents in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Southern California under excessive heat warnings as the mercury looks to soar above 37C.Yesterday forecasters advised people in parts of Nevada and New Mexico to stay indoors.Back in Europe, the heat is also expected to push north briefly, with an area from the Alps to western Poland also seeing temperatures around 10-12C above the average over the weekend.A westward extension of the heatwave across the Canary Isles is also likely later in the week.Although temperatures in southern Europe may dip on Saturday, temperatures will build again from Sunday with the heatwave likely to last much of or all of next week.Sky News's weather producer Joanna Robinson said: \"At the moment Tuesday and Wednesday next week currently look to bring the highest temperatures, with central Spain, Sardinia and parts of Italy all showing areas with temperatures some 10-12C above average.\"She added: \"That would bring highs of 44-45C, but there's time for that to change the closer we get.\"Watch The Climate Show with Tom Heap on Saturday and Sunday at 3pm and 7.30pm on Sky News, on the Sky News website and app, and on YouTube and Twitter.The show

grilled by politicians today, as a secret payments and \"slush fund\" scandal threatens the very existence of RTE.From Champions League final tickets to complimentary flip flops, Sky's Ireland correspondent (and former RTE staffer) Stephen Murphy explains how the crisis is enveloping Ireland's national broadcaster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Ryan Tubridy?Genial, bookish and with a geekish passion for US politics, the 50-year-old Dubliner has risen through the RTE ranks to become the broadcaster's highest-paid star and one of Ireland's most famous faces.He hosts a daily morning radio show and until stepping down in May, presented the world's longest-running TV chat show, The Late Late Show.\n\n\n\n\n\nTubridy has until now been well-regarded by colleagues within RTE, who find him approachable and affable despite his exalted status as the station's favourite son. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what happened?Like the BBC, RTE is funded by a TV licence fee (although it also sells advertising as part of a dual-funding model). So, in the interest of transparency, it publishes an annual list of its top 10 earners.Tubridy has topped that list for years, and was officially paid \u20ac440,000 (\u00a3375,500) in 2021. That may not sound huge by UK media standards, but his pay is considerably more than the likes of Jeremy Vine and Nicky Campbell (who have much larger audiences). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, as part of an audit, it's emerged that the RTE public figures understated Tubridy's earnings by a total of \u20ac345,000 (\u00a3295,000) between 2017 and 2022.The highest-earning star was - unknown to the licence fee-paying public - actually being paid a lot more than everyone thought.And what's more, Tubridy has been criticised for not correcting RTE's published figures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did that happen?Some of the overpayment remains to be explained. But we do know that an unusual deal was struck with a commercial partner and sponsor of The Late Late Show, Renault Ireland, which would pay Tubridy an additional \u20ac75,000 a year for three years in exchange for personal appearances at Renault events.RTE - for reasons yet to be determined - agreed to underwrite the deal, so when the carmaker decided not to renew the arrangement after one year, the station paid Tubridy the remaining \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3128,000). It was routed through a London-based RTE barter account.Barter accounts are commonly used by media companies to trade surplus advertising space for goods and services, rather than just cash. It was, critics say, a blatant attempt to keep the extra payments off the books.But what's the big deal?The revelation of secretive overpayments to a star already earning top dollar, by a cash-strapped broadcaster partly funded by the same public given false wage figures, immediately sparked intense anger both from outside and within the organisation.At the time of the overpayments, staff were being given pay cuts, and resources were being slashed. RTE News correspondent Emma O'Kelly recalls TV remote controls in the newsroom not working, as they couldn't be replaced. \"We are told time and time again that there's no money,\" she said.Yet money was found for topping up Tubridy's wages... and, it would emerge, many other expenses. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe director general of RTE Dee Forbes resigned last month over the Tubridy payments\n        \n\n\n\nSo the Tubridy money was just the start of the revelations?As reviews were announced, and RTE executives appeared before Oireachtas (Irish parliament) committees, lurid details of further barter account spending emerged. There now appeared to be three barter accounts, which were used for lavish expenses.\u20ac138,000 (\u00a3118,061) went on Ireland rugby tickets at the Aviva Stadium. \u20ac111,000 (\u00a394,962) was spent on a client trip to the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, with expenditure on the Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs the same year costing \u20ac26,000 (\u00a322,243).Bizarrely, nearly \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,277) was spent on 200 pairs of Havaianas flip flops for a summer party for clients. Many thousands more went on tickets for Bruce Springsteen, Garth Brooks and Harry Styles gigs, as well as hotels, and expensive restaurant meals.Almost \u20ac8,000 (\u00a36,844) was allocated for a Spice Girls concert. \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,711) went on balloons. It was clear, aghast parliamentarians repeatedly said, that the barter account was in fact a slush fund. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nRory Coveney resigned as RTE Strategy Director earlier this month\n        \n\n\n\nHow has RTE defended the spending?The broadcaster says that around \u20ac1.6m (\u00a31.4m) was spent in this fashion, but has to be set against commercial revenues of around \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.37bn) generated from clients over the same period. Despite this, the broadcaster recognises the breach of public trust.The director general of RTE, Dee Forbes, resigned on 26 June over the Tubridy payments. Director of strategy Rory Coveney resigned on 9 July.He was responsible for a failed musical that cost RTE \u20ac2.2m (\u00a31.88m) in losses. Some of the executives' performances before the parliamentary committees have been appalling.Infamously, RTE's chief financial officer Richard Collins told politicians he didn't know what his own salary was.How are the rank-and-file reacting in RTE?Morale has \"gone through the floor\", one RTE journalist told Sky News. \"I didn't think it could have gotten any worse in that place, but it has. People are disgusted over all that's emerged ... there just seems to be no end to it.\"Another senior correspondent told me of finding out about the Tubridy overpayments at the same time RTE was quibbling over a distance of two kilometres in their monthly mileage claim.Hundreds of RTE journalists who are affiliated with the NUJ union protested outside their own newsroom in Dublin, as well as regional offices.It's emerged that after RTE News closed its London bureau office at Millbank in Westminster (where Sky News and others have bases), its then London correspondent Fiona Mitchell, at the height of the Brexit saga, had to record bulletin-leading TV and radio voiceovers in cafe toilets.But at the same time, RTE executives spent around \u20ac8,300 (\u00a37,100) on membership of the exclusive Soho House club for their meetings with clients. The anger among many RTE staff is intense. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nNew RTE director general Kevin Bakhurst \n        \n\n\n\nWhat will happen next?All of this has been trundling on for three weeks.Today, Ryan Tubridy himself will appear before Irish TDs (MPs) to face a grilling over how his overpayments occurred, and why he didn't correct the public record.He will be accompanied by his agent, Noel Kelly, Ireland's showbiz \"super-agent\".Public interest is so intense that pubs across Ireland are showing the hearings like football matches, with one Dublin bar claiming it \"might be your last chance to catch Tubridy on the big screen\".New director general Kevin Bakhurst, an Englishman who has worked at the BBC and Ofcom as well as a previous spell at RTE, has taken over the top post this week and faces a mammoth task to restore credibility and public confidence.He started by immediately standing down the entire executive board. He was also noticeably lukewarm on Tubridy's future at RTE, saying: \"We need to see how this week plays out.\"The Irish government has launched a wide-ranging external review of RTE's governance, amid speculation the broadcaster could be split in two.And ominously, nearly everyone involved in this saga says they expect further financial revelations to emerge. In the words of the new boss: \"I suspect there may be more stuff to come out.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64ad6ed551ac3318d665d2f0", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/twitter-wins-big-name-backer-against-threads-but-its-the-taliban-12918910", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Twitter wins big name backer against Threads - but it's the Taliban", "lead": "Twitter has won the support of a big name backer against fast-growing rival Threads - but it's the Taliban.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 11:06:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:01:41.643750", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-anas-haqqani-elon-musk_6215134.jpg?20230711100113", "body": "\nTwitter has won the support of a big name backer against fast-growing rival Threads - but it's the Taliban.A leader of the hardline Islamist group, which seized power in Afghanistan in summer 2021, said Elon Musk's platform was a tolerant place that allowed freedom of speech to thrive.\n\n\n\nAnas Haqqani offered his endorsement in a tweet on Monday, as it emerged that Meta's new Twitter-like platform had amassed more than 100 million users in less than a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n                This content is provided by Twitter, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Twitter cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Twitter cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Twitter cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nIts popularity and brazen similarity to Twitter has irked Musk, who's made his disdain for Mark Zuckerberg clear in several tweets since Threads launched and even threatened to sue.But Haqqani, whose group has banned women from university education, public spaces, and most jobs, said Musk had nothing to worry about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other platforms cannot replace it,\" he said of Twitter, citing its commitment to \"freedom of speech\" and its \"public nature and credibility\".\"Twitter doesn't have an intolerant policy like Meta,\" he added.Sky News contacted Twitter for comment, but only received a customary poop emoji in return.Read more:Taliban 'want to destroy' rights of women and girls \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n4:29\n\n\n\n\n\nCricketer's dream ruined by Taliban\n\n\n\nThe Taliban on TwitterHaqqani, who defended the Taliban's regressive position on women's and girls' rights in a Sky News interview last year, is one of numerous leaders from the regime with a Twitter account.The Taliban had a presence on Twitter before Musk bought the company last October.

Now, I cannot find one as the chaos of Boris Johnson continues to bite at his successor and the economic outlook worsens for the PM.One cabinet minister told me recently Rishi Sunak's head seems to be \"dropping a bit\" - weighed down by the difficulties he is encountering in the delivery of not just one but all of his five pledges.Read more:Why Sunak and Biden are struggling to keep the spark of the special relationship alivePM 'discourages' use of cluster bombs after US agrees to send controversial munitions to UkraineUkraine's rapid accession to NATO unlikely despite major lobbying effort by KyivWhat looked easy - or at least doable - at the start of the year now really doesn't.The inflation he promised to halve remains stubbornly high.

Pic: PA/Elizabeth Cook\n        \n\n\n\nJurors heard how the aspiring actor wrote to the Hollywood star asking for mentorship and was \"dumbstruck\" to receive a call a few weeks later suggesting they meet later that evening.He had been told the American Beauty and The Usual Suspects actor liked \"young, straight men\" but did not know at this point that \"he was a predator\", jurors heard. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his police interview, the man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - said the Hollywood star made him feel \"weirdly special\" by asking him to meet for a beer. The alleged victim was \"starstruck\" and did not question his intentions, the court heard.Giving details of the night of the alleged sexual offence, the complainant said he met Spacey in London at about 11pm and that they walked for about 10 minutes before the actor invited him into his flat.The man told the officer he drank a couple of beers and smoked part of a joint with Spacey. At some point, the House Of Cards star went to hug the man as they sat on the sofa in the living room area, and then rubbed his face into the complainant's crotch, jurors heard.The alleged victim said he remembered looking at the \"bald patch\" on the back of Spacey's head and thinking what was happening was \"one of the strangest moments of my life\" - and something he would \"never forget\".Alleged victim 'conked out'The man told police he was \"very nervous\" and felt \"vulnerable\" during the alleged incident but he did not leave at this point.He questioned his own behaviour, whether he was being a \"d***head\" and if this was just how some people behaved in the \"theatre world\", jurors heard from his police interview.He also did not want to \"annoy\" Spacey, the court was told.\"You just don't want to annoy someone who is that powerful in the business you are trying to break in to,\" the man told the police officer. \"The social sway he had was massive.\"After about an hour at the flat, things started to become \"hazy\" and he \"conked out\", the man told the officer, saying this was \"unusual\".When he woke a few hours later, Spacey was kneeling on the floor, performing a sex act on him, it was alleged.\"Going to sleep isn't something I would normally do - it is unusual in my behaviour just to conk out,\" the complainant told the officer.\"I remember four to five hours later waking up - my belt was still together but my button and my zip were down and he's just performed [a sex act] on me.\"Spacey 'incredibly dismissive'The alleged victim said he told Spacey \"no\" and \"pushed\" him off.\"My belt was still together but the rest of it was undone,\" he told the officer about his trousers. He was \"massively in shock\", the court heard.Spacey then said it was \"best\" that he left and told him not to tell anyone, the man claimed.Becoming emotional in his police interview, the man said he did not know how long the alleged sex offence went on for or exactly what happened while he was asleep.Spacey was \"incredibly dismissive\" afterwards, he added.The complainant said he later \"completely buried\" the alleged incident. Asked by the officer whether he thought about reporting it to police before he eventually did, he said he feared this could have affected his acting career, and that he might have been \"slammed\" by a \"hotshot\" lawyer of Spacey's.\"It's David and Goliath,\" he told the police officer.The man added that while \"your gut tells you\" that you are not \"unique\" and there might have been others, he did not have the \"confidence\" to come forward.The alleged victim said he eventually found the confidence to report the incident when allegations were first made about the now disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in 2017.'Nothing happened that was consensual'Under cross-examination from Spacey's lawyer in court, the complainant answered questions about phone calls on the night of the alleged sexual offence. He denied a call after midnight, lasting 19 seconds, was Spacey calling him after he left the flat - earlier than his account of how long he was there on the night.Mr Gibbs put it to the alleged victim that he had \"upped and left\" without any proper explanation after \"intimate contact\" between the pair.The man denied this. \"Nothing happened that was consensual\", he said.Mr Gibbs later asked if the complainant questioned his sexuality after the alleged incident with the Hollywood actor. He denied this but said the incident had been a \"confusing thing to come to terms with\".Asked about his sexuality and if his way of processing a consensual act might have been to say it happened when he was asleep, the alleged victim said he found the line of questioning \"reprehensible\".Mr Gibbs then asked what the complainant would think of someone who engaged in a sexual act with someone solely in the \"hope of advancing their career\". The man said this would be \"abhorrent\".He told the court that if he was attracted to men he would be happy to explore this, but he isn't. \"The only time I have experienced something sexual with a man is when I was sexually assaulted by that vile sexual predator,\" the man said.Spacey pleaded not guilty in July 2022 to four charges of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.In January this year, he pleaded not guilty to seven further charges -
