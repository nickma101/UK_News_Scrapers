Diana Johnson, the chair of the home affairs committee, says the bill has been \u201crushed through parliament\u201d and agrees that it has become incredibly complicated. It is the failure to process a number of years worth of asylum applications, she says, not the small boats, that are clogging up the asylum system. She calls for an \u201cefficient, speedy asylum claim process\u201d, and cites Germany\u2019s system as a good example. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, says he supports the bill but that the government concessions on child detention are not enough and that there is nothing in the bill on age disputes. Jenrick: -There is no need to amend clause 10 but happy to followup later. Loughton: \u201cI think we may have to. Because that\u2019s certainly not my understanding. There are Henry VII sections in clause 10 which still give ultimate discretion to the secretary of state \u2026 \u201cThis is, I\u2019m afraid, symptomatic of what is the continuing problems with this bill. It\u2019s become so complicated, there are lots of double negatives within it and only last night, at I think 7.45pm, did the government publish their amendments, which we had just a few hours to scrutinise ahead of today. This needs proper explanation \u2026 \u201cThe assurances that we were promised have not materialised \u2026 on that basis I\u2019m afraid we cannot, and I speak for many others I hope on this side, take these amendments in lieu at face value and more work needs to be done.\u201d He says he hopes it will go back to the Lords. Stuart C McDonald, the SNP\u2019s immigration spokesperson, says the bill \u201cshould have alarm bells ringing\u201d and that it is going to be \u201ca disaster\u201d. \u201cIt is a desperate last throw of the dice from a desperate government.\u201d This bill doesn\u2019t need to be amended, he says, it needs to be stopped. Theresa May says if Lords amendment 56 to the illegal immigration bill is overthrown it will \u201cconsign more people to slavery \u2013 no doubt about it\u201d. The Conservative former PM said: We all want to stop the boats \u2026 but this bill is not just written to stop the boats, it covers all illegal migration and its unwritten subtext is the stop-certain-victims\u2019-claims-of-slavery bill. She added: The evidence of the police is clear: if you want victims to provide evidence to bring slave drivers to justice, the victims need time, they need support and they need to be here. The bill, she said, \u201cties the hands of the police\u201d and \u201cundoes the good work of the modern slavery act\u201d. It will consign more people to slavery \u2013 no doubt about it. If Lords amendment 56 is overthrown that will be the impact. She said the minister has shown willingness to look for mitigations but only in guidance. A link to the illegal migration bill, as it was introduced, is here. Amendment 56 says: Clause 21, page 26, leave out line 19 and insert\u2014 \u201c(3A) Subsection (2) also does not apply in relation to a person if the relevant exploitation took place in the United Kingdom. (3B) Where subsection (3) or (3A) applies in relation to a person the following do not apply in relation to the person\u2014 (a) section 22, (b) section 23, and (c) section 24. (4) In this section\u2014\u201d Kinnock says the government has \u201csent more home secretaries to Rwanda than they have asylum seekers\u201d and urges the government to \u201cfix the broken asylum system\u201d as he calls for a general election. Theresa May told the immigration minister Robert Jenrick that he is not using the correct statistics when he claims that modern slavery claims from migrants are rising. The immigration minister told the Commons there were \u201cclear opportunities to misuse modern slavery protections\u201d and that it was \u201cessential that we take steps in this bill to prevent misuse\u201d. He added: \u201cThe NRM [national referral mechanism] referral rate for people arriving in the UK on small boats and being detained for return has risen from 6% for detentions ending in 2019, to 73% in 2021.\u201d May, the former prime minister, said: He knows that I have a problem with the statistics. He has yet again quoted the statistics that the minister in the other place [House of Lords] quotes as well, the rate of which gives the implication that the percentage of people coming on small boats and claiming modern slavery has risen from 6% to 73%. It did not. What he is talking about is people who are subsequently detained for removal. Will he now confirm that the average percentage of people coming on small boats and claiming modern slavery has not changed over the last three years and is around 7%? Jenrick replied: The statistics I have referred to are the most relevant statistics, because this is the point that individuals are in the detained estate for the purpose of removal, their removal from the United Kingdom is imminent, and what we are seeing is a very high proportion of them are using the NRM to try to delay that removal. Stephen Kinnock said later that the government\u2019s use of incorrect statistics \u201cdistorts the debate and plays into the hands of the people traffickers\u201d and runs the risk of turning this bill into a \u201ctraffickers\u2019 charter\u201d. Kinnock said the bill \u201cwill only make a terrible situation worse\u201d \u2013 by increasing the backlog, the cost and \u201censure people smugglers are laughing all the way to the bank\u201d. Asylum seekers are \u201cmelting into the underground economy\u201d, he says, and many of t will never be heard from or seen by authorities again. Withdrawals as a proportion of completed cases have increased from 20% to 50% under the PM\u2019s watch, he said. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, says the Rwanda deportation plan is \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d, and accuses Jenrick of \u201cpettiness\u201d for painting over Mickey Mouse cartoons in an immigration centre. The Rwanda policy must \u201csurely be the most expensive press release in history\u201d. \u201cThis whole sorry tale is a shambolic farce,\u201d he said. The cost of the asylum system is now estimated to be seven times higher than it was under the last Labour government, he says. And the backlog is nine times higher than when Labour left office in 2010. \u201cNumbers are going up, not down \u2026 the prime minister is failing in his pledge to reduce asylum seeker hotel use. \u201cAnd to make matters worse, the National Audit Office has declared that the government will also fail to achieve its aim of clearing the so-called legacy backlog of 92,000 cases by the end of this year.\u201d Robert Jenrick says it is \u201cvital\u201d that the bill reaches the statute book quickly and says Lords amendments are \u201criddled with exceptions and get-out clauses\u201d, urging them to \u201cthink again\u201d. The public, the immigration minister says, \u201cexpects us to tackle this issue\u201d. He says: [The bill] is riddled with exceptions and get-out clauses as currently placed in by the other place. If that happens it will simply not work. We have to send a clear message back to the other place that it is now their turn to think again and to respect the will of the elected house. The public expects us to tackle this issue. Finally, Jenrick says, Lords amendment 104, put forward by the archbishop of Canterbury, is \u201cwell meaning but we don\u2019t believe necessary. It\u2019s a distraction from the immediate priority of stopping the boats and tackling the threat to life.\u201d He says the amendment doesn\u2019t reflect what the government has already done to tackle the refugee crisis and human trafficking, and to respond to crises. \u201cBy getting a grip on illegal migration we aim to reduce the pressure that it places on our public services and on community cohesion and to increase capacity to support those who seek sanctuary here in the UK.\u201d To make the UK \u201can even greater force for good\u201d. Next Jenrick addresses Lords amendment 103 relating to the National Crime Agency (NCA), which he says amounts to \u201clegislative grandstanding\u201d and \u201crisks undermining\u201d the director general. Hilary Benn, the Labour MP for Leeds Central, says one thing that would help stop the boats is to bring forward safe and legal routes. Jenrick says he doesn\u2019t believe this argument will reduce the numbers entering in small boats. The individuals they would allow to arrive by safe and legal routes would be \u201cquite different\u201d. Families and vulnerable people directly from conflict zones and refugee camps as opposed to \u201coffering a safe and legal route to predominantly young men in a place of safety\u201d. Jenrick says new routes will be implemented \u201cas soon as practicable and in any event by the end of 2024\u201d. Robert Buckland, Conservative MP for Swindon South, asks that timeframe for new safe and legal routes be brought forward, saying \u201c18 months hence is an inordinately long time\u201d. \u201cCould we at least have much more of a sense of urgency,\u201d he asks, and to bring forward much earlier than the end of next year. Jenrick says it\u2019s \u201cnot practicable\u201d that new routes could be brought into being within two months of publication of the report, saying it takes time and it\u2019s important to give Home Office needed time. More humanitarian visas were issued last year than any prior government \u201cprobably since the second world war\u201d. Conservative Vicky Ford asks what is maximum amount of time child could be waiting in local authority care? Jenrick: It\u2019s only if local authority care is not immediately available that they will be placed in hotels. \u201cThe only limiting factor is the availability of local authority care to support them\u201d. But, he admits: \u201cIt\u2019s not simple\u201d. Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, asks is it true that he gave order to paint over cartoons in accommodation? Jenrick: \u201cWe provide very high quality care \u2026 We didn\u2019t think the set-up in that particular unit was age appropriate.\u201d Because, he says, majority using it were teenagers. Claims that Cooper\u2019s \u201ccompassion is to a degree performative\u201d because she doesn\u2019t come forward with an alternative. The immigration minister Robert Jenrick says in considering each of the Lords amendments MPs must ensure they don\u2019t \u201cdrive a coach and horses through\u201d what the bill is trying to achieve. The aim, he told the House of Commons, is to stop all children and adults from crossing the Channel. Jenrick said the government thinks the bill is compatible with the refugee convention and international law. We believe that all the matters outlined in this bill are within international legal obligation and should it or any aspect of the bill be legally challenged, we\u2019ll contest that vigorously. Referring to Lords amendment two, which changes the timeframe for the duty to make arrangements for removal, Jenrick said it goes \u201ctoo far in resetting the clock\u201d. He said: The closer we get to commencement of the bill, the greater the risk that organised criminals and people smugglers will seek to exploit this and we will see an increase in crossings as the deadline looms, which only puts more people at risk. To guard against this, we brought forward amendments in lieu which move the application of the duty from 7 March to the date of royal assent. The March date would, however, continue to apply for the purpose of the secretary of state\u2019s power to provide accommodation for unaccompanied children and for the purposes of the bans on re-entry, settlement, and citizenship. This government amendment in lieu has a particular advantage with respect to the concerns expressed by the members for Maidenhead and Chingford (Theresa May and Sir Iain Duncan Smith) with regard to modern slavery. Debbie Abrahams, Labour MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, is urging for a Homes for Afghans scheme to be implemented, similar to Homes for Ukraine. Jenrick said that if it is possible, \u201cthis is something we should consider\u201d. More generally, on resettlement schemes, he said the UK is \u201cone of the world\u2019s leading countries\u201d. MPs are currently considering amendments made by peers to the illegal migration bill. The immigration minister Robert Jenrick says he disagrees with many of the changes proposed. The government brought forward technical amendments in the Lords, he said. But some changes put forward by peers are \u201clittle short of wrecking amends and not one the government can support\u201d, he said. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, \u201ccan\u2019t even successfully negotiate with his own chancellor\u201d, Labour has claimed, saying the government has \u201clost the confidence\u201d of NHS staff striking over pay. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, cautioned in the Commons that the \u201cworst strikes in the history of the NHS are still to come\u201d, and asked: \u201cWhat is the health secretary\u2019s plan now to stop these strikes from going ahead?\u201d Carrie Johnson has announced the birth of her third child with the former prime minister, Boris Johnson. In an Instagram post with a picture of her holding the newborn, Johnson wrote: Welcome to the world Frank Alfred Odysseus Johnson born 5th July at 9.15am. (Can you guess which name my husband chose?!). Am loving every minute of the sleepy baby bubble. Seeing my older two embrace their new brother with such joy and excitement has been the most wonderful thing to see. We are all very smitten. Thank you so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH. They really are the most amazing, caring people. I feel such immense gratitude. Now, can anyone recommend any good series/box sets to binge while breastfeeding? Time for a drink. The government will not sign up to any instrument at the World Health Organization (WHO) that could undermine the UK\u2019s ability to make domestic decisions on public health measures, MPs have been told. Health minister Will Quince\u2019s remarks were in response to Tory former cabinet minister Esther McVey, who raised concerns about the proposed changes to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, currently being negotiated at the WHO. McVey specifically asked whether these amendments would grant new rule-making powers to the WHO director general, potentially allowing binding directions on matters such as border closures, quarantining and vaccine passports. Quince reiterated the UK\u2019s \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to international law but said that, \u201con this matter\u201d, the government has been \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d it will not sign up to any IHR amendments. An update on the Portcullis House atrium roof incident\u2026 (see also 12.17pm) A House of Commons spokesperson said: Teams are currently attending to an issue with the atrium roof in Portcullis House. The central part of the atrium has been cordoned off, with additional safety mitigations implemented to allow us to continue our investigations. Committee meetings are still scheduled to take place, with amended access routes. Catering facilities remain open. Rishi Sunak has \u201ccommended\u201d Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan for supporting Sweden in its Nato membership bid during his bilateral meeting with the Turkish leader. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The prime minister met Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at the Nato summit in Vilnius today. The prime minister welcomed Turkey\u2019s support for Sweden\u2019s accession to Nato and commended President Erdo\u011fan for his efforts. The leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to ensuring the UK-Turkey relationship reaches its full potential, building on growing trade links and strong defence and security cooperation. Discussing opportunities to bolster our bilateral co-operation, including in cutting-edge defence technology and in addressing the shared challenge of illegal migration, the prime minister set out that dealing with criminal people smuggling gangs is a key priority for him. Both leaders agreed to task their foreign ministers to look at areas for closer collaboration on migration and organised crime. The leaders also agreed to deepen intelligence sharing and co-operation on countering terrorism. President Erdo\u011fan updated the prime minister on president Zelenskiy\u2019s recent visit to Turkey and the leaders agreed on the importance of ensuring an extension to the Black Sea grain deal. The leaders agreed to stay in close touch. Downing Street has declined to provide a deadline for the passage of the illegal migration bill through parliament. The PM\u2019s official spokesperson declined to say whether it would be before the summer recess this month, saying: We haven\u2019t set that timeline previously. I\u2019m not going to do so now. We want to move it through as quickly as possible, recognising that of course there\u2019s significant views on either side of the debate. We will listen as we have done here, but our priority remains to secure royal assent. The spokesperson said they were \u201cnot aware of any plans for further changes\u201d to the draft legislation. Campaigners are urging MPs to \u201cstand on the right side of history\u201d by voting against the government\u2019s controversial asylum bill. Refugees, asylum seekers, more than 60 victims of torture and around 30 campaign groups have written to members of the House of Commons to express their \u201chorror\u201d at the bill and urging them to vote against the proposed legislation. It comes as MPs prepare to vote on changes to the illegal migration bill after it came under heavy scrutiny in the House of Lords (see also 9.40am). Rishi Sunak has said he is \u201cthrowing absolutely everything\u201d at preventing Channel crossings by migrants and insisted that his plan to \u201cstop the boats\u201d was working. The letter, sent on Tuesday, said: It\u2019s time for this government to once and for all scrap their inhumane approach to refugees and rebuild the asylum system on foundations of compassion and human dignity ... Finding safety in the UK is an incredible opportunity to rebuild your life. We urge you to not take away this lifeline from the refugees that follow in our footsteps. It is now time for you to stand on the right side of history and oppose this shameful piece of legislation when it returns to the House of Commons. MPs are expected to cast votes from 5pm on the changes, backed by the House of Lords after being defeated 20 times and attracting multiple revisions. On Monday, the Home Office offered some concessions \u2013 including detention time limits for children and pregnant women and removing a clause to prevent the law being applied retrospectively from March. The letter\u2019s signatories, including charities Freedom from Torture, Care4Calais and Refugee Action alongside individuals, said: These cruel plans won\u2019t stop people taking dangerous journeys to find safety in the UK. Instead, this bill closes the door on refugees, punishing people who had little other choice but to risk their life reaching the UK. We know this because when you are fleeing the danger of torture, persecution or war, there is absolutely nothing that can stop you. You are on autopilot. It\u2019s like being in a burning house and finding an escape window. Nothing can deter a human being when they are fleeing for their life. Insufficient consideration was given to the impact of lockdown measures at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, the former Northern Ireland first minister and Democratic Unionist party leader has told the UK Covid inquiry. Arlene Foster said Northern Ireland was left \u201cwithout ministerial cover\u201d by Westminster at a time when the Stormont power sharing institutions had collapsed before the pandemic. The inquiry is hearing from Northern Ireland witnesses this week as it looks at how the UK was prepared for the pandemic before it hit in early 2020. Foster said the emergence of Covid led to fear and panic. She said: It was felt there was a need to lock down in a particular way. I do not think that enough consideration was given to the impact, the non-health impact, and there were many health impacts as well that were not foreseen. The devastating impact that Covid had on so many families in Northern Ireland stays with me because it was a devastating impact, many people lost loved ones in devastating circumstances that have been set out by the bereaved families\u2019 statement. I want to take this opportunity to give them my condolences and my sympathies. A plane of glass has broken in the roof of Portcullis House in parliament, causing water to fall into the atrium. A cordon and warning signs were placed around the area by parliamentary staff, the PA Media news agency reports, with a puddle and broken glass visible on the floor in the middle of the area. Here are some of the images and footage being shared on Twitter: Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, was on the prime minister\u2019s plane to Vilnius: For more on the Nato summit, follow the Ukraine blog: Given the attractiveness of vapes to children, what consideration has government given to banning disposable ones? Barclay: Agrees particular concern, which is why focusing on it in call for evidence, and this is something he is considering. Barclay is asked whether the longer the Conservatives stay in power the longer waiting list times will be. Barclay: \u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite.\u201d The average wait in Wales is longer than in England, he says. \u201cBut we are taking action.\u201d An MP says a constituent has been waiting 14 months for a hysterectomy. What is being done to get waiting lists down to 18 weeks? Barclay: Community diagnostic centres have already carried out 14m tests and scans. Now to the Commons, where the health and social care secretary, Steve Barclay, is answering questions \u2026 \u201cMy trafficker is behind bars, but if the UK\u2019s new migration bill passes, my story would have ended very differently\u201d \u2013 a sex trafficking survivor living in the UK shares their story: I remember the day I decided I was finally ready to report my trafficker\u2019s abuse after the false promise of a job turned into sexual exploitation. It was September 2018, and a woman from the organisation Women at the Well, which provides support to people affected by trafficking, came out to meet me at Starbucks with a notepad. I told her going to the police was the last thing I wanted to do. I worried about what he would do if he found out, if his other victims would be OK, whether I had broken the law and would be deported. But mostly I just wondered if anyone would believe me. My ability to trust people was almost nil: after all, my trafficker had proven to me that I shouldn\u2019t trust anyone. The organisation supported me to report my experiences to the police and begin the recovery process. It also referred me to the Home Office, which recognised me as a potential victim of trafficking and provided me with further assistance, including safe-house accommodation, and legal and subsistence support. Importantly, after the initial decision recognising me as the potential victim of trafficking, I was allowed to stay in the country, at least until the final decision on conclusive grounds was made. What followed was a traumatic four and half years of going through the criminal justice system before my day in court finally came. I remember the usher saying to me: \u201cYou are the single most important person in this room right now, and without you, this trial would not be happening.\u201d In trafficking, generally there is no prosecution without a witness. With my commitment to see justice served, a dangerous man was successfully removed from the streets and sentenced. Here are more details for today\u2019s parliamentary schedule for the House of Commons: 11.30am: health and social care questions 12.30pm: statement from treasury minister Andrew Griffith on financial services 1.45pm: 10-minute rule motion on bullying and respect at work 2pm: illegal migration bill \u2013 consideration of Lords amendments 5pm: votes Sunak has also weighed in on inflation, which he admitted is \u201cproving to be more persistent than people thought\u201d. But, he insisted, this does not mean his ways of dealing with it are wrong. I know things are difficult for many families across the country. The UK is not alone in experiencing a rise in interest rates \u2026 the crucial thing that we have to do is bring inflation down. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to ease the burden for families. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to stop the rise in interest rates. And that\u2019s why my priority is to halve inflation. Of course, that is proving to be more persistent than people thought, but that doesn\u2019t mean the course of action is wrong. We\u2019ve got to stick to it. Rishi Sunak has now arrived in Vilnius (pictured below disembarking from the plane with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly) where Nato summit proceedings kick off today. Defending the government\u2019s defence investment amid suggestions the UK could lose influence as a result of the size of its army, he said: I think the UK should be incredibly proud of the leading role that we play, not just in Nato but across the world, in protecting security and indeed in investing in our armed forces. The summit, he said, was an opportunity to highlight the \u201cenduring unity and importance\u201d of the military alliance \u201cwhich the UK has been at the heart of for the entire time of its existence\u201d. Rishi Sunak has insisted that his plan to stop migrants crossing the Channel \u201cis working\u201d \u2013 despite record numbers. Speaking to reporters on the plane en route to the Nato summit in Lithuania, the prime minister claimed Britain has been \u201cmaking progress so far\u201d and that he has always said crossings would increase over the summer, reports Sky News. Friday saw the highest number of migrants arriving in Britain across the Channel in one day so far this year, with 686 people making the risky journey. He said: I do think the plan is working \u2026 starting to work. You can see that most obviously with the Albanian deal we did. We came in and changed how we processed illegal migrants from Albania, signed a new deal with Albania. We\u2019ve returned almost 2,000 illegal migrants to Albania and you\u2019ve seen a dramatic reduction in the number of crossings. Right. That shows me deterrence works. This, he said, gives him \u201cconfidence that our overall strategy is the right one\u201d. He added: \u201cAnd look, we\u2019re making progress on other aspects of our plan\u201d. He said: The illegal migration bill is an important part of it, it\u2019s making progress through parliament \u2026 [it] represents, I think, the toughest piece of legislation any government has ever put forward to tackle this problem. He added: I\u2019m not going to rest until we resolve this problem. It\u2019s not going to be easy. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. Speaking to the Treasury select committee, Charlotte Harrison, the interim chief executive of home financing at Skipton Building Society, said she expects to see even more \u201cfinancial stress\u201d for customers than previously amid high interest rates. The Treasury select committee is hearing evidence from senior directors at major UK banks on the mortgage market and how it is being affected by rising interest rates (see also 10.12am). Later, at 11.30am, Steve Barclay, the health and social care secretary, and his ministers will be facing questions in the House of Commons. And after 12.30am the Commons will consider Lords amendments of the illegal migration bill (see 9.40am). Priti Patel has said key pillars of the government\u2019s flagship illegal migration bill have been abandoned as a cabinet minister insisted the government could \u201cmake real and clear progress\u201d on stopping small-boat crossings in the Channel. The former home secretary tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cWe were told that the illegal migration bill would \u2018stop the boats\u2019. Key pillars of that bill have now been abandoned.\u201d She also used her Twitter account to highlight the fact that her former department was now spending \u00a3500,000 a day on 5,000 empty hotel beds as a buffer for higher than expected numbers of migrants crossing the Channel. Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the Home Office maintains the buffer in an attempt to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. Two-year fixed mortgage rates in the UK have risen to the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, adding to the pressure on households. A typical two-year deal has risen to 6.66%, up from 6.63% on Monday, according to the data provider Moneyfacts. It is the highest rate since 2008 \u2013 bad news for homeowners whose deals are coming to an end and who need to remortgage soon. It means they will be paying hundreds of pounds more each month. The rise takes the cost of two-year mortgages slightly above the peak of 6.65% reached last autumn, when the borrowing market was rocked by Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s \u201cmini-budget\u201d package of unfunded tax cuts. The average five-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 6.17% on Tuesday from 6.13% on Monday. Moneyfacts said there were fewer deals available; a total of 4,344 residential mortgage products, down from 4,631 on Monday. Savings rates have not risen as fast as mortgage rates. The average rate on an easy access savings account was unchanged on Tuesday at 2.53%. Suella Braverman has said she hopes the amendments to the illegal migration bill will help the \u201ccrucial\u201d new law pass \u201cswiftly\u201d. It will also, the home secretary said, \u201csend a clear message that the exploitation of children and vulnerable people, used by criminals and ferried across the Channel, cannot continue\u201d. Jeremy Hunt has responded to new ONS figures showing that unemployment has jumped above expectations to 4% in the three months to May (from 3.8% the previous quarter). Meanwhile, wages increased at the joint-highest rate on record. The chancellor said: Our jobs market is strong, with unemployment low by historical standards. But we still have around 1m job vacancies, pushing up inflation even further. Our labour market reforms \u2013 including expanding free childcare next year \u2013 will help to build the high-wage, high-growth, low-inflation economy we all want to see. Boris Johnson has offered his congratulations to Sweden after last night\u2019s news that Turkey has agreed to support the country\u2019s Nato bid. The former PM tweeeted: As Rishi Sunak set off for Lithuania for the crunch two-day Nato summit in Vilnius, back home the controversial illegal migration bill will today make a return to the House of Commons. After taking a beating in the House of Lords \u2013 where it has been defeated no less than 20 times \u2013 last night the government was forced to announce new amendments to the proposed legislation, in what is expected to be seen as a win for Tory rebels. Key changes include that the law will not apply retrospectively to migrants who have already crossed the Channel. The Home Office also said it had brought in \u201csafeguards\u201d after being subjected to House of Lords scrutiny. But when it comes to bans on re-entry, settlement and citizenship, the law will still apply retrospectively to those who arrived illegally on or after the date of the bill\u2019s introduction: 7 March. The Home Office said it would ensure the list of definitions of \u201cserious and reversible harm\u201d cannot be changed in secondary legislation. Other changes include that the first tier tribunal can grant immigration bail after eight days to unaccompanied children who have been detained for the purpose of removal. This is a reduction on the proposed 28 days. Pregnant women cannot be detained for more than 72 hours, but that period can be extended to seven days if it is authorised by a minister. MPs will vote on the changes today and on the Lords amendments, which you can find here. I will be looking after the politics blog today.

The declaration will say: \u201cWe will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,\u201d a source told Reuters. The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, has shared a picture of the shuttle bus to the Nato summit in Vilnius, which is plastered with a less than subtle message. Oleksandra Matviichuk, a human rights lawyer and 2022 Nobel peace prize winner, has issued a statement about Ukraine\u2019s potential membership of Nato. She says: The beginning of the actual accession of Ukraine to Nato is a way to end the war, not to expand it. Because \u2018strategic uncertainty\u2019 will always serve as a reason for Russia to continue attacking Ukraine. Therefore, people in Ukraine expect concrete results from the summit in Vilnius. The time for assurances that the door to Nato is open has passed. They should be transformed into decisions that allow starting the process of accession of Ukraine to Nato. Russia has always used wars and occupation of foreign territories as a fait accompli, thereby creating a new reality and forcing the international community to reckon with it. The democratic countries that participate in Nato should finally take the initiative to start managing this process. We have taken security for granted for too long. It is necessary to take responsibility for our common future. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that an air alert has sounded in Sumy and residents have been warned of a missile danger. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Vilnius, Suspilne reports. Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, has filed from Vilnius this wrap up of events so far at the Nato summit: Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Nato leaders of showing disrespect to Ukraine by refusing to offer Kyiv a timetable for when it would be invited to join the military alliance, in a last-ditch effort to win a concession on membership at the start of a two-day summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. The Ukrainian president complained there was \u201cno readiness\u201d to invite Ukraine to join, which gave Russia the opportunity \u201cto continue its terror\u201d by leaving open the possibility to bargain his country\u2019s future membership of Nato in a peace deal. Nato leaders had been due to agree the summit\u2019s final declaration on Tuesday afternoon and release it in the evening, but Zelenskiy suggested he had seen a leak of the final text, complaining that \u201ccertain wording is being discussed without Ukraine\u201d. Ukraine \u201cdeserves respect\u201d Zelenskiy said, and claimed that Nato leaders were going to place extra conditions on the country\u2019s membership, most likely by insisting it undertook anti-corruption and pro democracy reforms. \u201cIt seems there is no readiness neither to invite Ukraine to Nato, nor to make it a member of the alliance,\u201d the president said in a statement published on social media at lunchtime. Nato sources said they believed the Ukrainian leader was engaged in last-minute hard-ball public diplomacy, aimed at prompting a rewrite of the final summit declaration or communique before the gathering closes on Wednesday. Countries in central and eastern Europe have been pressing for firmer commitment to Ukraine\u2019s postwar membership, amid a growing belief that the slow-moving counteroffensive could prompt Kyiv to consider negotiations with Moscow. Ukraine believes Nato membership is the only viable solution to prevent it becoming a victim of future attacks by Russia, but the US and other alliance members fear that allowing Ukraine to join at some future point could be interpreted by Moscow as escalatory. Here are some pictures from the first day of the Nato summit in Lithuania. Air raids sounded in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, shortly after the Nato summit got under way in Vilnius, after Russian warplanes equipped with hypersonic missiles were detected taking off. The city authorities sent an all-phone alert at 3pm local time, urging residents to take cover. The alarm was triggered by a MIG-31K leaving Savasleyka airbase in Russia\u2019s western Nizhny Novgorod region. While such flights happen regularly, the Kremlin has a habit of targeting Kyiv at symbolic moments to make a political and military point. Air raid sirens were activated in February when Joe Biden made his first trip to Kyiv since Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion. The US president and Volodymyr Zelenskiy were at the time leaving St Michael\u2019s golden domed monastery together. Overnight Ukraine claimed it shot down 26 Russian Shahed drones, launched from a south-east direction. Two got through. The kamikaze drones hit an administration building of a port facility in Odesa. Two port terminals, including a grain one, caught fire. The fire was extinguished, there were no critical damages or injuries, the city authorities said. A woman has been killed by Russian shelling in the village of Sofiyivka in the Kherson region, the governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Telegram. Prokudin also claimed residential quarters in the region have been set on fire by \u201cRussian terrorists\u201d which has left two people injured, one of whom is in a serious condition. North Korea has condemned the US for its decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine, calling it a \u201ccriminal act\u201d and demanded an immediate withdrawal of the plan, Reuters reports. North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency: \u201cI, on behalf of the DPRK government, vehemently denounce the US decision to offer WMD (weapons of mass destruction) to Ukraine as a dangerous criminal act to bring a new calamity to the world, and strongly demand the US withdraw the decision immediately.\u201d \u201cThe US has made a very dangerous choice \u2026 which brings to light once again its true colours as destroyer of peace regarding aggression and massacre as its national policy and mode of existence,\u201d Choe added. Reuters reports that France has begun delivering a significant number of SCALP cruise missiles to Ukraine, which will be integrated into non-western warplanes, a French military source said on Tuesday. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would start supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine at the Nato summit in Lithuania on Tuesday. The missiles have a range of 155 miles (250km) \u2013 the longest of any western weapon supplied to Ukraine so far. The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh has landed in Lithuania where the Nato summit is being held. He travelled on UK prime minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s plane. The Nato Summit has formally begun. The general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomes the Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, to the summit where Finland is attending for the first time \u201cas a full-fledged member\u201d. He also gives a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d to the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and says he we will be welcoming Sweden as a full-fledged member after Turkey dropped its veto and supported the country\u2019s Nato application. France will be providing Ukraine with SCALP missiles, AFP reports. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would start supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine at the Nato summit in Lithuania on Tuesday. The UK announced in May that it would supply Ukraine with the same missiles but under the name Storm Shadow. SCALP/Storm Shadow is an Anglo-French weapon with a range of 155 miles (250km) \u2013 the longest of any western weapon supplied to Ukraine so far. Reuters reports that Russia sees no grounds for peace talks with Ukraine, the Interfax news agency cited the Russian upper house speaker, Valentina Matviyenko, as saying on Tuesday during a visit to China. Reuters reports that Germany has finalised a \u20ac700m military aid package for Ukraine, according to two government sources who told the news agency on Tuesday. The package reportedly includes 2 patriot launcher missile systems, 40 Marder armoured vehicles and 25 leopard tanks. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d if Ukraine was not invited to become a Nato member and that uncertainty over its membership was motivation for Russia to \u201ccontinue its terror\u201d. Zelenskiy tweeted: \u201cWe value our allies. We value our shared security. And we always appreciate an open conversation. Ukraine will be represented at the Nato summit in Vilnius. Because it is about respect. \u201cBut Ukraine also deserves respect. Now, on the way to Vilnius, we received signals that certain wording is being discussed without Ukraine. \u201cAnd I would like to emphasise that this wording is about the invitation to become Nato member, not about Ukraine\u2019s membership. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented and absurd when time frame is not set neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine\u2019s membership. While at the same time vague wording about \u201cconditions\u201d is added even for inviting Ukraine. \u201cIt seems there is no readiness neither to invite Ukraine to Nato nor to make it a member of the Alliance. \u201cThis means that a window of opportunity is being left to bargain Ukraine\u2019s membership in Nato in negotiations with Russia. And for Russia, this means motivation to continue its terror. \u201cUncertainty is weakness. And I will openly discuss this at the summit.\u201d Reuters reports that Belarus is waiting for fighters from the Wagner mercenary group to deploy on its territory and plans to exchange combat experience with them when they do, the state news agency Belta cited the Belarusian defence ministry as saying on Tuesday. Belarus is also waiting for a new batch of regular Russian troops to arrive to take part in joint training with the Belarusian armed forces, the ministry was cited as saying. As the Nato summit got underway in Vilnius, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine has come much closer to Nato, and that should be reflected in all Nato decision-making. He said the wording of the final communique from the summit was being worked upon, and he was confident it would send a positive message on Ukraine\u2019s path to membership. Rishi Sunak said he hoped that there would be \u201cdemonstrable progress\u201d towards Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership of Nato at the two days leaders summit, but did not give any timescale or set any conditions the country might have to meet before becoming a member. The prime minister said that \u201cUkraine\u2019s rightful place is in Nato\u201d as he flew out to the summit, saying Nato would \u201cstand by the language of Bucharest in 2008,\u201d Sunak added, referring to the summit where Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership was agreed in principle, but no timetable or road map was set out to the long running frustration of the country\u2019s leaders. France will start supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine, which will allow Kyiv\u2019s forces to defend themselves, president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday. \u201cI have decided to increase deliveries of weapons and equipment to enable the Ukrainians to have the capacity to strike deeply while keeping our doctrine to allow Ukraine to defend its territory,\u201d he said, while declining to give further details on how many or the types of missiles. Nato says it has not seen a change in Russia\u2019s nuclear posture despite its announcement that it is stationing nuclear weapons in Belarus. However, Stoltenberg cautioned that \u201cthe nuclear rhetoric of Russia is reckless and dangerous. Nato allies are monitoring closely what Russia is doing\u201d. He went on to say \u201cso far we haven\u2019t seen any changes in the Russian nuclear deployment posture that requires a change from us, but we will remain vigilant.\u201d Hungary\u2019s foreign minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said on Tuesday that there was no concrete timetable set out for Ukraine\u2019s Nato accession in the proposed closing statement of the summit in Vilnius. Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 also said Hungary\u2019s ratification of Sweden\u2019s Nato membership is \u201conly a technical issue\u201d now and the government backs Sweden\u2019s bid. Turkey agreed on Monday to allow Sweden to join Nato, setting the stage for the allies to showcase their unity at a summit focused on supporting Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s block on Sweden\u2019s membership bid had cast a cloud over preparations for Tuesday\u2019s meeting, but the countries ironed out their differences in eleventh-hour talks in Vilnius. Nato\u2019s policy towards Russia increases the risk of direct conflict between bloc members and Moscow, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency cited the Russian ambassador to Belgium Alexander Tokovinin as saying. In his daily press briefing, Dmitry Peskov at the Kremlin has been highly critical of the Nato summit in Vilnius, and singled out France\u2019s offer of longer-range missiles for criticism. Addressing the issue of Sweden joining the alliance, Peskov said Sweden\u2019s expected accession to Nato would have clear negative implications for Russia\u2019s security and that Moscow would respond with similar measures to those it took after Finland joined the western military alliance. Ukraine has said it shot down 26 Russian drones overnight, however two got through and caused damage in Odesa. Suspilne reported \u201cTwo kamikaze drones hit the administration building of a port facility in Odesa: two port terminals, including a grain one, caught fire. The fire was extinguished, there were no critical damages or injuries.\u201d Russia\u2019s state-owned Tass news agency is reporting a claim by a retired member of occupation forces in Luhansk that Russia has made significant progress in the direction of Kupiansk. In his daily press briefing, Dmitry Peskov at the Kremlin has been highly critical of the Nato summit in Vilnius, and singled out France\u2019s offer of longer-range missiles, which Emmanuel Macron announced earlier this morning. Peskov said it was a mistake by France, and Ukraine will face consequences as Russia will take countermeasures. The unnoficial Kremlin press pool feed quoted Peskov as saying: \u201cThese decisions cannot affect the course of events within the special military operation, they can only worsen the fate of the Ukrainian regime.\u201d \u201cSpecial military operation\u201d is the Russian authorities preferred term for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022. Peskov went on to say that European leaders do not seem to understand that moving Nato infrastructure towards Russia\u2019s borders is a mistake, and that the western military alliance\u2019s advance into central and eastern Europe had led to the current crisis around Ukraine in the first place. Addressing the issue of Sweden joining the alliance, Reuters reports Peskov said Sweden\u2019s expected accession to Nato would have clear negative implications for Russia\u2019s security and that Moscow would respond with similar measures to those it took after Finland joined the western military alliance. Peskov played down Turkey\u2019s decision to end its opposition to Sweden\u2019s accession to Nato, saying that Ankara has obligations as a member of the alliance and that Moscow had had no illusions on this score. Peskov said Russia and Turkey had their differences but also shared some common interests, adding that Moscow intended to develop further its relations with Ankara. France will start supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine, which will allow Kyiv\u2019s forces to defend themselves, president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday. \u201cI have decided to increase deliveries of weapons and equipment to enable the Ukrainians to have the capacity to strike deeply while keeping our doctrine to allow Ukraine to defend its territory,\u201d Reuters reports he told the media on arrival at a Nato summit in Lithuania. He declined to give further details on how many or the types of missiles. Dan Sabbagh has flown to Vilnius for the Guardian on the place carrying the UK prime minister Rishi Sunak. He reports: Rishi Sunak said he hoped there would be \u201cdemonstrable progress\u201d towards Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership of Nato at the two days leaders summit, but did not give any timescale or set any conditions the country might have to meet before becoming a member. The prime minister said \u201cUkraine\u2019s rightful place is in Nato\u201d as he flew out to the summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on Tuesday, but that further discussions about how Kyiv could achieve membership would take place among leaders at the annual summit. Nato would \u201cstand by the language of Bucharest in 2008\u201d, Sunak added, referring to the summit where Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership was agreed in principle, but no timetable or roadmap was set out to the long-running frustration of the country\u2019s leaders. \u201cI think that what\u2019s important at this summit is that commitment is reaffirmed, and also there is demonstrable progress towards that goal,\u201d the prime minister told reporters. But he added Ukraine\u2019s membership was \u201cnot a question for right now, while they are in the midst of a conflict\u201d. At the heart of Nato lies a commitment for each member state to defend the other if they are attacked, meaning that if Ukraine were to join while the war was ongoing it could immediately draw member states into a fight against Russia. Sunak also said a group of leaders \u2013 including those from the US, France and Germany \u2013 would continue to have discussions about providing long term \u201csecurity assurances\u201d to Ukraine in the form of continuing military aid and economic support. Russia\u2019s state-owned Tass news agency is reporting a claim by a retired member of occupation forces in Luhansk that Russia has made significant progress in the direction of Kupiansk. It quotes Lt Col Andrey Marochko saying: For several days, the Russian Federation armed forces have made significant progress in the direction of the settlement of Kupiansk. A number of eastern territories of the Kharkiv region have also been liberated. Tass reports that Marochko went on to say that the Russian advance is forcing the Kyiv government to evacuate state institutions, and businesses to close and relocate to western Ukraine. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters has a quick snap that Hungary\u2019s foreign minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said on Tuesday that there was no concrete timetable set out for Ukraine\u2019s Nato accession in the proposed closing statement of the summit in Vilnius. Nato has not seen any movement of Wagner group fighters to Belarus, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation very closely,\u201d Reuters report Stoltenberg told the media. Over the weekend, Poland began moving over 1,000 troops to the east of the country amid rising concern in the Nato member that the presence of Wagner group fighters in Belarus could lead to increased tension on its border. Nato says it has not seen a change in Russia\u2019s nuclear posture despite its announcement that it is stationing nuclear weapons in Belarus. However, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg cautioned that \u201cthe nuclear rhetoric of Russia is reckless and dangerous. Nato allies are monitoring closely what Russia is doing.\u201d Reuters report he went on to say \u201cso far we haven\u2019t seen any changes in the Russian nuclear deployment posture that requires a change from us, but we will remain vigilant.\u201d Timothy Garton Ash addresses the issue of Ukraine\u2019s future in Nato for the Guardian this morning: In a survey in May, 87% of Ukrainians said they were optimistic about their country\u2019s future. But there\u2019s an increasingly sober mood in private. We were told that up to one in five Ukrainian children is now outside the country. Tymofiy Mylovanov, the president of Kyiv School of Economics, shared with us its projection that on current trends the workforce would be reduced by as much as a third over the next few years. It\u2019s a daunting challenge to produce the jobs, housing and schools without which millions of Ukrainians will not return from abroad. So when I say, \u201cWho lost Ukraine?\u201d, I don\u2019t mean losing the war. I mean losing the peace: a country exhausted, ravaged, traumatised, still robbed of some of its territory, a land in limbo. For this is now Putin\u2019s brutal, vengeful objective: if he can\u2019t force Ukraine back into the Russian empire, he will try to ruin it. Here\u2019s where the buck comes back to the US. Its military support is essential for Ukraine to win the war. Long-term security is essential for Ukraine to win the peace. Without security, there will be little investment, fewer returnees, no successful reconstruction. And that ultimately means Nato membership for Ukraine is critical. Read more here: Timothy Garton Ash \u2013 In Ukraine I saw a brave but ravaged land in limbo. It needs a future, it needs Nato All eyes appear to be on the Nato summit in Vilnius, with alliance leaders and partners gathering in Lithuania. Hungary\u2019s ratification of Sweden\u2019s Nato membership is \u201conly a technical issue\u201d now and the government backs Sweden\u2019s bid, Reuters reports the foreign minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 as saying as he was heading to the Nato summit in Vilnius. Reuters has a quick snap that Norway\u2019s government has announced it will increase its military support to Ukraine by 2.5bn krone this year, taking it to 10bn (\u00a3740m/$960m). Ukraine has said it shot down 26 Russian drones overnight, however two got through and caused damage in Odesa. Citing the Ukrainian air force, Suspilne reported Russia attacked Ukraine with 28 Shahed drones from the south-eastern direction, of which 26 were shot down. The report on Telegram continued: Two kamikaze drones hit the administration building of a port facility in Odesa: two port terminals, including a grain one, caught fire. The fire was extinguished, there were no critical damages or injuries. Odesa is one of the ports included in the Black Sea grain initiative, which expires next week. Jen Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, has had some words for the media this morning. Reuters quotes him saying that Ukraine has come much closer to Nato, and that should be reflected in all Nato decision-making. He said the wording of the final communique from the summit was being worked upon, and he was confident it would send a positive message on Ukraine\u2019s path to membership. Nato\u2019s policy towards Russia increases the risk of direct conflict between bloc members and Moscow, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency cited the Russian ambassador to Belgium as saying. Reuters reports Alexander Tokovinin said the regional defence plans that Nato intends to adopt at the summit starting today would make the bloc\u2019s confrontation with Russia more tense and prolonged. Tokovinin was the latest Russian voice to echo this line, as rhetoric intensifies heading into the Nato summit in Vilnius. Hungary\u2019s farm minister will go to Turkey for talks with his Turkish counterpart about extending the deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its Black Sea ports, the minister has said on Facebook. \u201cTurkey is a key player in the long-term handling of market difficulties caused by Ukrainian grain imports,\u201d the Hungarian minister for agriculture said. Reuters reports Istv\u00e1n Nagy said he was holding talks on behalf of countries in central and eastern Europe that had been affected by increased Ukrainian grain flows. Ukraine has increased its reliance on grain export routes through eastern Europe since being invaded by Russia. Five countries \u2013 Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia \u2013 sought import restrictions on the shipments, which the EU allowed. They complained cheaper Ukrainian grain was making domestic production unprofitable. The deal is due to expire next week. Moscow has repeatedly said it sees no grounds to extend it, complaining that western sanctions are impacting on its agricultural exports. The US national security adviser, Jake, Sullivan said in comments a few minutes ago that the US and allies would \u201csend a positive message\u201d on Ukraine\u2019s future membership of Nato at the summit, which kicks off today in Lithuania. He also said a new Nato aid package for Ukraine would be agreed on. Russian construction firms may be fined for failing to provide \u201cvolunteers\u201d to serve in Ukraine, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its intelligence report this morning. \u201cMoscow\u2019s municipal authorities are highly likely threatening to withdraw contracts from construction firms if they fail to hit quotas for providing \u2018volunteers\u2019 to serve in Ukraine. One company has reportedly been set a target of 30 volunteers by the end of August 2023,\u201d the Ministry wrote. It said the measure was likely to mainly impact ethnic minorities, \u201cwho make up the majority of Moscow\u2019s construction workers\u201d and that the move, \u201cis highly likely at least tacitly endorsed by Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin. It continues his track record of trying to minimise the impact of the conflict on better-off Muscovites, while still being seen to support the war effort.\u201d Ukraine said on Monday its troops had caught occupying Russian troops \u201cin a trap\u201d in the shattered eastern city of Bakhmut, where its forces have been gaining ground as part of their counter offensive. Russian accounts of the fighting said Moscow\u2019s forces have repelled or contained Ukrainian advances in the east and south. \u201cBakhmut. The enemy is caught in a trap,\u201d General Oleksander Syrskyi, in charge of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, said on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cThe city is under the fire control of (our) defence forces...the enemy is being pushed out of their positions.\u201d In the south, General Oleksander Tarnavskyi said on Telegram Ukrainian forces were \u201con the move\u201d and Russian forces had lost the equivalent of hundreds of men over 24 hours. The Guardian was unable to verify these claims. Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Internal affairs has posted its report of the overnight attack on Kyiv on Telegram, saying: The remains of the Shahed were discovered in one of the settlements of the region. Windows and outbuildings of private households were damaged, and grass flooring caught fire. There were no victims reported. Appropriate services are available on site. Ukraine will be part of Nato, Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Monday, and he expects to see an \u201calgorithm\u201d for Kyiv\u2019s pathway to officially joining to emerge from the summit. \u201cWe are still working on the wording, that is, on the specific words of such confirmation, but we already understand the fact that Ukraine will be in the alliance,\u201d Zelenskiy said late on Monday in his nightly video address. \u201cAnd we are working to make the algorithm for gaining membership as clear and fast as possible.\u201d Zelenskiy said the Vilnius summit must confirm Ukraine is already \u201cde facto\u201d a member of Nato as it has its weapons and shares values with the alliance. \u201cEven if different positions are voiced, it is still clear that Ukraine deserves to be in the alliance,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cNot now - there is a war, but we need a clear signal. And we need this signal right now.\u201d Russia launched an overnight air strike on Kyiv in early hours on Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s military said, just hours before the start of the Nato summit in Lithuania that is to tackle security threats from Moscow. \u201cThe enemy attacked Kyiv from the air for the second time this month, Serhiy Popko, a head of Kyiv\u2019s military administration, said in a post on the Telegram channel. Ukraine\u2019s air defence systems shot down all the Iranian-made Shahed drones Russia launched before they reached their targets, Popko said. There was no immediate information about damage or casualties. Air raid alerts blasted over Kyiv for an hour and longer in other parts of Ukraine\u2018s east, according to Ukraine\u2019s Air Force. The summit in Vilnius, which starts on Tuesday, will be dominated by the repercussions of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with leaders set to approve Nato\u2019s first comprehensive plans since the end of the Cold War to defend against any attack from Moscow. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest. Russia launched an overnight airstrike on Kyiv in the early hours of Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s military said, just hours before the start of the Nato summit in Lithuania that is set to tackle security threats from Moscow. \u201cThe enemy attacked Kyiv from the air for the second time this month\u201d, Serhiy Popko, a head of Kyiv\u2019s military administration, said in a post on the Telegram channel. According to preliminary information, Ukraine\u2019s air defence systems shot down all the Iranian-made Shahed drones Russia launched before they reached their targets, Popko said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the eve of the Nato summit that Ukraine will be part of the alliance and expects from the meeting an \u201calgorithm\u201d for Kyiv to officially join it. \u201cWe are still working on the wording, that is, on the specific words of such confirmation, but we already understand the fact that Ukraine will be in the alliance,\u201d Zelenskiy said late on Monday in his nightly video address. Other key recent developments: A Russian attack on a humanitarian aid distribution point in south-eastern Ukraine killed seven people, emergency services said on Monday, while two people were killed by Russian shelling in the east. Yuriy Malashko, governor of Zaporizhzhia region, said a guided aviation bomb was used in Sunday\u2019s attack on a school building being used to distribute aid in the small town of Orikhiv. Turkey agreed on Monday to allow Sweden to join Nato, setting the stage for the allies to showcase their unity at a summit focused on supporting Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s block on Sweden\u2019s membership bid had cast a cloud over preparations for Tuesday\u2019s meeting, but the countries ironed out their differences in eleventh-hour talks in Vilnius. Nato members are not expected to set clear preconditions for Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership to the military alliance in the face of caution from the US and Germany while the war with Russia continues. Ukraine wants clarity on when and how it can join the alliance after the war with Russia ends, believing that western military protection is the only way it can remain unthreatened by its neighbour. However, it looks instead likely to be offered closer integration with Nato and a stronger political declaration in favour of its membership in principle. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said he wants to work with allies to discuss a pathway for Ukraine to join Nato, but the exact mechanism was up for discussion, his spokesperson said on Monday, after talks with the US president, Joe Biden. Russian president Vladimir Putin met with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, just days after a short-lived rebellion by the mercenary chief and his private army, according to the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. A three-hour meeting took place on 29 June, which also involved commanders from the military company Prigozhin founded, Peskov said. Prigozhin has had a longstanding conflict with Russia\u2019s top military brass which on 24 June culminated in an armed mutiny in which he led his fighters into Russia. Ukrainian troops pressed on with their campaign to recapture Russian-held areas in the south-east on Sunday as president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that his country\u2019s forces had \u201ctaken the initiative\u201d after an earlier slowdown. Russian accounts said heavy fighting gripped areas outside the eastern city of Bakhmut, captured by Russian mercenary Wagner forces in May after months of battles. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said one of his units was deployed in the area. Russia will continue to cooperate with Beijing and can count on China\u2019s \u201cfriendly shoulder\u201d, the speaker of Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament said on Monday after meeting Chinese president Xi Jinping in Beijing. \u201cWe can count on a firm and reliable friendly shoulder in China,\u201d Valentina Matvienko said."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f45", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jul/11/uk-pay-growth-rising-inflation-andrew-bailey-jeremy-hunt-mortgage-providers-mps-rates-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rising mortgage rates will cause \u2018financial stress\u2019, MPs hear, as two-year fixed rates hit 15-year high \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Treasury Committee quiz lenders about mortgage rates, as two-year fixed mortgage rate rises to 6.66%, highest since 2008", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 15:08:49", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951605", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5d6bb7a9ea0472e5d55d9014e3247353d6e480ff/0_391_8192_4918/500.jpg", "body": "Time for a recap. UK borrowers continue to be hit by rising interest rates as the fight against inflation continues, and there may be more pain ahead. Average two-year mortgage rate have risen over their peak last autumn, averaging 6.66% today for the first time in 15 years. MPs have heard that rising mortgage rates are causing financial stress to customers, and that the situation will worsen. However, lenders also reported that they have not seen a significant pick-up in arrears yet. But, the UK could be approaching a \u2018tipping point\u2019 where mortgage rates rise to levels where borrowers cannot fully protect themselves by extending the terms of their loans or moving to interest-only deals. The International Monetary Fund warned that UK interest rates may need to keep rates higher for longer, to fight inflation. The financial markets are anticipating that UK interest rates will hit 6% by November, up from 5% at present. The latest labour market report has shown that UK wages increased at a faster rate than expected in May. Earnings growth hit 7.3% in the three months to May compared with a year earlier, driven by the strongest rise in private sector pay growth outside the pandemic period of 7.7%, the Office for National Statistics said. It was the joint highest since modern records began in 2001. And with unemployment rising, number of job vacancies down, jobs growth slowing and more people looking for work, there are signs that the UK labour market is starting to slow. And in other news\u2026 Britain\u2019s debt-laden \u201czombie\u201d companies are expected to be wiped out by the surge in interest rates, an insolvency specialist has predicted. Britain\u2019s retailers recorded a sharp rise in spending in June as hot weather prompted consumers to buy summer clothing and outdoor goods, despite growing pressure on budgets from the cost of living crisis. Morrissey has written to Jet2holidays urging the tour operator to drop its association with marine parks that continue to use captive orcas and dolphins for entertainment. Deutsche Bank have predicted that the Bank of England will lift interest rates by half a percentage point next month. Previously, Deutsche had forecast a quarter-point rise, from 5% to 5.25%. But following this morning\u2019s strong labour market data, showing wage growth running at 7.3%, it has upped its forecasts for the next meeting of the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee. Deutsche\u2019s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, explains: For now, evidence of still more persistent wage pressures will keep the MPC\u2019s foot on the accelerator. A second consecutive 50bps hike now looks more likely than not. Over in Moscow, the central bank has reported that Russia\u2019s current account surplus shrank by 85% in the first half of this year, to $20.2bn. That\u2019s a sharp fall on the record surplus of $147.6bn in January-June 2022, when Russia profited from the surge in energy prices and also cut its imports due to sanctions imposed by the West. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation said the drop in the surplus this year was due to a fall in volumes of exports, and lower prices for oil and gas, and other Russian commodities. On a quarterly basis, the current account balance decreased to $5.4bn in April-June, down from $14.8bn in January-March. Reuters adds that oil and gas revenues, the lifeblood of Russia\u2019s economy, fell 47% year-on-year in January-June, which the finance ministry put down to lower prices for Urals crude and lower natural gas export volumes. Meanwhile in Brazil, inflation has dropped to its lowest level in almost three years. Annual inflation in Latin America\u2019s largest economy slowed to 3.16% in June from 3.94% in May. On a monthly basis, prices fell \u2013 by 0.08% \u2013 the first deflation registered since September of last year. This may encourage Brazil\u2019s central bank to consider cutting interest rates from their current six-year high of 13.75%\u2026. Britain\u2019s debt-laden \u201czombie\u201d companies are expected to be wiped out by the surge in interest rates, an insolvency specialist has predicted. Begbies Traynor, a business recovery and financial consultancy, has said all of the nation\u2019s zombies \u2013 companies struggling to service debts that have avoided bankruptcy through cheap borrowing costs \u2013 will have failed by the end of next year. \u201cOver the next 18 months, we\u2019ll see virtually all of them finally come to an end,\u201d Ric Traynor, the executive chairman of the company, which is seen as a bellwether for the health of UK businesses, told Bloomberg. Cathryn Ross has said that Thames Water is looking at using smart meters to charge households for excessive water consumption in order to curb the use of hosepipes. She has taken aim at those with big gardens who \u201cthink that they care less about their water bills\u201d. The CEO explained: \u201cOne of the biggest single useages of water is people watering gardens, if you put a hosepipe on for 10 minutes, that could easily use a typical daily consumption. So what we are looking at now we are pushing ahead with the smart meter roll out, could we look at tariff innovation that charged a set amount up to 100 litres of water per person per day, maybe a bit more for 110 120 let\u2019s say, and then if you\u2019re using more than 130 we can start charging you really much more, that might send signals about more efficient water usage\u201d. She added: \u201cPeople [who] have bigger houses with bigger gardens, maybe they think that they care less about their water bill, maybe those are precisely the sort of people who could pay more so we could then take some more of that money and invest it in the network or invest it in social tariffs\u201d Back at the London Assembly Environment Committee, Thames Water\u2019s CEO has warned that water supplies are at risk in London due to climate breakdown. When asked about whether supplies are resilient, Cathryn Ross said: \u201cIn a nutshell we are living with an asset base that is older than we would like it to be, and even if it was in tip top condition if you were designing it today you wouldn\u2019t be designing it in the way that we have it. It simply is not capable of delivering the resilience that people want today in the 21st century.\u201d She said \u201cnumerous parts of the network\u201d face a cocktail of problems and it is \u201cnot as resilient as we would like it to be\u201d. Ross added: \u201cThe management of it during periods of extreme weather is becoming more challenging. We haven\u2019t planned into business as usual what it takes to manage the resilient provision of water and waste water services in the face of climate change. Today\u2019s news of mortgage costs hitting their highest level in 15 years with an average rate of 6.66% will worry people further, at a time when \u201cmortgage pressures on ordinary households are huge\u201d, says Douglas Chapman, SNP MP for Dunfermline and West Fife. Following today\u2019s Treasury Committee hearing on the mortgage market, Chapman says: Research this month from Citizens Advice Scotland reveals that around 11% of people always run out of money before payday, with a further 14% saying that this happens to them \u201cmost of the time\u201d. This percentage will surely rise given today\u2019s Committee panellists\u2019 discussing averages of \u00a3235 increases on monthly mortgage repayments due to large interest rises and deals coming to an end, which on top of a crippling cost of living crisis, consistently high energy prices and rampant inflation explains why many people feel their financial resilience is being pushed to the limit.\u201d \u201cIn addition, there was little encouragement for first time buyers today, who it appears need to spend longer amassing a larger deposit or tap into the Bank of Mum and Dad (which isn\u2019t an option for everyone), and then also choose from a narrower portfolio of smaller properties in order to meet monthly mortgage payments and pass banks affordability stress tests.\u201d Lisa Nandy MP, Labour\u2019s shadow housing secretary, has said the increase in fixed-rate mortgage costs today is a sign of \u201cTory economic failure\u201d \u201cToo often, families who are saving for their first home but getting no closer to buying it feel like they\u2019re doing something wrong. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is that the Tories have inflicted households with a mortgage bombshell, let renters down and failed to build the homes we need. \u201cMillions are feeling the pain from this Tory economic failure. \u201cLabour has a plan to start fixing this crisis. We would stop households missing out on the mortgage support they need by making measures mandatory, we will give greater rights and protections to renters, and we will take the tough choices to get Britain building.\u201d Henry Jordan, Nationwide\u2019s home commercial director, has said house prices were expected to fall 6.5% from the peak seen last August. He told MPs on the Treasury committee: \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen some fall in house prices, roughly about 4% from their peak in August last year. \u201cWe\u2019d expect some further slight falls to around about 6.5%, would be our expected peak movement.\u201d But, he doesn\u2019t believe this is having a material impact on the number of customers in negative equity, saying: We have a very, very low exposure to negative equity currently, it\u2019s 0.1% of our book. So we\u2019re not seeing those movements in house prices really have any specific bearing.\u201d Andrew Asaam from Lloyds Banking Group told MPs house price falls could leave some mortgage holders in negative equity (owing more than their property is worth). But MP also heard there is less risk than in previous financial crisis, as loan-to-value rates are relatively low. Asaam told the Treasury committee this morning \u201cThe place that this probably bites most is for first-time buyers, who will be typically at higher LTVs (loan to value rates). \u201cIt\u2019s a completely individual situation, but we still think owning a home for most people is better than renting. \u201cAnd therefore we want to keep products available at higher LTVs for first-time buyers. \u201cBut we need to make sure that those first-time buyers are resilient, ie they can afford to stay in their homes through a two-year period where house prices might be falling, for example, and they are aware that they could end up in negative equity.\u201d MPs on the Treasury committee have also been warned that mortgage rates could rise to a \u2018tipping point\u2019. According to Henry Jordan, home commercial director at Nationwide, that could be between 6.25% and 6.5% for customers remortgaging their home loans. We covered earlier that Jordan had explained that borrowers face an average increase of \u00a3235 per month as they move off existing fixed rate deals (at, say, 2.25%) onto new ones at around 5.5%. Jordan told MPs that a customer who extends the term of their mortgage could cut the monthly increase to \u00a3134. If they also move to an interest-only product, then they could move to a lower payment than they\u2019re paying currently. That remains true, Jordon says, until average remortgaging rates reach between 6.25% to 6.5%. That might be a tipping point at which options such as interest only won\u2019t be sufficient to offset the increase in payments that customer will see. We flagged earlier that average two-year mortgage rates are now 6.66%, but a customer remortgaging with their lender will typically get a lower rate than that. Newsflash: The Bank of England may need to keep interest rates high for an extended period if inflation pressures persist, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s directors have warned. In a review of the UK economy, the IMF warns that the country faces a challenging economic outlook, despite being expected to avoid a recession. The IMF warns that the UK\u2019s long-run prosperity hinges on \u201cambitious reforms\u201d. And in a stern assessment of Britain\u2019s economic progress, the Fund says that the UK, once a \u201cstrong performer\u201d, has now lost economic momentum. It explains: Prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, the UK had been a strong performer among the Group of Seven countries. But this momentum was lost in the middle of the last decade. By 2022, real business investment was still slightly lower than in 2016 \u2014 in contrast to the 14 percent increase among other G7 economies. Labor supply, which has just reached its pre-pandemic level, has also been weaker than peers. As in other advanced economies, productivity growth has been sluggish, reflecting a slower pace of innovation and technological diffusion. The IMF says it is critical to improve UK health outcomes, due to the long-term sickness that has driven the post-pandemic spike in inactivity. And they say investor confidence would be boosted by a stable, long-term strategy to promote business investment \u2013 which could include a \u201cpermanent set of tax incentives that could potentially apply to investments other than plant and machinery\u201d. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced a temporary \u2018full expensing\u2019 tax break in March\u2019s budget. And, as it concludes its annual Article IV consultation with the UK, the IMF welcomed last month\u2019s hike in interest rates to 5% \u2013 and warned that more may be needed. The fund says: Directors welcomed the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) policy response to arrest inflation pressures, including the 50 bps policy rate increase on June 22. Given risks and uncertainty about the outlook and inflation persistence, Directors concurred that a continuous review of the pace and magnitude of monetary tightening is warranted. Should inflationary pressures show signs of further persistence, the policy rate may have to be raised further and would need to remain higher for longer to durably lower inflation and keep inflation expectations anchored. Back at the Treasury Committee: Q: Are first-time buyers still trying to enter the housing market? Andrew Asaam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group, says the overall housing market is smaller this year than in 2021 and 2022, when the pandemic race-for-space was fuelling demand, as was the stamp duty holiday. Its more similar to 2019, he says. Within that, the FTB market is smaller too. People are either putting down a larger deposit, or buying a smaller property because affordability is tighter. We won\u2019t lent people as much now, with rates where they are, as we would historically. Q: Are you seeing an impact on house prices? Asaam points to the monthly house price index produced by its Halifax arm, which he says showed \u201ca moderation in house prices\u201d [the biggest fall in 12 years in June], while Lloyds forecast a 5% drop this year in its results. Thames Water CEO Cathryn Ross then told the London Assembly Environment Committee that \u201cprogressive charging\u201d for water bills would mean customers with the means to do so could pay more. Ross expained, during this morning\u2019s hearing: \u201cIf we found a more progressive way of charging we would unlock the ability to charge those who can pay more\u201d. Defending privatisation, Ross compared it to mortgaging a home: \u201cWe use finance to smooth the cost of those projects over a big period. We don\u2019t get that money for free, when investors do give us that money they expect a return. They should get a reasonable level of return rather than an egregious level of return. If our investors get the sort of return Ofwat says is fair, that\u2019s absolutely fine with them. That would mean we would pay some dividends if we were getting that level of return. We are not a profitable company. The annual results that we put out on Monday - we are making a loss of \u00a330m after tax. This will be the sixth year they have not taken a dividend and they are putting a significant amount of money into the company. We are not at the position at the moment of having any profit to give back to shareholders. \u201cWhen water companies were privatised they were privatised with a clean balance sheet - no debt. One of the reasons they were privatised is it was known there was a huge amount of investment that was needed. You can pay for that investment as you go so the cost of all that goes on the customer bill today. Or you can spread the cost. One of the reasons why the water companies were privatised in the way that they were was so the cost could be smoothed over time. We have taken a lot of debt, our total debt at the moment is \u00a314bn. But you have to remember that our assets are worth \u00a319bn. If we are taking on more debt to make our assets worth more it is like borrowing more to do an extension on your mortgaged house - it increases the value of your house.\u201d On whether nationalisation is feasible she said \u201cI don\u2019t really have a view\u201d and said it was a matter for \u201cgovernment manifestos in the context of an election\u201d. The interim CEO of Thames Water is being grilled right now by the London Assembly Environment Committee. Cathryn Ross took over the unenviable role of running the beleagured water company after the abrupt departure of former CEO Sarah Bentley. She told the committee that we take water for granted in this country, and the government\u2019s Plan for Water is not ambitious enough. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t think at the moment the Plan for Water goes far enough. It\u2019s a useful step forward but doesn\u2019t go far enough. Yes there is more we need to do but we actually need to change our national conversation about water. We need to understand for example that London has the same rainfall as Jerusalem and we aren\u2019t living in a wet country where we can take water for granted.\u201d Ross was also grilled on Thames Water\u2019s woeful record on leaks by Environment Committee Chairwoman Leonie Cooper, who said: \u201cIt\u2019s an unthinkable quantity. How can we persuade people to use less water if Thames Water is losing 602m litres a day?\u201d The CEO added: \u201cYou are quite right, I accept we are not where we need to be on leakage. I also completely understand, and we were seeing this last year, that when we were asking customers to use water wisely, this quite rightly was undermined by customers saying well we are doing our bit, why aren\u2019t you doing your bit.\u201d But added she has \u201cincreased the number of [leak fixing] gangs out there\u201d and Thames Water is \u201cliterally fixing a leak every seven and a half minutes, that hasn\u2019t happened before\u201d. She added that a third of leaks are from holes in customers\u2019 pipes rather than in Thames water\u2019s pipes. Bradley Fordham, mortgage director at Santander UK, says there are signs that some customers are looking to cancel subscriptions, as they focus their financial resources in the cost-of-living squeeze. But there isn\u2019t any particular sign of deterioration among unsecured borrowers, Fordham tells the Treasury committee. Over in Vilnius, prime minister Rishi Sunak has admitted inflation is \u201cproving to be more persistent than people thought\u201d. Speaking to broadcasters as he travels to the NATO leaders summit, the Prime Minister acknowledged \u201cthings are difficult\u201d for families across the country amid a rise in interest rates. But he insists that his course of action isn\u2019t \u201cwrong\u201d. Sunak told reporters: \u201cI know things are difficult for many families across the country. The UK is not alone in experiencing a rise in interest rates\u2026 the crucial thing that we have to do is bring inflation down. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to ease the burden for families. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to stop the rise in interest rates. And that\u2019s why my priority is to halve inflation. \u201cOf course, that is proving to be more persistent than people thought, but that doesn\u2019t mean the course of action is wrong. We\u2019ve got to stick to it.\u201d Q: What concerns do you have that people who extend their terms or move to interest-only loans are only deferring the pain, and will end up paying more overall? Henry Jordan, home commercial director at Nationwide, suggests that customers may be able to reduce their terms in future years, if interest rates come down again. Q: How many mortgage prisoners do you have? Andrew Asaam says Lloyds has no mortgage prisoners \u2013 all its customers can get a \u2018front book rate\u2019. Q: What else can banks do to prevent house repossessions? Andrew Asaam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group, says Lloyds have been phoning fixed-rate customers who are potentially high risk to offer them the chance to extend loan terms or lock in a deal now. Customers on variable-rates are told if they could save by moving to another product. And for customers in financial difficulties, there are a range of tools to help with loan forebearance and keep them in their homes, and \u201conly use repossession as a last resort\u201d. Q: So, what\u2019s the point of the mortgage charter if you\u2019re already doing most of the options already? Has the chancellor added anything substantive? Andrew Asaam, Lloyd\u2019s homes director, says it provides clarity and consistency for customers. And with inflation still high, it\u2019s a helpful intervention \u201cas things progress\u201d, Asaam adds. Q: 85% of the market are covered by this voluntary charter \u2013 should the government reach out to the other 15% of lenders? Santander\u2019s Bradley Fordham suggests those 15% of the market could be specialist lenders, such as buy-to-let (which is not covered by the charter). Nigel Terrington, CEO of Paragon Banking Group (which focuses on the BTL market) says he would happily sign the charter. Rushanara Ali, the Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, asks lenders about the new rules agreed with the government. Q: How much impact will the mortgage charter have? [Reminder, the charted allows mortgage holders to switch to a interest-only plan for up to six months, extend their loan terms, or lock in a new deal six months in advance'] Henry Jordan, home commercial director at Nationwide, says it remains to be seen what effect the charter will have. He says Nationwide saw a high take-up of payment holidays in Covid, with over 200,000 customers taking it up. He suspects take-up will be lower this time. All the options in the mortgage charter are available today, Jordan points out. The key change is that there is no affordability check, including on moving to an interest-only loan, and no impact on a customer\u2019s credit rating. Currently, Jordan says, some customers are put off from moving to an interest-only deal because they are worried about the impact on their credit file \u2013 so just 100 customers per month currently choose it. Ultimately, he points out, people will end up paying more interest if they extend their loan terms or move to an interest-only deal. Jordan explains: The message from me would be, only take these options if you need to becuase there will be a long-term cost. Andrew Asaam says Lloyds welcomes the mortgage charter, as it gives customers a clear idea of what banks will offer them. Skipton Building Society\u2019s Charlotte Harrison agrees that it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d how many customers will take up the options in the mortgage charter. Harrison also agrees that it will probably be fewer customers than took help early in the pandemic, as there is less uncertainty today. Harrison tells MPs: I would expct it to be lower, but we\u2019re aso equally preparing for customer enquiries coming into us. Bradley Fordham, mortgage director at Santander UK, reveals that fewer than 4% of customers with expiring mortgages are inquiring about mortgage charter-type help. The UK\u2019s relatively strong jobs market should help people handle higher mortgage rate, suggests Andrew Asaam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group Asaam tells the Treasury Committee: Mortgage arrears have been highly correlated with unemployment. Undoubtedly the cost of living crisis and inflation is really challenging. But while unemployment is still low, that obviously provides people with options and [they are] finding different ways to manage their payments. Rising mortgage rates mean homeowners will face a sharp increase in payments when their existing fixed mortgages expire, MPs hear. Bradley Fordham, mortgage director at Santander UK, tells the Treasury Committee that, currently, mortgage rates are between 5.5% and 6.5%. At 6%, a customer coming off a 2.3% rate will face a \u00a3350 per month increase in mortgage payments. Fordham says: It\u2019s significantly more in this environment. Fordham backs up Skipton\u2019s Charlotte Harrison\u2019s warning that more customers will face financial stress, saying: So you\u2019d expect more customers to have some financial difficulty. Q: Many people took out two-year mortgages during the stamp duty holiday in the pandemic, and soon need to remortgage. So, will the picture of your mortgage books have deteriorated in six months\u2019 time? Skipton Building Society\u2019s Charlotte Harrison says her building society has stress-tested customers against a higher interest rate environment. Most people will have paid off some of the capital they borrowed, so the amount the need to remortgage will have fallen. Many of those homeowners have also benefitted from the double-digit house price growth in the pandemic, so the equity in their homes has risen, Harrison explains (although prices are now falling). Harrison says: What I expect to see over the next six months is that we will see more customers with financial stress. But I expect that to be relative to the to the market. And I think there are options available to those customers as well. Skipton will explore what forbearance measures may be appropriate or not for strugging customers when their fixed-rate deals expire, she adds. Q: What provisions will mortgage lenders take, due to changes in the quality of your mortgage books? The lenders can\u2019t give precise answers (partly because some are in \u2018closed periods\u2019 ahead of their next financial results). Bradley Fordham, Santander\u2019s mortgage director, explains that you\u2019d expect provisions to rise \u201cvery slightly, in line with arrears\u201d. Charlotte Harrison, Interim CEO (Home Financing) at Skipton Building Society, echoes those comments. She says: Provisioning will reflect the quality of our [mortgage] book. Again, we\u2019d expect a small increase in that. Andrew Asaam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group says provisioning will reflect the underlying quality of the loan (he can\u2019t say more because Lloyd\u2019s results are due in a fortnight). Nationwide\u2019s Henry Jordan can give a bit more detail. He says Nationwide has adjusted its models to reflect the pressures on mortgage affordability. That increased Nationwide\u2019s provisions against bad debt, reported in its latest financial results in April. It\u2019s provision coverage ratio is 0.14%, and skewed toward buy-to-let mortgages rather than residential loans. Q: UK Finance data has shown a tick-up in mortgage arrears in the first quarter of this year, what have other lenders seen? Andrew Asaam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group, echoes the message from Nationwide. He says arrears are still very low in a historical context, and below pre-Covid 19 levels, although there has been a small uptick. Skipton Building Society\u2019s Charlotte Harrison says arrears at Skipton are flat year-on-year. It\u2019s a similar picture at Santander. Bradley Fordham, their mortgage director, tells MPs that despite a small-tick up in arrears they are still 20% below their pre-pandemic levels, and 70% below their 2009 levels after the financial crisis. Fordham says Sandander customers moving off fixed-rate deals are seeing their average rates rise from 2.3% or 4.5%, meaning an average increase of over \u00a3200 per month in repayments. Paragon Banking Group\u2019s CEO Nigel Terrington, says Paragon\u2019s arrears levels in lending to house-builders and small businesses are \u201cvery stable\u201d. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin starts the hearing by asking mortgage providers about the sharp increase in interest rates this year, following a long period of low rates. Q: What reaction are you seeing from the customers affected? Henry Jordan, Nationwide\u2019s home commercial director, says that the increase in mortgage rates means its customers face an average \u00a3235 per month increase in their payments when their current deals expire. That\u2019s roughly an increase of a third. Jordan says Nationwide\u2019s arrears are stable, with a one basis point [eg 1 percentage point] increase in customers who are three months in arrears on their repayments. But there has been a larger increase in people in arrears for shorter time, particularly among buy-to-let customers. Forebearance is actually lower than a year ago. But generally, customer are taking action to protect themselves from higher mortgage rates, Jordan says. He explains: We have seen an increase in over-payments, and an increase in term extensions, but no material increase in arrears yet. Over in parliament, MPs on the Treasury Committee are starting to question mortgage providers on rising rates, house prices and forbearance. It\u2019s a timely hearing, given average two-year fixed mortgage rates have just hit a 15-year high of 6.66%. Here\u2019s what to expect, from the committee: The cross-party Committee of MPs will examine the current state of the mortgage market, including levels of mortgage stress, arrears and forbearance, and the outlook for the market in light of higher interest rates. The Committee will question mortgage providers on consumer behaviour following recent rate rises, the impact on house prices and the wider housing market, and mortgage affordability and availability. Government support schemes and the recently agreed \u2018mortgage charter\u2019 are also likely to be discussed, as are buy-to-let mortgages and the rental market, and the take-up of long-term fixed rate deals. Here\u2019s the panel: Andrew Asaam, Homes Director, Lloyds Banking Group Bradley Fordham, Mortgage Director, Santander UK Charlotte Harrison, Interim CEO (Home Financing), Skipton Building Society Henry Jordan, Home Commercial Director, Nationwide Nigel Terrington, Chief Executive, Paragon Banking Group Over in Germany, investor confidence has deteriorated. The ZEW institute\u2019s gauge of investor morals dropped to -14.7 this month, down from -8.5 in June, and weaked than expected. Germany is currently in recession, and financial market experts predict \u201ca further deterioration in the economic situation by year-end,\u201d ZEW warns. The increase in the average rate of a two-year fixed mortgage deal to 6.66% today casts a gloomy shadow over the possibility of homeownership for thousands of first-time buyers, says Amanda Aumonier, head of mortgage operations at brokers Better.co.uk Aumonier adds: \u201cThe rise amplifies the challenges faced by hopeful buyers, making the dream of owning a home increasingly unattainable as borrowing costs skyrocket and monthly repayments become overwhelming. \u201cAmidst this turmoil, existing homeowners who wish to remortgage find themselves trapped in a daunting maze of escalating interest rates, fuelling concerns about the financial strain they face\u201d. The Government is taking a \u201cfirm and robust approach to public pay settlements\u201d, a Cabinet minister has said, after this morning\u2019s data showed regular wages rose by a record 7.3% per year in the three months to May. Asked whether wage growth drives up inflation, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told LBC radio: \u201cDomestic wage pressure is a key component of the stickiness of inflation, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that the Government takes a relatively firm and robust approach to public pay settlements and there\u2019s no way, unfortunately, that we can duck that because if those settlements are too high that will feed into those problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that those wage pressures are moderated to the extent we can.\u201d Pressed on whether the Government will accept the recommendations of the pay review bodies on public sector pay, Stride said: \u201cWe have to be absolutely unwavering in our mission to get inflation down because that impoverishes us all, it\u2019s a tax on everybody\u201d. However, raising pay in the public sector would not fuel a classic wage-price spiral, as state schools and hospitals would not fund it through higher prices. Here\u2019s a chart showing the surge in fixed-mortgage costs in recent weeks, driven up by signs that UK inflation is stubbornly higher than hoped (meaning higher interest rates). People concerned about soaring mortgage rates should stay calm and speak to their lender or mortgage brokers if they have any issues, says Charlotte Nixon, mortgage and financial planning expert at Quilter: The recent Mortgage Charter introduced by the government underlines that lenders should provide help in the first instance to strugging borrowers, she explains. Nixon warns, though, that the UK is in a \u2018difficult place\u2019, as average two-year mortgage rates hit 15-year highs today. She says: \u201cWith the average two-year fixed mortgage rate hitting a devilish 6.66% according to Moneyfacts, many mortgage holders and potential house buyers must be wondering when the flames will die down and things start to look a bit more normal. Unfortunately, the UK is in a difficult place with its battle against inflation and as such interest rates are going to have to keep going up in the short-term. This is going to feed into the mortgage market and as such this is not the top of the peak \u2013 more pain is to come. \u201cThe chaos in the mortgage market is hitting house prices and this is going to cause some uncertainty over the rest of the year as servicing costs become harder to manage and affordability is tested to its limits. For those who have a fixed rate deal ending in the next six months, the message is clear \u2013 act now or you could face exorbitant costs on the standard variable rate that you will default on to. \u201cFor those looking to take out a mortgage now, there are options to consider to lessen the burden, though they do come with consequences. Taking out a mortgage with a longer term can help reduce your monthly payments, however, cost over the whole period will be greater. Not all lenders offer this length but if you use a mortgage adviser, they can help you search the market for the best deal. Although a longer term does mean that you will pay more in interest over the full term it does reduce your monthly outgoings. Once you come to the end of your deal you could opt to remortgage to a shorter term, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be forever. Newsflash: UK short-term fixed mortgage rates have risen above the levels seen last autumn after the chaotic mini-budget. The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate has risen to 6.66% this morning, data provider Moneyfacts reports, up from 6.63% on Monday. That takes the cost of two-year mortgages slightly above the peak of 6.65% set last autumn, when the borrowing market was rocked by Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s package of unfunded tax cuts. It\u2019s the highest rate for two-year fixed-rate mortgages since 2008, adding to the financial pain facing households who need to remortgage soon. They face paying many hundreds of pounds more each month, if they had previously fixed at low interest rates. Fixed rate mortgages are priced off the yield (or interest rate) on UK government bonds. They hit their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis last week, as investors anticipated further increases in interest rates to fight inflation. Moneyfacts also reports that the average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate has risen today to 6.17%, from 6.13% on Monday. That is the highest rate since last October. Hundreds of mortgages have been pulled from the market again, as lenders rush to reprice deals. There are currently 4,344 residential mortgage products available, down from 4,631 on the previous working day. Moneyfacts also reports that buy-to-let mortgage rates have risen. Here\u2019s the details: The average 2-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.83%, up from 6.81% on Monday The average 5-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.62%, up from 6.60% on Monday Reminder: MPs on the Treasury Committee will quiz mortgage lenders about the situation this morning\u2026. Analysts at ING agree that today\u2019s strong wage growth could prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates by half a percentage point next month, to 5.5%. They say: A few months ago it looked like UK wage growth had peaked. Now it is running at its fastest pace yet, and, depending on next week\u2019s inflation figures, it could push the Bank of England into another 50bp rate hike in August Today\u2019s UK employment data is \u201ca bit of an \u2018anti-Goldilocks\u2019 moment\u201d, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, with pay growth accelerating but unemployment also up. Beauchamp explains: Wages continue to rise at a strong pace but unemployment has ticked up too, a most unwelcome sight for the Bank of England (and indeed the government). While this means the BoE will have to keep its foot to the floor in policy terms, it also shows that cracks are showing up in the edifice of UK plc. The money markets are indicating that the Bank of England is certain to raise borrowing costs again at its next meeting, on 3rd August. Another large, half-point increase in interest rates, from 5% to 5.5%, is seen at a 70% chance (based in the price of interest rate swaps) while there is a 30% possibility of a smaller, quarter-point increase to 5.25%. Bank rate is expected to hit 6% by November, and at least 6.25% by next spring. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says there will be \u2018intense\u2019 pressure on the BoE to keep raising interest rates, following today\u2019s employment data. Beck explains: \u201cHeadline (three-month average of the annual rate) total earnings growth increased to 6.9% in May, a 21-month high. Private sector regular pay rose 7.7% on the same basis, a record high outside the pandemic period and running well ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s forecast for growth of 6.3% in Q2. The pressure on the MPC to continue increasing rates in August will be intense. \u201cThe latest data for the labour market did at least offer signs of loosening on the quantities side. Employment continued to rise, increasing by 102,000 in the three months to May on the previous three-month period. But inactivity fell back, contributing to the workforce growing 1.1% year-on-year in the three months to May. This took the economically active population virtually back to its pre-Covid size. The net effect of more people in work, but a bigger workforce, was to push the Labour Force Survey jobless rate up to 4%, from 3.8% previously. Wages increased at a faster rate than expected in May, putting pressure on the Bank of England to push up the cost of borrowing at its next meeting in August, my colleague Phillip Inman writes. Earnings growth hit 7.3%, driven by the strongest rise in private sector pay growth outside the pandemic period of 7.7%, the Office for National Statistics said. City analysts had expected wage growth to ease to 7.1%. Pay growth was also revised up for the previous month to 7.3% from 7.2%. Speaking at the Mansion House annual dinner in the City, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, warned wage restraint would be needed to bring down high inflation. More here. The TUC is concerned that pay continues to lag behind inflation, despite the rise in basic wages in the last two months. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says it would be \u201creckless\u201d to push the UK into recession to cool inflation: \u201cThe government must stop scapegoating workers for its failures. Wages are not driving inflation \u2013 they are not even keeping up with it. \u201cIn the public sector and lower-paid private sector industries, pay is even further behind. \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s own data shows that nominal pay gains are being driven by the very highest earners. \u201cWorking families have suffered 15 years of falling living standards. Ministers shouldn\u2019t be forcing households to become even poorer. \u201cWe need a credible economic plan for boosting growth, jobs and pay. \u201cSetting the UK on course for another damaging recession would be reckless.\u201d The 13 increases in UK interest rates since December 2021 could now be hitting demand for workers, says Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. Ussher explains: \u201cWage costs remain very acute for employers across all sectors of the economy as businesses struggle to find the talent they need in a market that still has over two hundred thousand more vacancies than before the pandemic. \u201cHowever, there are also some hopeful signs, with the number of vacancies falling and more people coming out of inactivity back into the labour market. \u201cThere is also a suggestion that recent interest rate rises are starting to feed through, with a reduction in payrolled employees and a slight increase in the historically low rate of unemployment.\u201d Bloomberg agrees that the Bank of England will not be pleased by today\u2019s jobs report, saying: UK wage growth held at a level that Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said is fueling inflation, maintaining pressure for higher interest rates. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses held at 7.3% in the three months through May after figures for the period through April were revised up, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday. It equaled the highest readings on record, last month and in mid-2021 when the figures were distorted by the pandemic. Economists had expected a slowdown to 7.1%. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says today\u2019s labour market report is another \u201cdismal\u201d report card for the government: \u201cThese figures are another dismal reflection of the Tories\u2019 mismanagement of the economy over the last thirteen years. \u201cBritain is the only G7 country with a lower employment rate than before the pandemic and real wages have fallen yet again \u2013 just as more and more families feel the devastating impact of the Tory mortgage bombshell. \u201cLabour\u2019s mission is to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. We will create good jobs across every part of the country and our welfare reform and job support plan will get Britain working again.\u201d Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has responded to today\u2019s jobs report, saying: \u201cOur jobs market is strong with unemployment low by historical standards. But we still have around 1 million job vacancies, pushing up inflation even further. Our labour market reforms - including expanding free childcare next year - will help to build the high wage, high growth, low inflation economy we all want to see.\u201d [Reminder, unemployment has risen to 4%, while there are fewer vacancies than last month.] The minister for employment, Guy Opperman, says: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see inactivity falling, vacancies dropping, and employment on the up. To get prices down and help make mortgages manageable, we must halve inflation and grow our economy. To do that we are helping those who can, into work, and we recently increased the amount someone on Universal Credit can claim back for childcare to make working that bit easier. \u201cOur new Midlife MOT website is also helping everyone to future-proof their finances, whether that\u2019s looking at options for work, reviewing their skills or understanding their pensions.\u201d More people have returned to the UK labour market, as the cost of living squeeze continued to hit household finances. The economic inactivity rate decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 20.8% in March to May 2023, the Office for National Statistics reports. That means more people were either in work, or looking for a job. The ONS explains: The decrease in economic inactivity during the latest quarter was largely driven by those inactive for other reasons, those looking after family or home, and those who are retired. The increases in the employment and unemployment rates and the decrease in the inactivity rate during the latest quarter were attributed to men. UK companies reduced their vacancies for new staff in the last three months. In April to June 2023, the estimated number of vacancies fell by 85,000 to 1,034,000. This is the 12th consecutive fall in vacancies, as the jobs market returned to normal after the worker shortages following the Covid-19 pandemic. Over the last year, the total number of vacancies has fallen by 265,000. But, it is still 232,000 above pre-Covid-19 levels. Sterling is rallying this morning, following the news that UK pay growth was stronger than expected in the last quarter. The pound has hit a 15-month high against the US dollar at $1.2913, the highest level since April 2022. Traders are anticipating the Bank of England will continue hiking interest rates to cool the economy. Today\u2019s labour market report also shows that the unemployment rate has risen to 4% in March-May, up from 3.8%. The number of people unemployed for up to 12 months has risen in the quarter too. More timely data shows that the number of people on company payrolls has dipped by 9,000 in June, to 30.0 million. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan points out that real pay (adjusted for inflation) is still falling, saying: \u201cTotal employment grew in the latest three months while the number of people actively looking for work also increased, both driven by men rejoining the labour market. \u201cPay excluding bonuses has again risen at record levels in cash terms. \u201cDue to high inflation, however, the real value of weekly earnings are still falling, although now at its slowest rate since the end of 2021.\u201d Public sector pay growth continues to lag behind the private sector, meaning public sector workers are suffering a greater blow from soaring inflation. In March to May 2023, average regular pay growth for the private sector was 7.7%, which is the largest growth rate on record (outside of the pandemic period). Public sector pay grew by 5.8%, the fastest growth rate since autumn 2001. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK wage growth has accelerated to a record high as workers continue to push for pay rises to protect them from soaring inflation. New data just released this morning shows that average pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 7.3% year-on-year in March to May 2023, the joint-highest reading on record (matching a peak seen during Covid-19 lockdowns). That\u2019s stronger than expected. And the previous month\u2019s data has been revised higher too, to show 7.3% wage growth in February-April too (up from 7.2%). Economists had expected a small slowdown in pay growth today, to 7.1%, but this data suggests that wage inflation is more persistent \u2013 which will cause serious worries in the Bank of England, which fears a price-earnings spiral. Total pay, including bonuses, also strengthened \u2013 growing by 6.9% in the last quarter. This means wages are still lagging behind inflation, though, which was recorded at 8,7% in April and May, Growth in factory pay was the highest since records began in 2001, with pay growth of 7.8% in manufacturing. The finance and business services sector saw the largest regular growth rate at 9.0%. This morning\u2019s data comes just hours after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and chancellor Jeremy Hunt called for wage and price restraint to help the fight against inflation. In his annual Mansion House dinner, Bailey told City bigwigs: \u201cBoth price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target.\u201d Hunt took a similar line, saying the government would work with the Bank of England, and do \u201cwhat is necessary for as long as necessary\u201d to tackle inflation persistence and bring it down to the 2% target. With public sector unions continuing to push for pay deals, Hunt warned: That means taking responsible decisions on public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary. Hunt also agreed that firms should rein in their efforts to rebuild profit margins, saying: I agree with the Governor that margin recovery benefits no one if it feeds inflation. Also coming up today MPs will question UK mortgage providers this morning about the surge in borrowing costs, which is squeezing the affordability and availability of home loans, and the impact on house prices. The Treasury Committee will hear from Lloyds Banking Group, Santander UK, Skipton Building Society, Nationwide and Paragon Banking Group about the current state of the mortgage market - including levels of mortgage stress, arrears and forbearance - and the outlook for the market in light of higher interest rates. Yesterday, the average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate jumped to 6.63%, up from 6.54% on Friday, and close to the highs last autumn after the \u201cmini-budget\u201d, data provider Moneyfacts reported. Britain\u2019s retailers have recorded a sharp rise in spending in June as hot weather prompted consumers to buy summer clothing and outdoor goods, despite growing pressure on budgets from the cost of living crisis.

Svitolina leads 2-1 and will serve next in the third set. Back to Centre. At 1-1, Svitolina is on the charge, and has two break points at 15-40 on Swiatek\u2019s serve, with one forehand winner coming back at 87mph, much faster than Swiatek\u2019s second serve of 78mph. Swiatek saves both points to force deuce. She hasn\u2019t been playing well by her own lofty standards, but often seems to win the clutch points. Safiullin holds again to love. The geezer is looking like prime Pete Sampras out here. He hasn\u2019t lost a point on his service, and leads 2-1 in the first set. Sinner reached the quarter-finals last year, remember, where he lead Djokovic by two sets, before succumbing to the eventual champion. He is the heavy favourite to progress here, even if Safiullin is playing out of his skin in the first game, an easy hold. Sinner responds to hold a service game of his own, but Safiullin is swinging freely. On Court No 1, the first of our male quarter-final pairings emerge: Jannik Sinner and Roman Safiullin. The Russian is currently ranked 92 in the world, but will rise to 43rd even if he loses here. And 30th if he wins! Absolutely breathless stuff. Take a moment, and maybe read this. Swiatek earns set point, on the Svitolina serve, and the Ukrainian is not aggressive enough! Swiatek dominates the rally, Svitolina is forced long, and the world no 1 has fought back from the brink to tie this match up at one set all! Swiatek attacks the second serve, bunting a return winner just inside the baseline. She gets the mini-break back! It\u2019s 4-4, but another uncharacteristic forehand error gives Svitolina a 5-4 lead. But then, another forehand winner! From the sublime to the ridiculous for Swiatek. It\u2019s 5-5 and still on serve. Ballsy from Swiatek, back to 2-4, with a worldy backhand that lands three centimetres inside the tramline. Another excellent passing shot up the line and the Pole is back to 3-4 in the tie break. What drama. Mini-break for Svitolina! She leads 2-1 in the tie-break. Swiatek is haemorrhaging errors on the forehand \u2013 3-1 to Svitolina \u2013 before the Ukrainian finds a timely ace. She leads the world no 1 4-1 in the tie break. A crucial couple of serves coming up for Swiatek now. Back against the wall, Swiatek finds two excellent winners down the line, before a second-serve ace (!) down the T secures a comfortable hold. It\u2019s 6-6 in the second set. To a decisive tie-break we go! Interestingly, in that last service game, there was a Svitolina serve that was out, but it was not called, not challenged, and the Ukrainian went on to win a crucial point. It\u2019s all happening, back to Centre Court we go! Swiatek held up her end to get to 5-5, before Svitolina did the same to reapply the pressure, roaring into a 6-5 lead with an amazing cross-court winner on the run. Swiatek was in complete control as she came to the net, but the Ukrainian somehow found the angle. The crowd go beserk, and Svitolina screams in delight. Swiatek will once again serve to stay in the match. Vondrousova is in tears, overwhelmed by the enormity of reaching the semi-finals. She races to 40-0, and converted match point at the second attempt with a volley. Her ability to come to the net, and her booming forehand proved too much for Pegula, who must be devastated. \u201cI\u2019m loving grass now,\u201d says the triumphant Czech in her post-match interview. Back on Centre, Svitolina has fought her way back to 4-4 against Swiatek but faces two break points for the Pole. Svitolina saves one with Swiatek bunting a shot into the net, and the world no 1 again makes an error to hand her rival deuce. That is so uncharacteristic from Swiatek, who continues to struggle with her forehand. Two more forehand errors, and suddenly Svitolina leads 7-5, 5-4! The tournament favourite will serve to stay in the match. Pegula is hanging in there, both her and Vondrousova are striking the ball well, pummelling groundstokes back and forth towards each other. Vondrousova rips a forehand down the line to send the game to deuce, before Pegula wins a ridiculous 31-shot rally, surely one of the best of the tournament. The quality is sky high, amnd the Centre Court crowd are loving it. Vondrousova forces break point, prevailing on another monster rally in which both hit the baseline, before the 24-year-old breaks again. Vondrousova will serve for the match! She leads 5-4, having won the past four games! Vondrousova is full of beans, and with new balls in her hands, sends down some hearty serves towards Pegula. It feels like Vondrousova should be taller than she is, in the mould of Kvitova maybe, but she stands only at 5ft6in, so her 107mph serves are most welcome. Vondrousova holds, and we are all square at 4-4 in the third. What a finale in store. Things are hotting up on Court 1. Pegula has retained her early break and leads 4-2, but Vondrousova throws herself to her right to somehow pull out a clutch volley at the net. Great point, the Czech lefty is now out of it yet! She earns two break points by coming to the net again and converts the second, forcing Pegula into the error. Things are back on serve in the third set, although Vondrousova still trails 3-4. She is piping the tennis ball though, and has momentum here. Thanks Tom, back with a can of fizzy pop. I can\u2019t overstate what an awful error that was from Svitolina. Mentally, she completely folded in the rest of the game, she double faulted and let Swiatek dominate the rallies. \u201cTo be a great tennis player, it\u2019s good to have a short memory\u201d, cries the BBC commentary. That\u2019s not a bad piece of advice. It\u2019s vital that Svitolina puts the error behind her and tries to get back into the set. Swiatek holds and consolidates the break, winning the game with a rip-snorting backhand cross court past a flailing Svitolina. The Pole leads 3-1 in the second, but a set down of course. Swiatek breaks for a 2-1 lead in the second set. Swiatek initially looks as if she still can\u2019t get anything out of Svitolina\u2019s serve, which is accurate but not venomous. The Ukrainian races to 40-0 before netting a ridiculously soft attempted drop volley. A proper howler, and this one could be a turning point. It\u2019s followed with a double-fault for 40-30. And suddenly, we\u2019re at deuce when a probing return from Swiatek prompts another return into the net. Svitolina\u2019s second double-fault of the game takes us to a second deuce, and Swiatek then earns a break point with a deep looping forehand winner, which she converts after controlling a rally that ends with Svitolina backhanding into the net. And Michael\u2019s back and full of omelette and good cheer. So I\u2019ll hand you back. Swiatek shows signs of restoring her forehand mo-jo with an effortlessly firm winner into the corner. And gives her backhand a strong workout before one of them reels off an equally fine winner into the corner for 40-15. And it\u2019s an easy, and hugely needed, hold. 1-1, second set. They\u2019re back out and warming up on Court One for the other quarter-final. Aaand \u2026 we resume where we left off. Svitolina holds to love, dominating the rallies and inducing more overhit returns from the Pole. She\u2019s now won 20 out of the last 22 point. Svitolina leads 7-5, 1-0 They\u2019re back out on Centre Court. Swiatek\u2019s been in deep and honest conflab with her coaching team in the box. The break in play might be what Swiatek needs. She\u2019s recovered from these sorts of situations aplenty, including in this fortnight, but her game really did fall apart at the end of that set. Svitolina\u2019s playing well, striking the ball cleanly and judiciously, but hasn\u2019t had to produce anything spectacular to take the set. Meanwhile, Jessica Pegula has an early break in the third set against Vondrousova and leads 3-1. And then spots of rain are felt and the roof is called for. Likewise on Centre Court so we\u2019ll have a wee pause. The covers are on the outside courts too. Match on! Svitolina pins Swiatek to the back of the court in a lengthy rally, inducing an error, and it\u2019s 0-30 when she dobs a neat drop-volley just over the net. But Swiatek finally keeps her composure and control in a long rally to win her first service-game point in seven. No matter though because Svitolina responds brilliantly to earn two set points, which she takes at the first opportunity, a testing angled backhand forcing Swiatek to stretch slightly and volley a backhand wide. She\u2019s won 16 of the last 18 points, and, having already enjoyed some remarkable wins in the past week and a half, the biggest and best of the lot now beckons. But Swiatek\u2019s dug herself out of bother before. Swiatek\u2019s forehand is really misfiring, another shank handing Svitolina a 30-0 advantage and a low one at the net also drifting wide. And another one gives Svitolina the hold. I\u2019d make her the likelier winner of this set now. 6-5. Over on Court One, we\u2019re on serve in the decider. One set all, one game all between Jessica Pegula and Marketa Vondrousova. Svitolina breaks back! And to love, to boot. A horrible service game from the top seed as she mis-hits two forehands long for 0-30, the second from a particularly probing Svitolina return it must be said. Make that three forehands overhit, and the Ukrainian has three break points. To round things off, a double-fault hands Svitolina the break-back. 5-5, first set. Svitolina, serving, claws back a deficit for 30-all and goes on to hold, dominating her rallies impressively, and pumping up a crowd that\u2019s largely on her side. Swiatek is not at her imperious best here \u2013 the odd error pockmarking her play \u2013 but she will serve for the set at 5-4. Jessica Pegula breaks again to 30 to secure the set 6-2, and take us into a third A tricky service game for Swiatek but she prevails. She races to 30-0 lead but a better back-of-court forehand from Svitolina seals her the next point and that\u2019s followed by a sloppy Swiatek forehand into the net. Another wayward forehand from the favourite takes us to deuce, the first of two as Swiatek nets after a long rally. She eventually seals the hold with some confident serving and Svitolina will serve to stay in the set at 3-5. Svitolina offers a sprightly response to a couple of disappointing games, that strong forehand serving her well as she holds to love. Pegula stretches her lead against Vandrousova in the second set to 4-1. Looks as if we\u2019re headed for a decider there. Swiatek pushes Svitolina all over the court for 30-0 before an emphatic angled forehand gets the Ukrainian in the game, but it\u2019s a comfortable hold. 4-2. Over on Court 1 Pegula has a much-needed break against Vandrousova and leads 3-1 in the second set, with the Czech a set up. Thanks Michael. Afternoon everyone. Never had Swiatek pegged for an AC/DC fan I have to say. (Guess the Tennis Player\u2019s Playlist could make a decent game). Anyway, after her last service game was a bit of a highway to hell (sorry), the No 1 seed is back to her tenacious best on Svitolina\u2019s serve, taking it to deuce and then going on to break with a firm angled forehand. She leads 3-2, first set, and a break up. Svitolina breaks! The Centre Court crowd are certainly rooting for her a little more than Swiatek, as the Ukrainian gets the scores back on serve at 2-2. I\u2019m off for my lunch, My wife has just described the omelette she has kindly made for me as \u201cone of the worst looking omelettes in history.\u201d I can confirm it looks like an absolute mess, but tastes bloomin\u2019 lovely. Tom Davies will take you through the next hour. From the moment she stepped on Centre Court, with those headphones over her ears, Swiatek has looked like a woman possessed. She thumps a forehand crosscourt winner to get back to 30-30, and then follows it up with the deftest two-handed volley at the net, the ball dying beautifully in front of Svitolina, who quietly applauds the shot. For those that want to know what Swiatek is listening to in those headphones, it\u2019s rock\u2018n\u2019roll music. There are a few bands that I listen to before a match,\u201d Swiatek told reporters in 2022. \u201cLed Zeppelin, AC/DC and Guns N\u2019 Roses, they were always the three that were really kind of perfect for the situation. \u201cSo I use music to kind of have something that\u2019s going to get my brain busy and relaxed before the match. But also when I want to be more energetic, it really helps me.\u201d Back on Centre Court, Swiatek has an early break, but Svitolina rallies to hold her next service game, angling a fierce serve into the body of Swiatek to cramp the Pole. It is 2-1 in the first set to the world No 1, who will serve next. That set was a weird one. Both Pegula and Vondrousova flickered with intent, but ultimately it was the serving that separated the pair. Pegula\u2019s first and second serve percentage was 41/50%, while Vondrousova\u2019s was 68/74%. Vondrousova sets up set point with an ace, which hits the chalk and glides under Pegula\u2019s racket, and an unforced error hands the Czech player the set. She is half-way to the semi-finals at Wimbledon! Pegula ties it up at 4-4! But then immediately falls 0-30 down. It doesn\u2019t feel like a pattern or a narrative in this match has been established. Both players are ebbing and flowing between form and inconsistency. Vondrousova hits a cleeeeeean backhand return winner to get to 15-40 but Pegula hangs in with some neat work at the net to get back to 30-40, and then deuce. Pegula\u2019s touch at the net has really improved with her doubles game \u2013 she and Coco Gauff are within the top 10 ranked pair \u2013 but Vondrousova forces yet another break of serve with some powerful hitting. The Czech will serve for the first set at 5-4. On Centre, Swiatek and Svitolina are knocking up in front of the royal box. This is the first time in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for Swiatek, so nerves will be jangling. \u201cSpotted your comment about it being more than a decade ago that Djokovic lost on Centre Court Wimbledon,\u201d emails Laura Albero. \u201cAs my daughter pointed out, last time he was beaten she did not exist (she just turned 10 yesterday).\u201d Happy birthday to your daughter, Laura! Confidence is flowing for Vondrousova, who holds to go 4-2 up. The Czech is not afraid to mix things up with pace and bounce and spin, and Pegula is obviously not comfortable. Our man at SW19, Tumaini Carayol, concurs. Vondrousova holds and then wins an absolutely sublime point to go 0-40 up on Pegula\u2019s serve. Both players shows great grit in defence and sent some booming forehands down the line. Vondrousova brought Pegula to the net with a drop shot and then put her away with a backhand. Oooof. Vondrousova gets the break, and has now won the last three games to lead 3-2. Pegula actually looks like she\u2019s targeting the Vondrousova forehand, which is an interesting tactic. But the Czech has settled, perhaps Vondrousova had some early nerves, and Pegula struggles with her serve. One second serve comes down at just 83mph, and Vondrousova is able to break straight back. We are back on serve. 2-1 in the first. Pegula holds her own service game, and then breaks Vondrousova at the first opportunity to lead 2-0 in the first set! Vondrousova\u2019s strength is her forehand, but the lefty hasn\u2019t got it going yet and a few sloppy errors gave Pegula the break. Overcast conditions today at Wimbledon but no rain, so the roof is off. Court No 1 only looks about two-thirds full, although I\u2019m sure it will fill out. Disappointing, though. We get underway with Pegula-Vondrousova, with the American to serve first. Swiatek v Svitolina will start in around half an hour from now on Centre. Pegula and Vondrousova have just come out on No 1 Court. Both look very focused, this is new ground for both of them. Neither has ever made it past the Wimbledon third round before. Vondrousova reached the French Open final back in 2019, but has had three wrist surgeries since then. She has certainly found some form here, though, losing just one set so far this tournament. An email from Jeremy Routledge. \u201cJust to say I saw Marketa Vondrousova in her doubles match yesterday out on Court 17 and thought she looked in imperious form, she\u2019s such a guileful, intelligent player with beautiful ground strokes (and lots of tattoos). I\u2019m now a big fan. Go Marketa!\u201d Just to flag a fairly ridiculous stat: Djokovic has not lost on Centre Court IN OVER A DECADE. Ten years, people. His last loss on Centre Court came to Andy Murray on 7 July, 2013, which was the final that year. Since then he\u2019s won 43 matches in a row on the world\u2019s most famous tennis court and hoping to make it 44 today. We all know about Djokovic. The GOAT, at least in terms of grand slam titles won, he has won the past four Wimbledon men\u2019s singles titles. Preeeeeeettty, preeeetttty good. Barney Ronay wrote something on Serbian, if you are craving some Novak content, and it\u2019s (also) excellent. But his opponent today, Andrey Rublev? Well the Russian hit one of the best tennis shots I have ever seen in the last round against Alexander Bublik, whose reaction to the shot is extremely memeable, but probably reflects my own face in the Guardian office on Sunday. A triumph of athleticism, timing, and determination. Here\u2019s what Djokovic had to say about Rublev before their match today, which starts on Centre after Swiatek v Svitolina concludes. Rublev is a fantastic player, one of the best forehands on tour. He is a very good person who works hard to be in the top 10, which he has been for the last few years. He is one of the most consistent players across all surfaces. I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d And just like that, our first email, from Joe Hoyt. \u201cI\u2019ve been following Wimbledon here and with their own highlights. Has anyone else noticed that while Wimbledon persists with line judges it has added AI generated commentary to the match highlight packages? I find it excruciatingly daft and distracting\". I had read about it (here) but I haven\u2019t seen any of the AI stuff yet. I have just tracked down a vid though. Here\u2019s AI highlights of Chris Eubanks v Stefanos Tsitsipas, for your consideration. It\u2019s as dreary and lifeless as you would expect, although not a whole lot worse than some of the TV \u2018personalities\u2019 out there. Please get in touch, if you have any feelings about today\u2019s events. I\u2019m at michael.butler@theguardian.com or on dwindling social media platform Twitter: @michaelbutler18. Two contrasting stories from yesterday \u2026 First of Centre Court is arguably the game of the day: Swiatek v Svitolina. The world No 1 versus the most popular player at this year\u2019s Championships. Svitolina has certainly made her mark here, particularly in Sunday\u2019s emotion-filled win over Belarusian Victoria Azarenka, but there are many factors at play here: her nationality, the fact that she only gave birth to her daughter nine months ago, her openness and disarming personality (Harry Styles has since offered her tickets to an upcoming concert, don\u2019t worry). But above all, it\u2019s Svitolina\u2019s tennis ability that is centre stage. Nobody has more wins against current No 1s in the past 10 years than the Ukrainian. Swiatek will be worried. This is great, from Guardian snapper Sarah Lee. Jessica Pegula is having a fine time at the moment, and she will get today\u2019s action underway against Marketa Vondrousova. Pegula has dropped just one set (in the first round) in this year\u2019s tournament and looks in fine fettle as she aims to make her first grand slam semi-final. Pegula has had a real late resurgence in her career, and didn\u2019t break into the top 100 until she was 25. Now 29, she is one of the world\u2019s best player, and has found a real consistency outside of the slams. Tumaini did this excellent interview with her earlier this year, well worth a read (she is the daughter of a billionaire who owns the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills and NHL\u2019s Buffalo Sabres). Her opponent, Vondrousova, is no mug. Unseeded but ranked 42nd and a former French Open finalist, the Czech lefty could easily cause Pegula some problems today. It\u2019s an intriguing opener on Court No 1. Hello world. We\u2019re down to the last eight in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s draw. Big boy/big girl tennis. Loads of storylines, loads of drama. It should stay dry, so the roof on each court should stay open but This Is England, so no promises. Here\u2019s the order of play today, on Centre and Court No 1. As you can see, play to get underway at around 1pm BST, although not everyone is happy about that. But with just two quarter-final matches on each of the show courts today, we shouldn\u2019t have any more 11pm finishes (although Kim Clijsters and Martina Hingis are pairing up in a ladies invitational doubles round robin later on No 1, which is quite fun)."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f47", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/11/tour-de-france-2023-stage-10-updates-on-road-from-vulcania-to-issoire-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France 2023: stage 10 updates on road from Vulcania to Issoire \u2013 live", "lead": "<strong>Rolling report:</strong> Will Jonas Vingegaard cling on to the yellow jersey after Monday\u2019s rest day?

It\u2019s heartbreaking for the Latvian but he\u2019s still in the lead group, taking a breather at the back. 4.5km to go: Neilands\u2019 gap is reduced to six seconds as Georg Zimmermann leads the chasing quintet, who are riding together \u2026 for the time being. 7km to go: It\u2019s a downhill finish but not a particularly steep one. The riders are currently clocking 59km per hour. Neilands\u2019 lead is flitting between 10 and 15 seconds. He\u2019s putting in a terrific shift. 8km to go: Neilands holds on to his slender lead, while the Alaphilippe group is 20 seconds behind the Bilbao and Chaves group. 12km to go: Neilands pedals on, just nine seconds clear of the Bilbao and Chaves group. \u201cIt\u2019s the day of your life! It\u2019s the day of your life! Come on, man!\u201d he\u2019s told by his team boss. It might be for now but it\u2019s not looking good for the Latvian. 14km to go: Caleb Ewan is having his birthday party in the sprinters group, which is currently 27 minutes behind the stage leader. 15km to go: Krists Neilands gets some word of encouragement from his team boss, who tells him how great he is and encourages him to focus on the downhill. He\u2019s 16 seconds clear. 15km to go: Alaphilippe is in a four-man group with Warren Barguil, desperate to rein in the six riders ahead of them. Wout van Aert is towing the peloton along with his team leader Jonas Vingegaard fourth from the front. 20km to go: The peloton are 3min 31sec behind Neilands, the stage leader, who has five riders chasing him down as the road levels out a bit: Pello Bilbao, Ben O\u2019Connor, Georg Zimmermann, Esteban Chaves and Antonio Pedreras. Julian Alaphilippe is 22 seconds behind them. 23km to go: Looking for his first ever Grand Tour stage win, the Latvian Israel-Premier Tech rider Krists Neilands begins his descent towards the finish line with a handy 24-second lead over the chasing posse. 28km to go: Neilands has crested the summit of the C\u00f4te de la Chapelle-Marcousse with a lead of 39 seconds over a group of five riders including Pello Bilbao. Julian Alaphilippe does not seem to be among them. 30km to go: Krists Neilands is in the closing stages of the climb with a lead of 36 seconds over those chasing him. Ineos Grenadiers are towing the peloton along. 30km to go: Mathieu van der Poel\u2019s attack comes to an end and he drops back to the peloton. Wout van Aert is currently stranded in no-man\u2019s land, 38 seconds ahead of the bunch but three minutes behind the leader. 33km to go: With over four kilometres of the climb remaining, Israel-Premier Tech rider Krists Neilands has attacked and opened a gap of 16 seconds on the leading group. 34km to go: The leaders hit the final climb with the gap to the peloton at 3min 04sec. Wout van Aert and Mathiu van der Poel are between the two groups, only 2min 28sec behind the leaders. 36km to go: The lead group of 14 riders are approaching the foot of the final climb to the C\u00f4te de la Chapelle-Marcousse. It\u2019s a category three at 980m high, 6.5km in length and has an average gradient of 5.6%. 41km to go: Onwards and downwards they go on another very eventful day on this Tour de France. At the finish line, the mercury on the thermometer is in the very early forties. 43km to go: Chasing the leaders, Wout van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel have put 10 seconds between themselves and the peloton. 46km to go: Our lead group of 14 riders are are burning rubber down the penultimate descent of the stage at 63km per hour with the gap back to the peloton at 2min 22sec. 51km to go: Krists Neilands opens a small gap on the latest descent, with the 13 others in the breakaway group in hot pursuit, breathing down his neck. 54km to go: There are 54 kilometres left in this stage and 40 of them are downhill. 56km to go: Despite appeals from other teams, Ineos Grenadiers are refusing to do any work in the peloton as they don\u2019t want to hamper Michal Kwiatkowski\u2019s chances of winning the stage. Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck) is currently on the front of the peloton and the gap is down to 2min 20sec. 58km to go: \u201cThis has been an absolute riot of a day so far,\u201d writes Bill Preston. \u201cThe plan for everyone appears to be \u2018Get a stomp on!\u2019 Which is the sort of racing tactics I admire and endorse. It could only be more fun if team radios were randomly jammed. \u201cAnd [we had] a man dressed as a fish who had a Pinot sign. Which is all kinds of brilliant. Hopefully, and given recent events, the final final break in whatever form it is will come to an accord to neutralize the final descent, and let their thrilling heroics on the way up the final ascent decide the order of the day.\u201d 60km to go: Luke Durbridge (Jayco\u2013AlUla) is doing the donkey work at the front of the peloton, upping the pace. With Pello Bilbao in the lead group, he\u2019s trying to narrow the gap to protect Simon Yates\u2019 GC position of sixth. 65km to go: On motorbike pillion duty for Eurosport at the back of the peloton, Jens Voigt is explaining how unpleasant it is for the riders today. \u201cIt\u2019s 36 degrees celsius, there\u2019s not a single tree so there\u2019s no protection from the wind and it\u2019s up and down all day long,\u201d he says. \u201cThe roads are absolutely dead, not rolling at all. It\u2019s a horrible day for the riders. It\u2019s hot, no shadow, the speed is crazy fast and won\u2019t slow down, and the road surface is absolutely terrible.\u201d If he\u2019d finished that solioquy with a \u201cHappy birthday, Caleb Ewan!\u201d, it would have been a serious mic-drop moment. 66km to go: Our leaders are maintaining a gap of 3min 10sec to the peloton. With just one categorised climb remaining in this stage, you would imagine today\u2019s stage winner will come from this group of 14. 72km to go: Julian Alaphilippe is making the pace in the lead group. He\u2019ll be relishing the big descent down to today\u2019s finish line. 74km to go: In the lead group, Cofidis rider Anthony Perez waves his bidon in front of a nearby TV camera, presumably to let the occupants of his team car know he is in need of liquid refreshment. It\u2019s hot out there. 76km to go: Our lead group of 14 riders have a three-minute lead over the peloton, which is being towed along by several Jumbo-Visma riders. Jonas Vingegaard is conspicuous in yellow about five from the front. 78km to go: Esteban Chavez finishes the most recent climb with a lead of 3min 20sec over the peloton and is now facing back-to-back uncategorised climbs. The Colombian rejoins the breakaway from which he recently broke away. 83km to go: Chavez remains out in front, followed by Julian Alaphilippe (Soudal-Quick Step), Kasper Asgreen (Soudal\u2013Quick-Step), Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch\u00e9-Circus-Wanty), Nick Schultz and Krists Neilands (Israel-Premier Tech), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), Warren Barguil (Arkea-Samsic), Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek), Ben O\u2019Connor (AG2R-Citro\u00ebn), Harold Tejada (Astana), Antonio Pedrero (Movistar), Anthony Perez (Cofidis) and Michal Kwiatkowski (Ineos Grenadiers). 84km to go: Unwilling to give anyone, including me, a moment\u2019s peace or respite, Esteban Chaves from EF Education-EasyPost attacks off the front of the lead group as the lead group tackle the category three C\u00f4te de Saint-Victor-la-Rivi\u00e8re. Why, Estebean? Why? He opens a gap of 32 seconds and looks over his shoulders a couple of times, possibly questioning the wisdom of his move as he has no company and might burn himself out. 85km to go: We have 14 riders in front as the Alaphilippe group finally catches the leaders. The gap to the peloton is 2min 54sec. 89km to go: Julian Alaphilippe is making up time on the leaders on this descent. He\u2019s 20 seconds behind them. 94km to go: WIth most of the field descending. Our lead group now consists of Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch\u00e9-Circus-Wanty), Nick Schultz (Israal-Premier Tech), Esteban Chaves (EF Education-EasyPost), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), Warren Barguil (Arkea-Samsic), Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) and Ben O\u2019Connor (AG2R-Citro\u00ebn). On motrobike analysis duty for Eurosport, he asks somebody in the Bahrain-Victorious team car if winning the stage or moving into the top 10 on GC is the main priority for Pello Bilbao. He gets a non-commital answer but reading between the lines the suggestion is that it\u2019s the stage win they want, because obviously if he can secure that, the GC will look after itself. 98km to go: The peloton has been decimated on the way up that climb but what\u2019s left of it is led over the summit by Jumbo-Visma\u2019s Wout van Aert. They\u2019re 2min 36sec behind the leaders. 101km to go: \u201cCaleb Ewan is already having a bad enough birthday, but how far back does he have to get before he will be timed out automatically?\u201d asked Richard O\u2019Hagan. I think we need somebody to win the stage before the stopwatch starts but Caleb won\u2019t be giving Pello Bilbao a slice of birthday cake if he keeps up this blistering pace in the lead group. 102km to go: Our lead seven riders have opened a lead of 40 seconds over the chase group containing Julian Alaphilippe. The leaders won\u2019t want Alaphilippe joining them, as his presence in the breakaway would significantly reduce their individual chances of winning the stage. The peloton is 2min 18sec behind the leaders. 104km to go: Kasper Asgreen is dropped from the lead group, which has now been joined by Ben O\u2019Connor. Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) is making a blistering pace as he tries to get into the top 10 on GC. He\u2019s 7min 37sec behind Jonas Vingegaard on the leaderboard. 106km to go: The lead group are on their way up the Col de la Croix Saint-Robert. It\u2019s six kilometres long, 1,451m high and has an average gradient of 6.3%. The peloton is 1min 52sec behind them. 106km to go: Most of the sprinters are riding together in a group six minutes behind the leaders. Caleb Ewan is already 12 minutes off the pace. 107km: Our leading group of seven riders pass through the intermediate sprint at the foot of the category two Col de la Croix Saint-Robert. Kasper Asgreen is first across the line, taking \u20ac1,500 for the team beer kitty. Alphilippe, Ben O\u2019Connor and three others are 24 seconds behind. 109km to go: Jumbo-Visma have slowed the pace in the yellow jersey group, suggesting the peloton is about to reform at the bottom of the climb. It\u2019s good news for David Gaudu, Romain Bardet and the brothers Yates. 111km to go: Kasper Asgreen (Soudal-Quick Step), Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch\u00e9-Circus-Wanty), Nick Schultz (Israal-Premier Tech), Esteban Chaves (EF Education-EasyPost), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), Warren Barguil (Arkea-Samsic) and Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) remain out in front, with a lead of 32 seconds over the Alaphilippe quintet. The Gaudu group are now just a minute behind Vingegaard and Pogacar, which is being led by two Jumbo-Visma riders. It looks like they\u2019re going to catch them and reform the peloton. 111km to go: Things finally start to settle down with the next long climb looming. There are almost 100 riders, including the Yates brothers, in the Gaudu group that is 1min 30sec behind the much smaller yellow jersey group. 117km to go: The riders of Groupama-FDJ are towing the Gaudu group along, trying to close the gap to the yellow jersey group. They\u2019re pedalling at full gas, as they say in cycling, but not making any obvious inroads. 119km to go: Julian Alaphilippe makes it on to the chase group, which is about 25 seconds behind the leading seven riders. 121km to go: Kasper Asgreen (Soudal-Quick Step), Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch\u00e9-Circus-Wanty), Nick Schultz (Israal-Premier Tech), Esteban Chaves (EF Education-EasyPost), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), Warren Barguil (Arkea-Samsic) and Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) have opened a gap of 27 seconds on the bunch featuring Pogacar and Vingegaard. There are four men on the road between both groups. The Gaudu group including Jakobsen are almost three minutes behind. 125km to go: Kasper Asgreeen, Georg Zimmerman and Warrenn Barguil are in a group of seven riders trying to escape from the bunch. At the back of the field, a motorbike with a cameraman on board pulls alongside who Jasper Philipsen and the man in the green jersey looks down the barrel with a grimace before performing a \u201cslit-throat\u201d gesture, to let everyone know how difficult he\u2019s finding today\u2019s going. He\u2019s not the only one \u2013 the race has been blown apart in today\u2019s early stages and it\u2019s tough to keep an eye on everyone. 127km to go: It\u2019s all change again at the front of the race, where we have a group of about 35 riders, including Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar. A group of six riders try to break away, while the Gaudu group is 2min 14sec behind. 130km to go: On a rare stretch of flat road in today\u2019s stage, Mohoric and Alaphilippe have been been joined by Krists Neilands, Lilian Calmejane, Georg Zimmerman and Nelson Oliveira. There are plenty more riders battling to get across to gatecrash their party. 133km to go: Alaphilippe and Mohoric continue their descent with the peloton hot on their tail. A group of 20 riders including David Gaudu, Neilson Powless, Egan Bernal, Ion Izagirre is a further 1min 30sec back. 136km to go: Alaphilippe and Mohoric are now in front as the descent continues. The yellow jersey group is just 15 seconds behind them. 136km to go: Krists Neiland has been joined by Wout Poels as the riders hurl themselves down the long climb. Julian A;aphilippe is chasing them, hurling himself into the corners of the narrow road at breakneck speed. Matej Mohoric is right on his wheel. 140km to go: I can confirm that Wout van Aert is indeed having a tough time of things in a peloton that is 1min 46sec behind the yellow jersey group. The field are on their second descent of the day, where things could change very quickly again. It\u2019s been a ludicrously chaotic start. 142km to go: With the stage yet to settle down as they tackle the second stiff climb of the day, we have about 60 riders spread out over about 300 metres of asphalt at the front of the race. Krist Neilands is now out on his own in front with two kilometres of the climb remaining. The yellow jersey group are about 30 seconds behind him. 144km to go: In eighth place on GC and the brightest French prospect at this year\u2019s Tour, David Gaudu seems to have been dropped and there\u2019s talk that Wout van Aert may also be in trouble. I thought he was trying to bridge the gap between the peloton and the breakaway but I may be mistaken. More news as I get it. 144km to go: There are skirmishes all over the road and as things stand we have a group of 13 riders in front on the 6.7km climb to the Col de Guery. As I type, it sheds several riders. A quintet comprising Louis Meintjes, Christopher Juul-Jensen, Michal Kwiatkowski, Krist Neilands and Clement Champoussin now lead the stage. 149km to go: Jonas Vingegaard, Tadej Pogacar, Sepp Kuss, Romain Bardet, Simon Yates and Adam Yates are all in the yellow jersey group that is being hunted down by a peloton led by Ineos Grenadiers. 151km to go: Ineos Grenadiers take up the cudgels at the front of the peloton. At the front of the race, a group of around 15 riders have opened a gap of 21 seconds over the nine-man yellow jersey group. 152km to go: In third place on GC, it looks like Jai Hindley has also missed the break. It would certainly explain his team\u2019s place at the front of the peloton. 154km to go: They\u2019re on the first of many of today\u2019s descents and a number of riders including Jonas Vingegaard, Tadej Pogacar and several other GC big-hitters bridge the gap to lead group. It\u2019s now 22-strong. Julian Alaphilippe, who will have fancied his chances today, has missed the break and is back in a bunch being led by Bora-Hansgrohe. 160km to go: With the gradient at a calf-busting seven per cent, a group of seven riders \u2013 Jorgenson, Strong, Charmig, Cavagna, Kwiatkowski, I. Izagirre and Neilands - have opened a small gap as they go over the top of the climb. At the back of the bunch, Fabio Jakobsen has been dropped. 161km to go: Caleb Ewan is already struggling at the back of the peloton. He turns 28 today but doesn\u2019t look to be having the happiest of birthdays thus far. 163km to go: Correction: It\u2019s Israel-Premier Tech\u2019s Krists Neilands who has opened a gap. He\u2019s joined by Bryan Coquard from Cofidis and they\u2019re about 10 seconds clear of the rest. 164km to go: The bunch hits the foot of the first climb, the category three Col de la Moreno. It\u2019s 1,065m high, with an average gradient of 4.7%. Israel-Premier Tech rider Dylan Teuns is towing them along and has opened a tiny gap. 166km to go: A group of 10 riders peel off the front but are quickly reeled in by the bunch. The roll-out continues: There\u2019s another kilometre to go before battle commences and what an early skirmish we have in store. The temperature is around 43 degrees celsius and today\u2019s stage profile looks like a shark\u2019s lower jawbone. Who\u2019d be a pro cyclist? Good luck, lads! The riders roll out: Facing a stiff five-kilometre category three climb as soon as the flag drops and they are given the signal to begin racing, the prospect of today\u2019s nasty start may have tempered yesterday\u2019s rest day for many riders. It\u2019s a day for a breakaway, which is likely to escape very early this afternoon.

The battle on the climb at the start will be intense and a downhill finish means the final four-mile ascent could see drama aplenty, while there is barely a flat stretch of road in between. This stage will be a target for Julian Alaphilippe, Magnus Cort or other stage hunters such as Daniel Mart\u00ednez."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f48", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/11/county-cricket-surrey-v-nottinghamshire-somerset-v-hampshire-and-more-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "County cricket: Surrey v Nottinghamshire, Somerset v Hampshire, and more \u2013 live", "lead": "Join Tanya Aldred for all the latest updates from around the grounds in the County Championship", "author": "Tanya Aldred", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 15:05:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951668", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/95796669f825d57f157cc9410672572a1dbfc1eb/0_51_5459_3276/500.jpg", "body": "A wicket for Vince!

Westley (115) keeping Essex going nicely , 224-5 at Blackpool . Walter just out for 76, a second wicket for Williams. Middx, 227-7, have a lead of 8 over Northants. And it is still raining at The Oval. And at Taunton, James Vince prepares to bowl. A standing ovation for Rew! His first double century, his fifth Championship century of the year, he punches the air, pulls his helmet off, gives that ginger mop an airing, grins, gets a big hug from fellow teenager Bashir. The first Somerset double-ton since Marcus Trescothick. What a season, what a player! Marks calls for Rew, on 198, to dink it to square leg. He indeed sweeps, but just one. Dont\u2019 do anything silly Bashir. Beach ping-pong cricket from Rew and Bashir at Taunton, sticking their legs down the pitch and ruining the figures of the Hampshire mighty attack. Somerset 450-9. Hundreds coming thick and fast round the grounds \u2013 well played Tom Westley \u2013 a third century of a productive year for a man who played five Tests in the forgotten years. Essex 207-4 in a partnership of 152 with Walter (75 not out). Just one Div 2 game rain unaffected, at The Riverside, where Alex Lees is close to a rapid century. Durham 169-4, a couple each for Shaw and Goodman. No. 11 Bashir slicing THE Mohammad Abbas for four. Dreamy days for Somerset.

An unbeaten partnership of 112 at The Oval between Will Young and stand-in skipper Haseeb Hameed. Forgot to mention yesterday but HH was giddy as a colt in the field, chasing after everything full pelt. Notts cruising: 139-1. A fourth wicket for Dawson, Somerset\u2019s 9th, as Brooks is lbw for 12. Rew still there, joined by offsipinner Shoaib Bashir. Two 19 year olds touch gloves at the crease with Summerset in touching distance of 400. Still nowt to see at Cardiff, and rain at Hove where the game has come to a halt with Derbys 96-2.

And Warwickshire have a lead of 87 over Kent, now2 58-5, with Yates on the brink of a patient century after lean times. Not sure which way the weather is going, but it is now raining in Manchester. Typically thoughtful column by Jonny Liew, but what do you think about the cost of county cricket? How much has that gone up? Like Jonathan says, it\u2019s a bit of a blind sport for journalists as we get in for free. Gulf Giants are owned by Adani, who have been the targets of protests by, amongst others, the Chappell brothers. Was alerted to Dom Bess batting, so turn on the Somerset stream to see him in the familiar maroon helmet, tipping the ball away off his toes. I do hope this saga ends in a permanent happy return to Taunton. Somerset 288-6, Rew still there 113; Aldridge done by Dawson for 88. An hour in, let\u2019s wander round the grounds. First the Party Division: Raining still at Sophia Gardens and New Road. Gloucestershire collapsed, losing their last four wickets for 36; and Durham cantering away in the now customary manner \u2013 56-1 off ten. Sussex all out for 402, losing their last three for 22 this morning. Still scored at a cracking rate though \u2013 whoever said BTL yesterday that they\u2019d be chasing honours in a few years if they could hold onto their players: firm agree. Derbys 33-1 in reply. Rew the first to pass 800 runs this year too: The second hundred of the round, and a FIFTH hundred of the year for the calm, classy and extremely talented James Rew. Somerset 245-5. Somerset continue to race along at Taunton, James Rew\u2019s race towards his hundred helped by James Vince letting him slip through his fingers at slip on 86. Somerset 229-5. And Dan Lawrence, just after being announced in the unchanged Test squad, is caught for one as the Blackpool express speeds up. Essex 22-3. An early Lancashire breakthrough at the seaside as Sir Alastair is snaffled by Keaton Jennings at slip, Essex 20-1.

The first time he\u2019s taken six catches in an innings and five wickets for Lyndon James for the first time too. Make that six wickets for James, as Dan Worrall holes out next ball. Surrey 355 all out \u2013 done and dusted in a sneeze. Oh dear, the weather gods not looking kindly on Sophia Gardens \u2013 start delayed there after a day of sky watching on Monday. No play yet at New Road either, but we do have action at Blackpool! On we go, round the grounds, with Surreysd Jordan Clark the most contented man on the grass These were his thoughts last night: \u201cI\u2019ve been a little bit frustrated through the season with how I\u2019ve played and how I feel I\u2019m capable of playing, so I\u2019m glad to get that one out of the way and it\u2019s just good to get a score, \u201cSometimes when you don\u2019t get that score, it plays on your belief and your confidence a little bit. Now I feel I can play with a bit more freedom. \u201cWith a wicket like that, there\u2019s a ball with your name on it and the aim of the game is to try and score runs, so it\u2019s better to put the pressure back on them rather than waiting for the ball to nip back and nick it.\u201d Haseeb Hameed\u2019s first opportunity to captain in Championship cricket proved tricky, Nottinghamshire hampered as both Brett Hutton and Jake Ball left the field at the Oval clutching various parts of their body. Things had started well with Rory Burns out to the second ball of the day, and again with Surrey 70 for four, but a steady innings from Ben Foakes and big hitting from Jordan Clark \u2013 who cracked his first century of the year \u2013 left the champions in a strong position. Casey Aldridge and James Rew kept Somerset in the hunt at Taunton, coming together after a familiar top-order fumble, this time at the hands of Hampshire\u2019s Kyle Abbott who grabbed four for 20 and a run-out. Somerset rested some key players before the Blast Finals Day but Dom Bess returned on a short-term loan from Yorkshire. Matt Parkinson, on loan to Durham before moving to Kent, took three wickets at the Riverside to haul back Gloucestershire, including a ripper to remove James Bracey\u2019s off stump. There were half\u2011centuries from Chris Dent and Miles Hammond. Kent were dismissed for 171 by Warwickshire, who were already in touching distance by stumps. Kent\u2019s blushes had been saved by a late-order swashbuckle from Grant Stewart. It was a carefree day\u2019s batting for Sussex against Derbyshire at Hove, Tom Clark top\u2011scoring with 96 and Ollie Carter passing 50 for the third match in a row. Meanwhile Northamptonshire meandered to 219 all out against Middlesex. At New Road, Finlay Bean and Adam Lyth knocked up 154, Yorkshire\u2019s highest opening stand for six years, before the weather intervened. Worcestershire dropped three catches.

Elsewhere it\u2019s a day of sunny spells and showers, these most frequent in the north, perhaps with thunder and hail. Things whizzing along at Merchant Taylor\u2019s and at Canterbury \u2013 where Kent already look in big trouble against Warwicks; Surrey have clocked together a tricky-looking total against injury-hit Notts, batters racing away at Hove, while Rew and Aldridge rescued Somerset at Taunton.

At issue is whether the House will take up the hard-right amendments, with the weight falling once again on Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Some of the most closely watched amendments relate to abortion, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) funding, and transgender troops, according to Politico\u2019s Playbook. McCarthy will need to navigate between the demands of his most conservative members \u2013 three of whom serve on the House rules committee \u2013 and the need for Democratic votes in order to get a bill ultimately signed into law, Playbook writes. It continues: In the past, House leaders typically have told the hard right to pound sand, knowing they weren\u2019t going to vote for the final bill anyway. But after pissing off conservatives during the debt limit standoff, McCarthy looks poised to make a different calculation this time. Facing heavy criticism from the House Freedom Caucus and other conservatives, McCarthy is under pressure to give on a number of high-profile issues touching defense policy, Punchbowl News writes. It says: Every \u2018culture war\u2019 provision from the Freedom Caucus that\u2019s added to the base legislation will cost Democratic votes. It will also make GOP moderates unhappy. The House rules committee is scheduled to mark up the FY2024 defense authorization bill, the annual bill setting Pentagon priorities and policies, today. The bill, which is expected to hit the floor later this week, has been signed into law 60 years straight. But this year, Speaker Kevin McCarthy and GOP leaders are confronting a legislative landmine as the far-right House Freedom Caucus push for dozens of proposed changes to the legislation. Adam Smith, the head Democrat on the House armed services committee, said he was worried about a flurry of \u201cextreme right-wing amendments\u201d attached to the bill and that he wasn\u2019t \u201cremotely\u201d confident the bill will pass this week. Smith told the Washington Post he was concerned about GOP measures on \u201cabortion, guns, the border, and social policy and equity issues\u201d. Without the controversial amendments, Smith predicted that well over 300 House members would vote for the bill. With them, \u201cyou lose most, if not all, Democrats,\u201d he told Politico\u2019s Playbook. Iowa\u2019s state legislature is holding a special session on Tuesday as it plans to vote on a bill that would ban most abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy, when most people don\u2019t yet know they are pregnant. The state is the latest in the country to vote on legislation restricting reproductive rights after the overturning of Roe v Wade last year, which ended the nationwide constitutional right to abortion. Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, called for the special session last week, vowing to \u201ccontinue to fight against the inhumanity of abortion\u201d and calling the \u201cpro-life\u201d movement against reproductive rights \u201cthe most important human rights cause of our time\u201d. Lawmakers in the GOP-controlled legislature will debate House Study Bill 255, which was released on Friday and seeks to prohibit abortions at the first sign of cardiac activity except in certain cases such as rape or incest. Iowa\u2019s house, senate and governor\u2019s office are all Republican-controlled, and the bill faces few hurdles from being passed. Read the full story here. The first hearing before US District Judge Aileen Cannon in the federal criminal case against Donald Trump will be on 18 July, according to a court order. Trump was charged with retention of national defense information, including US nuclear secrets and plans for US retaliation in the event of an attack, which means his case will be tried under the rules laid out in the Classified Information Procedures Act, or Cipa. Cipa provides a mechanism for the government to charge cases involving classified documents without risking the \u201cgraymail\u201d problem, where the defense threatens to reveal classified information at trial, but the steps that have to be followed mean it takes longer to get to trial. The process includes the government turning over all of the classified information they want to use to the defense in discovery, like any other criminal case, in addition to the non-classified discovery that is done in a separate process. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued the amount of discovery \u2013 the government is making the material available in batches because there is so much evidence and it has not finished processing everything that came from search warrants \u2013 meant that they could not know how long the process would take. Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote: From a practical manner, the volume of discovery and the Cipa logistics alone make plain that the government\u2019s requested schedule is unrealistic. Donald Trump asked the federal judge overseeing the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case to indefinitely postpone setting a trial date in court filings on Monday and suggested, at a minimum, that any scheduled trial should not take place until after the 2024 presidential election. The papers submitted by Trump\u2019s lawyers in response to the US justice department\u2019s motion to hold the trial this December made clear the former president\u2019s aim to delay proceedings as their guiding strategy \u2013 the case may be dropped if Trump wins the election. The filing said: The court should, respectfully, before establishing any trial date, allow time for development of further clarity as to the full nature and scope of the motions that will be filed. Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis launched the investigation in early 2021, after Donald Trump tried to overturn his election defeat in Georgia by calling Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, and suggesting the state\u2019s top elections official could help him \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d, just enough needed to beat Joe Biden. The investigation expanded to include an examination of a slate of Republican fake electors, phone calls by Trump and others to Georgia officials in the weeks after the 2020 election and unfounded allegations of widespread election fraud made to state lawmakers, according to AP. About a year into her investigation, Willis asked for a special grand jury. At the time, she said she needed the panel\u2019s subpoena power to compel testimony from witnesses who had refused to cooperate without a subpoena. In a January 2022 letter to Fulton county superior court chief judge, Christopher Brasher, Willis wrote that Raffensperger, who she called an \u201cessential witness\u201d, had \u201cindicated that he will not participate in an interview or otherwise offer evidence until he is presented with a subpoena by my office\u201d. That special grand jury was seated in May 2022, and released in January after completing its work. The panel issued subpoenas and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, ranging from some of Trump\u2019s most prominent allies to local election workers, before drafting a final report with recommendations for Willis. Portions of that report that were released in February said jurors believed that \u201cone or more witnesses\u201d committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges. The panel\u2019s foreperson said in media interviews later that they recommended indicting numerous people, but she declined to name names. Here\u2019s a bit more on the grand jury being seated today in Atlanta, Georgia, that will probably consider charges against Donald Trump and his Republican allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The new grand jury term begins today in Fulton county, and two panels will be selected at the downtown Atlanta courthouse, each made up of 16 to 23 people and up to three alternates. One of these panels is expected to handle the Trump investigation. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney will preside over today\u2019s court proceedings, CNN reported. McBurney oversaw the special grand jury that previously collected evidence in the Trump investigation, and he is also expected to oversee the grand jury tasked with making charging decisions in the case. Good morning, US politics blog readers. A grand jury being seated today in Atlanta is expected to consider charges against former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis launched the investigation in early 2021, shortly after Trump tried to overturn his loss by calling Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and suggested the state\u2019s top elections official could help him \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d. A special grand jury previously issued subpoenas and heard testimony from about 75 witnesses, which included Trump advisers, his former attorneys, White House aides, and Georgia officials. That panel drafted a final report with recommendations for Willis. The new grand jury term begins today in Fulton county, which includes most of Atlanta and some suburbs. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney will swear-in two grand juries, one of which is expected to hear evidence in the Georgia elections case. Willis, an elected Democrat, is expected to present her case before one of two new grand juries being seated. The panel won\u2019t be deciding guilt, only if Willis has enough evidence to move her case forward and who should face indictment. Willis has previously indicated that final decisions could come next month. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching today: Joe Biden is meeting with other Nato leaders in Vilnius, Lithuania, where Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine will top the agenda. The House rules committee is scheduled to mark up the FY2024 defense authorization bill today. The legislation is set to hit the floor later this week, with final passage currently envisioned for Friday. The House will meet at noon and at 2pm will take up multiple bills, with last votes expected at 6.30pm The Senate will meet at 10am and vote on several nominations throughout the day. There will be classified all-senators briefing with defense and intelligence officials on how AI is used for national security purposes."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f4a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/everyone-loved-angel-spanish-town-still-grieving-for-hero-who-fought-wildfires", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Everyone loved \u00c1ngel\u2019: Spanish town still grieving for hero who fought wildfires", "lead": "As fresh heatwave hits Spain, T\u00e1bara residents remember heroics of man who lost his life in blaze last year", "author": "Sam Jones in T\u00e1bara", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 15:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951708", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a86681e9cc0488e0a068bebda8132980f7939b4d/0_232_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The smoke-grey skies over T\u00e1bara were turning furnace orange as \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn forced down the ham sandwich that had been pressed on him by his friends at the petrol station and ran to his excavator. By mid-afternoon on Monday 18 July last year, the 53-year-old builder\u2019s yard owner had been watching the wildfires in the Sierra de la Culebra in north-west Spain creep closer to his town for eight hours, waiting to see whether his trucks and diggers could help fight the blaze. A little before 3pm, the flames arrived on the edge of T\u00e1bara and Mart\u00edn made the quick, selfless decision that would lead to his death three months later. His actions, captured on a video that went around the world, would yield some of the starkest and most disturbing images of the scorching and deadly European summer of 2022, the hottest on record. Minutes after climbing into his excavator to try to dig a firebreak to halt the blaze, Mart\u00edn and his vehicle were swallowed by the flames and the drifts of thick, black smoke. A few agonising seconds later, the video showed him somehow managing to stumble and run out of the inferno, his clothes consumed by the flames. He had suffered burns to 80% of his body. Rescuers bundled Mart\u00edn into a car and drove him to a nearby health centre, from where he was taken by helicopter to a hospital in the city of Valladolid. Despite the best efforts of medical staff, however, the man hailed in the press as el h\u00e9roe de T\u00e1bara died from his injuries in the early hours of 25 October 2022. Almost a year after the fires hit \u2013 and following its driest April to date \u2013 a drought-struck Spain is bracing for another summer of wildfires and heat-related deaths as the realities of the climate emergency become increasingly inescapable across the Iberian peninsula and beyond. Temperatures this week are forecast to reach 44C (111F) in parts of the country as the second heatwave of the summer bites. In T\u00e1bara, the memories of last July are raw and the trees around the town still charred black. \u201cIt all happened in just 15 minutes,\u201d says Montse Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco, who was working at the petrol station that day. \u201cThe whole town was in pieces. Everyone loved \u00c1ngel. He was such a lovely person and he was always ready to help anyone with whatever they needed. We all hoped he\u2019d make it; you never lose hope. But he didn\u2019t make it.\u201d As T\u00e1bara\u2019s mayor, Ant\u00f3nio Ju\u00e1rez, puts it, \u201cwhat nobody wanted to happen happened. We all know each other in this town and \u00c1ngel was a guy who was always ready to help other people and pitch in. What he did to try to save the town is proof of all that.\u201d Ju\u00e1rez, a forestry engineer and volunteer firefighter, says the causes of the wildfires are not hard to fathom. He refers to T\u00e1bara and the surrounding areas as \u201cthe ground zero\u201d of what has come to be known as la Espa\u00f1a vaciada \u2013 the hollowed-out Spain. A few decades ago, there were almost 2,000 people in T\u00e1bara; today it has just 770 inhabitants, most of them older people. The draw of the big cities has led to depopulation, which, in turn, has led to profound changes in the surrounding landscape. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing more and more is the loss of the ties that bind people to the land,\u201d says the mayor. \u201cNew sources of energy, together with depopulation, mean that people scarcely use the forests: there\u2019s no longer a firewood season or people making charcoal. That means the forests are becoming exponentially overgrown. \u201cIn places where there were once a few oak trees, there are now oak forests. Places where there were once pastures are now scrublands. There\u2019s less livestock and there are now no goats here that used to live off the land.\u201d All of which means that there is far more vegetation to burn. Add to all that an extremely dry year, strong winds and a lack of fire-fighting equipment, \u201cand you get what we endured last year. It was, in the widest sense of the phrase, a perfect storm\u201d. Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s summary tallies with the findings of a new report from Greenpeace that warns the effects of the climate emergency in Spain will be as far-reaching as they will be devastating. \u201cProjections indicate that if Spain does not cut severely the emissions that cause global warming, the country will become hotter, drier, more arid and flammable,\u201d says Maria Jos\u00e9 Caballero of Greenpeace Spain. \u201cIt will experience more floods and high-intensity fires and the impacts of sea level rise.\u201d According to EU figures, the 2022 wildfire season was the second worst on record, with blazes devouring 1,624,381 hectares \u2013 an area of land roughly equivalent to Montenegro. In Spain alone, wildfires burned through 315,705 hectares. Jofre Carnicer, a professor of ecology at the University of Barcelona and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says the wildfires already seen in Spain, Australia and Canada are a taste of things to come. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to increase our capacity when it comes to prevention but we\u2019re also going to find that there are limits when it comes to adaptation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing some kinds of fires whose virulence and simultaneous natures require tools that human society doesn\u2019t always have.\u201d While investing in rural areas and forest management is key, Carnicer says the best way to mitigate the effects of the climate emergency is by reducing emissions. \u201cThe scientific consensus is that the best stabilisation strategy is a drastic reduction in emissions in the next 10-20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be easy, but the more we do, the braver and the more drastic the action we take, and the better the public and private financing is, the better the scenario will be.\u201d Spain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribera \u2013 who has already pointed out that \u201call the money in the world\u201d won\u2019t fix the damage done by a failure to reduce emissions \u2013 also believes that last year\u2019s events in the Sierra de la Culebra will become more and more common. \u201cIn places where the climate is in transition \u2013 such as the Iberian peninsula \u2013 big fires are probably one of the most real, frequent, important, damaging and painful threats that climate change brings,\u201d she says. Although Spain\u2019s 17 regional governments are responsible for responding to wildfires in their own territories, the central government has 60 aircraft, 200 specialist firefighters and a military emergencies unit that can be deployed to supplement their efforts. As well as working to improve preparation, enhance civil protection measures and professionalising and increasing human resources, Spain has also deployed some of those specialist firefighters to help tackle recent blazes in Chile and Canada. \u201cWe don\u2019t just need to cooperate when it comes to sharing experience with other neighbouring countries \u2013 it\u2019s also important that we strengthen our rapid response capacity for when it\u2019s needed in different countries that we might not immediately think of as those most affected by these risks but which, as time goes by and the accumulated effects of climate change pile up, will also find themselves vulnerable to this kind of phenomenon,\u201d says the minister. In T\u00e1bara, where the sky is now blue and the summer air hot and dusty, the mayor says the best way to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s tragedy would be to reintroduce livestock grazing to keep the land clear. More fire-fighting equipment, water points, lookouts and planning would also help. \u201cThe authorities haven\u2019t known how to adapt to these circumstances,\u201d says J\u00faarez. \u201cThey haven\u2019t tackled the demographic problems and they haven\u2019t known how to manage the forests. And they haven\u2019t been able to foresee just how virulent these fires can be or provide the necessary means of fighting them.\u201d The people of T\u00e1bara, he adds, are still grieving. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do or what to say. This wasn\u2019t a dream you can wake up from. It was reality and there\u2019s now a sadness here in people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201d Back at the petrol station, Montse Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco sells cold cans to her thirsty customers and thinks, as she often does, about her friend \u00c1ngel. \u201cWe still talk about him a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I remember his jokes and what a good, happy person he was. The thing is he would have done it again because that\u2019s what he was like.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f4b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/its-party-time-jair-bolsonaro-opens-themed-online-store", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s party time\u2019: Jair Bolsonaro opens themed online store", "lead": "Products include \u2018party kits\u2019 with hats, cake decorations and banners bearing Brazilian ex-president\u2019s face", "author": "Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 14:49:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951732", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2414b9afdb1c1971a7760656e2f5096f0410a662/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "Some politicians go on lucrative speaking tours when their days in power are done. Others start foundations, distill whiskey, raise cattle or buy luxury sheds. Jair Bolsonaro has chosen a different path and opened a shop where, for the price of a hardback, you can order a Bolsonaro-themed birthday pack complete with party hats, cake decorations and a plastic banner carrying a festive message from Brazil\u2019s former president. \u201cIt\u2019s party time, alright?\u201d reads the poster\u2019s slogan, below a portrait of the grinning populist. The far-right \u201cparty kit\u201d costs 149.99 reais, or just under \u00a324. The party paraphernalia is the latest offering from the online Bolsonaro store, which opened in February, one month after his followers ran riot through Brazil\u2019s capital to protest at his defeat in last year\u2019s election. \u201cIf there\u2019s a birthday party theme cooler than this, I\u2019m not aware of it,\u201d read a post on the shop\u2019s Instagram account accompanying a photograph of Bolsonaro\u2019s politician son, Eduardo, sporting a conical hat featuring an image of his father. Critics of Brazil\u2019s former leader have derided the internet emporium as a wretched and melancholy coda to a political career they hope is finally over, after Bolsonaro was banned from seeking office last month for peddling \u201cappalling lies\u201d during the acrimonious 2022 election. Writing in the newspaper O Globo on Tuesday, one conservative columnist asked readers: \u201cIs Bolsonaro really [politically] dead?\u201d The pundit in question, Merval Pereira, admitted that writing off any politician was foolish: \u201cThey say even rock bottom contains a trampoline. \u201cRight now, however, the ex-president \u2026 looks like he\u2019s heading inevitably towards the end of his career,\u201d Pereira concluded, predicting his subject would end up leading a small, radical faction on the Brazilian far-right. Members of that faction this week voiced delight at their leader\u2019s transition from party politics to party hats. \u201cMy birthday\u2019s only in February but I want to reserve mine now,\u201d wrote one enthusiast from rural S\u00e3o Paulo, a stronghold of Bolsonaro support. Other Bolsonaristas celebrated the \u201cpatriotic decorations\u201d as a way of scaring off unwelcome partygoers belonging to Brazil\u2019s tofu-eating wokerati. \u201cThe perfect repellent for infiltrated lefties,\u201d wrote one. Party hats are not the only merch on offer at the former president\u2019s store, where products can be paid for in up to 12 instalments. There are notebooks (\u00a39.30), beer mugs (\u00a311), key rings (\u00a33.95) and stickers (\u00a31.50) carrying Bolsonaro\u2019s catchphrase: \u201cBrazil above everything! God above all!\u201d And there is a 14-page calendar remembering some of the \u201cmost important achievements\u201d of Bolsonaro\u2019s turbulent 2018-2023 presidency, when more than 700,000 Brazilians died of Covid, Amazon deforestation soared, and Brazil became a pariah in the world. The calendar\u2019s price was recently slashed from \u00a39.50 to \u00a37.90. \u201cOur dream is more alive than ever!\u201d reads the motto on its cover, although many Brazilians are not so sure."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f4c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/11/football-daily-volcano-pitch-mexico", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "And we thought Stoke was the most inhospitable place to play football", "lead": "<strong>In today\u2019s Football Daily:</strong> Football on top of a volcano.

Wimbledon and the Tour de France are on for goodness\u2019 sake! And we have nothing funny to say about Ashley Young. He\u2019s just growing old gracefully and hopefully Everton won\u2019t ruin that. Oh. So we\u2019re trying something a bit different this Tuesday. The reason is that we stumbled across some photographs which we couldn\u2019t stop looking at. And while our editor might be wary of where this is going, we want to share them with you, because they\u2019re truly fascinating. You see, on the outskirts of Mexico City locals regularly travel up an 11km trail that takes them 2.7km above the nearby metropolis. Once they have given their legs a good workout \u2013 or got a lift up if they\u2019re not masochists \u2013 they ramble through a thick forest and emerge in the crater of the Teoca volcano. But they\u2019re not there to take selfies and look at the wildlife. No. They\u2019re going to play football. Here\u2019s the pitch: And there we were thinking Stoke was the most inhospitable away fixture in world football. Thankfully, the Teoca volcano is about as inactive as this email\u2019s long forgotten weird uncle, so seismic rumbles don\u2019t dislodge the ball on set-pieces or cause the hardy footballers to stagger around like extras in a low-budget 1970s disaster movie. In fact, despite the pitch looking patchier than the one at Stamford Bridge in 2003, the players score some decent goals. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d wheezed the 47-year-old goalkeeper Daniel Mancilla Pena. \u201cIt\u2019s very impressive to come all the way up here to the pitch and to have a very nice setting to play football.\u201d Though at that altitude we\u2019re guessing playing in goal is more fun than running around in the baking heat and thin air for 90 minutes. There is even a team called Liverpool and, yes, they play in red. If they had any fans we\u2019d like to think they too would sing the tune to Ring of Fire, which is the name given to the part of Mexico where they play football, due to it being the world\u2019s most seismically and volcanically active. Yes, Football Daily does geographical facts these days. The area used to be an old ceremonial ground and was transformed into a football pitch in the early-1950s. \u201c[It] must be about 70 years old,\u201d blabbed their league\u2019s chief suit, Joel Becerril. \u201cThey used to carry me up here when I was a child.\u201d We\u2019re not sure if there are any lingering curses that would require the Barry Fry method to lift them but, judging by the pictures, the teams just look happy to have a pitch to play on. Unlike in the UK, we\u2019re guessing property developers won\u2019t be building flats and a supermarket on it anytime soon. So there we have it \u2013 it\u2019s not just Tour de France riders who celebrate on top of volcanoes. A tip of the hat from Football Daily to the amateurs near Mexico City who light up the local leagues 3km up in the air. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt was a little hard to take just because of how much it was oversized and how many people started talking about it. For me, I wasn\u2019t overweight, but obviously the manager has seen it in a very different way. I just took it and did my best to get as fit as possible\u201d\u2013 Kalvin Phillips there, setting the record straight on the weighty issue of whether or not he was carrying too much timber when he joined the club last summer. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Regarding Mark Randall (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day), the precedent for appearing in said Big Cup is obviously winning the requisite league. After 134 years of existence, with no major trophies to Larne\u2019s name before that maiden title, the joyous and surreal nature of that occasion still hasn\u2019t sunk in fully even though the first preliminary round is imminent. So Mark\u2019s love of the people of Larne is reciprocated and then some. On a (somewhat) related note, as Arsenal are back in Big Cup, does the winner of their inevitable first knockout tie with PSG finally sort out the Round of \u2026 conundrum?

Stanislav Rzhitsky, 42, was killed on Monday by an unidentified gunman during a morning run in a park near the Olimp sports centre, local police said. Russian law enforcement said a murder investigation had been launched after Rzhitsky\u2019s body was discovered with several gunshot wounds. It was not immediately clear who was behind the killing and no suspects were named by Russia. At the time of his death, Rzhitsky was serving as the deputy head of the Krasnodar city administration\u2019s mobilisation. According to the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant, Rzhitsky was previously the commander of the Krasnodar submarine, named after the city, in the Russian navy. The Ukrainian army said in a Telegram post on Tuesday that Rzhitsky was in command of a submarine that carried out a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia in July 2022, which killed 23 civilians. Rzhitsky\u2019s father told the Baza, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, that his son left the military in December 2021, before Russia invaded Ukraine. Several close friends of Rzhitsky similarly told the independent Russian station Dozdh that Rzhitsky left the army before the war started. Baza further reported that the killer could have tracked Rzhitsky\u2019s runs on the Strava app, as he regularly followed the same 4-mile route while running. The Ukrainian defence ministry\u2019s main directorate of intelligence, GUR, did not claim responsibility for Rzhitsky\u2019s death. But in a cryptic message, GUR shared a series of details about the killing, including the time of the attack (6am) and the lack of witnesses because of rain. \u201cDue to heavy rain, the park was deserted, so there were no witnesses who could provide details or identify the attacker,\u201d the GUR said. In a later statement, the agency\u2019s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, rejected the claim that Ukrainian intelligence was behind the killing. \u201cStatements by some media and politicians that the GUR has something to do with the death of Stanislav Rzhitsky have no basis,\u201d Budanov said. Ukraine typically declines to claim responsibility for attacks on Russia or Russian-annexed Crimea, though Kyiv officials have frequently celebrated such attacks with cryptic or mocking remarks.

Nests recovered from trees in Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Antwerp in Belgium were found to be constructed almost entirely from strips of long metal spikes that are often attached to buildings to deter birds from setting up home on the structures. The discovery prompted researchers at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam and the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden to scour the internet for further examples, leading to the identification of two more anti-bird spike nests: one in Enschede in the Netherlands and another in Glasgow. \u201cI really thought I\u2019d seen it all,\u201d said Kees Moeliker, the director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam, who studied the crow\u2019s nest found during tree maintenance near the city\u2019s main railway station. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this. These anti-bird spikes are meant to deter birds, they are supposed to scare them off, but on the contrary, the birds just utilise them.\u201d While the Rotterdam nest was made by crows, the other three were built by magpies, which construct large dome-like nests. The crows used the anti-bird spikes as a sturdy construction material, but the magpies may have appreciated their intended use: they placed most of the spikes on the nest\u2019s roof where they could deter predators, including other birds and weasels. Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, said: \u201cEven for me as a nest researcher, these are the craziest bird nests I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d It is not the first time birds have been found to incorporate urban materials into their nests. In 1933, a South African museum reported a crow\u2019s nest fashioned from hard-drawn copper, galvanised iron and barbed wire. Nails, screws and even drug users\u2019 syringes have all found their way into birds\u2019 nests. About 25 years ago, Moeliker collected a pigeon\u2019s nest from an oil refinery in Rotterdam harbour, a place he described as having \u201cnothing green, only industry, concrete and bad air\u201d. The nest was made not from twigs but chicken wire. As an example of birds\u2019 ability to adapt to the urban environment, he considered it the ultimate. \u201cIt turns out that it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, in view of the latest crow and magpie nests. They are described in Deinsea, the annual of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam. Rather than finding old strips of anti-bird spikes at rubbish dumps, Moeliker, who previously won an Ig Nobel prize for documenting the first known case of homosexual necrophilia among ducks, says crows and magpies appear to be finding and removing the metal strips from buildings. \u201cThey are ripping the stuff off. It\u2019s been observed in several kinds of birds,\u201d he said. On Monday, a European team of researchers warned that nearly 200 bird species build nests with potentially dangerous human litter ranging from cigarette butts to plastic bags and fishing nets. Dr Jim Reynolds, an ornithologist at the University of Birmingham, who took part in that work said he was \u201camazed\u201d at the anti-bird spike nests, but added that if any group of birds was going to do it, it would be the corvids, who are known for their cognitive skills. \u201cI was really struck by the irony, to take anti-bird devices and use them to their own ends,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThey are even more amazing than I think they are.\u201d As well as helping to protect the nests, the spikes may also serve as a display to impress potential mates, he said. Anti-bird spikes are not only attached to building ledges to deter birds from nesting. In 2017, residents in the leafy Clifton neighbourhood of Bristol fixed bird-repelling spikes to trees to stop pigeons perching on the branches and creating a mess on parked cars below. \u201cWe should not deter birds, we should embrace birds and live together with them,\u201d said Moeliker. \u201cThese birds are very smart and they always find ways to cope with the harsh urban life. I\u2019m very sympathetic towards these crows and magpies. They are my heroes.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f4f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/paris-charge-suv-drivers-higher-parking-fees-tackle-auto-besity", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Paris to charge SUV drivers higher parking fees to tackle \u2018auto-besity\u2019", "lead": "Size, weight and motor will be taken into account as councillors target \u2018dangerous, cumbersome\u2019 vehicles", "author": "Kim Willsher in Paris", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 14:32:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951814", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/af4b55a2fabe50fffc6246cf77e4e0eccd9b9744/1308_844_4304_2582/500.jpg", "body": "Paris city hall is to impose higher parking fees on owners of SUVs in its battle to reduce pollution in the capital. Details of the charges have not been announced but the size, weight of the vehicle and its motor will be taken into consideration. Electric vehicles and those with large families requiring a bigger car are expected to escape the increased fees that will come into effect on 1 January 2024. Paris councillors approved the measure in an unanimous vote last month. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Badina-Serpette, a councillor from the EELV ecology party that proposed the increased charges, said: \u201cWe would like the city of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles.\u201d He said the aim was \u201cto focus on an absurdity: auto-besity \u2026 the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities, and particularly in Paris\u201d. Officials say the number of SUVs in the city has increased by 60% over the last four years and they now make up 15% of the 1.15m private vehicles parked in Paris every evening. They hope raising fees will put a brake on the increase and encourage the ownership of lighter vehicles. \u201cFrom 1 January 2024, SUV owners can expect to pay higher fees to park in the French capital,\u201d the council said in a statement. David Belliard, a deputy mayor responsible for public space and mobility policy, said SUVs were incongruous in an urban environment. \u201cThere are no dirt paths , no mountain roads \u2026 SUVs are absolutely useless in Paris. Worse, they are dangerous, cumbersome and use too many resources to manufacture,\u201d Belliard said. However, Pierre Chasseray, a spokesperson for the driver defence group 40 millions d\u2019Automobilistes, said the number of SUVs had risen because larger families were buying them to replace their people carriers. \u201cThey are family vehicles \u2026 used for going away at weekends or on holiday. We\u2019re pandering to a tiny minority of the very urban population who have decided to make the SUV the symbol of the battle against pollution,\u201d Chasseray told Le Parisien. In Lyon, the authorities have also announced higher parking charges based on vehicle weight from next year.

Elon Musk, a very stable tech genius, is throwing a temper tantrum over Mark Zuckerberg launching the Twitter rival Threads. You would think a capitalist such as Musk would welcome a little healthy competition, but he doesn\u2019t seem keen to compete in the business arena. Instead, he has challenged Zuckerberg to a \u201cliteral dick-measuring contest\u201d. Musk, who is 52 years old, prefaced that invitation by tweeting: \u201cZuck is a cuck.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether he had professional help crafting this zinger or if it came to him in a flash of brilliance. How is Twitter\u2019s new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, enjoying all this, I wonder? She probably thought she would be stewarding a struggling tech company\u2019s return to greatness; instead, she is managing a manbaby\u2019s outbursts. She probably expected she would be leading complex strategy meetings; instead, one imagines, she is being briefed by her underlings about what a cuck is. Perhaps Yaccarino already knows exactly what a cuck is. It hasn\u2019t escaped notice that the former NBC Universal executive follows a large number of proudly rightwing Twitter accounts including Catturd, whom Rolling Stone once described as \u201cthe shitposting king of Maga Twitter\u201d. If you spend any time in the haunts of the online right, you are bound to hear a lot of cucking; it is one of the most beloved insults of angry white men. For those of you who lead healthy offline lives and are not familiar with the term, cuck is slang for a feeble man with progressive-ish views (anyone to the left of Mussolini) and stems from the word \u201ccuckold\u201d, meaning a man whose wife is unfaithful. In 2014, during Gamergate, the antiquated insult was revived on rightwing message boards. (It\u2019s hard to explain Gamergate to anyone who isn\u2019t \u201cextremely online\u201d, but, in brief, a female gaming journalist broke up with her boyfriend, sparking a furiously misogynistic movement that significantly influenced the rise of the modern right.) In 2016, the word gained even more traction in a Reddit message board called r/The_Donald. Donald Trump staffers started using it; Steve Bannon, for example, once called Jared Kushner a cuck. From there, it infiltrated the mainstream. Over the years, cuck has become a dangerously amorphous term. While it isn\u2019t inherently a white supremacist word, it has taken on racist and antisemitic connotations. For some people, it\u2019s a reference to racist fetish pornography. It\u2019s also, one linguist has argued, a coded way to talk about antisemitic \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theories. Meanwhile, for others, it\u2019s just a silly word to be used in jest. \u201cWhile it might have once been possible to distinguish out-and-out white supremacists from [so-called] ironic Nazis, now the different groups were learning the same language,\u201d noted Tim Squirrell, an expert in extremism, in a 2017 article about the evolution of cuck. Say what you will about the far right; they are cunning linguists, alarmingly adept at packaging hateful concepts into silly terms that can be defended as \u201cjust a joke\u201d. \u201cIncels\u201d, for example, routinely talk about women as \u201cfemoids\u201d, a contraction of \u201cfemale humanoid\u201d used to signal that these men don\u2019t consider women to be fully human. Memes also do a lot of heavy lifting: Pepe the frog, a beady-eyed cartoon amphibian, has been co-opted as an \u201calt-right\u201d hate mascot. It\u2019s not just me saying the far right are strategic about how they sanitise hateful language; they have admitted it themselves. In 2017, for example, the style guide for the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer was leaked. \u201cGenerally, when using racial slurs, it should come across as half-joking,\u201d it instructed. \u201cMost people are not comfortable with material that comes across as vitriolic, raging, nonironic hatred. The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not.\u201d So, was Musk joking when he called Zuck a cuck? Or was it something more sinister? I can\u2019t say for certain. But the fact that one of the world\u2019s richest and most influential men is proudly using far-right terms?

The proportion of 10- and 11-year-old pupils meeting the government\u2019s expected standard in reading, writing and maths combined remained at 59%, exactly the same as in the 2022 results, which was down from 65% in 2019, prior to the pandemic. Ministers will be particularly concerned about a drop in reading attainment. According to official government statistics published on Tuesday, 73% of the cohort achieved the expected standard, down from 75% last year. It comes after ministers celebrated England\u2019s success in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls) earlier this year, when children from English schools moved up to fourth place in the global literacy league table. This year\u2019s Sats reading paper, which children sat in May, triggered complaints from parents and teachers who said it was so hard it reduced some children to tears. The Standards and Testing Agency later ruled it was at the appropriate level of difficulty. The latest key stage 2 results will raise concerns about the efficacy of the government\u2019s education recovery plans and the enduring impact of the pandemic on children\u2019s learning. This year\u2019s Sats cohort were particularly disrupted at the end of year 3 and in year 4. There were small improvements in results for some subjects. In maths, 73% of pupils met the expected standard, up from 71% in 2022. In writing it was 71%, up from 69%, and in science 80% met the expected standard, a small improvement from 79%. Attainment in grammar, punctuation and spelling remained unchanged at 72%. Nevertheless, this year\u2019s results still fall far short of the government\u2019s stated target of 90% of pupils meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths at key stage 2 by 2030, described by one commentator as \u201ca pipe dream\u201d. Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cThese results confirm the point made by teachers and researchers: primary schools are still deeply affected by the pandemic and Sats worsen this already difficult situation. \u201cFunding is inadequate. Class sizes are growing. The jobs of support staff have been cut. The national tutoring programme has not enabled a rise in the overall profile of results. There is no substantial programme to support educational recovery.\u201d Tiffnie Harris, a primary specialist with the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cSchools are straining every sinew to improve results and we appeal to the government to support them by urgently addressing the national crisis caused by teacher shortages and inadequate funding. It is extremely difficult to raise standards when schools are struggling to put a qualified teacher in front of every class.\u201d Jon Andrews, the head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute, said: \u201cWhile there have been small increases in the percentage of pupils reaching the expected standard in maths and writing, these are still well below pre-pandemic results.\u201d The national curriculum assessments \u2013 also known as Sats \u2013 are taken by state school pupils in year 6, at the end of primary school. The school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: \u201cWe know that pupils have had their education disrupted due to the pandemic, which is why, following on from our success in the Progress International Reading Literacy Study, it is encouraging to see attainment levels improving in some key subjects.\u201d The shadow schools minister, Stephen Morgan, said: \u201cWhen he was chancellor, Rishi Sunak said that the country had \u2018maxed out\u2019 on Covid recovery and the results are now plain to see. Children\u2019s education is paying the price of the failure of the national tutoring programme and the neglect of the Conservative government.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f52", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/its-amazing-to-see-notre-dame-cathedrals-new-roof-arrives-by-barge", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s amazing to see\u2019: trusses for Notre Dame\u2019s new roof arrive by barge", "lead": "Four years on from fire that devastated Paris landmark, oak trusses weighing seven tonnes each are winched into place", "author": "Kim Willsher in Paris", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 14:20:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951871", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aac2357bcddc210059c3eff46db6e0527ec74a36/0_365_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "In April 2019, the world watched as Notre Dame Cathedral burned and flames fuelled by the ribbed roof \u2013 made of hundreds of oak beams, some dating from the 13th century \u2013 roared into the sky. Four years on, the cathedral in Paris is rising from the ashes. On Tuesday, the trusses for what will be a new roof constructed from old oaks made their way along the Seine in two big barges. The river was closed to other traffic for the operation. There were \u201coohs\u201d from the crowds of tourists as the first of six wooden triangles weighing seven tonnes each were lifted slowly by crane into the azure and cloudless sky to the cathedral roof. The pieces will be fitted together like a giant puzzle within the next two months. The reconstruction of the wooden structure, historically known as la for\u00eat (the forest) because of its size and density, marks a symbolic step in the rebirth of the cathedral, one of Paris\u2019s emblematic landmarks. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see. What a fabulous building, even covered in scaffold,\u201d said Jake, who was on holiday with his family. The for\u00eat formed the cross-shaped roof that ran the length of the nave and transept above stone vaults. A total of 25 triangular structures 10 metres high and 14 metres across the base make up part of the cathedral\u2019s charpente \u2013 its essential framework, created from ancient oaks that have been hand-cut to size and shape using the kind of forged axes employed by medieval carpenters. The 96-metre-high spire, added in 1859 by the architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, is also being reconstructed as it was, allaying fears of what the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had called a \u201ccontemporary gesture\u201d being incorporated, along with other far-fetched schemes to turn the roof into a park or swimming pool. After the conflagration, officials said the cathedral, Unesco-listed as a world treasure and immortalised in Victor Hugo\u2019s novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, had been within 15-30 minutes of complete destruction. Firefighters battled for 15 hours to stop the flames reaching the wooden frame of the gothic towers on the west facade. Had it burned, there were real fears it would have brought the bells, the largest of which rang at the crowning of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and weighs 13 tonnes, crashing down, bringing the towers with them. A large swathe of central Paris was contaminated with lead dust from the building\u2019s destroyed roof. In the hours after the fire, Macron pledged that the 850-year-old cathedral would be rebuilt by 2024. To ensure this, he put a retired military officer, Gen Jean-Louis Georgelin, a former chief-of-staff to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e under Jacques Chirac, in charge of the project. The cause of the blaze is still not known. Tuesday\u2019s operation roused emotion in Parisiens such as Bernadette who watched the cathedral burn four years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s moving to see the first elements of the roof coming together. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s being rebuilt exactly as it was. I really wasn\u2019t sure about Mr Macron\u2019s contemporary gesture,\u201d she said. Jean-Louis Bidet, the technical director of the Perrault at\u00e9lier in Normandy, which has been rebuilding the roof frame, had earlier said the pieces of la for\u00eat had been put together \u201cas if they were in their permanent position at the top of the walls of Notre Dame\u201d in a trial run at the company workshop several weeks ago. \u201cWe assembled them to verify they were as they should be,\u201d Bidet told French television. The area around the cathedral has been completely reimagined by a Belgian landscape architect, Bas Smets, who told the Guardian last year that he aimed to create a more open and pedestrian-friendly space in the 4,500 sq metres around the cathedral.

Here are the key developments from the day so far: The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the allegations were \u201cshocking and concerning\u201d and the government is \u201creassured the process (the BBC) are taking is rigorous and will be swift\u201d. The work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, said he would not use parliamentary privilege to identify the BBC presenter at the centre of the scandal in an apparent move to discourage fellow MPs from taking that decision. The press accountability campaign group, Hacked Off, said the Sun newspaper had questions to answer over its handling of the story after it emerged the young person at the heart of the controversy refuted its reporting of the matter. The BBC was asked to pause its investigation into allegations one of its presenters paid a teenager for explicit images \u201cwhile the police scope future work\u201d following a meeting with the Metropolitan police, the corporation has said. The BBC published an updated timeline of events that revealed the corporation attempted to contact the complainant \u2013 reportedly the young person\u2019s mother and stepfather \u2013 twice but received no response. Tim Davie, the director general, said he had not spoken to the presenter involved as he revealed the allegations were initially considered to be \u201cvery serious\u201d but not criminal when the corporation was first approached in May. Authorities should be \u201cgiven time\u201d to investigate the allegations surrounding a BBC presenter, Downing Street has said. Pressed on the potential use of parliamentary privilege by MPs to name the suspended star, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson told reporters: Obviously we support freedom of speech, but this is a sensitive issue which is being looked at carefully, and the relevant authorities need to be given the appropriate time to carry out that work. Asked about the Tory deputy chair, Lee Anderson, calling the BBC a \u201csafe haven for perverts\u201d, the spokesperson said: Obviously the BBC is a vital institution, much cherished by the British public and continues to do vital important work. And that\u2019s why, as ministers have made clear, it\u2019s important that they establish the facts and act appropriately in this case. The spokesperson denied Sunak was trying to avoid finding out who the suspended BBC presenter is, in order to evade questions. When this was put to the spokesperson, he told reporters: I wouldn\u2019t characterise it like that. I mean, the prime minister is at the Nato summit and yesterday had the president of the United States here, so obviously his time is taken up with those issues. It\u2019s for the BBC and others to look into this one. The Metropolitan police have issued an updated statement on their involvement with the allegations levelled at the BBC presenter. It said: We have asked the BBC to pause its own investigation while we continue our assessment to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed. The assessment is being led by detectives from the Met\u2019s specialist crime command and follows a virtual meeting with representatives from the BBC on the morning of Monday, 10 July. There remains no police investigation at this time. The Metropolitan police have asked the BBC to pause its inquiries into a suspended male presenter, while specialist officers decide if there is any justification for a criminal investigation, Jim Waterson reports. The BBC director general, Tim Davie, said the Met had taken control of the inquiry, although the police were still at the \u201cscoping\u201d stage of their inquiries and they may decide they was no criminal case to answer. Davie made the announcement as he took questions from journalists at the launch of the BBC\u2019s annual report. The off-camera event was scheduled long before one of the broadcaster\u2019s leading male presenters was suspended following allegations in the Sun he spent \u00a335,000 buying explicit images from a young person. In other developments: The BBC published its own timeline of events leading up to the presenter\u2019s suspension, which claimed a member of the young person\u2019s family initially tried to make a complaint via a physical BBC office in May \u2013 and later failed to return phone calls from BBC investigators. Davie said the initial complaint was \u201cvery serious but not criminal\u201d, unlike the claims put to the BBC by the Sun last week that the young person may have been 17 when contact began. The director general confirmed the presenter was informed of the allegations against him only last week, when the Sun contacted the BBC. The director general said the BBC had a \u201cduty of care\u201d to the suspended presenter, suggested they were providing him with support, and declined to comment on suggestions that blackmail may have been involved. The young person at the heart of the story has said the Sun\u2019s claims of illegal behaviour are \u201crubbish\u201d. The BBC published its annual list of its highest-earning stars. Read the full article here: Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, has praised the corporate investigation team at the BBC, claiming they are \u201coutstanding\u201d, while defending his own actions in \u201ccalmly and judiciously\u201d navigating through what he claimed was a complex situation. In an interview by Sarah Montague on BBC Radio 4, he said \u201ccorporate investigations looked at the log, a summary of the call, of 29 minutes duration. That summary then goes to the corporate investigations team.\u201d He said they judged it to be a serious allegation. On the gap between the initial contact and the presenter being approached over the allegation, he defended the delay, saying it would not be right to put every unverified complaint directly to every presenter immediately without trying to validate it. Asked if only making two attempts to contact the family \u2013 once by email and once by phone \u2013 was an appropriate effort on behalf of the corporation, Davie said he had questions about what could be learned from the whole process. He told Montague one was \u201cDo we raise the red flags quick enough?\u201d, and said \u201cthere may well be some learnings from this case on process and protocol\u201d. In terms of processing the complaint, and whether it should have been done faster, he said: \u201cI understand the timetable and it followed the process. The process was run and we need to take stock.\u201d Earlier today Davie said he had asked Leigh Tavaziva, the BBC group chief operating officer, to assess whether its protocols and procedures were appropriate. He noted that the case had been kept open and not dismissed prior to the Sun going public with its reporting, which has now been questioned by one of the individuals concerned. He said the BBC had needed to get right the \u201cbalance between privacy, duty of care, and a very serious allegation\u201d and that it had \u201cexcellent processes to protect people\u201d. On the overall impact of the incident, he said: \u201cThe BBC is often in the midst of quite painful and difficult affairs and storms, and these are clearly damaging to the BBC. And it\u2019s not a good thing for the BBC.\u201d He said what he cared about as director general was that the BBC newsroom was free to report on the crisis fairly and freely, and that as an organisation it was doing the right thing and \u201cbeing seen to do the right thing\u201d. Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, is being interviewed on BBC Radio 4 right now. We will bring you the key lines. Is blackmail involved? Are there any other complaints against the presenter? Davie said: I shouldn\u2019t be going there. It\u2019s appropriate, with the privacy concerns, to let the investigation be assessed and let the police do their work. It was clearly a serious complaint and the corporate investigations team wanted to take it further. Having said that, based on what they say, they did not believe it included an allegation of criminality. I don\u2019t want to go any further than that in terms of privacy and duty of care concerns. We have a highly experienced corporate investigations team who look at the evidence they\u2019ve got. They are paused and we have not been given a timescale. Have you personally spoken to the presenter? Davie said: I haven\u2019t. Did the presenter offer to resign? Davie said: I wouldn\u2019t comment on a private conversation. What support is being offered? Davie said: Duty of care is a very significant factor in this if you look at the enormity of the coverage. Duty of care in these type of affairs is critical. That goes beyond the people at the centre of the drama but also the people affected by that. I can\u2019t give you specific individuals\u2019 duty of care packages. But the BBC is, I think, excellent at making sure we are offering the right support. It is one of the highest priorities as we move this through this affair. Has the BBC asked to see the presenter\u2019s phone? Davie said: We talked to the presenter but we have not gone beyond that. It is then appropriate to discuss with the police and get some guidance from them. It\u2019s not right for me to comment on the specifics of any police processes or requests at this point. Why didn\u2019t the initial allegation in May get put to the presenter? Davie said: We must balance duty of care with taking any complaint seriously. In the last six months about 250 cases go to that team. I think it\u2019s right they should make contact with the individual who made the initial allegation and get some verification and talk to that person and understand what they\u2019re dealing with before they raise that with an individual. Working through the consequences of going another way is interesting, it would be difficult. It was an open case. It was not closed. When did the director general and other top executives learn about the allegations? Davie said: Myself and the executive committee were made aware on the 6 July and were not told before that. Obviously the BBC gets a number of things coming in to its corporate investigations team. If they are serious in nature they can either put to a serious case team. The corporate investigations team assess what goes into that bucket. Some verification of claims is appropriate. They do some due diligence on what is being alleged. You could be in a situation where anyone could ring anything in and put it to presenters. Unfortunately in this process there was no response which left the case to be left open. We couldn\u2019t get more information, that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t confirmed. Tim Davie took questions from journalists on the presenter cash-for-pictures scandal during his annual report briefing. We\u2019ll bring you the highlights here from my colleague, media editor Jim Waterson. Will the incident damage trust in the BBC? Davie said: Any affair of this nature is serious in terms of the BBC\u2019s reputation. Trust is absolutely fundamental to the BBC. It is too early to say how this impacts the BBC\u2019s reputation in terms of trust. We constantly need to be seen to be navigating complex fast-moving issues confidently and calmly. When did the presenter learn about the allegations against them? Davie said: The presenter was first talked to on the 6 July, the day that the Sun allegations came into the BBC. Before that, there was a process of trying to verify the serious complaint we had into our audiences services team. The process is that we did receive a call on 19 May. That was taken by the audience services team, who then make a summary call for the investigations team. On the basis of the information they had at that point, it did not involve an allegation of criminality but it was nonetheless very serious. But their assessment was it did not include an allegation of criminality. When the Sun made new allegations on the 6 July they were different to the matters being considered by BBC corporate investigations and clearly related to potential criminal activity. At the BBC annual report press briefing, director general Tim Davie made a statement addressing the unfolding situation concerning the allegations against the BBC presenter. He said: This is clearly a complex and difficult situation where we need to manage a number of factors \u2013 properly responding to serious allegations, sensitively managing duty of care issues, appropriately respecting the privacy of individuals and justified public interest. We do believe we are navigating these responsibly and judicially but we recognise it\u2019s not easy to do so. The BBC corporate investigations team had a meeting with the police in relation to the information provided to the BBC by the Sun newspaper on Thursday 6 July, Davie said. He went on: As a result of this the BBC has been asked to pause its own investigation into the allegations while they scope future work. We will pass any material that we have to them. We know that questions have been asked how this case was initially managed and the timeline of events, so today we have published an update that sets out key dates and further detail. The BBC has processes and protocols for receiving information and managing allegations when they are made, We always take these matters seriously and seek to manage them with care. The events of recent days have shown how complex and challenging these kinds of cases can be and how vital it is they are handled with the upmost diligence. That is why it is important that we ensure these processes are robust and working appropriately. Davie said the corporation\u2019s chief operating officer, Leigh Tavaziva, will oversee a review into current protocols and procedures for \u201cred flagging\u201d complaints within the organisation. The BBC has published an update that sets out key dates and some additional information that it is currently able to share: \u2022 On 18 May, the complainant (a family member) attended a BBC building, where they sought to make a complaint about the behaviour of a BBC presenter. \u2022 On 19 May, the complainant contacted BBC Audience Services; the details of this contact were referred to the BBC\u2019s Corporate Investigations Team. \u2022 On 19 May, the BBC\u2019s Corporate Investigations Team assessed the information contained in the complaint provided from Audience Services. The assessment made was that on the basis of the information provided it did not include an allegation of criminality, but nonetheless merited further investigation. \u2022 On 19 May, the BBC\u2019s Corporate Investigations Team emailed the complainant stating how seriously the BBC takes the issue and seeking additional information to verify the claims being made; there was no response to this contact. \u2022 On 19 May, checks were also made to verify the identity of the complainant. This is a standard procedure to confirm that the complainant is the person they say they are. \u2022 On 6 June, having received no response to the email referenced above, a phone call was made to the mobile number provided by the complainant by the BBC\u2019s Corporate Investigations Team; this call did not connect. \u2022 Following these attempts to make contact with the complainant, the Corporate Investigations Team were due to return to the matter in the coming weeks. No additional attempts to contact the complainant were made after 6 June, however the case remained open throughout. \u2022 On 6 July, the Sun newspaper informed the BBC via the Corporate Press Office of allegations concerning a BBC presenter; it became clear that the source of the claims was from the same family as approached the BBC on 18 and 19 May. This was the first time that the director general or any executive directors at the BBC were aware of the case. \u2022 The claims made by the Sun contained new allegations, that were different to the matters being considered by BBC Corporate Investigations. \u2022 On 6 July, the BBC initiated an incident management group to lead the response to this case, involving senior BBC executives including the director general. The acting chairman was updated, and the board was regularly updated in the coming days. \u2022 On 6 July, a senior manager held the first conversation on this matter with the presenter concerned, to make him aware of the claims being outlined by the Sun. It was agreed that the presenter would not be on air while this matter was being considered. \u2022 On 7 July, following the Sun\u2019s contact, the BBC\u2019s Corporate Investigations team contacted the complainant again, who was in touch with the BBC\u2019s investigators. \u2022 On 7 July, the BBC\u2019s Serious Case Management Framework (SCMF) was initiated and the investigation being undertaken by the Corporate Investigations Team was brought into the SCMF, which is chaired by a human resources director. \u2022 On 7 July the BBC also made contact with the police with regard to this matter. \u2022 On 8 July and on 9 July the complainant sent the BBC some materials related to the complaint. \u2022 On 9 July the BBC issued an update to staff and the media; the BBC also confirmed that it had suspended the presenter. \u2022 On 10 July the BBC met with the police, to report the matter and discuss how to progress the investigation. The police have requested that the BBC pause its investigations into the allegations while they scope future work. The BBC has been asked to pause its investigation into allegations one of its presenters paid a teenager for explicit images \u201cwhile the police scope future work\u201d following a meeting with the Metropolitan Police, the corporation has said. The press accountability campaign group, Hacked Off, has waded into the BBC presenter scandal, calling for the Sun to answer questions over its handling of the story. Its comments come in the wake of a statement made by a lawyer representing the young person at the heart of the controversy, that alleged the mother and the newspaper had made false claims. The lawyer said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place between our client and the BBC personality and the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish.\u201d Nathan Sparkes, the chief executive of Hacked Off, said: If the claims of this young person\u2019s lawyer are true, they indicate that the Sun failed to follow even the most basic journalistic standards in pursuit of this story. They must explain what representations they had from the person involved and why, if they did indeed receive objections, they disregarded them. They have used the lives of this young person, and BBC presenter, to further their relentless anti-BBC agenda. Newspapers like the Sun are able to publish these reckless attacks, which do irreparable damage to people\u2019s lives, with impunity because they remain outside of any independent form of regulation. There remains no evidence that Ipso, the Sun\u2019s complaints handler which is controlled by the industry, has lifted a finger to investigate the Sun in relation to their conduct on this story. If the lawyer\u2019s claims are true, then the Sun should issue a direct apology to the BBC for its coverage over the last few days. On Monday, a spokesperson for the Sun said: \u201cWe have reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child. Their complaint was not acted upon by the BBC. We have seen evidence that supports their concerns. It\u2019s now for the BBC to properly investigate.\u201d The young person\u2019s parents on Monday night said they \u201cstand by\u201d the claims. Sources in the Sun newsroom suggested there was growing nervousness about the newspaper\u2019s handling of the story, which has dominated the headlines for several days, led to the suspension of the BBC presenter, and forced multiple on-air stars to publicly deny they have been suspended. The cabinet minister Mel Stride also made comments this morning about the use of parliamentary privilege. The work and pensions secretary said he would not use parliamentary privilege to identify the BBC presenter at the centre of a scandal in an apparent move to discourage fellow MPs from taking that decision. Asked on Sky News if he would use parliamentary privilege \u2013 in effect a form of legal immunity that grants MPs protection in the House of Commons \u2013 to name the presenter involved, as some of his colleagues have suggested they might, Stride said he would not. He said: I can only speak for myself. I would personally certainly not be doing that. That is a privilege that should be used very sparingly and with great thought. Read more here: A bit more from Sunak in Lithuania. The PM declined to comment on reports some MPs could be considering naming the presenter at the heart of the scandal under the protection of parliamentary privilege. He told reporters: We have an existing set of laws that govern free speech and privacy. I think it\u2019s important that the BBC conducts this investigation quickly and rigorously given the concerning and serious nature of the allegations. He said the government \u201cis confident the BBC is investigating this both rigorously and rapidly\u201d and that this is \u201cthe right course of action\u201d. Entirely coincidentally, today is the release of the BBC\u2019s annual report, where the corporation sets out its performance over the last year and publishes enormous amounts of data on its finances, future plans, and how it is performing. It\u2019s also one of the only occasions where the BBC\u2019s top executives \u2013 including director general Tim Davie \u2013 subject themselves to questions from the media. The release of the report was planned long before the BBC was thrown into crisis by anonymous allegations against a senior presenter, which has led to his suspension. Davie and the interim chair, Dame Elan Closs Stephens, who is making her first public appearance in the role, are expected to answer questions and provide an update on the investigation into the presenter. We will be able to report what they said at midday. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said he was alarmed by reports that a BBC presenter may have paid thousands for explicit pictures from a young person \u2013 but said that ministers had been reassured by the corporation that its investigation into the case would be quick. \u201cThey were shocking and concerning allegations,\u201d the prime minister said on his way to the Nato summit. \u201cThe culture secretary spoke to the director general on Sunday and is reassured the process they are taking is rigorous and will be swift. We\u2019ve had those reassurances and that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d It was important for those investigating the situation, such as the BBC and the police, to be allowed to reach a conclusion, he said. The prime minister also added he had not been told by his aides the identity of the presenter, who has been widely named online. The work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, was on duty as the face for the government in media rounds and was asked questions about the scandal at the BBC. The cabinet minister urged people to \u201cresist \u2026 the urge to opine on\u201d the allegations that a BBC presenter paid a teenager for sexually explicit images, and about how the allegations are being dealt with. He told Sky News: Once it\u2019s all over and concluded, I think that is most certainly the time to be looking at whether things were done correctly or not. But at the moment, it seems to me this is a highly fluid, unknown situation and we should give the BBC a bit of space. It\u2019s really important that all of us resist, to the extent that we can, the urge to opine on what was right, or what was outrageous or wrong, until we know all the facts. Asked about the BBC\u2019s handling of the situation, he said: We don\u2019t know enough of the facts to be able to start pointing too many fingers yet at the process. I think we have to wait till this has played out as quickly and effectively as possible, and that\u2019s what the secretary of state (for digital, culture, media and sport) has been pushing for. And then we can start to make those judgments. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of developments in the unfolding scandal at the BBC involving an unnamed presenter who has been accused of paying tens of thousands of pounds for explicit images from a young person. The broadcaster has suspended a male member of staff after the Sun newspaper reported claims from the parents of a young person that the presenter had paid around \u00a335,000 over three years for explicit images. The scandal took another twist on Monday night after a lawyer representing the young person at the centre of the controversy said nothing inappropriate or unlawful happened, calling the reporting \u201crubbish\u201d. The Met police have said at this time there would be no criminal investigation into the allegations. However, the parents of the young person involved, who is said to be 20 now, stand by the account they gave to the Sun. Today will be a busy day for the BBC, a day of enormous pressure, as the corporation publishes its annual report in the midst of the controversy. The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, is expected to talk to the media, which was previously scheduled due to the release of the report, and is likely to bombarded with questions over the corporation\u2019s handling of the controversy."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f54", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/finnish-far-right-finance-minister-riikka-purra-accused-of-racist-online-comments", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Finnish far-right finance minister accused of racist online comments", "lead": "Riikka Purra says she will not resign after being linked to racial slurs and threats of violence made in 2008", "author": "Jon Henley Europe editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 14:01:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951922", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3e03faa20de98fbf14bf69c560880499983a71/829_0_4708_2824/500.jpg", "body": "Finland\u2019s new rightwing government has been plunged into fresh controversy after the discovery of racist and sometimes violent blogpost comments apparently written by the far-right Finns party leader and finance minister, Riikka Purra. Purra, whose nationalist, anti-immigration party finished second in April\u2019s elections and holds nine cabinet posts, has neither confirmed nor denied writing the posts, which date mostly to 2008, and said she had no intention of resigning \u2013 although on Tuesday she issued a broad apology for \u201cstupid social media comments\u201d. The comments, made under the username \u201criikka\u201d on the blog of Purra\u2019s predecessor as Finns party leader, Jussi Halla-aho, included uses of the Finnish equivalent of the N-word, other racial and anti-immigrant slurs, and threats of violence. Last month, another Finns party minister, Vilhelm Junnila, resigned after revelations that he had made jokes about \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d, given a speech at an event attended by neo-Nazis and called for mass abortions in Africa to combat the climate crisis. A third, Mari Rantanen, the interior minister \u2013 who is in charge of Finland\u2019s intelligence services \u2013 has had to deny that she believed in the extremist great replacement theory after it emerged that she had hashtagged it in several tweets. One 2008 \u201criikka\u201d comment talked of \u201c[N-words] selling pirated Vuittons\u201d in Barcelona, which Purra, then a researcher at the University of Turku, was visiting at the time for an academic conference. Another described \u201cthe sound darker males make when they pass you by\u201d as \u201cnot whistling (that would be too obvious) but a fucking hiss between the teeth\u201d, adding: \u201cThe more eager Abdullah is, the more saliva comes with it.\u201d In another post, the commenter wrote: \u201cAnyone feel like spitting on beggars and beating [N-word] children today in Helsinki?\u201dA post in January 2008 read: \u201cI\u2019m so full of hate and pure rage \u2026 What are you doing to my psyche, Islam?\u201d In September 2008, \u201criikka\u201d wrote about a confrontation on a suburban train with a group of young immigrants: \u201cIf they gave me a gun, there\u2019d be bodies on a commuter train, you\u2019ll see.\u201d Finnish media have matched Purra\u2019s movements and biographical details to the posts. The Finns leader has acknowledged commenting on the blog hosted by Halla-aho \u2013 who was convicted in 2012 of inciting hatred against an ethnic group \u2013 and other forums under different usernames, but has not confirmed she was \u201criikka\u201d. After saying on Monday she condemned violence but had no regrets about \u201cexpressing myself in ways that today I would not accept\u201d, on Tuesday Purra tweeted: \u201cI apologise for stupid social media comments made 15 years ago and for the harm and resentment they they understandably caused. I\u2019m not a perfect person, I\u2019ve made mistakes.\u201d She said she hoped she would be judged on her performance in office, adding that her party\u2019s policies were \u201cnot based on extremism, racism or discrimination, but on pursuing the interests of Finland and Finns. Our immigration policy is legitimate and legal and there is nothing wrong or suspicious about it.\u201d Opposition and some coalition politicians have been quick to condemn the posts, attributing them to Purra. The former interior minister Maria Ohisalo said Purra \u201chas not only racist but also violent content on the same platform. No regrets, no resignation.\u201d The prime minister, Petteri Orpo, of the rightwing National Coalition party (NCP), said on Tuesday it was important that Purra had rejected violence in her tweets on Monday night, and he did not accept \u201cracism in any form\u201d. Speaking at a Nato summit, President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 said immigration and racism were separate issues. \u201cThe Finnish government would be wise to have a clear zero tolerance for racism,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the government is able to take this on board, it would be a good signal to the world.\u201d Separately on Tuesday, a photo emerged of a senior MP from the opposition Social Democratic party with a group of naked youths, some making a Nazi salute. Antti Lindtman said he regretted the incident, adding that the photo was from high school, he had not personally made the gesture and he had never been a Nazi sympathiser."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f55", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/11/motherhood-is-really-tough-johanna-konta-returns-to-wimbledon", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Motherhood is really tough\u2019: Johanna Konta returns to Wimbledon", "lead": "Former British No 1, who is playing in invitational event, says transition to being a mum has been hard", "author": "Geneva Abdul", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 13:58:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.951943", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9298293c1506670a9b03087ac9f3459122372605/0_157_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cAre you loving motherhood?\u201d was one of the first questions the former British No 1 tennis star Johanna Konta found herself being asked as a new mother. She would respond \u201cyes\u201d, feeling it to be the appropriate response. But now, she\u2019s taking a more honest approach. \u201cI think the act of motherhood is really tough, it\u2019s really monotonous and boring compared to what I used to do, which is play on Centre Court and travel the world and live a very selfish existence,\u201d Konta said bluntly. Known as one of Britain\u2019s most successful tennis players, Konta announced her retirement at the age of 30 in 2021. Now she has returned to Wimbledon for the ladies\u2019 invitation doubles alongside Sania Mirza, and this time with her 10-month-old daughter. \u201cTo then be thrown into a very selfless existence is a really hard transition, and it\u2019s not fun \u2013 but I would choose it every single day over playing on Centre Court,\u201d she said at Wimbledon on Tuesday morning. Throughout the years, tennis has seen a number of professional players successfully return to high-profile careers after becoming mothers. Margaret Court gave birth to her first child in 1972 and the following year won the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open. Kim Clijsters won her second US Open in 2010 after becoming a mother. And Serena Williams was two months pregnant when she won the Australian Open in 2017. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not without challenges. Training while pregnant can take a toll on elite athletes, and a player\u2019s return after giving birth depends on how smoothly it goes. Across other sports, motherhood is yet to be as widely embraced and the fight for maternity provisions is ongoing: it was only last year when professional female footballers in England were guaranteed maternity and long-term sickness cover. While each sport is different, Konta feels tennis has a blueprint when compared with other sports, with Clijsters, Williams, Victoria Azarenka and Tatjana Maria having paved the way. \u201cIt does take a certain setup and it does take a certain infrastructure to be able to do it,\u201d she admits. There was also the cost of restarting one\u2019s career, caring for a child on the road, and having the right family support. \u201cI really love what my life was, but I\u2019m learning to love my life more now,\u201d Konta said, adding that she was \u201cvery committed\u201d to retirement. The same cannot be said for Caroline Wozniacki, who returned to professional tennis after walking away from her career three years ago to start a family. After working out through two pregnancies, the former No 1 and grand slam champion wanted to get back on the court. \u201cI think as an athlete you feel like you can still play at your best and still have some[thing] left in you. I think it\u2019s a great opportunity, we only live once so why not?\u201d said the 33-year-old. \u201cI think now is the time, while the kids are young. I feel good.\u201d When Clijsters learned Wozniacki\u2019s return had similar timing to her own, it \u201cjust brought back a moment\u201d, the Belgian player said. She retired in 2007 and returned two years later after the birth of her daughter, winning three grand slam titles before hanging up her racket again in 2012. In 2019 she made another comeback at the age of 36. She retired for the third time last year.

He is known to have fathered at least eight so far, by at least three different women. He had four children with his ex-wife Marina Wheeler, and another in 2009 with the arts consultant Helen Macintyre, with whom he had an affair. The Johnsons\u2019 first child, a son named Wilfred, was born in April 2020. In May 2021 the couple married in secret at Westminster Cathedral, and in December that year it was announced they had had a baby girl, whom they named Romy Iris Charlotte.

Amid fears of dams failing if water wasn\u2019t released \u2013 exacerbating the dangerous flooding \u2013 and the further collapse of roadways, many roads on Tuesday remained closed in Vermont including several along the spine of the Green Mountains, and in upstate New York. The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings and advisories across Vermont from the Massachusetts line north to the Canadian border. In the south and west, states were blistering under a worsening heatwave, as the US embarked on another week of extreme weather and experts warned that the human-caused climate crisis is driving the record-breaking conditions. More than 13 million Americans were under flood watches and warnings from eastern New York state to Boston and western Maine to the north-east, the National Weather Service said in its forecast on Monday, and there have been more than 50 rescues by boat. The slow-moving north-eastern storm, dumping extreme amounts of water as it lingered over communities on Sunday and Monday, reached New England after hitting parts of New York, where one person died as she tried to leave her home during a flash flood and was swept away by storm waters in front of her fiance, officials said Joe Biden, who is in Vilnius, Lithuania, attending the annual Nato summit, declared that a state of emergency was confirmed in Vermont and authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to help coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance. The White House will continue to monitor the effects of the flooding, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing on Tuesday, urging people in affected areas \u201cto please, please be safe, and follow safety protocols\u201d. Some communities received 7-9in (17.78-22.86cm) of rain in less than 24 hours. Flooding affected Montpelier, the Vermont state capital, where Interstate 89, a major highway, was closed in both directions between Montpelier, Middlesex and north of Montpelier. Montpelier town manager Bill Fraser warned that the Wrightsville dam several miles to the north on the north branch of the Winooski River could exceed capacity, something that\u2019s never happened before. \u201cThere would be a large amount of water coming into Montpelier which would drastically add to the existing flood damage,\u201d he said, adding that there are very few evacuation options remaining. \u201cPeople in at-risk areas may wish to go to upper floors in their houses.\u201d Vermont\u2019s governor, Phil Scott, said the state had not seen rainfall like this since Tropical Storm Irene hit the region in August 2011, which killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles (805km) of highway. What\u2019s different is that Irene lasted just about 24 hours, Scott said. \u201cThis is going on. We\u2019re getting just as much rain, if not more. It\u2019s going on for days. That\u2019s my concern. It\u2019s not just the initial damage. It\u2019s the wave, the second wave, and the third wave,\u201d he said. Shelters were set up at churches and town halls. Some people canoed to the Cavendish Baptist church in Vermont, which had turned into a shelter while volunteers made cookies for firefighters working on rescues. \u201cPeople are doing OK. It\u2019s just stressful,\u201d shelter volunteer Amanda Gross said. Vermont state representative Kelly Pajala said she and about a half dozen others evacuated early on Monday from a four-unit apartment building on the West River in Londonderry. \u201cThe river was at our doorstep,\u201d said Pajala. \u201cWe threw some dry clothes and our cats into the car and drove to higher ground.\u201d People in New York and Connecticut were cleaning up from earlier rain. The National Weather Service in Burlington said rain in the northern part of Vermont was expected to lessen on Tuesday, but more rain was forecast for Thursday. One of the worst-hit places was New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, where a woman identified by police as Pamela Nugent, 43, died as she tried to escape her flooded home with her dog in the hamlet of Fort Montgomery. Officials say the storm has already caused tens of millions of dollars in damage. Atmospheric scientists say destructive flooding events are spurred by storms forming in a warmer atmosphere, making extreme rainfall a reality. The additional warming that scientists predict is coming will only make it worse."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f58", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/zelenskiy-accuses-nato-of-lack-of-respect-over-ukraine-membership", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Zelenskiy accuses Nato of lack of respect over Ukraine membership", "lead": "Ukrainian president complains there is \u2018no readiness\u2019 to invite country to join, as Lithuania summit opens", "author": "Dan Sabbagh in Vilnius", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 13:43:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952002", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e17b09094c391fde0186d9474eb7c61ac5380670/0_10_6114_3670/500.jpg", "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Nato leaders of showing disrespect to Ukraine by refusing to offer it a timetable for when it will be invited to join the military alliance, in a last-ditch effort to win a concession on membership at the start of a two-day summit in Lithuania. The Ukrainian president complained there was \u201cno readiness\u201d to invite Ukraine to join, giving Russia the opportunity \u201cto continue its terror\u201d by leaving open the possibility for it to bargain over Ukraine\u2019s future Nato membership in any peace deal. Nato leaders meeting in Vilnius had been due to agree the summit\u2019s final declaration on Tuesday afternoon and release it in the evening, but Zelenskiy suggested he had seen a leak of the final text, complaining that \u201ccertain wording is being discussed without Ukraine\u201d. Ukraine \u201cdeserves respect\u201d Zelenskiy said, and claimed Nato leaders would place extra conditions on his country\u2019s membership, most likely by insisting that Ukraine underwent certain anti-corruption and pro democracy reforms. \u201cIt seems there is no readiness neither to invite Ukraine to Nato nor to make it a member of the alliance,\u201d the president said in a statement published on social media at lunchtime. Nato sources said they believed Zelenskiy was engaged in last-minute hard-ball public diplomacy, aimed at prompting a rewrite of the final summit declaration or communique before the gathering closes on Wednesday. In the run-up to the summit, the US and Germany, especially, were sceptical about giving Ukraine a firm timetable or setting clear conditions for its future membership once the war ended, prompting growing anxiety in Kyiv. On Sunday, before the summit, Joe Biden, the US president, said that Ukraine was not ready for membership and needed to show progress on \u201cdemocratisation\u201d and \u201ca whole range of other issues\u201d. Other countries, especially in central and eastern Europe, have been pressing for firmer commitment to postwar membership, amid a growing belief that Ukraine\u2019s slow-moving counteroffensive could prompt Kyiv to consider negotiations with Moscow. Petr Pavel, the president of the Czech Republic, said in an interview with Sky News that any agreement that did not allow Ukraine to start the process of joining Nato once the war ended would \u201cprobably not be satisfactory\u201d. Britain adopted a more cautious public position, with Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, telling reporters he wanted to see \u201cdemonstrable progress\u201d towards eventual membership, and that Ukraine\u2019s \u201crightful place\u201d was in the alliance. Sunak did not spell out what further steps to Ukraine\u2019s membership would look like, saying it would be subject to final negotiations at the summit. Ukraine believes Nato membership is the only viable solution to prevent future attacks on it by Russia, but the US and other alliance members fear allowing Ukraine to join at some future point could be interpreted by Moscow as escalatory. There is also a fear that the US and other Nato members could be dragged into a war with Russia if Ukraine joined, as Nato operates on the principle that each country has to help defend any member under attack. But holding out on allowing Ukraine to join until the war ends gives Russia the option of continuing the war indefinitely to prevent Ukraine joining Nato. Biden is due to give a speech on Wednesday afternoon when he will set out his position, after press conferences by other leaders."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f59", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/tell-us-have-you-kept-a-pop-music-scrapbook-wham", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tell us: have you kept a pop music scrapbook?", "lead": "Andrew Ridgeley\u2019s mum kept one on Wham!

But this cautious approach could backfire, leading us closer to nuclear catastrophe. For Ukrainians, the question of whether Russia will sabotage the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), Europe\u2019s largest, located in southern Ukraine, has long been a \u201cwhen\u201d, not an \u201cif\u201d. Last week, Ukrainian civilians and officials shared panicked messages on social media as fears of a potential attack crystallised. Russian embassies and Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson appeared to be preparing disinformation lines, suggesting that Ukraine, which suffered so terribly from the Chornobyl nuclear accident, could deliberately unleash radioactive terror on its own people. While unconvincing, the rhetoric was an eerie and foreboding reminder of past Kremlin disinformation campaigns following Russian atrocities: the Skripal poisonings, the Bucha massacre, the downing of passenger jet MH17, and the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. The instinct by some of Ukraine\u2019s allies to reduce the risk of Russia turning to its nuclear arsenal is entirely correct, but the tactics are misguided. The west\u2019s mixed signals over its willingness to defend Ukraine are widely considered to have contributed to Putin\u2019s decision to launch his genocidal war. Since the invasion 17 months ago, Putin appears to have remained convinced that he has the \u201cstrategic patience\u201d to outlast the west and assure his victory. In his defence, he can cite some compelling evidence to support his belief. After Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the US and EU response was underwhelming \u2013 limited to symbolic but often ineffective personal sanctions. More recently, the international community\u2019s muted reaction to the Kakhovka dam catastrophe will have hardly caused him to reconsider his strategy. But in the absence of a clear, coordinated plan to deal with Russia\u2019s escalating nuclear threats, western leaders have edged us closer to the nuclear disaster they are seeking to avoid. Russia possesses the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenal, a dubious achievement it is not shy of broadcasting. A nuclear war would herald the end of global civilisation. Even use of a tactical nuclear weapon, resulting in a smaller explosion, would be a catastrophe for Ukraine. Any serious assessment of nuclear risk means not underestimating this. But it is also crucial that western leaders consider the consequences of being cowed by Putin\u2019s threats, which are designed to force the world to indulge his rapacious appetite to destroy Ukraine. By providing Ukraine with war-winning military support, the west can send a message to the Kremlin \u2013 and any other irredentist powers \u2013 that using nuclear threats will not work. Focusing on Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal alone distracts from more immediate threats, namely the alleged positioning of explosives around ZNPP, which has been under occupation by Russian armed forces since March 2022. Russia has amassed military personnel and equipment inside the facility, and there are reports that the children and families of Ukrainian operators forced to work at ZNPP are being held hostage in Russia, having been removed from the vicinity of the plant under the guise of \u201cevacuation\u201d. Against the backdrop of ongoing Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the fear that the Kremlin is preparing an act of nuclear terrorism is far from unreasonable. When this could occur or what this act might look like remains unclear. Some experts suggest that it is likely Russia will blow up a small part of the plant, such as a cooled reactor, to display what it is capable of, or to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive. This would be unlikely to lead to radiation leakage \u2013 but there are also much riskier scenarios. A stronger explosion could cause damage to the protective shell of a reactor, spreading radiation approximately 350 miles from the site of the blast and creating a disaster of catastrophic scale. Perhaps the threats can be dismissed as part of Russia\u2019s information warfare \u2013 another way to terrorise the Ukrainian civilian population. Last week, 10 Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian missiles in Lviv, Ukraine\u2019s most western and peaceful city. But nuclear catastrophe is not something to leave to chance or half measures. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked under trying conditions to ensure the safety of the plant, but it has lost the confidence of many in Ukraine. In its latest inspection, the IAEA insisted the plant was secure but also requested further access, as it was prevented from viewing parts of the site where Ukrainian officials claim mines have been planted. This situation is untenable. Much more robust action is needed to restore nuclear safety, and confidence. The best possible chance of demilitarising (and de-occupying) ZNPP would involve a multilateral taskforce formed of parties trusted by all sides, including the US, China, India, the UK and the EU, which could supervise the area around the station with IAEA support and expertise. In the absence of such efforts, much of Europe remains hostage to fortune. World leaders must now face up to some tough decisions, rather than giving in once more to Russian blackmail or ignoring the problem until it starts to radiate into Ukraine\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 and beyond.

After the first complaint she repainted the pink door green, a colour likewise rejected by the council, which adheres to strict guidelines for conservation areas, then changed it again to a colour she describes as off-white.

Begbies Traynor\u2019s double-digit annual revenue and profit growth resulted from a rise in insolvency appointments and its improved reputation for handling mid-sized insolvencies, as well as several acquisitions and its property services. Company insolvencies in England and Wales have hit a 24-year high, as businesses struggle with rising energy and wage bills, and higher interest rates. Official figures from the Insolvency Service showed 2,552 companies filed for insolvency in May, 40% more than a year earlier and the highest since 2009. This was higher than during the pandemic when government support measures were in place. Begbies raised its dividend by 9% to 3.8p a share, after pre-tax profit for the year to 30 April came in higher than expected at \u00a36m, up from \u00a34m the year before. Revenues climbed 11% to \u00a3121.8m. The company, which has an 11% share of the administration market, hopes to handle larger, more complex insolvencies. Traynor said: \u201cOur insolvency team will benefit from their recent insolvency appointments and increased order book, together with anticipated further growth in the insolvency market. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in activity for smaller companies over the last year because they tend to be the first ones that are hit when there\u2019s a problem. We\u2019re now moving into mid-market companies.\u201d The company bought the London-based property finance brokerage Mantra Capital and two chartered surveyors, Budworth Hardcastle in eastern England and Mark Jenkinson &amp; Son in South Yorkshire. In May, it acquired another chartered surveyor, Banks Long &amp; Co, strengthening its presence in eastern England. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cBegbies Traynor tends to thrive when economic conditions are gloomy. It has seen increased work for insolvencies, which reflects how businesses can crumble under the pressure of higher rates. \u201cMany companies have reached a tipping point where they cannot generate enough cash to service borrowings and so they have no choice but to fold.\u201d The UK\u2019s largest pawnbroker, H&amp;T, has also performed well in recent months. Gross lending grew 22% to \u00a3128m in the six months to 30 June. H&amp;T said demand for pledge lending \u2013 where an item is temporarily given up in exchange for a loan \u2013 was at record levels and continued to gather momentum. \u201cWhile it is easy to conclude these companies are profiting from the misery of others, both would argue they are doing an important service,\u201d Mould added."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f5d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/11/ange-postecoglou-spurs-biggest-challenge-attacking-mindset-james-maddison", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Postecoglou feels \u2018biggest challenge\u2019 at Spurs is getting attacking mindset back", "lead": "Ange Postecoglou says his most pressing issue at Tottenham is to instil a more attacking mentality in the players", "author": "David Hytner", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 13:11:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952098", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cb0dd71c7d4197ba287ed9d2886a1443ae5ed8c5/0_138_7949_4768/500.jpg", "body": "Ange Postecoglou says his most pressing issue at Tottenham is to instil a more attacking mentality in the players.

Postecoglou was asked whether he would have to reprogramme the players. \u201cThat will be the biggest challenge and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concentrating on,\u201d he said. It\u2019s about changing that mindset and changing the way the players see the game, and maybe their roles within it. \u201cEven with the positions they play, there\u2019s going be adjustments in how I want them to do things. It will be a shift from the way the club has played for three or four years.\u201d Postecoglou noted that his signings would be a part of the process, mentioning the midfielder James Maddison and the goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. There is uncertainty over whether the longstanding No 1, Hugo Lloris, will remain at the club. The 36-year-old has said \u201cit\u2019s the end of an era\u201d for him at Spurs and he has \u201cdesires for other things\u201d. Postecoglou said: \u201cIn terms of how quickly the players embrace it, the new players coming in will help. That\u2019s the part I have control over \u2013 whether that\u2019s James or Guglielmo in goal. They\u2019re players who fit in the direction I want to go in. Then it\u2019s about seeing with the existing group how many of them are able to adjust and embrace the way we\u2019re going to play.\u201d Maddison, signed from Leicester for \u00a340m, will be charged with taking some of the creative and goalscoring load off the front three \u2013 especially Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Maddison had 10 goals and nine assists in the Premier League last season in a relegated Leicester team. He, like Kane, will report for pre-season on Wednesday. \u201cAny manager will tell you that part of the key to being a dominant team is having multiple attacking threats and having a midfielder who can score and create goals \u2013 they\u2019re not easy to come by,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cJames has proven himself as somebody who can do that. When you look at Tottenham over the last few years, they\u2019ve been really reliant on the front three to get their goals. I thought it was a really good fit for us to look for a player like James. \u201cHe\u2019s had the birth of twins so I don\u2019t know what shape he\u2019ll be in when he gets here. But once we get him in, it means he can come on tour with us. He\u2019s in a stage of his career where it feels like he can be a leader, which is great because we need players who want to embrace that responsibility.\u201d Postecoglou discussed the culture he wants to put in place. Kane is on record as saying that certain values have been lost in recent years and Postecoglou said the starting point had to be positivity in every individual. \u201cMy basis for culture and behaviour is that we\u2019re all very fortunate to do what we do. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a person who comes through these gates who shouldn\u2019t come through with a smile on their faces, particularly the footballers. If you have an appreciation and respect of your environment and the people there, it gives you a good chance to create something. \u201cSometimes people need direction with that. If there\u2019s no clear direction and clarity around what that is supposed to look like people can go off and do their own thing. I have been and I will be pretty clear on my expectations around what we need to be like. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too far from the kind of things that Harry was talking about.\u201d Spurs have confirmed the free-agent capture of the Israel winger Manor Solomon. The 23-year-old was contracted to Shakhtar Donetsk until the end of December 2023 but he has been allowed \u2013 under a Fifa rule \u2013 to walk away from the deal. The governing body introduced the measure for all Ukraine-based players after the invasion of their country by Russia. Spurs will pay compensation to Shakhtar but it is understood that the bulk of it will be provided by Fifa. Solomon, who scored five goals in 24 appearances on loan at Fulham last season, has signed a five-year contract. Spurs remain confident of closing a deal for the \u00a330m-rated Wolfsburg centre-half Micky van de Ven."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f5e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/11/gary-lineker-still-bbcs-top-earner-on-135m-annual-report-shows", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gary Lineker still BBC\u2019s top earner on \u00a31.35m, annual report shows", "lead": "Pay of Match of the Day host unchanged in year he was suspended for criticising ministers\u2019 language", "author": "Matthew Weaver and Jim Waterson", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 13:07:51", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952117", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/433cd5d689919dfb8b8ef24ad423b07cd3130fd4/0_345_3395_2037/500.jpg", "body": "Gary Lineker has maintained his position as the BBC\u2019s highest paid presenter in a year when he was suspended for criticising the language used by ministers when discussing the government\u2019s asylum policy, the BBC annual report reveals. The Match of the Day host was paid \u00a31.35m in the last financial year, the same amount he received the previous year, and well ahead of the BBC\u2019s second highest earner, Zoe Ball, who remained on \u00a3980,000 a year. The pay of leading BBC stars has remained largely static but the News at Ten host Huw Edwards became the BBC\u2019s highest paid journalist. He received a \u00a325,000 pay rise in return for hosting a number of news specials, including coverage of the Queen\u2019s funeral. This took Edwards\u2019 total BBC salary to \u00a3435,000, pushing him up to fourth place on the overall pay list. He is just behind the Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer on \u00a3445,000, and ahead of the BBC Northern Ireland presenter Stephen Nolan on \u00a3415,000. The pay of the director general, Tim Davie, who was forced to climb down over his decision to suspend Lineker after a backlash by the presenter\u2019s colleagues, increased slightly to \u00a3525,000. The figures were contained in the BBC\u2019s annual report, which was released on Tuesday. The report was planned long before the BBC was thrown into crisis by allegations against an unnamed senior BBC presenter, which has led to his suspension. It reveals the enormous financial challenges facing the BBC. It is losing licence fee payers at a substantial pace, with 500,000 fewer households paying the \u00a3159 annual fee compared with last year. The annual report also shows how the BBC is struggling to attract younger audiences. The broadcaster\u2019s reach among 16- to 34-year-olds has slipped significantly, with only 76% of the age group using any BBC service in a normal week, down from 81% last year. Among this age group, the audio app BBC Sounds only added 20,000 active users, despite it being the focus of the BBC\u2019s efforts to reach young people with podcasts. The figure was worse for children under 16, with just 72% using BBC services in an average week, well behind YouTube. The BBC\u2019s interim chair, Dame Elan Closs Stephens, said: \u201cThe BBC has to serve its broadcast audience as well as its digital-only audience \u2013 and to do so in a harsh financial environment.\u201d Combined with rising inflation and government-mandated freezes in the licence fee, the BBC said its income had fallen by 30% in real terms since the coalition government began implementing austerity policies in 2010. The BBC\u2019s median gender pay gap increased from 5.9% to 7.3%. This is the second increase since the BBC started publishing the statistics in 2017, when the gap stood at 9.3%. The corporation\u2019s annual report said: \u201cWe expect small fluctuations in the pay gaps each year based on new hire and leaver numbers, as well as any specific pay interventions.\u201d Since 2017 the BBC has been required by the government to publish the salaries of employees who earn more than \u00a3150,000 a year from the licence fee. The annual pay disclosure has dominated headlines, created rows over the gender pay gap, and led to the departure of some of the corporation\u2019s leading stars. This year the BBC has raised the threshold for disclosure to \u00a3178,000 \u2013 meaning many presenters and executives no longer have their pay publicly disclosed. Under the old system the BBC would have disclosed the salaries of 220 employees who earned more than \u00a3150,000, thanks to a large number of people having received pay rises that took them to that level. This year only 135 were named. The list does not include individuals who work for the BBC\u2019s commercial arm, meaning actors on popular television shows are not included."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f5f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/tom-holland-i-felt-enslaved-to-alcohol-spider-man", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tom Holland: \u2018I felt enslaved to alcohol\u2019", "lead": "The Spider-Man actor used a podcast appearance to speak about his struggles with alcoholism, and how giving up drinking has made him \u2018the happiest I\u2019ve ever been\u2019", "author": "Catherine Shoard", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 13:04:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952136", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dd3acbcaaf6da1b900426ab7ca78bdab3338bf0b/333_91_2292_1376/500.jpg", "body": "Tom Holland, the British actor best known for playing Spider-Man, has opened up about his battles with sobriety.

After a \u201cvery, very boozy\u201d Christmas period in 2022, Holland found that having resolved to complete a dry January, \u201call I could think about was having a drink \u2026 It really scared me\u201d. \u201cI just was like, \u2018Wow, maybe I have a little bit of an alcohol thing.\u2019\u201d Holland resolved to extend his period of sobriety, but found it hard to do so in England, where he said he found socialising and alcohol were significantly intertwined. \u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t be social,\u201d said Holland. \u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t go to the pub and have a lime soda. I couldn\u2019t go out for dinner. I was really, really struggling.\u201d In particular, he added, he found he needed to distance himself from friends in the rugby community, \u201cbecause so much of it is about how much can you drink\u201d. \u201cI just sort of said to myself, like, \u2018Why? Why am I enslaved to this drink? Why am I so obsessed by the idea of having this drink?\u2019\u201d By the actor\u2019s 27th birthday on 1 June, he had gone for six months without drinking and said he was \u201cthe happiest I\u2019ve ever been in my life\u201d. He found benefits included improved sleep and ability to handle everyday obstacles. \u201cThings that would go wrong on set, that would normally set me off, I could take in my stride. I had such better mental clarity. I felt healthier, I felt fitter. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say it \u2013 I was definitely addicted to alcohol.

Yeah, I feel amazing.\u201d Holland is currently on a break from acting, after a gruelling shoot on Apple TV series The Crowded Room, in which he played an American criminal with dissociative identity disorder. Holland\u2019s career started to take off when he played Billy Elliot in the West End, before making his big-screen breakthrough with 2012\u2019s tsunami drama The Impossible. He made his debut as Spider-Man in 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War, and has since starred in three standalone Spider-Man movies.

The question haunts most accounts of the supreme court, an anxious subtext detectable in every discussion among court watchers and pundits when the court agrees to hear a specific case and after every oral argument. There is a safe assumption \u2013 borne out in the conservative supermajority\u2019s decisions, in their statements and in their pre-court careers \u2013 that they are all personally inclined to take the maximalist conservative route. If they were unconstrained by other factors, like public opinion and the legitimacy of the court, one gets the distinct sense that they would do the worst thing possible: reverse the most social progress, cause the most suffering, undermine democratic representation as much as possible and accrue as much political power as they can to themselves. What stops them, or slows them down, is not an instinct for moderation, or a sense of respect for the other branches, or the law. What slows them down is a caution about public opinion, a fear of what will happen if their institution is delegitimized in the minds of the people \u2013 what slows them down, that is, is something like shame. This term should prove, once and for all, that shame is not an adequate check on the court. It\u2019s true that the Republican justices surprised some court watchers by pulling their punches in cases where they may have been tempted to pursue a more aggressive approach. They declined to overturn what remains of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, for instance, even though destroying the legislation has been a decades-long aspiration of Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 though, to be clear, what\u2019s left of the act after previous court rulings eviscerating it does not provide anything like adequate protection for the franchise of Black voters. They did not embrace the most extreme version of the so-called independent state legislature theory, which would have in effect ended democratic elections for the House of Representatives in many states \u2013 though in the process of striking down the theory, they also reserved the right of federal courts (that is, themselves) to intervene in federal elections. To some, this is what counts for a moderate term from the revanchist court: a handful of decisions where the justices seemed to temper their own impulses, at least temporarily, and either preserved the diminished status quo or chose not to accelerate their aims as quickly as they should have. But the delusion of the court\u2019s moderation should have been put to rest in the last week of its term, when it issued three decisions that will dramatically upend American life: ending affirmative action in college admissions, creating a carve-out in civil rights law that allows businesses to claim a right to discriminate against gay people and using a flimsy legal theory to declare the Biden administration\u2019s student debt relief plan as illegal. These life- and law-altering rulings were matched in their extremism by an earlier decision gutting the Clean Water Act, allowing for unregulated pollution of American wetlands through a strained and inventive reading of the word \u201cadjacent\u201d. If these justices were capable of shame, one would expect that now, more than ever, would be the moment when that feeling would act to restrain them. After the court decimated the rights of American women last year in Dobbs, the case that overturned Roe v Wade, public approval of the court has never been lower. More and more Americans understand the justices as politicians, ones who are not accountable to the electorate and not acting with either Americans interests or their preferences in mind. The intervening months have done much to confirm this feeling: not only are the justices political actors, but a tidal wave of reporting suggests that many of them are particularly corrupt ones. Last November, the New York Times published a report in which a former conservative activist detailed how a lobbying group purchased a building near the supreme court, infiltrated the body\u2019s historical society, befriended the justices and allegedly received advance notice of the ruling in a 2014 birth control case from Samuel Alito. This April, ProPublica released the first of a series of disclosures about Clarence Thomas\u2019s relationship with the billionaire Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow, who has showered the justice with lavish vacations \u2013 at his New Hampshire Compound, on his \u201csuperyacht\u201d, and onboard his private plane \u2013 as well as paying for the private school education of Thomas\u2019s nephew and buying the home of the justice\u2019s mother, renovating it and allowing her to live there rent free. Similar revelations were made about a luxury fishing trip taken by Justice Alito, paid for by another billionaire Republican donor, Paul Singer, whose subsequent interests are before the court Alito has not recused himself from. When asked to appear before the Senate judiciary committee to explain these gifts and the subsequent failures of disclosure and refusal, Chief Justice John Roberts rejected Congress\u2019s oversight power, writing a curt letter telling the Senate to go kick rocks. These are not the actions of people concerned for their court\u2019s legitimacy. These are the actions of people convinced that there is nothing the elected branches can do to stop them. Is it worth explaining the legal rationales that the court used to reach these ruinous outcomes? To give credence to the court\u2019s professed reasoning risks suggesting that the justices are acting in good faith. They are not. The fact of the matter is that many of the term\u2019s most significant decisions were based on fanciful notions about history, creative and far-fetched readings of statute, hypotheticals and invented facts. In the affirmative action case, the conservative majority relied on a misreading of history \u2013 so strained I can only describe it as cynical \u2013 to assert that both the Reconstruction amendments and the court\u2019s own civil rights jurisprudence in cases like Brown v Board of Education were \u201ccolorblind\u201d. In the student debt case, the court accepted Missouri\u2019s right to sue on behalf of a debt servicing agency that wanted no part in the lawsuit and had to be legally compelled to produce the documents necessary for the plaintiffs; then, the justices reached their preferred conclusion via the \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d, a novel and flimsy legal alibi that has in recent years been used by the court to assert that they and not the executive branch, have authority over issues of social or political controversy. In the anti-gay case, the court ruled in favor of a woman who claimed she would be hurt by having to make a wedding website for a gay couple \u2013 even though she had never been asked to do so. In a fair and lawful court, these cases would have been dismissed on procedural grounds. But this supreme court, a revanchist, activist conservative political body that plunders authority from the elected branches, the justices reached the merits \u2013 because they wanted to. The court has hijacked American democracy, vastly overextended its own power and flaunted its corruption. It will take a political movement to stop them.

Emma, Bradford Sweet, juicy berries are one of the best things about summer, but they can quickly turn squishy. Providing there\u2019s no mould, Emma\u2019s first option is to bake them. \u201cYou absolutely want to be throwing them into the likes of financiers, friands, a bakewell tart or even a berry tart topped with cr\u00e8me patissi\u00e8re,\u201d says Philip Khoury, author of A New Way to Bake, published next month. The reason being, as berries age, \u201cthe fibre that gives them their tight and regular structure starts to give, but their flavour becomes sweeter, because the carbohydrates break down into sugar\u201d. So, while the fruit\u2019s texture might be compromised, \u201cit is sweeter and, once baked, will turn nice and jammy\u201d. By the same logic, you can\u2019t go far wrong with a crumble, either. \u201cGet some apples in with the berries, then toss in sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon,\u201d says Crystelle Pereira, author of Flavour Kitchen. How you then make your topping is entirely up for grabs: \u201cHave it oat-based and add coconut oil for more of a breakfast crumble, or use sesame seeds, desiccated coconut or cornflakes for texture.\u201d Nuts, too, are very much encouraged: \u201cFlaked almonds go well with berries, as do cashews or pistachios with strawberries.\u201d (The latter, Pereira adds, \u201clooks really, really good\u201d.) The bounty of summer berries also coincides neatly with the need to chill. \u201cFreezing is a great way to lock in their quality before they turn completely,\u201d Khoury says. Freeze the berries whole, just as they are, or, Pereira suggests, \u201ccook them down into a compote with a bit of lemon or lime juice and some sugar\u201d. If strawberries are in play, she might add cardamom and ginger, while other berries might get a sprinkling of chai spice blend (cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, black pepper). \u201cStore some compote in a jar and have it with your breakfast with yoghurt and granola, and put the rest in a zip-lock bag or ice-cube tray and freeze.\u201d Of course, frozen berries also mean dessert. Oli Brown, chef/co-owner at Updown, near Deal, Kent, purees them pre-freeze for \u201cwhen you want amazing ripe fruit in winter for a souffle\u201d, or, more pressingly, for ice lollies and sorbets. Also guaranteed to bring joy is a frozen berry negroni. \u201cIt\u2019s such a genius idea from Billy Stock of The Rose Inn [also in Deal],\u201d Brown says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to serve a vodka-strawberry lolly when people arrive this summer \u2013 it\u2019s a fun way to use fruit that can\u2019t necessarily be used on the plate.\u201d The same goes for shrubs, or drinking vinegars, which are equally at home in cocktails as they are in soft drinks. \u201cInfuse vinegar, sugar and water with the berries in equal amounts, then leave to sit in the fridge for a couple of days,\u201d says Brown, who might also throw in lemon verbena, rosemary, thyme or mint. Strain, and you\u2019re good to go. Salads, meanwhile, might welcome a raspberry dressing, Brown says, \u201calthough it is a bit retro\u201d. Another savoury solution would be to pickle berries or cherries, which, again, could be eaten with leaves or, say, mackerel or roast duck: \u201cAfter all, fruit and meat, and fruit and fish are A Thing.\u201d Got a culinary dilemma?

But unlike 2016, of course, Trump has been the race\u2019s perhaps prohibitive favorite from the jump \u2060\u2013 over the last three months, Trump has moved from plurality to outright majority support from the Republican electorate in the polls. Far from damaging his candidacy, his two indictments have, if anything, encouraged more and more Republican voters to rally to his side. And, unfortunately for those hoping he loses the nomination, the sheer size of the field will make it difficult for any one of his rivals to consolidate enough of the non-Trump vote to mount a real challenge to his candidacy. Each of his long-shot competitors had to have known that their entry into the race would only make his renomination likelier. Yet they jumped in anyway. Why? Charitably, we might want to set aside the numerous financial and professional incentives candidates have to run even losing campaigns for the presidency these days and choose to assume that the candidates in the field are offering policy agendas so robust and compelling \u2060\u2013 are so on fire about what they actually want to do as president \u2060\u2013 that they couldn\u2019t help but throw their hats into the ring. Ron DeSantis, for his part, has shoved rightwing paranoia about education and the rollback of LGBTQ+ rights onto the party\u2019s center stage; Florida has become the crucible for a cultural agenda social conservatives are plainly eager to advance from Congress and the White House once they get the chance. But nearly everyone else in the race seems intent on making it a pure referendum on Donald Trump. Chris Christie, for instance, now up for his second try against Trump for the nomination and currently averaging less than 3% in the primary polls, spent the bulk of his announcement speech last month disparaging Trump\u2019s character; his slogan, a rather audacious one for someone who left office mired in legal controversy and scandal, is \u201cbecause the truth matters\u201d. At the opposite end of the field, Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami \u2060\u2013 a mostly ceremonial office \u2060\u2013 has suggested he might pardon Trump if elected; he\u2019s also about as attentive as Trump to matters of policy substance. When asked by the conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt about the persecution of the Uyghur people in China recently, Suarez confessed ignorance. \u201cI will search Uyghurs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a good learner. I\u2019m a fast learner.\u201d In fairness, Trump \u2060\u2013 or at least his team \u2060\u2013 has been notably more thoroughgoing in advancing a policy agenda this time around than his rivals. He made headlines earlier this year with proposals to invest in the development of flying cars and to construct up to ten new \u201cFreedom Cities\u201d \u2060\u2013 state-of-the-art megalopolises of the future \u2060\u2013 from scratch on federal land. All this was good for a few laughs, but the bulk of the Trump campaign\u2019s public platform on the issues at the heart of Republican politics are both more plausible and more alarming, though nearly all of them would be very heavy lifts legislatively. On crime, the next Trump administration will pursue tighter penalties for violent offenders, more funding for police departments and a strengthening of qualified immunity. On education, Trump promises to \u201ccut federal funding for any school or program pushing critical race theory or gender ideology on our children\u201d and give states incentives not only to achieve longstanding conservative priorities like abolishing teacher tenure and implementing merit pay, but introducing parental bills of rights and measures like the direct election of school principals. On LGBTQ+ rights, Trump wants to ban gender-affirming care for minors and prohibit the federal recognition of transgender identity. And on immigration, the next Trump administration will revive the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy and other measures aimed at frustrating asylum seekers and continue the militarization of the border. The absence of fleshed out platforms from the other candidates as yet means that Trump remains not only the tonal but the substantive center of the Republican race thus far. And even those running the campaigns most explicitly aimed at resuscitating the pre-Trump GOP establishment have shown a willingness to follow Trump to the extremes. It might surprise many American voters for instance \u2060\u2013 though neither President Biden nor most of the political press has made much of it \u2060\u2013 that there\u2019s a consensus among Republican candidates, as Reason\u2019s Matt Welch has noted, that the next administration should launch a new war in Mexico, with American troops on the ground if need be, against the drug cartels. This was an idea Trump first put forward four years ago; in his current platform, it survives as a pledge to order the Department of Defense to \u201cinflict maximum damage\u201d on the cartels and to take them down \u201cjust as he took down Isis\u201d. The majority of the major candidates in the field are on board with this, including South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott and Nikki Haley, who are still routinely framed as comparatively moderate figures by much of the political press. In his very announcement speech, in fact, Scott went as far as to call cartels terrorists and promised to \u201callow the world\u2019s greatest military to fight\u201d them. Haley has also echoed Trump directly \u2013 the cartels, she said in the spring, are to be dealt with \u201cjust like we dealt with Isis\u201d. This is the same Nikki Haley who noted correctly and with some candor in her campaign announcement video that the Republicans have lost the popular vote in \u201cseven out of the last eight presidential elections\u201d. That\u2019s an insight that can cut two ways. On the one hand, it should be plain to all running that neither Trumpism nor a mere return to the unpopular Republican platforms of old will broaden the Republican base \u2060\u2013 a conservatism that can reliably win popular majorities in 2024 and beyond has yet to be discovered or forged and none of the candidates in the running seem especially interested in paving novel ground. On the other hand, it should similarly be plain that next Republican nominee will not actually need a popular majority to win the White House in 2024 \u2060\u2013 dusting off Trumpism and missteps and malaise within the Democratic party may well be enough to deliver victory again, no platform innovations necessary. As it stands, Trump himself seems likeliest to carry the party\u2019s mantle again next year \u2060\u2013 his rivals remain too numerous; his gravitational pull on the party\u2019s discourse and agenda remains too strong.

Officers from the national security department visited the housing estate where Law\u2019s family live and took his parents and brother in for questioning in the early hours of Tuesday morning. So far no arrests have been made. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong police said the people taken for questioning on Tuesday morning were \u201csuspected of assisting persons wanted by police [for continuing to] commit acts and engage in activities that endanger national security. Investigation is under way and further operations, including arrest, may be made.\u201d Police recently issued a HK$1m (\u00a399,100) bounty for Law, a former pro-democracy legislator who fled Hong Kong for the UK in 2020. At the time he said he had cut off all contact with his family. On 3 July, Hong Kong police issued arrest warrants for Law and seven other overseas-based activists, accusing them of violating the territory\u2019s national security law while in exile. The warrants were accompanied by bounties for each of the activists. The move was condemned by the governments of the UK, the US and Australia, where most of the activists are based. Last week, Law said that his life would become more dangerous as a result of the arrest warrants. Many observers have noted that Hong Kong authorities are increasingly using tactics similar to those employed by security forces in mainland China to intimidate critics overseas. Harassing the families of dissidents is one such method. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP and chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said the raids were \u201cutterly outrageous\u201d and clearly an attempt to \u201clure\u201d Law back to the territory so he could be imprisoned. Kearns said the government should have called in China\u2019s ambassador to the UK to complain after the bounties were announced for the activists. She and other MPs urged the government earlier this month to enforce sanctions against Hong Kong officials involved in targeting UK-based pro-democracy activists. Mark Sabah, the UK and EU director for the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, called the actions sinister. \u201cThis latest escalation is clearly designed to intimidate and silence Hongkongers abroad from exposing the true nature of the Hong Kong authorities and their Beijing masters,\u201d he said. In the days after the warrants were issued, five people in Hong Kong were arrested and accused of violating the national security law by receiving funds to support the overseas activists. Some of the arrested people were linked to an app that promoted businesses sympathetic to the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, according to local media. The app was removed from app stores last week.

The report, Bibby Stockholm \u2013 At What Cost? from the NGOs Reclaim the Seas and One Life to Live, provides the first detailed estimated costings of the Bibby Stockholm, the barge the Home Office is planning to use in Dorset to accommodate asylum seekers. It says the most generous saving the Home Office can make is \u00a39.28 a person a day if they substitute hotel accommodation for barges. This figure is calculated without knowledge of certain costs such as inspections, repair and refurbishment. While the Home Office has not published a detailed breakdown of the costs of securing and operating the barge as the UK\u2019s first floating accommodation site for asylum seekers, officials have repeatedly said that the use of barges will reduce reliance on expensive hotels and cost less. Nicola David of One Life to Live said: \u201cThe Bibby Stockholm will almost certainly be an additional cost and will therefore make no difference to either the cost of hotels or the number in use.\u201d The Bibby Stockholm was due to arrive in Portland in Dorset by 19 June but has not yet arrived there. Like some other Home Office plans to provide alternatives to hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, the proposals encountered difficulties before a single asylum seeker has boarded the barge. Plans to accommodate asylum seekers on a military base in Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire were abandoned last minute after facing strong opposition from the local community and the constituency the Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake. Plans to accommodate asylum seekers at two other military bases \u2013 Wethersfield in north Essex and Scampton in Lincolnshire \u2013 are facing a high court challenge this week. The report states that at most, the barge option could save \u00a34,694 on the daily hotel bill of \u00a35.6m \u2013 or 0.08% of the current spend and adds that if the Home Office was to publish the full costings there may be no financial saving at all. The Home Office has said that the number of asylum seekers arriving in the UK was a \u201cnational emergency\u201d. The report\u2019s authors argue that it would be much more cost-effective for the Home Office to spend the money on employing more asylum case workers to clear the record asylum backlog, which stood at 173,000 in March 2023. David said: \u201cWe believe there is no \u2018national emergency\u2019 requiring the use of large-scale containment, other than of the Home Office\u2019s own making due to the unprecedented backlog of asylum claims. \u201cJust one day\u2019s \u00a35.6m hotel bill could pay for about 150 new asylum claim decision-makers.\u201d While Portland has accepted having the barge docked there, other ports including in London, Birkenhead, Teesside and Tyneside have rejected requests from government to dock a barge. The report points out that being forced to live on water could retraumatise asylum seekers who may have seen people with whom they travelled on small boats across the Mediterranean either go overboard or drown. Those unable to swim may be particularly fearful of living on water. In a separate piece of research One Life to Live has discovered that Bibby Marine, the company the Home Office secured the Bibby Stockholm barge from, has historic links with the slave trade with at least three voyages in 1805 and 1806 transporting enslaved people from various parts of Africa to other parts of the world including the Caribbean. The research calls on the company to be \u201con the right side of history\u201d and not have people of colour on their barge living in difficult conditions. A spokesperson for Bibby Marine said: \u201cThose staying on the Bibby Stockholm will be provided with a quality, comfortable and safe place to stay. Services on board the vessel will be managed by Corporate Travel Management Limited (CTM) and its delivery partners on behalf of the Home Office. As a responsible business, the welfare of anyone on board our vessels is a key priority for us \u2013 we remain in continual dialogue with the Home Office, CTM and its delivery partners around how those service providers will ensure asylum seekers staying on board the vessel are treated with care and dignity. \u201cThe Bibby Line Group was formed after the abolition of slavery and the company has never been involved in the transportation of slaves. In the books we published in 1969 and 2007, we set out John Bibby\u2019s part ownership of transatlantic trading vessels, and the links of these to the transportation of slaves. More recently we have worked with academics to explore and report these connections in more detail. We retain a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery in line with our values.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for the British taxpayer than expensive hotels. \u201cThis is why we continue to source new alternative sites and vessels to accommodate migrants, which are more manageable for communities, as our European neighbours are doing. We are committed to making every effort to reduce hotel use and limit the burden on the taxpayer.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f65", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/11/durer-painted-himself-at-centre-of-renaissance-altarpiece-in-revenge-research-finds", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "D\u00fcrer painted himself at centre of Renaissance altarpiece in revenge, research finds", "lead": "Exclusive: Cambridge academic\u2019s study of surviving letters shows pay row with wealthy patron", "author": "Dalya Alberge", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:25:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952252", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8e5639747d18e27665a2c2ea55c0b56b9906433e/1352_2295_2092_1254/500.jpg", "body": "The Renaissance painter Albrecht D\u00fcrer took revenge on his patron after a bitter row over pay by placing his own self-portrait in a 1500s altarpiece that he painted for him, according to research. The Nuremberg master was commissioned by a wealthy Frankfurt merchant, Jacob Heller, only to find himself fighting in vain for a decent fee. Ulinka Rublack, a professor of early modern European history at Cambridge University, said: \u201cHe placed an image of himself right in the middle of the panel, as a lean, isolated figure in a landscape \u2013 a figure nobody would have expected to see when looking up from the monumental apostles in the foreground to gaze at the Virgin Mary\u2019s ascension and coronation. \u201cD\u00fcrer inserted his figure just left of centre, and below Mary and Jesus, to ensure that any viewer\u2019s gaze was directed to just this spot.\u201d She said that in other paintings D\u00fcrer added discreet images of himself, in a corner or at the edge, almost like a signature, just as Alfred Hitchcock made fleeting appearances in his films. But D\u00fcrer placed himself right in the centre of his painting for Heller, Rublack said, \u201cidentifying himself as the artist, holding a \u2018shop-sign\u2019 placard with his name \u2013 nobody ever did anything like this again\u201d. She added: \u201cIt really is astonishing.\u201d The prominence of D\u00fcrer\u2019s self-portrait and the fury expressed in his surviving letters has led Rublack to conclude that \u201cthis had to have been an act of revenge\u201d. D\u00fcrer\u2019s anger at Heller is reflected in nine letters from 1508 and 1509 in which he argued he was being underpaid. Materials were expensive and he had to pay his assistants for the altarpiece\u2019s side wings. He had initially agreed 130 florins, only to realise he was producing a more ambitious painting than planned and that the merchant would have needed to pay more than 100 florins just for the pigment. One letter argued that the artist had made almost no profit, even with 230 florins as payment. He vented his anger: \u201cI am losing time and money and earning your ingratitude.\u201d In another passage, he asked Heller bluntly: \u201cWhat do you imagine my living costs are?\u201d Rublack said merchants were crucial figures in commissioning Renaissance art, though Heller drove D\u00fcrer to the \u201cbrink of exasperation\u201d. Having to beg for a decent wage took such an emotional toll that D\u00fcrer vowed to stop painting anything as complex as altarpieces. After everything, his masterpiece was destroyed in a fire in Munich in 1729 and is known from an early 17th-century copy by a Nuremberg painter, Jobst Harrich, now in the Frankfurt Historical Museum. There is also his famous sketch for it of praying hands, which Rublack described as \u201camong the most famous hands in the world\u201d, reproduced by everyone from Andy Warhol to the hip-hop artist Drake. She said few people knew about the altarpiece for which it was created because the quality of the copy was \u201cnot great\u201d, and \u201cmajor biographies of D\u00fcrer either do not mention or just briefly touch on the Heller altarpiece\u201d. She said: \u201cD\u00fcrer fought a historical battle to assert the value of art. Heller proved stronger. Scarred and angry, D\u00fcrer moved on, abandoning altarpieces to create commercially viable works.\u201d The artist died in 1528, having painted only one further altarpiece. Ironically, from the 1580s onwards, collectors were paying vast sums for his works, many times what he had been paid for this masterpiece. Today, such is the demand among collectors that a drawing was recently valued at $50m (\u00a338m). Rublack\u2019s research will feature in her forthcoming book, D\u00fcrer\u2019s Lost Masterpiece: Art and Society at the Dawn of a Global World, to be published by Oxford University Press in August."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f66", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/11/families-critical-of-birmingham-stabbings-report-zephaniah-mcleod", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018These were failings\u2019: families critical of Birmingham stabbings report", "lead": "Victims\u2019 mothers say recommendations will not secure real change after Zephaniah McLeod\u2019s deadly attacks in 2020", "author": "Jessica Murray Midlands correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:22:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952270", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/637f1aa4148af8ad626ea42f8e1e2c0653f1e403/412_0_7115_4271/500.jpg", "body": "Jo Billington can vividly remember the moment police came to her home in Crosby, Liverpool, at 5am on 6 September 2020. They told her that her 23-year-old son, Jacob, had been killed in Birmingham, where he had been on a night out with his friends. \u201cThey left saying \u2018we don\u2019t know anything about the incident, we just know Jacob has passed away. It\u2019s all in the news\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThey gave me a non-emergency number to call but after an hour of trying to get through I rang 999 and said to the call handler: \u2018I\u2019ve just been told my son has been killed in Birmingham, can somebody help me?\u2019 It was pretty grim.\u201d Jacob\u2019s family, along with his best friend, Michael Callaghan, who was seriously injured, have been waiting a long time for a report on how Zephaniah McLeod, a violent criminal with a history of mental health issues who had recently been released from prison, was able to stab eight people that night. The 176-page document, originally due to be released in January 2022, contains extensive detail about McLeod\u2019s interactions with police, probation, prison and mental health services over the years. But the families are angry about the report\u2019s recommendations, which they do not think will secure any meaningful change, and what they see as a lack of explanation as to not just how but why things went so wrong. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know why something has gone wrong, how can you correct it? So I was very disappointed when I got the report,\u201d Billington said. Callaghan was stabbed in the neck by McLeod and had a \u201ccatastrophic, inevitable stroke\u201d followed by \u201cpneumonia so severe he was medically paralysed\u201d, according to the report. He has since relearned to walk but is still unable to use his left arm. \u201cI don\u2019t think the urgency this has been treated with matches the severity of the impact on our lives,\u201d Callaghan said. \u201cMichael didn\u2019t know about Jacob until he came out of the coma, after the funeral had happened and everything,\u201d said his mother, Anne Callaghan. \u201cHe was just utterly distraught and had woken up paralysed.\u201d McLeod\u2019s other victims included Shane Rowley, whom he stabbed in the torso six times, the wounds penetrating her lung, liver, kidney and bowel. He stabbed Thomas Glassey twice in the chest, and slashed at the face of Migle Dolobauskaite as she sat outside a train station. The Billington and Callaghan families pushed to have their victim impact statements included in the final report to ensure the ultimate consequences of McLeod\u2019s actions were not lost. \u201cI don\u2019t want it called \u2018the incident\u2019,\u201d Billington said. \u201cThis was a young man stabbed through both his main neck arteries bleeding to death in the street. Let\u2019s not soften that because we can\u2019t soften it, it\u2019s our son.\u201d She hopes a coroner will grant an article 2 inquest into her son\u2019s death, to establish whether his human rights were breached by the state\u2019s inability to protect him from the harm McLeod had posed. In November 2021, when McLeod received a 21-year prison sentence, it became clear that a failure to adequately grasp the severity of his mental illness was a significant factor in the case. \u201cGiven your past medical history, it is a matter of considerable concern that you were simply lost in the system for some weeks,\u201d the judge Mr Justice Pepperall said in his sentencing remarks. But the families were unprepared for the scale of mismanagement exposed in the report. \u201cI was amazed at how bad it was over such a long period of time, because this is really the end of 10 years of a lack of treatment,\u201d Billington said. \u201cHe was definitely psychotically ill, but he was also a violent career criminal as well. I think sometimes the two sets of things weren\u2019t seen as a joint problem. His offending behaviour was never seen in the context of his mental illness. So all the time he fell between these cracks between the two services.\u201d Anne Callaghan said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the days where people got sectioned and thrown into institutions. But it seems like a lot of red flags were just ignored and ignored and ignored. They were normalising completely unacceptable things.\u201d Their sons were good friends, attending Sheffield University together and since graduation spending their spare time creating music for their band, The Vedetts, with Michael as lead singer and Jacob on drums. Scattered on the coffee table in front of them are photos of Michael and Jacob with their friends over the years \u2013 at music festivals, on the log flume at Alton Towers, playing in the band. \u201cIn the sentencing we heard the 999 call and you could hear the panic and terror in their friend\u2019s voices as they said \u2018how do we stop the bleeding?\u2019. They had two people with arterial neck injuries, so you can imagine what that scene was like,\u201d Billington said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to be sensationalist, it\u2019s just to say these are the outcomes of things like this for real people. These weren\u2019t missed opportunities, these were failings and people not doing their job properly. It\u2019s very difficult to forgive.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f67", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/11/uk-pay-growth-interest-rate-rise-jeremy-hunt-inflation", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Record UK pay growth adds to pressure for interest rate rise", "lead": "Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England\u2019s Andrew Bailey call for wage restraint to help curb inflation", "author": "Phillip Inman", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:20:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952289", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6d37a002bfdf475ab858c3967655fa1f9ca873/0_0_3667_2201/500.jpg", "body": "Wages increased at a faster rate than expected in May, putting pressure on the Bank of England to push up the cost of borrowing at its next meeting in August. Earnings growth hit 7.3% in the three months to May compared with a year earlier, driven by the strongest rise in private sector pay growth outside the pandemic period of 7.7%, the Office for National Statistics said. It was the joint highest since modern records began in 2001. City analysts had expected wage growth to ease to 7.1%. Pay growth was also revised up for the previous month to 7.3% from 7.2%. Speaking at the Mansion House annual dinner in the City on Monday, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, warned wage restraint would be needed to bring down high inflation. The governor said current levels of price and wage increases were inconsistent with reducing inflation \u2013 now at 8.7% \u2013 to the government\u2019s 2% target. Despite the rise in headline wage growth, real pay when taking inflation into account was down 0.8%, the ONS data showed. Mel Stride, the work and pensions minister, said in response to the figures that the government needed to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d to bring down wage inflation by bearing down on public sector wage demands. \u201cWhat is really important, just as the Bank of England is doing its bit on the monetary side with higher interest rates, [is] that the government does the right thing with fiscal policy to accommodate that. \u201cAnd that does mean leaning into controlling wage growth wherever possible, principally in the public sector.\u201d The ONS said public sector wages rose in 5.8% in the three months to May while earnings jumped by 9% in the finance and business services sector, which covers jobs in the City, the accountancy and legal professions, advertising and marketing. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said the government \u201cmust stop scapegoating workers for its failures\u201d. He added: \u201cWages are not driving inflation \u2013 they are not even keeping up with it. In the public sector and lower-paid private sector industries, pay is even further behind.\u201d Labour\u2019s work and pension spokesperson, Jonathan Ashworth, blamed the government\u2019s failure to provide skills training and help people back to work who left the labour market during the pandemic. \u201cBritain is the only G7 country with a lower employment rate than before the pandemic and real wages have fallen yet again \u2013 just as more and more families feel the devastating impact of the Tory mortgage bombshell,\u201d he said. Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said employers were under pressure to pay higher wages as they competed for skilled workers, despite a fall in the number of job vacancies from 1.3m to 1m since January. The ONS data also showed the unemployment rate increased from 3.8% to 4% and employment growth fell back, indicating that the jobs market is cooling at a faster rate than forecast. City analysts had expected employers to keep hold of workers despite a rise in the Bank\u2019s base rate to 5%. Some economists said the fall in vacancies and rise the jobless figures should persuade the Bank that higher interest rates were already dampening the economy. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cSigns that the labour market is loosening quickly bolster the case for the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee to stop its rate hiking cycle soon.\u201d But he conceded that the high levels of wages growth dampened the prospect that another interest rate increase in August could be prevented, which would mark a 14th consecutive rise. Tony Wilson, the head of the Institute for Employment, said an increase in unemployment indicated that higher interest rates were beginning to take their toll on some employers, and large wage rises were likely to persist for many years without action from the government to bring more people back into work. More than 2 million people say they want to work but are outside the labour force. The UK is one of the few large European countries where the number of inactive workers has increased since 2019, leading to a drop in the employment rate. ONS figures showed that, in the three months to the end of May, the situation improved after a rise in the number of people over the age of 55 who reported returning to work and a decrease of 2,000 in the number of people registered with a long-term illness. However, the employment rate only increased 0.2 percentage points to 76%, leaving it 0.6 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level, largely due to the 420,000 extra people off work with a long-term illness compared with 2019."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f68", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/11/met-police-bbc-pause-investigation-suspended-presenter", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Met police ask BBC to pause investigation into suspended presenter", "lead": "Corporation\u2019s director general reveals request as officers consider if there is reason for a criminal inquiry", "author": "Jim Waterson Media editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:20:11", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952309", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/60850168187076bd0775cf125c47f0b45f1f8410/473_1135_7214_4329/500.jpg", "body": "The Metropolitan police have asked the BBC to pause its inquiries into a suspended male presenter, while specialist officers decide if there is any justification for a criminal investigation. The BBC director general, Tim Davie, said the Met had taken control of the inquiry, although the police were still at the \u201cscoping\u201d stage of their inquiries and they may decide they was no criminal case to answer. Davie made the announcement as he took questions from journalists at the launch of the BBC\u2019s annual report. The off-camera event was scheduled long before one of the broadcaster\u2019s leading male presenters was suspended following allegations in the Sun he spent \u00a335,000 buying explicit images from a young person. In other developments: The BBC published its own timeline of events leading up to the presenter\u2019s suspension, which claimed a member of the young person\u2019s family initially tried to make a complaint via a physical BBC office in May \u2013 and later failed to return phone calls from BBC investigators. Davie said the initial complaint was \u201cvery serious but not criminal\u201d, unlike the claims put to the BBC by the Sun last week that the young person may have been 17 when contact began. The director general confirmed the presenter was informed of the allegations against him only last week, when the Sun contacted the BBC. The director general said the BBC had a \u201cduty of care\u201d to the suspended presenter, suggested they were providing him with support, and declined to comment on suggestions that blackmail may have been involved. The young person at the heart of the story has said the Sun\u2019s claims of illegal behaviour are \u201crubbish\u201d. The BBC published its annual list of its highest-earning stars. Davie said the young person\u2019s family initially attempted to complain about the presenter by walking into a local BBC office in May. They then called the BBC\u2019s complaints line \u2013 usually used by members of the public unhappy with what they have watched on screen. He said this was then passed to the BBC\u2019s internal investigations team, which concluded it was worth pursuing. \u201cOn the basis of the information they had at that point, it did not involve an allegation of criminality but it was nonetheless very serious,\u201d said Davie. The investigations team twice attempted to contact the individual who had made complaint but received no response, he said, prompting it to pause the investigation. Davie insisted it was standard procedure for the BBC\u2019s investigations team to verify serious allegations before putting them to presenters. He said 250 cases had been referred by the internal investigations team in the last six months, and the BBC had to protect its staff from malicious claims, adding: \u201cYou could be in a situation where anyone could ring anything in and put it to presenters.\u201d The young person\u2019s mother later took the allegations to the Sun, claiming payments from the BBC presenter helped fund her child\u2019s crack cocaine habit. She alleged her child was 17 years old when they started talking online with the BBC employee. The young person, now 20, has issued a statement distancing themselves from their mother and said the key allegations were \u201crubbish\u201d. The young person\u2019s lawyer said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place between our client and the BBC personality and the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish.\u201d The lawyer also suggested they told the Sun the story was wrong but the newspaper did not include the denial in its reporting. Davie said the BBC had been conducting its inquiries with \u201cutmost diligence\u201d while \u201csensibly handling duty of care issues\u201d, including protecting the privacy of all the individuals involved. He also confirmed the BBC would hand over to the police any material it held on the suspended presenter, while reviewing its protocols and procedures for reporting allegations. If the young person sent the BBC presenter any explicit photos when they were 17, it is possible a serious criminal offence involving child sexual abuse was committed. But if the young person waited until they were 18 to send any explicit pictures, they would have legally been an adult and it is substantially less likely that a criminal offence was committed. The BBC presenter has not been named in the mainstream media, partly due to the increasingly strong privacy laws in England and Wales. Davie said he had not talked to the presenter and would not comment on whether they had offered to resign. Davie added: \u201cDuty of care is a very significant factor in this if you look at the enormity of the coverage... That goes beyond the people at the centre of the drama but also the people affected by that.\u201d The young person\u2019s lawyer told BBC News they had provided a similar denial to the Sun before the publication of the original story, telling the tabloid there was no truth to the article they were preparing to publish. The tabloid pressed ahead, without including any denial from the young person. A spokesperson for the Sun said: \u201cWe have reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child. Their complaint was not acted upon by the BBC. We have seen evidence that supports their concerns. It\u2019s now for the BBC to properly investigate.\u201d The BBC\u2019s annual report also revealed the salaries of many of the BBC\u2019s leading presenters, while also showing how the broadcaster is struggling to connect with youth audiences and facing a drop in the number of British households paying the licence fee. Davie defended the continuing need for the corporation in the face of challenges, saying: \u201cDespite all the storms and challenges, the need for a strong and thriving BBC is greater than ever. In a world of polarisation, surely we are fighting for something very important.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f69", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/erdogan-boxes-clever-for-turkish-interests-as-sweden-wins-nato-prize", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Erdo\u011fan boxes clever for Turkish interests as Sweden wins Nato prize", "lead": "President makes progress on series of issues despite some distaste among international partners for his methods", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:18:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952327", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fd29643d84d5b457a3a7feb634f669ace1748cd7/0_162_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "Any student of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s negotiating methods knows that the Turkish president is the master of leverage, waiting until his interlocutor is at their weakest before making his final play. His methods can be brutal. Leaked minutes from a 2015 meeting with EU leaders about a shaky deal on stemming migration from Syria recorded him saying: \u201cWe can open the doors to Greece and Bulgaria anytime and we can put the refugees on buses \u2026 So how will you deal with refugees if you don\u2019t get a deal? Kill the refugees?\u201d Luxembourg \u2013 from where the then EU Commission president Jean Claude Juncker hailed \u2013 was \u201cthe equivalent of a little town in Turkey\u201d, he taunted. In that context, holding back Turkish approval of Sweden\u2019s membership of Nato until the eve of this week\u2019s summit in Vilnius was to be expected. Erdo\u011fan has been fighting for Turkish interests on three fronts: a tougher crackdown on Turkish Kurds in Sweden; lifting the de facto US Congress veto on the US sale of F-16s to Ankara; and \u2013 in a blindside late twist \u2013 demanding progress over Turkish aspirations for visa-free travel inside the EU. In all three cases he made progress without having to set a precise date by when the Turkish parliament would approve Sweden\u2019s Nato membership. Even now not every piece in the jigsaw is firmly in place. Sweden has amended its constitution, changed its laws, significantly expanded its counter-terrorism cooperation against the PKK (the Kurdish separatist group) and resumed arms exports to Turkey. It has also agreed to present a roadmap \u201cas the basis of its continued fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations\u201d and reiterated that it will not provide support to the YPG/PYD Kurdish group in Syria. Sweden has also reiterated \u2013 a word designed to show no new concession has been made \u2013 that it will not provide support to what Turkey describes as the Fethullah terrorist organization (FETO), an entity the Turkish government perceives as a clandestine network led by the preacher Fethullah G\u00fclen. Nato also agreed to set up an anti-terrorist coordinator. More importantly, Swedish courts are getting tougher with Swedish Kurds who infringe the law. On the issue of F-16s, Turkey\u2019s national defence minister, Ya\u015far G\u00fcler, spoke by phone late on Monday with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin. In a glowing statement, the US defence department said the pair \u201clauded the long history of military cooperation between the United States and Turkey and applauded our continued close cooperation\u201d. It continued: \u201cThey also discussed the positive talks between Turkey, Sweden and Nato secretary general [Jens] Stoltenberg, as well as the [US] Department of Defense\u2019s support for Turkey\u2019s military modernisation.\u201d More importantly Bob Menendez, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee and a great friend of Greece, said he would decide within a week whether to lift his veto on the F-16s and remarked there had been a lull recently in Turkish belligerence towards Greece, and hoped this was \u201ca permanent reality\u201d. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, had been bending his ear to this effect, he revealed. The $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) deal, stalled since 2021, would include the sale of 40 jets as well as modernisation kits for 79 warplanes already in the Turkish air forces command\u2019s inventory. It\u2019s not clear that Erdo\u011fan made as much progress on the issue of Turkey\u2019s EU membership, but in reality the Turkish president probably knew that was a non-starter. It is more likely he is hankering after a renegotiated customs union agreement and visa-free travel. With the extreme right on the march in Spain, Germany, France, and Scandinavia, the political resistance to such deals will be near total. Charles Michel the European Council president diplomatically hailed a \u201cgood meeting\u201d with Erdo\u011fan, adding in a non-committal way that they had \u201cexplored opportunities ahead to bring EU-Turkey cooperation back to the forefront and re-energise our relations\u201d. Few in Nato warm to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s self-absorption and transactionalism, but distaste for his methods is insignificant given the prize. In Sweden too there will be rejoicing. A Pew Research Center survey of 24 countries released on Monday showed Sweden\u2019s attitude to Russia was in a class of its own. An astonishing 98% of people have a negative view of Russia, 78% have a favourable view of Nato while 92% have no confidence in Vladimir Putin\u2019s handling of world affairs. Little wonder that after a day of giddying negotiations with Erdo\u011fan, the relieved Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, had a celebratory drink in Vilnius late on Monday night."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f6a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/11/us-aid-policies-undermined-success-of-afghanistan-mission-says-watchdog-chief", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US aid policies undermined success of Afghanistan mission, says watchdog chief", "lead": "Poor oversight, lack of understanding and weak collaboration between allies contributed to ease of Taliban takeover, conclude US and UK aid bodies at London conference", "author": "Patrick Wintour, diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:11:05", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952346", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/afd8e045cca3cf0244813429fb77ebf5ea65aa7b/62_0_2938_1763/500.jpg", "body": "America\u2019s huge, badly-coordinated and politically-driven aid programme in Afghanistan engendered the corruption that undermined its entire mission and turned Afghans away from the western coalition, according to the head of a US aid watchdog. \u201cWe did not really understand Afghanistan or how it worked as a country,\u201d John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (Sigar), told a conference at the defence and security thinktank the Royal United Services Institute. \u201cWe sent so much money so quickly into so poor a country with so little oversight we were actually giving more money than the gross domestic product of Afghanistan for so many years,\u201d Sopko said. He said unrealistic timelines set by Washington and Brussels had \u201cled to a desire to show success\u201d. \u201cWe do not want to be honest and as a result we learned how to do the wrong thing perfectly by checking boxes. We focused on inputs but never looked at the outcomes,\u201d he said, giving the example of the US checking whether hospitals were built but not whether they were being used. Sopko was speaking on Monday at the conference in London, where UK and US aid watchdogs shared their perspectives on why the billions spent in Afghanistan had ended with the Taliban capturing the country so easily. Sir Hugh Bayley, a commissioner of the UK\u2019s Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai), said the west did not understand local traditions, culture or capacity. He said the UK parliament needed to end its \u201coptimism bias\u201d and demand the truth from aid workers on the ground. He revealed that UK diplomats had been advocating with the US for a different political approach from about 2015, but were unable to persuade the Americans to broaden the base of a centralised Pashtun-focused Afghan government. The UK officials were in favour of attempts to pull in people who were supportive of the Taliban but also tractable. \u201cThey regret that such steps were not taken when the UK was in a position of strength,\u201d he said. Conceding US dominance, Sir Hugh said one diplomat had admitted to him the UK \u201cdid not have the influence at strategic level that we sought\u201d. \u201cWe tolerated that because this was not the third world war, because we did not face an existential threat to western democracy and our independence,\u201d Sir Hugh said. \u201cThe implication was that if the UK had faced such a threat, the relationship between allies would have required a more collegiate system.\u201d Sir Hugh said the turnover of UK military, development staff and diplomats was too fast, meaning there was little institutional memory. \u201cInsufficient attention was paid to its locally recruited staff who spoke the languages, understood the culture and who were free to mix and mingle in the local community, and who were crucially there for a long time and had much better memories of what had been tried before.\u201d Nigel Thornton, a lead analyst at Icai, who has interviewed hundreds of former UK diplomats and aid workers in Afghanistan, said the UK\u2019s aid programme was intended to build a state in the service of security. He said the UK knows from decades of learning what an effective aid programme looks like, and it took until 2016 for the country to acknowledge that it would take decades for a viable state to be built, and this would require engagement with the Taliban to secure political legitimacy. \u201cIt is hard to build legitimacy with people when the government is kicking down their doors at night,\u201d he said. The UK prioritised the transatlantic relationship rather than challenge US priorities, he added. One lesson, he said, was to \u201cfail faster\u201d, look in the mirror, admit the unpalatable truths and be prepared to change quickly. The UN estimates that 28.8 million people in Afghanistan currently require humanitarian aid and is seeking $3.2bn to address the crisis this year."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f6b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/11/uk-two-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-moneyfacts", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK two-year fixed mortgage rates hit highest level since 2008", "lead": "Average rate rises to 6.66%, according to Moneyfacts, in more bad news for homeowners", "author": "Julia Kollewe and Larry Elliott", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:03:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952364", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6c0b6e93f8e9c79bb28b713cab88e6e348c0d344/20_18_2508_1506/500.jpg", "body": "Two-year fixed mortgage rates in the UK have risen to the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, adding to the pressure on homeowners.

It is the highest rate since 2008 \u2013 bad news for homeowners whose deals are coming to an end and who need to remortgage soon. It means they will be paying hundreds of pounds more each month. The rise takes the cost of two-year mortgages slightly above the peak of 6.65% reached last autumn, when the borrowing market was rocked by Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s disastrous mini-budget package of unfunded tax cuts. The average five-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 6.17% on Tuesday, the highest since last October, from 6.13% on Monday. Fixed-rate mortgages are priced off the yield, or interest rate, on UK government bonds. They hit their highest levels since the financial crisis last week as investors anticipated further increases in borrowing costs to fight inflation. The Bank of England unexpectedly raised its base rate by a half point to 5% at its June meeting as it battles high inflation. Financial markets have pencilled in a 70% chance of another half-point rise to 5.5% at the August meeting. Interest rates are expected to reach 6% by November and at least 6.25% by next spring. Hundreds of mortgage deals have been pulled from the market again as lenders rush to reprice products. Moneyfacts said there were fewer deals available \u2013 a total of 4,344 residential mortgage products, down from 4,631 on Monday. Savings rates have not risen as quickly as mortgage rates. The average rate on an easy access savings account was unchanged on Tuesday at 2.53%. Borrowers are paying the price for not fixing their mortgages for longer; for example, for the full term of the loan, which is more common in other countries such as Germany. There are few 25-year mortgages on the market, including Kensington\u2019s starting at 5.6%. The City regulator urged the UK\u2019s largest high street banks to \u201caccelerate\u201d savings rates after a meeting with chief executives last Thursday. They admitted they needed to do more to support consumers after claims they were \u201cprofiteering\u201d from high borrowing rates. High street banks and other mortgage lenders were questioned about the mortgage situation by MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday morning. Executives from Lloyds Banking Group, Santander UK, Skipton Building Society, Nationwide and Paragon Banking Group faced questions over what they are doing to help struggling households. Charlotte Harrison, of Skipton Building Society, said the lender had stress-tested customers against a higher interest rate environment. \u201cWhat I expect to see over the next six months is that we will see more customers with financial stress. But I expect that to be relative to the market. And I think there are options available to those customers as well,\u201d she said. The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that interest rates may need to rise further \u2013 and stay high for longer \u2013 in order for the Bank of England to win its battle against inflation. In its annual health check on the UK economy, the Washington-based IMF supported the decision by Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee to increase official borrowing costs by 0.5 percentage points to 5% last month. \u201cShould inflationary pressures show signs of further persistence, the policy rate may have to be raised further and would need to remain higher for longer to durably lower inflation and keep inflation expectations anchored,\u201d the IMF said."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f6c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/puffin-rock-and-the-new-friends-review-new-peril-in-beloved-cartoons-movie-spinoff", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Puffin Rock and the New Friends review \u2013 climate peril in beloved cartoon\u2019s movie spinoff ", "lead": "Known as one of the few cartoons that parents of pre-school kids can enjoy too, this is a tiny bit more grown up, but still a gorgeous, wholesome delight", "author": "Cath Clarke", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:00:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952383", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d4da6260f47fbef0e9b9d736a7407c14508f5565/325_0_3060_1837/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cIt\u2019s another glorious morning on Puffin Rock.\u201d For parents of small children, Chris O\u2019Dowd\u2019s voice at the beginning of Puffin Rock episodes has the effect of a bell sounding the start of meditation.

The state is the latest in the country to vote on legislation restricting reproductive rights after the overturning of Roe v Wade last year, which ended the nationwide constitutional right to abortion. Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, called for the special session last week, vowing to \u201ccontinue to fight against the inhumanity of abortion\u201d and calling the \u201cpro-life\u201d movement against reproductive rights \u201cthe most important human rights cause of our time\u201d. Lawmakers in the GOP-controlled legislature will debate House Study Bill 255, which was released on Friday and seeks to prohibit abortions at the first sign of cardiac activity except in certain cases such as rape or incest. Iowa\u2019s house, senate and governor\u2019s office are all Republican-controlled, and the bill faces few hurdles from being passed. Republicans in state legislatures nationwide have rolled back reproductive rights after the end of Roe, and have banned or severely limited abortions in more than a dozen states. A number of those states, such as Texas, Alabama and Mississippi, passed full abortion bans with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The bans, which powerful Christian conservative groups have supported, are in conflict with the views of the majority of Americans who numerous polls show are generally supportive of abortion access. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa survey from last year showed that about 61% of Iowans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Iowa\u2019s bill is similar to a 2018 state law, then the most restrictive in the nation, that banned abortions at about six weeks. The Iowa supreme court later deemed that law unconstitutional in 2019 and blocked it from coming into effect. The court decided last year, however, that abortion is not a constitutionally protected right in Iowa \u2013 a ruling that opened the door for lawmakers to restrict reproductive rights in the state. The special session on Tuesday is taking place after Reynolds failed in her attempt to have the Iowa supreme court remove the injunction against her 2018 six-week abortion ban and allow it to be enforced. The Iowa supreme court justice Thomas Waterman called the state\u2019s attempt to enact the law \u201can unprecedented effort to judicially revive a statute that was declared unconstitutional\u201d, and in his opinion last month referenced a previous ruling that made it illegal for police to search a suspect\u2019s garbage without a warrant. \u201cIt would be ironic and troubling for our court to become the first state supreme court in the nation to hold that trash set out in a garbage can for collection is entitled to more constitutional protection than a woman\u2019s interest in autonomy and dominion over her own body,\u201d Waterman wrote. The court was split 3-3 in its decision last month on reinstating the 2018 bill, resulting in a deadlock that meant a lower court\u2019s ruling blocking the ban remained in place."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f6e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/11/north-carolina-man-arrest-shot-horse-animal-cruelty", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "North Carolina \u2018horseman of the year\u2019 charged over claims he shot son\u2019s horse", "lead": "John Victor Russell, 75, was charged with two felony counts, including cruelty to animals", "author": "Adam Gabbatt", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 12:00:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952419", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/103d7edb918046d27211514c4b0c8c65181c1521/0_1249_3209_1926/500.jpg", "body": "A North Carolina \u201chorseman of the year\u201d has been arrested after he allegedly shot his son\u2019s horse dead during an argument.

The shooting came a month after he was recognized for his services to horses during a ceremony in Tryon, North Carolina. Russell was arrested at his home near Columbus, North Carolina, on 5 July, WYFF reported, after sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to reports of a fight involving gunfire. \u201cWhen deputies arrived, they found several people on the property and determined that a dispute happened between Russell and his son, resulting in gunfire and the death of a horse that the son had been riding,\u201d John J Suave, Polk county sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson, told WYFF. The Chronicle of the Horse, a horse news website, reported that Russell has been charged with felony cruelty to animals and assault on a person with a deadly weapon with intent to kill. Russell was described as a \u201clegendary horse trainer\u201d by WYFF. The news outlet reported that the Russell family is well known in the Tryon area \u201cwith an equestrian legacy of horse training in the community\u201d.

The papers submitted by Trump\u2019s lawyers in response to the US justice department\u2019s motion to hold the trial this December made clear the former president\u2019s aim to delay proceedings as their guiding strategy \u2013 the case may be dropped if Trump wins the election. Trump\u2019s lawyers essentially argued in the 12-page court filing to US district court judge Aileen Cannon in Florida that she should not bother setting a tentative trial date until the major pre-trial motions were finished because they could not know how long the discovery process might take. \u201cThe court should, respectfully, before establishing any trial date, allow time for development of further clarity as to the full nature and scope of the motions that will be filed,\u201d the filing said. Trump was charged with retention of national defense information, including US nuclear secrets and plans for US retaliation in the event of an attack, which means his case will be tried under the rules laid out in the Classified Information Procedures Act, or Cipa. Cipa provides a mechanism for the government to charge cases involving classified documents without risking the \u201cgraymail\u201d problem, where the defense threatens to reveal classified information at trial, but the steps that have to be followed mean it takes longer to get to trial. The process includes the government turning over all of the classified information they want to use to the defense in discovery, like any other criminal case, in addition to the non-classified discovery that is done in a separate process. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued the amount of discovery \u2013 the government is making the material available in batches because there is so much evidence and it has not finished processing everything that came from search warrants \u2013 meant that they could not know how long the process would take. \u201cFrom a practical manner, the volume of discovery and the Cipa logistics alone make plain that the government\u2019s requested schedule is unrealistic,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. The filing also complained that the justice department\u2019s proposed December trial date did not reflect precedent, such as with former NSA analyst Reality Winner, who was charged with retaining national defense information in June 2017 and only went to trial in October 2018. In arguing against the December trial date, Trump\u2019s lawyers suggested there would be challenges in selecting a jury ahead of the 2024 election, for which Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, and so the trial should wait until after it was over. The response from Trump\u2019s lawyers did not address why the judge, instead of proceeding with no schedule whatsoever, could not at least draw up a tentative schedule that lays out in broad terms how the pre-trial process for classified and non-classified materials should work, as is typical. Although time-consuming, Cipa in some ways is straightforward, and the statute outlines that the judge should establish a timetable for the classified discovery at the very start of the process, at a \u201cSection 2 hearing\u201d, which all parties agreed on Monday could take place on 18 July."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f70", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/11/former-student-jailed-plotting-blow-up-newcastle-police-station-luke-skelton", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man, 20, who wanted race war jailed for Newcastle police station bomb plot", "lead": "Luke Skelton was 17 when he began planning attack as part of his desire for a \u2018full-on\u2019 race war", "author": "Mark Brown North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 11:58:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952458", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/22f28862e4711f4b4e2eb6e15208e3098d028070/0_38_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "A former college student with extreme rightwing views who plotted to blow up a police station as part of his desire for a \u201cfull-on\u201d race war has been jailed for four years. Luke Skelton was 17 when he first started posting extreme views and making preparations to bomb a police station in Newcastle upon Tyne. Now 20, he was jailed on Tuesday by a judge who said Skelton was engaged in a course of conduct \u201cbased on the extreme rightwing views which you then held in order to bring about civil disturbance and unrest by terrorist means\u201d. A trial heard that Skelton researched napalm, molotov cocktails and how to make explosives on the internet. Judge Paul Watson KC, the recorder of Middlesbrough, said evidence showed Skelton was \u201ca committed and active rightwing extremist\u201d who was dedicated to white supremacy and promoting racial hatred. Skelton was obsessed with nazism and \u201cmade heroes out of those who carry out atrocities in the name of fascism and other extreme rightwing ideologies\u201d. The trial at Teesside crown court heard evidence that Skelton posted online views that were racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, antisemitic and Islamophobic. \u201cYour fantasy was to turn back the pages of history books to times when such xenophobic and hateful views were tolerated and even admired,\u201d the judge said. Skelton, then a student at Gateshead college, travelled from his home in Washington, Tyne and Wear, to Newcastle to take photographs and carry out reconnaissance on his target, the Forth Banks police station. \u201cYour objective was to cause explosions to provoke what you saw as a coming race war,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThis was no spur of the moment or impulsive conduct.\u201d The court heard submissions that there was never any chance of Skelton, who has autism spectrum disorder and a low IQ, being capable of carrying out his intention to blow up a police station. Anti-terror officers first arrested Skelton in June 2021, leading him to change his username for an online group to \u201cAdolf Hitler\u201d \u2013 \u201cso the police don\u2019t suspect me\u201d, he told Discord users. His barrister, Crispin Aylett KC, said medical reports showed his client\u2019s autism, isolation and possible depressed mood could all affect his behaviour. Much of what Skelton said online was clearly nonsense, he added. Aylett said the behaviour all took place during the Covid pandemic, a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for young people who lost two years of their lives. The judge gave Skelton a five-year sentence, with four years in custody and an extended licence of one year for the terror plot."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f71", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/11/birmingham-stabbings-2020-zephaniah-mcleod-report", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Report finds failings over ex-prisoner who stabbed eight in Birmingham", "lead": "Zephaniah McLeod was not appropriately treated and medicated for his mental illness, report says", "author": "Jessica Murray Midlands correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 11:52:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952477", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c50fbb14884627b34b589040245f1192ed98e262/0_67_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "A man who stabbed eight people in a series of unprovoked attacks was released from prison months earlier with no restrictions or supervision despite experiencing delusions, refusing to take medication and having made weapons in his cell, a report has found. Zephaniah McLeod, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, stabbed eight people during a late-night rampage in Birmingham city centre in September 2020, killing 23-year-old Jacob Billington who was walking back from a night out. His best friend, Michael Callaghan, was stabbed in the neck and had a stroke that left him partially paralysed, and three others also received serious injuries. An independent report published on Tuesdayon how mental health services, police, probation and prison services managed McLeod has concluded he \u201cwas not appropriately treated and medicated [for his mental illness] from 2011 to 2020\u201d, during which time he was mainly in prison or released on licence. \u201cHe did not engage with mental health services in prison or in the community\u201d and would only take medication \u201cfor a matter of days\u201d, the report says. \u201cWe observed more care plans relating to the management of [McLeod\u2019s] asthma while in prison than his mental health problems.\u201d In the months leading up to his release, McLeod reported paranoia, frequently got into fights with inmates and prison staff, and was found to have a sharpened toilet brush in his cell, but he was seen by a psychiatrist only once in his final six months in prison. When he was released in April 2020, during the height of the Covid pandemic, \u201cservices did not know where he had gone\u201d until he sought help for his mental health in Birmingham months later. He had not seen a probation officer in person since 2018. The report, commissioned by NHS England and compiled by a team of mental health and prison specialists, makes recommendations including a serious case review, better resourcing of the NHS-run mental health team at HMP Parc in south Wales, where McLeod was imprisoned in the months before his release, and a review of the prison release service at Birmingham and Solihull mental health foundation trust. Billington\u2019s mother, Jo, criticised the recommendations as \u201cweak\u201d and said they \u201cfail to get to the heart of what went wrong here\u201d. She said: \u201cThe report catalogues a massive amount of astonishing failings and incompetence. It speaks to a terrifying lack of concern, or even interest in how dangerous this man was. \u201cWe are told about \u2018missed opportunities\u2019. These are not missed opportunities, these are people not doing their job, these are procedures not being followed and a catastrophic lack of professional standards, leading to a young man losing his life.\u201d A week before his release, McLeod refused to attend a psychiatric appointment, and staff reported he was \u201cnot taking his medication, not coming out of his cell, lying in bed with a blanket over his head\u201d. Probation services claimed they believed McLeod had moved to the Wrexham area on release as he said he wanted to escape the \u201cgang culture\u201d of Birmingham, although the prison had provided him with a travel ticket to Birmingham. He was seen by the community mental health team at his home 48 hours before the stabbings and admitted to hearing voices, but refused to attend an appointment with a psychiatrist later that day, and one was rescheduled for later that month. The report details McLeod\u2019s long history of criminality, starting with arrests from the age of 14, and in 2011 he was sent to a young offender institution after a series of robberies in which he snatched gold chains from women\u2019s necks in the street. In April 2017 he was sentenced to 36 months in prison for drugs and firearms offences. He was released on licence to supported accommodation in November 2018 but was recalled to prison eight weeks later for breaching conditions. The report concludes that McLeod\u2019s \u201cuntreated schizophrenia contributed to his chaotic behaviour in the community\u201d during this time, and there was a \u201clack of professional curiosity\u201d from hostel staff over incidents such as his report of getting into a fight at a bus stop with a group of men he claimed were talking about him. \u201cThis could have been an early warning sign of a deterioration in his mental health,\u201d the report says. Weeks earlier, he had told prison mental health staff that he was \u201chearing voices, both male and female, telling him to \u2018kill \u2018em \u2026 stab \u2018em \u2026 they are talking about you\u2019.\u201d In October 2019, McLeod was deregistered from a multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) service, designed to manage violent and sexual offenders, due to his failure to engage with staff. The report concludes there was \u201cno evidence to indicate [McLeod\u2019s] risk of harm had reduced sufficiently or that his case no longer required multi-agency involvement\u201d."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f72", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/11/hans-peter-feldmann-obituary", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hans-Peter Feldmann obituary", "lead": "Artist who explored the impulse to collect \u2013 whether stamps, pots of fake flowers, images of women\u2019s knees or photographs of toast", "author": "Oliver Basciano", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 11:51:54", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952496", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/151c90bbd7e0a40106f15288d9935aa73a359b5a/29_0_4519_2712/500.jpg", "body": "For a decade Hans-Peter Feldmann, who has died aged 82, dropped out of the art world and turned to dealing in antiques: mostly selling tin toys and nautical and medical instruments from a small shop in D\u00fcsseldorf. In a way, however, nothing had changed, as Feldman\u2019s art was always about collecting, be it his taxonomical arrangements of found images, his vitrine installations of objects ranging from the slightly creepy (the contents of women\u2019s handbags), or the geeky (stamps). In 2012, for the artist\u2019s solo exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London, Feldmann persuaded six women to sell him the complete contents of their handbags for \u20ac500; the assortment of keys, business cards, sunglasses, notebooks, receipts, comfortable shoes, sanitary products and makeup were displayed in museological fashion. Likewise, Stamps with Paintings and Passepartouts (2016), featured long shelves of card-mounted postage stamps from various countries and times, all featuring historical paintings of nudes, mostly female. Feldmann exhibited piles of hats, pots of fake flowers, photographs of toast, boxes of Milky Way chocolate bars, shelves of ordinary cardboard boxes. In 2017 at the Imperial War Museum he plastered a gallery with hundreds of international newspaper front pages from the day after 9/11. Not all his work featured numerous elements: he exhibited individual photographic and painted portraits, but which he had interfered with, often cutting out the face of the sitter or altering their eyes into a squint. When critics tried to link his work to the Pictures generation, including artists such as Richard Prince and Cindy Sherman, who in the 1970s were making a commentary on media saturation, or to appropriation art, a style seen as a successor to Marcel Duchamp\u2019s readymades, Feldmann rejected such conceptualisation. \u201cI have always made very concrete things, whereas conceptual art is only an idea \u2026 to me, art is something real, something you need a hammer to do,\u201d he said in a rare interview at the time of his 2010 Malm\u00f6 Konsthall show. \u201cYou go and look at the works, and either you feel something, or you don\u2019t.\u201d Born in D\u00fcsseldorf, Feldmann always refused to give any further biographical information. His father ran a chemist and his \u201cparents were poor so they didn\u2019t have any money to collect anything\u201d, but the job \u201cnecessitated a lot of correspondence, invoices etc, which meant I had ready access to different stamps. It was quite an expansive collection compared to that of my friends.\u201d From the age of five he began to keep scrapbooks of pictures gleaned from magazines and books, carefully cut out. The memory of this, and of his philately, came back to him after he had enrolled at the University of Arts and Industrial Design Linz in Austria and discovered he was not good at painting or drawing. Instead, he started to make little booklets, around 30 in total, compiled between 1968 and 1971 and all titled Bild or Bilder (Picture or Pictures). One featured 11 images of women\u2019s knees, while another a dozen prosaic photographs of aeroplanes. In 1972 he was invited to show them at Documenta 5 in Kassel. Two years later, in advance of one of Feldmann\u2019s earliest commercial exhibitions, Galerie Paul Maenz in Cologne mailed everyone on its contact list a set of postcards by the artist, over the course of a year, each featuring a found image (among them a horse, a romantic couple) and a caption bearing the month. It was, he said, an anti-consumerist gesture, as each recipient only received 11 of the postcards, rendering every collection incomplete. In 1977, having had institutional exhibitions at Kunstverein M\u00fcnchen and Museum Folkwang in Essen, he was invited again to show at Documenta, exhibiting Sunday Pictures, an arrangement of found posters of the period. Another museum show followed in Zurich in 1979, but by this time Feldmann had had enough. \u201cI always made a living from things other than art,\u201d he explained of his break. \u201cArt is a natural function, like coughing, like breathing. You do it to heal yourself.\u201d The remedy this time, however, was to destroy all the work still in his possession and turn down any exhibition invitations that might be forthcoming. In 1979 he opened a curiosity shop in D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s old town. Among the collectables on sale were thimbles, and these soon proved to be his best sellers. He started to search out more sets and produced a monthly mail order catalogue, all the photographs hand-glued to the pages, sent to enthusiasts internationally. \u201cThey were selling like hell, there were so many thimble collectors in the world at that time,\u201d he recalled. Despite this success, in 1989 the curator Kasper K\u00f6nig persuaded him to come back to art with the offer of a show at Portikus, Frankfurt, though Feldmann maintained the shop for a further three decades. The frequency of the invitations to show in museums and galleries increased. Nonetheless, ever keen on absurd gestures, in 1990 when the then 23-year-old Hans Ulrich Obrist asked him to contribute to an exhibition he was staging in his kitchen, Feldmann made an even smaller show of images inside the curator\u2019s fridge. Two years later Feldmann had his first US survey exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. He had a retrospective of his work at Museum Ludwig in Cologne in 2003, and a show at the Arnolfini, Bristol, in 2007. He returned to the Guggenheim in 2011 having won the $10,000 Hugo Boss prize the previous year, withdrawing the prize fund as one dollar bills which he then exhibited at the museum. He is survived by his wife, Ursula. \u2022 Hans-Peter Feldmann, artist, born 17 January 1941; died 26 May 2023"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f73", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/11/anger-and-recrimination-as-nigerias-world-cup-preparations-unravel", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Moving The Goalposts | Anger and accusations as Nigeria\u2019s World Cup preparations unravel", "lead": "Coach Randy Waldrum has accused the Nigerian federation of failing to pay wages, while players have threatened a boycott", "author": "Osasu Obayiuwana", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 11:37:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952515", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2f5b44cf69550ee4f6f083c713d059a02a08d815/62_342_5734_3440/500.jpg", "body": "Randy Waldrum, the head coach of Nigeria\u2019s Super Falcons, ought to be looking forward to leading the nine-time African champions \u2013 the most successful national team on the continent \u2013 to their World Cup opener against the Olympic champions, Canada, at Melbourne\u2019s Rectangular Stadium on 21 July. The American has never hidden the fact that leading a team to a World Cup finals, for the first time as a coach will be a career high point. In contrast, Nigeria are a staple at the World Cup, with the Falcons qualifying for every tournament since the inaugural 1991 edition in China and reaching the quarter-finals at the 1999 tournament in the United States. But the Nigerian camp is not a happy one at the moment. The 66-year-old Waldrum, from Irving, Texas, is in open dispute with the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF). \u201cWhat keeps me going are the players. Otherwise, I would have quit this job long ago,\u201d Waldrum said in an explosive interview with the On The Whistle podcast. \u201cUp until about three weeks ago, I had been owed about 14 months\u2019 salary. And then they paid seven months\u2019 salary. We still have players that haven\u2019t been paid since two years ago, when we played the summer series in the USA. It\u2019s a travesty. \u201cIn the two and a half years that I have been here [in Nigeria], I have never had one time that the Federation came to me and asked: \u2018What do you need, coach?\u2019 I\u2019m not going to be quiet any more \u2026 in October, every country was given $960,000 from Fifa to prepare for the World Cup. Where is that money?\u201d Ademola Olajire, the NFF\u2019s communications director, in a vitriolic response to the journalist Samuel Ahmadu, called Waldrum a \u201cblabbermouth\u201d and the \u201cworst Super Falcons coach in history\u201d. \u201cEveryone knows Fifa pays preparation money for every team going to the Women\u2019s World Cup. The team travelled to Japan to play matches, travelled to Mexico for a tournament and travelled to Turkey to play matches,\u201d Olajire said. \u201cThe team is presently having a training camp in the Gold Coast ahead of the World Cup. Is it \u2018Mr Blabbermouth\u2019 Waldrum who has been paying? He claims he\u2019s been at the job because of the players. Bollocks. His entire objective has always been to add leading a team at the World Cup to his CV. [He is the] worst coach to have handled the Super Falcons of Nigeria, by a country mile.\u201d And as if this is not enough, the players are threatening to boycott World Cup matches should the NFF not adhere to an agreement to give the players 30% of the tournament revenue it gets from Fifa, which the NFF says it will no longer pay, since Fifa is paying each World Cup player a minimum of $30,000 for participating in the group stages, up to a maximum of $270,000 per World Cup winner. Amid this chaos, it is easy to forget that Nigeria have a collection of top-level players with the talent to compete against the world\u2019s best, if they are well-coached and have the requisite administrative support. A squad featuring the Paris FC goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s attacking midfielder Rasheedat Ajibade, the forward Desire Oparanozie, who is with Wuhan in the Chinese Super League, as well as the irrepressible Asisat Oshoala, who recently won the Uefa Champions League with Barcelona, are certainly not cannon fodder. But can they pull victory out of the jaws of disaster and rise above the organisational and administrative chaos that threatens to turn Africa\u2019s most consistent World Cup performers into a spectacle for all the wrong reasons? The group stages, in which they will also play the hosts, Australia, and Ireland, will provide the answers soon enough.

Where dramas such as Red Pitch and Dear England focus on football, Bones revolves around rugby. Ed (Ronan Cullen) is a star player, but off the field is silently struggling with anxiety and grief. Laddish banter and drinking bonds him with teammates Charlie (Samuel Hoult), Will (Ainsley Fannen) and Ollie (James Mackay) but also leaves him emotionally marooned. Under Daniel Blake\u2019s direction, the production effectively dramatises the adrenaline charge of the sport and its physical dangers. Staged just short of a rugby match at 70 minutes, there are artful scenes in which characters run across AstroTurf while Eliza Willmott\u2019s excellent sound design sets their movement against drum\u2019n\u2019bass and electronica. This conveys the brute energy of the sport, with scrum formations and men charging into each other. But as important as its subject matter is, especially given high male suicide rates in recent years, Lewis Aaron Wood\u2019s script doesn\u2019t quite fly. Characters are flimsy, and the choreography brings pace and visual effects but gets in the way of the story\u2019s development. The main plotline involves Ed\u2019s apparently broken leg. He says he fell down the stairs but Charlie suspects he is lying and tells the team, which seems clunky and unconvincing given they are best friends. A physiotherapist (Mackay, doubling up) gives Ed a mental health assessment but this part of the story goes nowhere. Ed\u2019s father (also Mackay) occasionally appears, but is shadowy. We are let into Ed\u2019s mind during matches \u2013 he describes how he feels while playing a game, and there are tiny, tantalising emotional insights in these moments, such as the fact that he wished to be injured as a child in order to get more attention. Some of the performances are halting or wooden, so we do not believe in the connections between these characters. No one in the play feels known to us, and you end up wishing for more substance to match the production\u2019s ample style.

When First Bus announced on Monday that it was withdrawing its weekend night bus services across Scotland\u2019s biggest city from the end of July it resulted in an overnight backlash. First Bus argued that the service was no longer viable because of low passenger numbers, which have failed to bounce back since the pandemic despite promotions such as free tickets over the festive season. But Mike Grieve, head of the Night Time Industries Association Scotland, described the decision as \u201cshortsighted and dangerous, showing no consideration for the safety of thousands of night workers and customers coming home in the early hours of the morning\u201d. The Scottish Labour MSP for Glasgow region, Pam Duncan-Glancy, wrote directly to First Bus accusing the company of \u201ca dangerous dereliction of responsibility to the people of Glasgow who will no longer have a night service to get them home safe\u201d. Peter Kelly, the director of the Poverty Alliance, said stopping the night service was \u201ccompletely unjust and will hit Glaswegians on low incomes the hardest \u2013 people who work nightshifts and early shifts in the kind of jobs that are already undervalued\u201d. With the city\u2019s subway and train network shutting down by midnight, the night bus is the only option for many people trying to get home after shift work or a night out in the early hours of the morning. The city has also suffered a significant reduction in taxis with many quitting the business since lockdown, while the council\u2019s new low emission zone restricts the type of vehicles that can drive into the city centre. Graeme Macfarlan, the commercial director at First Bus Scotland, said it had become clear that because of changes in the public\u2019s leisure habits there was \u201cnot enough appetite in Glasgow for night bus services to successfully operate into the early hours\u201d. Macfarlan added that the company had been \u201cdelighted\u201d to reintroduce the night bus network last June but had been absorbing operating losses for the last 12 months. \u201cDespite a wide variety of efforts by First Glasgow and partner organisations to increase the number of people using the night buses, it has not reached the level required to sustain these services beyond July.\u201d Ellie Harrison of the public transport campaign Get Glasgow Moving said that the decision highlighted wider problems with the city\u2019s transport infrastructure. \u201cWe want Glasgow to follow the example of Greater Manchester by re-regulating its transport system and coordinating bus routes to integrate with the subway and trains. Profit-driven bus companies only want to run at busy times and in busy places, which means that people can\u2019t plan their lives around public transport.\u201d She said current green targets would require much more comprehensive changes, adding: \u201cWith the Scottish government wanting to reduce car miles by 20% by 2030 and Glasgow city council wanting to be net zero by 2030 I don\u2019t think anyone comprehends the scale of transformation required.\u201d The city council and Strathclyde Transport Partnership have expressed concerns about the announcement and the council has said it was meeting First Bus to discuss the situation, although the Guardian understands this is part of ongoing talks on the matter between the company and the council. A spokesperson for Glasgow city council said: \u201cWe do understand the commercial operators who provide public bus services are facing significant challenges but the decision highlights again the need to look at alternative ways of running bus services in Glasgow.\u201d \u201cMore broadly, we will continue to work with public transport operators to support improvements to bus services in Glasgow. We are also working with partners to explore the medium-to-longer term options for greater public control of the city\u2019s bus network that could allow us to set routes, fares and timetables.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f76", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/morrissey-jet2holidays-marine-parks-orcas-dolphins", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Morrissey: Jet2holidays must cut ties to marine parks over orcas and dolphins", "lead": "Former Smiths frontman criticises holiday firm for selling tickets for Tenerife zoo that offers animal shows", "author": "Joe Middleton", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 11:08:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952573", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3456218d1b312ecd532a287fee6a0dbb9ef98b6b/0_123_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "Morrissey has written to Jet2holidays urging the tour operator to drop its association with marine parks that continue to use captive orcas and dolphins for entertainment. In a letter to the Jet2 chief executive, Steve Heapy, the former frontman of the Smiths said the mammals belonged in the open ocean where they could find food and socialise, which they could not do if they were in \u201ca cramped, concrete tank\u201d. He said the \u201cunnatural conditions\u201d took a toll on the animals, and he pointed to the number of premature orca deaths in recent years at Loro Parque, a zoo in Tenerife that featured in the 2013 documentary Blackfish. At the zoo, which Jet2holidays sells tickets for and promotes on its website, an orca called Skyla died in March 2021 aged 17, followed by Ula weeks later aged two, and Kohana who died in September 2022 aged 20. Morrissey also addressed the \u201cbleak\u201d situation of bottlenose dolphins, which he claimed were \u201ccrammed together at the marine park in a tank that\u2019s smaller than the car park\u201d. He wrote: \u201cDay in and day out, these animals can do little else but swim in endless circles. They\u2019re even forced to perform demeaning tricks in exchange for food. Anyone who thinks that\u2019s entertainment needs to get their head checked. And anyone who profits from this abuse should be ashamed.\u201d Morrissey is performing at the Sounds of City concert series on Wednesday in Leeds, where Jet2 is based, and said he would like to meet Heapy to discuss the issue. He said: \u201cBetter yet, I hope I can tell my audience that Jet2holidays is no longer associated with cruel marine parks.\u201d A petition organised by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) urging Jet2Holidays to cut ties with marine parks has been signed by almost 40,000 people. The animal rights charity describes the facilities as \u201cmarine abusement parks that hold animals captive for decades in cramped tanks with chemically treated water\u201d. The holiday firm offers customers the opportunity to buy tickets for excursions at marine mammal theme parks such as Loro Parque when booking a holiday. It is one of the last remaining travel providers to do this after similar firms such as Thomas Cook, Virgin Holidays and British Airways Holidays, stopped the practice. There has been a public backlash against keeping killer whales and dolphins in captivity after the release of Blackfish. The film argues that orcas are highly intelligent, social animals whose behaviour becomes warped in captivity, leading to psychosis and aggression towards humans. It focuses primarily on the traumatic life of an orca called Tilikum and thedeath of his trainer Dawn Brancheau at Seaworld Orlando in February 2010. Alexis Martinez, a trainer at Loro Parque, also features in the film and dies after a training session with an orca in December 2009. SeaWorld pledged to stop breeding whales in captivity in March 2016. Tilikum, who was involved in the deaths of three people, died in January 2017, aged 36, after spending 24 years in captivity at SeaWorld Orlando. Loro Parque\u2019s orca expert said that in a \u201cwell managed\u201d marine park the activities of whales were \u201ccarefully curated to promote their physical and mental wellbeing, while also providing educational and entertainment value for human observers\u201d. They said the marine park had been \u201cextremely transparent\u201d about the \u201cunexpected\u201d deaths of Skyla, Kohana and Ula. The expert said the marine park conducted an investigation using independent vets and pathologists that concluded \u201cthe causes of death were unrelated to the animals being in a marine park\u201d.

The Guardian has not been able to independently verify all of the claims, while the BBC said some details had been omitted to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. \u2022 18 May: The complainant (a family member) attended a BBC building, where they sought to make a complaint about the behaviour of a BBC presenter. \u2022 19 May: The complainant contacted BBC audience services; the details of this contact were referred to the BBC\u2019s corporate investigations team. The corporate investigations team assessed the information contained in the complaint provided by audience services. The assessment made was that on the basis of the information provided it did not include an allegation of criminality, but nonetheless merited further investigation. On the same day, the corporate investigations team emailed the complainant stating how seriously the BBC took the issue and seeking additional information to verify the claims being made; there was no response to this contact. Checks were also made to verify the identity of the complainant. This is a standard procedure to confirm that the complainant is the person they say they are. \u2022 6 June: Having received no response to the email referenced above, a phone call was made to the mobile number provided by the complainant to the BBC\u2019s corporate investigations team; this call did not connect. After these attempts to make contact with the complainant, the corporate investigations team were due to return to the matter in the coming weeks. No additional attempts to contact the complainant were made after 6 June; however, the case remained open throughout. \u2022 6 July: The Sun newspaper informed the BBC, via the corporate press office, of allegations concerning a BBC presenter; it became clear that the source of the claims was from the same family that approached the BBC on 18 and 19 May. This was the first time that the director-general or any executive directors at the BBC were aware of the case. The claims made by the Sun contained new allegations, that were different to the matters being considered by corporate investigations. The BBC initiated an incident management group to lead the response to the case, involving senior BBC executives including the director-general. The acting chair was updated, and the board was regularly updated in the coming days. The same day, a senior manager held the first conversation on this matter with the presenter concerned, to make him aware of the claims being outlined by the Sun. It was agreed that the presenter would not be on air while the matter was being considered. \u2022 7 July: After the Sun\u2019s contact, the corporate investigations team contacted the complainant again, who was in touch with the BBC\u2019s investigators. The BBC\u2019s serious case management framework (SCMF) was initiated and the investigation being undertaken by the corporate investigations team was brought into the SCMF, which is chaired by a human resources director. The BBC also made contact with the police with regard to this matter. \u2022 8-9 July: The complainant sent the BBC some materials related to the complaint. The BBC issued an update to staff and the media; the broadcaster also confirmed that it had suspended the presenter. \u2022 10 July: The BBC met with the police, to report the matter and discuss how to progress the investigation. The police have requested that the BBC pause its investigations into the allegations while they scope future work."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f78", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/11/california-historic-reparations-black-residents", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": " California faces backlash as it weighs historic reparations for Black residents", "lead": "The state has become the focus of the nation\u2019s divisive reparations conversation as it advances its reparations efforts", "author": "Sonya Singh", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 11:00:33", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952609", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/93a3425dbe6554cf1140c416879c132fed7c7a1b/0_335_5063_3040/500.jpg", "body": "As California considers implementing large-scale reparations for Black residents affected by the legacy of slavery, the state has also become the focus of the nation\u2019s divisive reparations conversation, drawing the backlash of conservatives criticizing the priorities of a \u201cliberal\u201d state. \u201cReparations for Slavery? California\u2019s Bad Idea Catches On,\u201d commentator Jason L Riley wrote in the Wall Street Journal, as New York approved a commission to study the idea. In the Washington Post, conservative columnist George F Will said the state\u2019s debate around reparations adds to a \u201cplague of solemn silliness\u201d. Roughly two-thirds of Americans oppose the idea of reparations, according to 2021 polling from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and 2022 polling from the Pew Research Center. Both found that more than 80% Black respondents support some kind of compensation for the descendants of slaves, while a similar majority of white respondents opposed. Pew found that roughly two-thirds of Hispanics and Asian Americans opposed, as well. But in California, there\u2019s greater support. Both the state\u2019s Reparations Task Force \u2013 which released its 1,100-page final report and recommendations to the public on 29 June \u2013 and a University of California, Los Angeles study found that roughly two-thirds of Californians are in favor of some form of reparations, though residents are divided on what they should be. When delving into the reasons why people resist, Tatishe Nteta, who directed the UMass poll, expected feasibility or the challenges of implementing large programs to top the list, but this wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cWhen we ask people why they oppose, it\u2019s not about the cost. It\u2019s not about logistics. It\u2019s not about the impossibility to place a monetary value on the impact of slavery,\u201d said Nteta, provost professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \u201cIt is consistently this notion that the descendants of slaves do not deserve these types of reparations.\u201d In California, notions of deservedness may be tied to a commonly referenced facet of the state\u2019s identity \u2013 that it joined the union as a free state in 1850. \u201cThe fact that supposedly serious people in San Francisco are considering a plan that would give $5,000,000 in reparations to every Black resident in their city in a state that never had slavery is a joke,\u201d Republican representative Lauren Boebert tweeted in March. On Newsmax, Michael Reagan \u2013 son of President Ronald Reagan, who signed the 1988 bill apologizing and giving reparations to Japanese Americans for their imprisonment during the second world war \u2013 called reparations a \u201ccash grab\u201d and a \u201cscam\u201d that will force non-Black residents to \u201cinclude the state in their will\u201d. \u201cNo one should be taking this seriously at all. This is hilarious,\u201d Fox News host Greg Gutfeld said of San Francisco\u2019s proposal on The Five. \u201cThey don\u2019t want this. What they want is to divide people, to create another commotion over race \u2026 White leftists do worse things to Blacks than the Aryan Nations ever could.\u201d Under the Fox clip online, a comment with nearly 700 likes reads: \u201cA state that never ALLOWED slaves wants to take billions of dollars from people who never OWNED slaves to give to people who never WERE slaves. Welcome to California.\u201d But the state\u2019s history is more complicated, said A Kirsten Mullen, co-author of From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the 21st Century with William A Darity Jr, professor of public policy, African and African American studies and economics at Duke University. Both she and Darity \u2013 who is also her husband \u2013 are members of the expert team appointed by the task force. Even though the state constitution banned slavery, Mullen said, the Fugitive Slave Law allowed slaveholders to use violent measures to return enslaved people who entered California before its statehood. Many Confederates traveled west, too: brothers John and Joseph Le Conte, for example, became prominent early faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. John Le Conte, a physicist who espoused white supremacy, served as its first acting president. The task force\u2019s final report, which follows last year\u2019s 500-page interim report, lays out the state\u2019s role in detail, from how enslaved people were brought to California during the Gold Rush to how prevalent KKK members were among city officials. It also looked beyond slavery to the harms and ancillary effects of other forms of racism, such as housing segregation, unequal education, medical experimentation and sterilization, mass incarceration and greater risk of death from Covid-19. \u201cCalifornia, though it has this reputation, it\u2019s not necessarily well deserved for being a more liberal place,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cUltimately, what [the people of that time] learned was there was no place where Black people were treated with respect and had equality.\u201d That history left a stark economic divide. For every dollar that white families earn today, Black families earn 60 cents, according to a report from the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan thinktank. \u201cThe racial wealth gap is a premier indicator of the cumulative effects of intergenerational racism in this country,\u201d Mullen said. Those who oppose reparations for the wrongs of centuries past may not think modern recipients deserve compensation, Nteta said, but they also don\u2019t think they deserve to be the ones responsible for compensation. \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\u201d Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, whose ancestry includes slave owners, told reporters in 2019. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a civil war, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We\u2019ve elected an African American president.\u201d In recent research that he plans to investigate further, Nteta and his team found greater support for a range of reparations for victims of Jim Crow policies \u2013 many of those harmed are alive today, and so are their children. This recency is also likely a part of why the Civil Liberties Act, which offered $20,000, an official apology and other redress to Japanese Americans incarcerated during the second world war, saw success, Nteta said. It was co-sponsored by Congressman Norman Mineta, the nation\u2019s first Asian American cabinet member, who was incarcerated with his family as a boy. While the legislation encountered its own hurdles, it eventually saw enough bipartisan support to make it to the desk of a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, who signed the bill in 1988. In California, Mullen and the economists on the expert team were tasked with determining dollar figures for specific harms. The preliminary projection to address housing discrimination, for example, estimated up to $148,099 per Black resident, or $3,366 for each year in California from 1933-1977, the height of redlining practices. The estimate to address these harms could exceed $800bn, more than 2.5 times the state\u2019s budget of $300bn. Restitution over time could take a variety of forms, such as cash payments, community investments, tuition assistance and housing grants, like the city of Evanston, Illinois, introduced in 2019. Cash payments are less popular than other types of compensation in the UMass polling data, and California governor Gavin Newsom has not endorsed the idea of large cash payments. For many in the reparations movement, Nteta said, the larger conversation goes beyond the payments themselves. \u201cThis is about recognizing one of the nation\u2019s original sins, and the nation as a collective entity atoning for that and doing so substantively,\u201d Nteta said. But backlash against progress towards racial equality is nothing new. Mullen said this is the human response to change, particularly when any majority\u2019s station is challenged. It happened when newly emancipated Black people were denied 40-acre land grants, when the black codes restricted their rights following the end of the civil war, through Jim Crow and beyond. Historically, she said, punishments also extended to white allies who aided Black people. \u201cThere are still lots of ways that folks are protecting their hegemony,\u201d Mullen said. What is new is the pervasiveness of discussion. She credits this to the expanded availability of information \u2013 documentation of more than 100 massacres between Reconstruction and the end of the second world war, online archives of Black newspapers, databases through the Library of Congress and more. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to read it, to learn it without at least having to question what you\u2019ve been taught, what you\u2019ve read, and wonder what the implications are,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cSome of it is our fear of what we stand to lose.\u201d Both Nteta and state assembly member Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a member of the nine-person task force, noted that the size and influence of California \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest economy \u2013 drives the volume of discussion about reparations. \u201cAs California goes, so goes the rest of the country,\u201d Jones-Sawyer said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why there\u2019s pushback, because people really do understand that if we\u2019re able to resolve this in some fashion, it will start the resolution of a lot of these problems across the nation.\u201d As the nation enters a presidential election cycle, Nteta expects the potential for political fallout to limit Democratic focus on reparations. Decades of scholarship, he said, makes the case that Democrats tend to lose national elections when they center the interests or experiences of African Americans. \u201cI think this will go under the broad umbrella of \u2018This is where \u201cwokeness\u201d gets you \u2013 to a place where you\u2019re sending $5m to individuals simply because of the color of their skin,\u2019\u201d Nteta said. He expects to hear Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s I Have a Dream speech used to make the case that reparations are antithetical to our overarching values \u2013 content of character \u2013 even though King himself supported reparations. For decades, the idea of studying reparations found little traction at the federal level. Beginning in 1989, Representative John Conyers opened each session of Congress with HR 40 \u2013 named after the unfulfilled promise of 40 acres and a mule for the newly emancipated \u2013 until his retirement in 2017. But public attitudes might be changing slowly for a number of reasons, Nteta said, including the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the work of the Black Lives Matter movement and resistance to the ways white supremacy surfaced during the years of the Trump presidency. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee has since revived HR 40 and, in 2021, Congress voted to advance the bill. It was met with unanimous opposition from Republicans on the House judiciary committee, who saw a panel\u2019s findings as a foregone conclusion. But if any state could pass legislation, it\u2019s California, Nteta said, since a large percentage of the legislature is progressive, many of whom can avoid fallout because their term limits are approaching, and it has a progressive governor who has sometimes bucked national trends. If it passes in California, it may hit the dominoes of states with similar political characteristics, like Massachusetts or New York.

Jones-Sawyer and state senator Steven Bradford, also a member of the task force, will work to put forward legislation next year.

Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend contributed to the country\u2019s yawning \u201cnature gap\u201d, which he understood well through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively to women, particularly women of color. \u201cA lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,\u201d Borromeo said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that surrounded them and rendered him motionless. \u201cI want other people to experience that too.\u201d Due to discrimination and ongoing financial barriers, women tend to shy away from outdoor activities more and more as they age. Nearly 60% of girls between the ages of six and 12 participate in outdoor recreation, but the figure declines steadily through their teenage and adult years. Only 20% of women in their 60s enjoy outdoor recreation, according to a 2018 report by the Outdoor Foundation. The racial outdoors gap is even more stark: 70% of national parks visitors are white, even though people of color comprise 40% of the US population. To address these disparities, Borromeo\u2019s company (his co-founder has since left the company) releases seasonal collections of stylish athleisure wear and accessories and hosts monthly community programs \u2013 including backpacking workshops, hiking retreats and introductory climbing meet-ups. Ticket prices are heavily subsidized or waived for qualifying low-income individuals. A percentage of Wondery\u2019s sales revenue goes toward local groups working to diversify outdoor spaces, such as Black Girls Trekkin\u2019 and the Lagartijas climbing crew, which hosts meets for Latino members at climbing gyms and crags across the Los Angeles area. \u201cOur core mission was always that we must make an impact on any marginalized community,\u201d said Borromeo, who is Filipino with Chinese and Spanish heritage. His company now employs nearly 20 people. All but one \u2013 Borromeo \u2013 are women. Wondery\u2019s product lines, from the size-inclusive Isabella utility pants to a line of water bottles engraved with logos of the 50 states, are frequently on backorder. Local female climbers can often be seen wearing Wondery\u2019s items on Instagram, the result of the brand\u2019s collaboration efforts. We spoke with Borromeo, now the president of Wondery, along with the company\u2019s community director, Lydia Mok, and director of operations, Nina Bhatia, about their dream of transforming the Los Angeles-based startup into the country\u2019s go-to women\u2019s outdoor brand. How did you get the idea for Wondery? Borromeo: Back when we started seven years ago, we saw there were so many men\u2019s outdoor brands. Even going camping and climbing, there are so many opportunities for men, brands that are catered for men. We just thought: why aren\u2019t there more brands centered on women? So we thought: let\u2019s do this, let\u2019s provide women the opportunity to go outside. What were those first days and months like? Borromeo: We literally started in a broom closet. We put up some storage shelves and made 20 or 30 graphics. Kimberley and I came up with some ideas; she fed those to me and I\u2019d put them on a shirt. I found someone I went to school with to help fund the business, and I also went to my mom, who has always been supportive in everything I do. It\u2019s my first business, and there was a lot of trial and error in making apparel when you\u2019ve never done it before. What are some barriers preventing women and people of color from exploring the outdoors? Mok: Extreme sports, or outdoor sports in general, have always had this stereotype of being a crazy \u201cwhite people\u201d thing. I did a solo road trip to Colorado: you have to think about safe spaces to stop at. The outdoors can be fun and liberating and there\u2019s a lot of healing that goes on. So to reclaim that for Bipoc people is really powerful. Borromeo: It\u2019s so expensive to get outdoors even though it should be free. It\u2019s harder for Bipoc individuals to get to a place where they have excess income to spend on activities like climbing a rock. I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood, and went to a high school that\u2019s 95% white. I had to code-switch to blend in: I had to pretend to like sports. I didn\u2019t realize how important representation is. Whether it\u2019s being of color or being a woman, or of a different sexual orientation \u2013 it\u2019s so important to have a community where you can be yourself. What was your marketing strategy for entering a crowded field of established brands? Borromeo: Part of the strategy to get traction in the climbing community was to be where they were: in climbing gyms. So that\u2019s who we\u2019re targeting and now more than ever. We used influencer marketing to get our designs out into the world. What is the thinking behind your emphasis on community programming? Bhatia: Providing a safe place for people of color is a huge priority for us. That\u2019s why we have events geared toward the LGBTQ community. We\u2019re doing our best to provide inclusive sizing [from x-small to xxx-large] and picking gender-neutral colors. Getting outdoors is something we practice internally as well. It\u2019s awesome to see that climbing gyms, for example, are so much more diverse now than when we started. Mok: We partner with non-profits and community groups on the philanthropy side. I\u2019m part of Bipoc outdoor groups where you\u2019re not being constantly asked questions about your gender or sexuality, where you\u2019re being allowed to exist and enjoy yourself outdoors, not having to relive trauma stories. So we want to create more spaces like that. What\u2019s next for Wondery? Borromeo: Our goal is to become the women\u2019s outdoor brand. I want people from underrepresented communities to go out on a trail and be able to say, \u201cOh! She\u2019s wearing Wondery pants.\u201d Or \u201cThat\u2019s a Wondery jacket!\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f7a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/11/techscape-meta-threads-twitter", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "With 100 million users and counting, is Threads is on course to finish off Twitter?", "lead": "Meta wants its new rival to be a friendly, news-free space.

Indeed, it\u2019s not Musk, but Meta\u2019s launch of Threads \u2013 which has 100 million-plus users in a matter of days \u2013 that could be the biggest threat to Twitter at present. Threads, though, appears to be a very different social media beast. For starters, Meta\u2019s response to Twitter is accessed through your Instagram account, meaning you can automatically follow the accounts you already follow on Instagram. And though it looks quite similar to Twitter, with short text-based posts, it differs in key ways. Friendly and news-free Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hasn\u2019t been shy in explaining where he thinks Twitter has failed, saying that the platform had underachieved due to the amount on hostility on Twitter. He\u2019s said that his aim will be to grow Threads to be big but friendly. Is it possible to have a town square without everyone yelling at each other? Instagram\u2019s Adam Mosseri, meanwhile, said that news and politics will not be as prominent, which seems to go against the idea of such a site. It seems Meta wants to send the message straight away that this isn\u2019t your live news source \u2013 which is arguably the one thing Twitter always got right until recently. Despite this, politicians and news outlets are already joining Threads and beginning to work it into their social media routine. But as long as there is an algorithmically determined feed on the site, Meta controls how much of that content we see. Publications discovered that the hard way a few years ago when Facebook deprioritised news from its feeds. The company also recently gutted its own news teams. Can Instagram influencers make good threads? Since Threads is accessed with an Instagram account, people who have a large following on the photo-sharing app are converting that to a large following on Threads. But what works for a visual-based platform doesn\u2019t translate well to a text-based one. One of the jokes made about Musk buying Twitter is that he\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest reply guy trying desperately to be a poster. And in Threads, we\u2019re now seeing what happens when influencers also suddenly have to learn how to post. The app already has a whole bunch of inspirational \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d-style quotes often found on Instagram. They look out of place, though, in a text-focused app where the cynical and comedic shine. This will probably change if the non-Instagram-famous posters build followings on Threads, but it\u2019s not a great start. Is Threads shredding Twitter? There are signs Threads is at least starting to hit Twitter. Matthew Prince, the CEO of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, said that Twitter\u2019s traffic levels have been tanking since the start of this year, with the biggest dip in July. In addition to threatening to sue Meta over Threads, Musk\u2019s posting through it all is also a sign it\u2019s getting under his skin. After the app was launched, Musk tweeted: \u201cCompetition is fine, cheating is not.\u201d (As my colleague Johana Bhuiyan reported, Twitter does not appear to have provided evidence of Meta having access to its IP or trade secrets.) Love it, or leave it One of the biggest hurdles for any new user on a social media platform is finding all the accounts you used to follow on other sites. If you leave Twitter, of course, you leave behind all the accounts you used to follow. So potentially one of the best features going for Threads will be its portability, something taken from Mastodon. Meta aims to incorporate the ActivityPub protocol into Threads to allow you to not only communicate with those on other fediverse servers (ie Mastodon users) but transfer your account and followers to services that allow you to port over. A safe space \u2026 for advertising Brands are flocking to Threads, even though Meta says it will no put adds on the platform for at least this year. One of the things that prompted advertisers to pause their advertising on Twitter was the shift in moderation and allowing far-right agitators back on to the platform. You can still see those on Threads \u2013 because they\u2019ll go where the audience is \u2013 but might find their posts being more censored than they were on Twitter. Which is a good thing, except that overall the experience feels much more corporatised than before. Twitter, brought to you by McDonald\u2019s. For all the talk about wanting a platform less toxic than Twitter, the overemphasis on moderation also has one big distinction from Twitter: no adult content. One of the big changes on the internet in the past few years was after adult content was banned on Tumblr, it moved to Twitter. Twitter had mostly turned a blind eye to it under the former administration, aside from shadow-banning accounts posting adult content (that is making people log in to see the posts, and making the accounts hard to find via search). None of that is allowed on Threads from the outset, just like Instagram. The bigger discussion here is how long it would have remained on Twitter anyway. Several countries including the US, the UK and Australia have introduced online safety laws and regulation looking to put in more age verification and other restrictions on such sites, and at any time Apple could have turned to Twitter and threatened removal from the app store. Maybe it\u2019ll remain on Twitter, or one of the others will fill the gap. But Threads won\u2019t be it. Missing features Threads is still missing much of what makes Twitter Twitter. There are no hashtags to find like-minded communities. There\u2019s no direct messaging, no desktop version, and no way to view only the feeds of people you follow. Many of these features are coming soon (except for DMs, according to Forbes) but will people stick around for that long to wait for it? Clearview who? Some of Meta\u2019s rivals, including Jack Dorsey\u2019s spin-off Bluesky, collect far less user data than Threads does, and Meta\u2019s track record in what it does with that data should give us pause. Concerns over whether Threads can comply with EU data privacy rules is why the app hasn\u2019t launched in the European Union yet. Many might make the calculation that if they\u2019re already in the Zuckerverse, by using Instagram or Facebook, then what is one more app? But some people might pause and wonder if it\u2019s worth giving Meta more data and making them even more powerful. More Threads Much digital ink has been spilled over the fastest-downloaded app in history. To cut through, here are a few key pieces, starting with an explainer I wrote and global technology editor Dan Milmo\u2019s survey of the first serious threat to Twitter since Elon Musk took over. Finally, Kari Paul, in San Francisco, asks if Threads will flip the fortunes of a flailing Facebook. John Naughton, meanwhile, wonders where all the journalists and politcos will go if Threads does indeed manage to take down Twitter. Finally, the Guardian\u2019s media editor Jim Waterson has an insightful review of the new app and the internet landscape we\u2019re now in, writing: \u201cThreads\u2019s launch might be just be another step in the disintegration of the social media scene of the 2010s and its rebirth as a more sanitised advertiser-friendly environment, rather than a messy free-for-all discussion.\u201d If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Tuesday."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f7b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/11/england-keep-faith-with-under-fire-jonny-bairstow-for-fourth-ashes-test-cricket", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England keep faith with under-fire Jonny Bairstow for fourth Ashes Test", "lead": "England have kept faith with Jonny Bairstow in an unchanged squad for the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford", "author": "Ali Martin", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 10:49:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952665", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/da34abf0725eebf5de22477ea28178598baee45f/0_0_2221_1333/500.jpg", "body": "England will look to pump Jonny Bairstow\u2019s tyres up before next week\u2019s fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford after keeping faith with the under-fire wicketkeeper in an unchanged squad. Bairstow\u2019s role behind the stumps has come under increasing scrutiny during this impossibly tight series, with three dropped catches in the three-wicket win over Australia at Headingley furthering fears that the dual role is too great a burden so soon after last year\u2019s broken leg. But having clawed the scoreline back to a 2-1 deficit with two to play, Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum have opted to work on Bairstow\u2019s confidence in the lead-up rather than send for Surrey\u2019s Ben Foakes. The question now, as England try to set up a grand finale at the Oval, is who bats where and which seamer comes into the attack. As was the case last week, when Ollie Pope was ruled out of the summer with a dislocated shoulder, no extra batting cover has been added beyond the unused Dan Lawrence. Harry Brook moved to Pope\u2019s No 3 berth in the first innings in Leeds, before Moeen Ali volunteered for the role in the day-four run chase and Brook dropped down to his preferred role at No 5. Moeen has told the management he is ready to repeat this, booking additional net sessions against the new ball during the nine-day break. Stokes and McCullum \u2013 captain and head coach \u2013 have a decision to make with Brook\u2019s move away from the new ball helping the 24-year-old right-hander to a match-winning 75 last Sunday. Ollie Robinson has been retained in the squad despite back spasms on day one at Headingley leaving him a passenger in the main. It would represent a risk to play the 29-year-old again so soon, however, with Jimmy Anderson and Josh Tongue seemingly vying for the final place if England stick to five bowlers.

Situated in Sparkhill, a working-class area three miles south from the city centre, the Mermaid quickly established itself as a DIY focus, with a diehard crowd travelling from far afield to sell fanzines, trade tapes and put on cheap punk and metal all-dayers upstairs. Gifted with legendarily laidback landlords \u2013 not to mention a crew of mercifully nonplussed local drinkers in the downstairs bar \u2013 it was unique, and is now the subject of a four-part podcast and publication by Brummie social historians Home of Metal. \u201cIt was so accepting,\u201d says former regular Matthew Knight. \u201cThe 80s was a pretty vile time; the right were on the rise, racism was rife, but here was this place you could go where everyone was vegetarian and into Crass,\u201d he laughs. \u201cNobody was sexist or racist. It was a little oasis.\u201d Lisa Meyer, the director of Home of Metal as well as Birmingham\u2019s Supersonic festival, was initially inspired to document the story of the Mermaid after hearing enthusiastic stories from the likes of Justin Broadrick (Godflesh) and Nicholas Bullen (Napalm Death) after gigs at Supersonic. \u201cWe\u2019d always asked the question: why did this music \u2013 Black Sabbath and Judas Priest and Napalm Death and Godflesh, say \u2013 come from this region?\u201d After doing a 2011 exhibition focused on Napalm Death, fanzines and the scene\u2019s politics, it became evident that the Mermaid was \u201cthe antithesis of Judas Priest\u2019s theatrics and stage costumes. Bands were literally playing on the floor \u2013 there was no stage.\u201d Hosting a wide array of bands from anarcho-punk legends such as Conflict and Antisect through to old school names such as UK Subs and American bands including Swans and Circle Jerks, the Mermaid was initially known for its unwavering support of underground punk. Talking to regulars and bands who frequently included the pub on their tour schedules, the idea of community came up time and again. Crust punk mainstays Amebix regularly toured there, as guitarist Stig Miller fondly remembers. \u201cA place like the Mermaid couldn\u2019t exist in the present time,\u201d he says. \u201cBy modern standards it would be considered a dump. They didn\u2019t bother with things like fire regulations or having working toilets \u2026 sometimes when we were playing there the floor would be bowing and I thought we\u2019d all end up falling through to the downstairs bar. But what an atmosphere: fantastic, DIY, real punk rock.\u201d Miller describes a febrile atmosphere where boundaries between performers and crowd were all but obliterated. \u201cEveryone there was doing something, whether it was selling a fanzine or organising a gig, doing a band, running a label. There weren\u2019t really any civilians in that sense. It was a very creative time.\u201d Though the Mermaid was known for its stellar support of punk rock it was the combination of the most ferocious metal with the DIY ethics of punk that gave birth to the band most closely associated with the pub: the godfathers of grindcore, Napalm Death. Often dubbed the unofficial house band of the Mermaid, Napalm Death combined guttural vocals with lightning fast blast beats on (very) short songs. Fast and furiously heavy, this was as extreme as metal got. Former band member and longtime Godflesh guitarist and vocalist Justin Broadrick recalls the band\u2019s early days as feeling \u201clike a kids\u2019 band. Drunk teenagers. The average age was 14-16. We were going through our early teenage years, and we all know what that\u2019s like [laughs]. By the time Mick [Harris, drummer] joined and we sped up all the songs, people started to take us more seriously. They were coming not just to see us support the UK Subs, they were actually coming to see us as well. It dawned on us that we were doing something that people were actually interested in \u2013 even if we were teenagers drinking and doing whatever cheap drugs.\u201d Although the Mermaid was fuelled by booze and psychedelics there was also a more serious aspect at play. Hunt saboteurs organised there, using the pub as a base before going out on meetings. \u201cYou\u2019d go there Saturday morning at God knows what time,\u201d explains Matthew Knight, \u201cget in the van and you\u2019d end up in the Worcestershire country side, running around chasing people in red coats. It was a beacon of resistance.\u201d It was also a beacon of endurance. A notorious gig by Swans \u2013 an American band infamous for their rib-crushing volume \u2013 nearly took the roof off. Julie Barton was a regular attendee who was there on the night, aptly the same night as the 1987 hurricane. \u201cIt was all calm on the way in and then Swans came on. I remember seeing them loading the kit in. I\u2019d never seen a PA that size. As the noise intensified people started moving to the back of the room. I remember standing with my back against the wall. There was a corridor that led into where the gigs were and people were watching from the corridor for safety. There was plaster falling off the celling. I remember looking down at my pint and my cider was moving like Jurassic Park [laughs]. I\u2019ve never felt that feeling of bass, just going through your body, into your stomach. My chest was vibrating. And then walking out afterwards there was rubbish blowing down the street and the trees were bending.\u201d Other gigs were equally tumultuous. Broadrick remembers notorious power electronics outfit Whitehouse playing regularly in the early 80s, \u201cbringing a whole crew with them who\u2019d stand at the back and try to corral everyone into seats at the front \u2013 there were no seats by the time we were in Napalm Death, they\u2019d all been destroyed \u2013 in order to be tortured by Whitehouse, while the crew would stand at the back and hurl glasses over the top of the audience to land behind the band. That gig was the only time I ever saw the landlord. He got [Whitehouse vocalist] William Bennett in a headlock. A state of total carnage.\u201d But if you could dodge the odd hurled glass, the Mermaid could change your life. Long friendships were forged, and even as bands came and went, the enduring power of DIY ethics endured. \u201cIt was almost like a year zero for us,\u201d explains Knight. \u201cYou met people there and you developed political thinking. It was a way of life, of effecting change. For pretty much everybody who went to The Mermaid who I\u2019m still in contact with, we took that on in our own lives \u2013 it wasn\u2019t about standing at barricades throwing rocks at the police, it was about how we interact at work, how we interact in relationships, how we raise our children. It was like a university, a grounding.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f7d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/el-salvador-michelle-recinos-barbers-strike-book-guatemala-president-nayib-bukele", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Life imitates art as El Salvador pressures book fair to bar dissenting writer", "lead": "Barbers on Strike, author Michelle Recinos\u2019s collection of short stories, has apparently upset strongman president Nayib Bukele", "author": "Tom Phillips Latin America correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 10:30:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952703", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a614e12b2d1c5762e0fbcc6b529c5ccf3c4d0d/0_192_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "First the soldiers came for those with mohawks.

Recinos\u2019s collection of short stories was due to be featured at a recent book fair in neighbouring Guatemala celebrating Salvadorian literature.

Nearly 70,000 people have been thrown in jail since Bukele launched his controversial \u201cwar on gangs\u201d in February 2022 \u2013 many for simply acting or looking suspicious. Human rights activists say more than 150 prisoners have died and have accused Bukele\u2019s administration of shredding human rights and the country\u2019s democracy in his supposed bid to obliterate the gangs. In her diary-like yarn, Recinos paints a sinister portrait of an increasingly autocratic land, where armoured vehicles and troops occupy the streets and hardly a day goes by without reports of new arrests: bus conductors, restaurant workers, shopkeepers and athletes \u2013 all spirited into custody for falling foul of the regime. \u201cToday the baker didn\u2019t come by. He was picked up in a raid \u2026 two blocks from here,\u201d Recinos\u2019s narrator writes on day 22 in her fictional journal, 24 hours before her barber is jailed. \u201cThis country gets more stupid by the day,\u201d the narrator laments after that arrest. \u201cWe are getting more stupid by the day.\u201d The author declined to talk more about her work and what she called the recent \u201cdark chapter\u201d. But in an interview last year with the Guatemalan website Agencia Ocote, Recinos said her story had been inspired by Bukele\u2019s draconian state of emergency and was designed to expose the situation in her homeland. \u201cPerhaps in 50 years, if El Salvador still exists, people will read it and think: \u2018Hey! \u2026 These things really were happening,\u201d she said. Writing on Twitter, Recinos called her book a portrait \u201cof certain realities, as painful as they are Central American \u2026 It ISN\u2019T a pamphlet to overthrow any particular government,\u201d she insisted. Bukele\u2019s clampdown has caused crime rates to plummet and made El Salvador\u2019s president wildly popular with many of the country\u2019s 6 million citizens, about 1% of whom have been jailed. He is widely expected to win another five-year term. \u201cYou write DEMOCRACY from the bottom up,\u201d Bukele, whose Twitter handle designates him El Salvador\u2019s \u201cPhilosopher King\u201d, tweeted after Sunday\u2019s announcement, pointing to his sky-high popularity among violence-weary voters. (In a previous Twitter bio, Bukele sarcastically claimed the title of \u201cthe coolest dictator in the world\u201d.) The crackdown has also earned Bukele foreign fans, with conservative politicians and media outlets across Latin America hailing the \u201cBukele effect\u201d. Last December, Honduras declared its own Bukele-style state of exception while one of Colombia\u2019s leading news magazines, Semana, recently published a fawning front-page tribute to \u201cthe Bukele Miracle\u201d. Recinos\u2019s short story suggests such tactics are unlikely to have a happy ending. On the 60th and final day of her chronicle, the narrator\u2019s boss asks her to head to the barber\u2019s for a crewcut, \u201cbecause here a haircut could make you an upstanding citizen, or it could land you in jail\u201d. The narrator\u2019s usual haircutter is in prison, and another has gone missing. But at a downtown barbershop called \u201cHope\u201d, she finds a soldier shaving customers\u2019 heads. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good,\u201d the serviceman murmurs. The narrator braces: \u201cI was up next.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f7e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/10/ticket-fraud-uk-festival-gig-scams", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "From Taylor Swift to Coldplay: how to avoid festival and gig ticket scams", "lead": "Offers on Twitter and Facebook may be tempting \u2013 but experts warn over the risks of fraud", "author": "Suzanne Bearne", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 10:27:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952722", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0cfc2f3cc457ce8027306e646efc0f4dec6aa20e/0_43_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "With many popular events selling out in double-quick time, trying to get your hands on a ticket when they first go on sale can be a stressful and frustrating business (hello Glastonbury, Beyonc\u00e9 and, no doubt, Taylor Swift, whose ticket presale for her 2024 UK dates kicks off on Monday). Also, not all of us can commit to organising our diary six months or a year in advance. All is not necessarily lost if you are not successful. However, it pays to be cautious when trying to bag a last-minute ticket for a hot event. Fortunately, there will always be people who need to sell their tickets nearer the time. But, while using official sales channels won\u2019t leave you out of pocket, the world of ticket resale on social media requires exercising a huge amount of caution, warns Mike Andrews, a coordinator for the National Trading Standards eCrime team. \u201cThere\u2019s been a shift in the last few years towards fraudsters targeting people on social media, which has reflected consumer behaviour of more people turning to social media to find tickets,\u201d he says. In fact, concert ticket scams soared by 529% between March 2022 and February this year, with those defrauded losing an average of \u00a3110, according to research by Lloyds Bank. Scour genuine resale sites If you are desperate for a ticket but the event is sold out, websites such as Ticketmaster list resale tickets (typically offered by people unable to attend) for many events, and Twickets is arguably the leading resale marketplace. \u201cThey offer greater protection if anything was to go wrong,\u201d Andrews says. Other resale sites include TicketSwap, while the ticket app Dice allows fans to join a waiting list for sold-out gigs. Too good to be true? Many people will jump on to social media to scout out tickets for a gig \u2013 and there are plenty of genuine sellers using platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. However, there are ways to stop yourself falling for increasingly sophisticated scams. \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Liz Stanton at Get Safe Online, an internet safety website, says. Although she quickly adds that scammers are becoming increasingly savvy. \u201cThey\u2019re more switched on and will drop the price down to a level that doesn\u2019t sound ridiculously obvious that it\u2019s a scam. For example, if Glastonbury tickets are originally \u00a3350, they might drop to \u00a3320 as they know that putting it at \u00a350 is just having a laugh.\u201d Check the person\u2019s profile This is where some of the most obvious warning signs are if you are buying via social media. \u201cA red flag would be that they have few friends or followers on the platform,\u201d Andrews says. Scroll through their profile and look at the activity. \u201cIf someone has recently set up a profile and put on a week\u2019s worth of pictures, that should raise concerns,\u201d he adds. Sometimes you will spot fake profiles as they will set their location abroad, which might give off a whiff of suspicion. On Twitter, many scammers use random usernames that don\u2019t correlate with their name, and add in emojis and kisses to their username to make them look more approachable. Also, scammers can stick out on Twitter as they often retweet furiously in the days leading up to selling a ticket for a big event \u2013 look at their posts and replies to see if there\u2019s any actual engagement with friends or followers. Also, watch out for people who say \u201cDM me\u201d in their original post and turn off comments. The purpose of this is that they are trying to have multiple conversations with potential victims in their private messages rather than look like the ticket had been bought. Use \u2018reverse image\u2019 \u201cCriminals will \u2018scrape\u2019 pictures of tickets online and use the information in the image to add to their own posts,\u201d Andrews says. However, he adds, there are ways to check if it is legitimate. \u201cYou can do a \u2018reverse image\u2019 search to see if there are copies of the image on other websites. (For more information on how this works, check out articles such as this.) If you spot others, that would suggest it\u2019s highly suspicious.\u201d And a word of warning from the experts: to help crack down on this problem, don\u2019t post an image of your own ticket online. Also, you can apply the same approach with the seller\u2019s profile pictures. \u201cMost scammers use someone else\u2019s pictures, which a reverse image search can sometimes pick up,\u201d Stanton says. Pay by credit card Many fraudsters push buyers into paying for tickets via a direct bank transfer, and will come up with all sorts of excuses to get you to do this. \u201cIf you use a money transfer service or direct bank transfer, you\u2019re not protected and may not be refunded,\u201d Andrews says. Whenever you are buying tickets online, make the purchase with a credit card, he adds. \u201cIf you can demonstrate to your credit card issuer that you have been defrauded, it should refund you.\u201d To qualify for protection under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, you have to spend between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000 on your card. Scammers will sometimes encourage people to pay using PayPal\u2019s friends and family option. However, this doesn\u2019t offer you any protection, as PayPal doesn\u2019t provide refunds for payments made this way. If you want to use PayPal, only do this via its goods and services option \u2013 which will often result in scammers running a mile. This offers protection and provides refunds. Also, you can often spot a scammer when they provide PayPal or bank details, as this will often reveal a different name to the one they are using online. If you are scammed Try to take pictures of the conversations as evidence for your refund request. \u201cAs soon as the transaction goes through, they will usually block you and delete the conversation; that\u2019s why we say to always screenshot,\u201d Stanton says. Report and block the fraudsters on the social media platform and report them to Action Fraud, the national fraud reporting centre. Contact your bank as soon as possible to try to stop the transaction and see if you can claim a refund if it has gone though."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f7f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s pillage\u2019: thirsty Uruguayans decry Google\u2019s plan to exploit water supply", "lead": "Country suffering its worst drought in 74 years, with government even mixing saltwater into drinking supply", "author": "Grace Livingstone in Montevideo", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 10:15:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952740", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fca2d0a3523c668bc9ac6c576bbc43cfc7f92e87/0_0_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "A plan to build a Google data centre that will use millions of litres of water a day has sparked anger in Uruguay, which is suffering its worst drought in 74 years. Water shortages are so severe in the country that a state of emergency has been declared in Montevideo and the authorities have added salty water to the public drinking water supplies, prompting widespread protests. Critics claim that the government is prioritising water for transnationals and agribusiness at the expense of its own citizens. Daniel Pe\u00f1a, a researcher at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, said: \u201cOnly a tiny proportion of water in Uruguay is used for human consumption. The majority is used for big agro industries, such as soya, rice and wood pulping. Now we have Google planning to use enormous quantities of water.\u201d The search giant has bought 29 hectares (72 acres) of land to build a datacentre in Canelones department, in southern Uruguay. The centre would use 7.6m litres (2m gallons) of water a day to cool its servers \u2013 equivalent to the domestic daily use of 55,000 people, according to figures from the Ministry of Environment obtained by Pe\u00f1a through a legal action. The water would come directly from the public drinking water system, according to Pe\u00f1a. Uruguay\u2019s industry ministry says these figures are out of date because the company is revising its plans, and the datacentre will be \u201ca smaller size\u201d. In a statement, Google said the hub would serve Google users worldwide, processing requests for services such as YouTube, Gmail and Google Search. \u201cThe Uruguay data center project is still in the exploratory phase, and Google\u2019s technical team is actively working with the support of national and local authorities. We expect preliminary numbers (like projected water consumption) to undergo adjustments. At Google, sustainability is at the core of everything we do, and the way we design and manage our data centers is no exception,\u201d it said. Extremely low rainfall levels and record high temperatures have left Uruguay\u2019s main reservoir dry and rivers depleted, and to make up the supply, public water authorities have started taking water from the Rio de la Plata estuary, where seawater mixes with freshwater, giving tap water a salty taste. The foul-tasting tap water has caused shock waves in a country which has the highest GDP per capita in South America and was the first country in the world to declare access to water a constitutional right. The government has doubled the permitted levels of sodium chloride in tap water and is advising pregnant women and people with serious health conditions not to drink it. Parents have been advised to prepare baby milk with bottled water and not to add salt to children\u2019s food. Uruguay\u2019s president, Luis Lacalle Pou, has announced emergency measures such as lifting taxes on bottled water and distributing two litres (a half gallon) of free water a day to 21,000 poor or vulnerable families. He has also promised to build a new reservoir in 30 days. But public anger remains widespread. \u201cTap water is virtually undrinkable. But there are approximately 500,000 people who can\u2019t afford to buy bottled water,\u201d said Carmen Sosa of the trade union-backed Commission to Defend Water and Life. Its slogan, \u201cThis is not drought, it\u2019s pillage,\u201d is scrawled on walls across Montevideo. \u201cMore than 80% of water goes to industry, like soya and wood pulping. Yes, we have had a shortage of rain, but the drought has simply shown the problems with our economic model. We can\u2019t concentrate resources in a few hands,\u201d said Sosa. \u201cWater for human consumption has to come before profit.\u201d Last month, the world\u2019s biggest pulping plant started operations in Uruguay, the third such mill in the country. The new plant, run by the Finnish company UPM to create raw material for paper, is forecast to use 129.6m litres (34m gallons) of water a day, and releases effluent into a local river. UPM said it treats the effluent before release, and constantly monitors the water quality in the R\u00edo Negro. A UPM spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cUruguay is facing the worst drought in a century. Within this framework, UPM\u2019s operations in Uruguay have no connection with the drought that is occurring. The drinking water consumed in Montevideo comes from the Santa Luc\u00eda River. None of the pulp mills installed in Uruguay are linked to this river. This challenging climatic situation cannot be associated in any way with the forestry sector.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f80", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/11/trafficker-behind-bars-uk-migration-bill-modern-slavery", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "My trafficker is behind bars, but if the UK's new migration bill passes, my story would have ended very differently | Anonymous", "lead": "The new legislation will be devastating for survivors of modern slavery, says a survivor of sex trafficking", "author": "Anonymous", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 10:14:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952759", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/591f96b860ac9fb759e83381c44da37140062266/0_0_6920_4153/500.jpg", "body": "I remember the day I decided I was finally ready to report my trafficker\u2019s abuse after the false promise of a job turned into sexual exploitation. It was September 2018, and a woman from the organisation Women at the Well, which provides support to people affected by trafficking, came out to meet me at Starbucks with a notepad. I told her going to the police was the last thing I wanted to do. I worried about what he would do if he found out, if his other victims would be OK, whether I had broken the law and would be deported. But mostly I just wondered if anyone would believe me. My ability to trust people was almost nil: after all, my trafficker had proven to me that I shouldn\u2019t trust anyone. The organisation supported me to report my experiences to the police and begin the recovery process. It also referred me to the Home Office, which recognised me as a potential victim of trafficking and provided me with further assistance, including safe-house accommodation, and legal and subsistence support. Importantly, after the initial decision recognising me as the potential victim of trafficking, I was allowed to stay in the country, at least until the final decision on conclusive grounds was made. What followed was a traumatic four and half years of going through the criminal justice system before my day in court finally came. I remember the usher saying to me: \u201cYou are the single most important person in this room right now, and without you, this trial would not be happening.\u201d In trafficking, generally there is no prosecution without a witness. With my commitment to see justice served, a dangerous man was successfully removed from the streets and sentenced. Following my experiences, I feel safe now that my trafficker is behind bars. He can\u2019t hurt anyone any more. That\u2019s the most important thing to me. I have been able to take back my sense of agency, reintegrate into society and support myself independently. Healing from my experiences and moving forward with my life would not have been possible without the help I received. I am here today, safe and healthy, thanks to professionals from NGOs and local authorities. If I had gone through this journey five years later, under the proposed illegal migration bill, which is back in the Commons today after amendments in the Lords, there is a chance my story could have ended very differently. In fact, my trafficker would still be walking the streets today. The legislation is designed to detain and remove from the UK those who have arrived here via irregular routes, including potential survivors of modern slavery. The bill sets out that those who arrive irregularly will be detained and removed from the UK. According to an analysis of the bill, carried out by the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre, to which I contributed, this could have devastating consequences by limiting survivors\u2019 ability to report their traffickers and access the support they need. Many people will be scared of coming forward to the authorities to be identified out of fear of being detained and removed rather than protected \u2013 exactly the threat traffickers use to control those who they exploit. Under these conditions, I would not have been able to help send my trafficker to jail. The home secretary could decide that it\u2019s absolutely necessary for trafficking victims to stay in the country to support a prosecution \u2013 but the bill specifically creates a presumption that survivors\u2019 presence in the UK is not required to provide this support. When you watch police dramas, they don\u2019t show you the merry-go-round of interviews, the sudden call to provide a piece of evidence or pop into the police station to sign a paper. Having lived through five years of this, I can confirm that it is tantamount to a part-time job. The idea that I could do this from the other side of the world, where my morning would be the officers\u2019 bedtime, is laughable. Perhaps even more importantly, it would have been near to impossible to access the specialist support I needed and deserved. In my home country, there is still no law addressing trafficking happening on its own soil, let alone provisions for citizens returning to recover from these experiences. I doubt I would have been able to access therapy, accommodation and the many other things I needed to begin my journey to recovery. If I had gone home I would have taken a broken chapter of my life with me, with no chance of changing my story. The bill is at odds with the compassion I have received from British people, which helped me turn my trauma into a story of my strength. Britain has long been proud of providing support and protection to people who are in need. For people who experienced modern slavery, it has built a support system that \u2013 although imperfect \u2013 has been leading the way for the rest of the world.

After all, Threads doesn\u2019t have the best blood lines; nothing in its lineage suggests that it will be the secretariat of social media good behavior or ethics. It is the spawn of Meta, which we still might know as Facebook if Mark Zuckerberg and his brain trust hadn\u2019t decided to rename their behemoth after its many reputation-damaging misdeeds. Those include allowing users\u2019 data to leak out, as well as distributing untold amounts of hate and lies and ultimately, giving Donald Trump an invaluable helping hand in his disastrous 2016 election by spreading Russian disinformation. (Recall, too, the scandal surrounding Facebook\u2019s relationship with the political data firm Cambridge Analytica.) But it\u2019s all relative, it seems, and people apparently have tweet-sized memories. These days, the bigger villain is Elon Musk who, since he bought Twitter last year, has been systematically making a not-great place into a much worse place. He has elevated the haters, fired staff who were trying to control the worst content and alienated the very users who made Twitter worthwhile. Quite the clown show, and a crushing one for those who depend on Twitter for news and to hear voices that are much more diverse than those in mainstream media. For all its faults, Twitter has been democratizing in that way, at least. But it gets worse by the day and Musk is more than cavalier. He\u2019s disrespectfully ugly. (When news organizations reach out to Twitter these days to get comment for their stories about what\u2019s happening on the platform, they receive a poop emoji in response; and after tweeting \u201cZuck is a cuck,\u201d Musk suggested Sunday that he and Zuckerberg should compete in \u201ca literal dick measuring contest\u201d.) \u201cIt\u2019s an indication of Elon Musk\u2019s unpopularity that people are so keen to embrace a platform created by Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d the New York Times star reporter Katherine Rosman wrote last week; suitably enough, she did so on Threads. Embrace it, they certainly have. Immediately after the launch last week, 30 million people signed up. It kept growing explosively over the weekend and was due Monday to hit 100 million users worldwide. (For comparison, the population of the United States is 332 million; you do the math.) A well circulated graphic showing a sharp drop in Twitter\u2019s usage drew cheers from those who had decamped or were planning to. As I clicked through the steps to become a willing part of this potential mess, one screen\u2019s worth of information stopped me cold \u2013 but, in what may be a self-indictment, only for a moment. \u201cPowered by Instagram,\u201d it began. \u201cThreads is part of the Instagram platform. We will use your Threads and Instagram information to personalize ads and other experiences across Threads and Instagram.\u201d Later, there was a section entitled \u201cYour data,\u201d which might as well have read \u201cYou\u2019re doomed.\u201d So why did I do it? In short, because it\u2019s a professional necessity \u2013 as someone who frequently writes about media \u2013 to be where the action is. And because I\u2019m congenitally curious. And because I\u2019m disgusted by Musk and how he\u2019s damaged Twitter; on balance, the platform has been of significant benefit to me as a place to develop sources, get ideas, share my own work and communicate directly with a wide variety of smart people. (I remain on Twitter, as well as on BlueSky, a promising new platform that is still in beta, so for now it is by invitation only.) What\u2019s more, I realize, as someone who\u2019s already on Facebook and Instagram, that the chimeric horse called Privacy fled the barn a long time ago. Why should I bother with a padlock now? Still, I worry. I\u2019m well aware that Threads is not yet available in the European Union for the very reasons that ought to concern Americans and others: the app does not comply with EU law, which has stricter provisions on data privacy. And Zuckerberg\u2019s promises about making Threads less toxic than Twitter \u2013 \u201cfriendly\u201d, to use his term \u2013 are questionable, as a Guardian report by Josh Taylor and Josh Nichols made clear Monday.

Mess with the acoustics \u2013 it\u2019s either the lack of windows or the aggressively cheap corrugated wall material \u2013 so that the cacophony is warped and comes from every direction, then submerge all the children beneath the balls, which mysteriously makes them louder, but now invisible.

Analysts see the company reprioritizing its expansion plans as its conflict with Florida\u2019s rightwing governor and his so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law banning classroom discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation escalates into a legal dispute. In May, Disney canceled a $1bn project to build an office campus and relocate 2,000 employees to Orlando. It also pulled the plug on a Star Wars hotel that had been open at Disney World for less than two years. Now, following comments from Disney\u2019s chief executive Bob Iger that DeSantis is \u201canti-business\u201d and \u201canti-Florida\u201d, the company is all in on Disneyland Forward, an ambitious rolling program of growth at its two Anaheim theme parks. The company projects the program will generate $253m annually and more than 2,200 new jobs. Last month, California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, no friend of his Republican Florida counterpart, attended Disneyland\u2019s Pride Nite and blamed his state\u2019s good fortune on DeSantis\u2019s attacks on non-binary communities. \u201cIn California, we don\u2019t just tolerate our diversity, we celebrate it and all the ways it makes us stronger,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur inclusivity and acceptance attract new talent and ideas that drive our economic growth and make California a hotspot for world-leading companies to grow and prosper.\u201d Publicly, Disney leaders have only hinted at a correlation, separately citing \u201cconsiderable changes\u201d in Florida\u2019s business environment and \u201cmore opportunity\u201d in California for recent actions. But longtime Disney watchers and business analysts have little doubt the company\u2019s strategy, in the short term at least, is tied to its ongoing battle in Florida and the presence of DeSantis, whose stuttering campaign for the Republican presidential nomination is being weighed down by the controversy. \u201cThere is a relationship,\u201d said business analyst Bill George, former chief executive of Medtronic and author of True North: Leading Authentically in Today\u2019s Workplace. \u201cDeSantis has done lasting harm to Disney\u2019s investments in Florida, and they\u2019ve already pulled investment and said 2,000 people are not moving, they\u2019ve already canceled that. I\u2019m in touch with a lot of CEOs who are looking at those issues right now and thinking, \u2018Where should I invest? What\u2019s best for the long run?\u2019\u201d George said Disney, Florida\u2019s largest private employer with 75,000 cast members, many LGBTQ+, would also want to consider their welfare. \u201cI have friends, men with husbands, women with wives and children, and they\u2019ve got to send them to school in a place that makes them feel uncomfortable because they have two mothers or two fathers? I wouldn\u2019t want to be in an environment like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a CEO, it\u2019s important to me, is this a good place for my employees to live, go to school, to grow up, the environment\u2019s good, we have good natural resources and all the other stuff? That\u2019s not even so much political, but environmental.\u201d He added that he thought Disney would eventually settle the lawsuits \u201cbecause they don\u2019t want to be in a big fight with the government of Florida\u201d, and that ultimately the political fallout will dissipate. \u201cTo hardcore rightwingers, the brand\u2019s been damaged in the same way as Bud Light, but I don\u2019t know any parents, or grandparents, or kids that don\u2019t want to go to Disney. It\u2019s just something they do,\u201d he said. Tom Bricker, editor of disneytouristblog.com, sees \u201ca golden window of opportunity\u201d for Disney in California, partly because of the Florida troubles, newly elected \u201cfriendly\u201d city leaders in Anaheim, and the backing of Newsom and state leaders. \u201cThere\u2019s the practical reality that Disney is not going to be in a financial position to build everything everywhere all at once, [and] in the near to medium term tough decisions are going to be made about expansion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat aforementioned window with California, coupled with the ongoing standoff in Florida, potentially makes it easier to justify prioritizing Disneyland.\u201d Bricker also notes the outsize roles being played by DeSantis and Newsom. \u201cThe two home-state governors where Disney does business have become central figures in the culture wars, almost reflexively opposing one another on every issue. This is not a value judgment about either, it is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIn any case, the Walt Disney company has become a \u2018victim\u2019 of this dynamic in Florida and, by extension, a beneficiary in California. [But] Disney is not going anywhere and will outlast any politicians and corporate executives. We will be applauding the inevitable photo op between the CEO of Disney and whoever is the governor of Florida in three years when the current unpleasantness is in the rearview mirror.\u201d Disney analyst Peter Kunze, assistant professor of communications at Tulane University, notes that the company still has plans for massive long-term investment at Disney World and also sees it playing a long game to protect its prized asset in Florida. \u201cThe reality for DeSantis is his time is limited, and my impression is that it\u2019s not paying off for him the way he thinks it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt undercuts the traditional Republican platform of being job creators \u2013 normally they get out of the way of business. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that it\u2019s DeSantis supporters who are upset by it \u2026 as opposed to those who have some kind of economic or financial investment in Disney continuing to be this kind of generator of economic development and growth,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange to see this quintessentially mainstream American institution being attacked by these organizations that position themselves as family values. It\u2019s become a bit of a standoff between two powerful egos and without a clear victory for either in part because of this entanglement of business and politics.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f86", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/a-kind-of-kidnapping-review-patrick-baladi-youtube", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A Kind of Kidnapping review \u2013 sleazy MP no one wants is taken in pitch-black comedy", "lead": "Bungling amateurs kidnap a morally bankrupt politico in this British film \u2013 but his wife won\u2019t spring for him, and he\u2019s enjoying the publicity", "author": "Cath Clarke", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 10:00:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952868", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c8180e56eda16e3df614c0e04eb1867e4a66c498/235_0_1430_858/500.jpg", "body": "This pitch-black, low-budget British comedy entertainingly revolves around a sleazy, self-serving MP who may or may not bear a passing resemblance to a certain recent prime minister.

A good one: spontaneous, romantic, the kind you see in the movies. The guy I fancied came back to mine after a gig we\u2019d been at with mutual friends. I brewed mango tea in my favourite pot and showed him my life-drawing sketches. Conversation and Kate Bush albums intertwined as night turned into day. When birds began chirping, I suggested we go for a walk in the park to round off our time together. Big mistake. Almost immediately, my nose began its rebellion \u2013 unleashing a flow of clear phlegm across the rest of my face. With no tissues, I had to reach for the nearest thing \u2013 a tree leaf. I asked my crush to turn around while I loudly blew my nose and got snot everywhere on my hand. I still remember the mucus stuck between my fingers. Things are worse than ever for hay fever sufferers. It\u2019s July, by which point the worst hay fever symptoms should be dying down, but research shows that warming temperatures and longer seasons due to the climate crisis, growing levels of air pollution, and reduced biodiversity within urban environments are all contributing to intensifying and prolonging symptoms and more adults experiencing allergies for the first time. In these worsening conditions, hay fever horror stories are everywhere. On Reddit, users share cringeworthy tales of projectile strings of snot or console each other about the discomfort (\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a layer of cement between the skin of my face and my skull,\u201d writes one poster). On TikTok, people share videos of their painfully swollen red eyes. For many people, hay fever is truly disruptive, something that ruins joyful moments and sees victims locked away in their dark, heavy curtained rooms, bitterly watching others enjoy summer in bliss. I spoke to fellow sufferers about their lowest moments. I could only use the Notes app to communicate Alexa Hallum, a 23-year-old from Dallas, works in marketing. Her life has been shaped by seasonal allergies for as long as she can remember. \u201cI remember in sixth grade I had to be sent home because I coughed so loud that I disturbed state testing on the other side of the school,\u201d she says. Later, the allergies got in the way of her social life. She\u2019d get ready for a night out but immediately her makeup would \u201calways get messed up because my nose would be runny\u201d. A few years ago, Hallum developed chronic sinusitis \u2013 when the spaces inside your nose and head are swollen and inflamed for three months or longer. Hers tends to flare up during allergy seasons, and related symptoms like headaches, nausea and sore throats stopped Hallum from going out. She started losing her voice a lot too, which meant she would communicate through the Notes app on her phone. \u201cIt was very infuriating. People just wouldn\u2019t hear me, and being a woman, men would talk over me. It was really depressing. I wasn\u2019t able to participate much.\u201d Hallum has since had surgery that has alleviated sinusitis symptoms but hasn\u2019t stopped her seasonal allergies. \u201cI feel like Dallas is one of the worst places for allergies in the whole world. We have a thing here called cedar fever, so every year, I know I\u2019m going to be really sick all through the beginning of spring.\u201d We moved to Arizona and things only got worse Mark Reese\u2019s lifelong seasonal allergies are so bad, his family moved to a new state to help manage his symptoms. But somehow, things took a turn for the worse. \u201cWhen I was little, we were in Ohio for a couple of years and my allergies took off really severely. I was in Boy Scouts constantly going outdoors and it was becoming debilitating,\u201d the 54-year-old recounts. \u201cThe wisdom back then was that if someone had severe allergies, they should move to Arizona, so that\u2019s what my father did when he happened to get a contract there.\u201d To Reese\u2019s dismay, he found out he was allergic to pine and juniper, trees found everywhere in the state. Today, he lives in Tennessee, and his symptoms are usually what he describes as \u201crun of the mill\u201d. But they can still get severe, causing fatigue and difficulty breathing. With the recent dips in air quality due to nearby forest fires and pollution, Reese has been unable to spend quality time with his wife and son: \u201cMy wife has to explain that Dad needs to stay inside.\u201d Across the Atlantic, Francisca\u2019s work has also been suffocated by pollen. A geographer and an environmental consultant in London, she struggles to be outdoors for six months of the year. \u201cI currently work at a nature reserve, and last year, I remember being at one of the practical conservation sessions that we run for students in the local area. I was only there for about 20 minutes, and my throat closed up, my nose was itchy, my eyes were so sore, and my head was spinning. I went home and didn\u2019t wake up until the next day.\u201d She\u2019s able to manage some of her symptoms with stronger medication. \u201cI just have to get on with it; it\u2019s part of my job,\u201d she says. I was so snotty we had to postpone our wedding For some, allergens wreak havoc on their love lives. Vicky from Leeds moved her entire wedding \u2013 which was meant to take place in June \u2013 after she realised that hay fever could ruin her special day. \u201cI\u2019m so snotty with it as well, it\u2019s actually disgusting, and it makes you feel tired, like you don\u2019t want to do anything,\u201d the 27-year-old says, explaining that she had mental images of being photographed with red eyes from the itching and a runny nose ruining her make-up. Her now husband also suffers from hay fever, so it would have been an especially terrible backdrop to their once-in-a-lifetime event. Their wedding venue had an available spot at the end of the summer, and the couple could breathe a sigh of relief when they were able to postpone the day. Not everyone is so lucky, though. Jo, a 27-year-old in the south of England, had a disastrous second date when she leaned into a kiss with a stuffy nose. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018Shit, my nose is going,\u2019\u201d the film-maker says. \u201cNever mind fighting the snot ready to escape your nose \u2013 if [hay fever is already forcing you] to breathe through your mouth, and that gets taken away from you, you\u2019re not left with much.\u201d After that night, Jo never saw her date again. Things are only going to get worse \u201cThere are over 100 million Americans who are touched by some form of allergies \u2013 asthma, eczema, all these things are related, it\u2019s an immune system response,\u201d says Kenny Mendez, president and CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling the direct health impacts of climate change, and unless we get control over that and try to reverse things, then people\u2019s allergies are only going to get worse.\u201d Mendez is particularly worried about allergic-asthma sufferers, who may have asthma attacks triggered by seasonal allergies. These can be fatal if not managed properly. He points out that allergy- and asthma-related health issues are experienced differently along racial and class lines. \u201cOver 3,500 people die from asthma each year, but certain populations are disproportionately impacted. Black Americans are three times more likely to die from asthma, five times more likely to be treated in the emergency room in the US and Black women have the highest mortality rate of any gender or racial group. If you have allergic asthma, and certain communities are living in urban areas that have disproportionate impacts from allergies, and they have allergic asthma, then it\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d Mendez says. Seasonal allergies may sound like a joke to some, but sufferers like Alexa wish they were taken more seriously by wider society. \u201c[My allergies were] definitely written off by teachers and my parents. They would often say things like: \u2018Why are you so exhausted? Why are you being dramatic? No, you can\u2019t stay at home, it\u2019s just allergies.\u2019 But I was really, really unwell.\u201d Attitudes do seem to be changing. Mendez believes that since the outbreak of Covid, many workplaces have become more flexible with employees working from home when showing cold-like symptoms. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just allergies, you go to work, and you say \u2018I\u2019ve got allergies\u2019, and you\u2019re sneezing, coughing and don\u2019t want to be that person, sometimes you\u2019ll just stay home now. I think that\u2019s a little bit more accepted. Employers are saying: if you\u2019re not feeling well, stay home.\u201d Jo agrees, citing a colleague who last week was able to go home because of bad hay fever. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re moving in a better direction,\u201d she says. Yet until the world somehow musters the resolve to address the climate crisis and other factors heightening seasonal allergy symptoms, it seems hay fever sufferers like me will continue enduring the trials and tribulations of our snot-filled summers."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f88", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/11/a-shopping-guide-to-the-best-neutrals", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A shopping guide to the best \u2026 neutrals", "lead": "From a crochet dress to white jeans, these pieces are the cream of the crop", "author": "Melanie Wilkinson", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 09:45:49", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952903", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9ab8ef85c3e16d7fb50067f189fd50a6e1d0f2ea/107_118_4797_2880/500.jpg", "body": "Buy Knit wrap top, \u00a357, arket.com Shorts, \u00a360, withnothingunderneath.com Crochet dress, \u00a375, phase-eight.com *** Rent Ribbed trousers, \u00a337 for four days, by Ports 1961 from mywardrobehq.com White dress with crystal trim, \u00a3105 for three days, by Area from frontrowuk.com Beige top, from \u00a355 by Cult Gaia, from selfridgesrental.com *** Thrift Strappy dress, \u00a340, beyondretro.com White jeans, \u00a332, glass-onion.com Striped shirt, \u00a357.98, by Ralph Lauren from vestiairecollective.com"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f89", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-503-of-the-invasion", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 503 of the invasion", "lead": "France offers longer-range missiles to Kyiv as Nato summit gets underway in Vilnius; Stoltenberg cautions Russia over its nuclear rhetoric", "author": "Martin Belam, Guardian staff and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 09:45:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952921", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8f7ad5c5c5b5db0657edd5bc3709c511b60dbc0d/0_393_5918_3552/500.jpg", "body": "Nato says it has not seen a change in Russia\u2019s nuclear posture despite its announcement that it is stationing nuclear weapons in Belarus.

Hungary\u2019s foreign minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said on Tuesday that there was no concrete timetable set out for Ukraine\u2019s Nato accession in the proposed closing statement of the summit in Vilnius. Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 also said Hungary\u2019s ratification of Sweden\u2019s Nato membership is \u201conly a technical issue\u201d now and the government backs Sweden\u2019s bid. Turkey agreed on Monday to allow Sweden to join Nato, setting the stage for the allies to showcase their unity at a summit focused on supporting Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s block on Sweden\u2019s membership bid had cast a cloud over preparations for Tuesday\u2019s meeting, but the countries ironed out their differences in eleventh-hour talks in Vilnius. Nato\u2019s policy towards Russia increases the risk of direct conflict between bloc members and Moscow, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency cited the Russian ambassador to Belgium Alexander Tokovinin as saying. Ukraine has said it shot down 26 Russian drones overnight, however two got through and caused damage in Odesa. Suspilne reported \u201cTwo kamikaze drones hit the administration building of a port facility in Odesa: two port terminals, including a grain one, caught fire. The fire was extinguished, there were no critical damages or injuries.\u201d Russia\u2019s state-owned Tass news agency is reporting a claim by a retired member of occupation forces in Luhansk that Russia has made significant progress in the direction of Kupiansk. Ukraine said on Monday its troops had caught occupying Russian troops \u201cin a trap\u201d in the shattered eastern city of Bakhmut, where its forces have been gaining ground as part of their counter offensive. Russian accounts of the fighting said Moscow\u2019s forces have repelled or contained Ukrainian advances in the east and south. Hungary\u2019s farm minister will go to Turkey for talks with his Turkish counterpart about extending the deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its Black Sea ports. Istv\u00e1n Nagy said he was holding talks on behalf of countries in central and eastern Europe that had been affected by increased Ukrainian grain flows. The deal is due to expire next week. Moscow has repeatedly said it sees no grounds to extend it, complaining that western sanctions are impacting on its agricultural exports. Russian president Vladimir Putin met with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, just days after a short-lived rebellion by the mercenary chief and his private army, according to the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. A three-hour meeting took place on 29 June, which also involved commanders from the military company Prigozhin founded, Peskov said. Prigozhin has had a longstanding conflict with Russia\u2019s top military brass which on 24 June culminated in an armed mutiny in which he led his fighters into Russia."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f8a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/block-battery-eggs-coming-into-uk-say-animal-welfare-groups-brexit", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Block battery eggs coming into UK, say animal welfare groups", "lead": "RSPCA accuses government of \u2018race to the bottom for animal welfare standards\u2019 with post-Brexit trade deal", "author": "Helena Horton Environment reporter", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 09:36:55", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952941", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0995db4063934db804e7631400bc46563360ccaf/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "Battery eggs should not be sold in the UK as part of post-Brexit trade deals, animal welfare groups have said, as the government prepares to allow them to be imported. As part of the new Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), ministers are expected to give the green light to battery eggs to be imported from countries including Mexico. Many consider battery cages cruel as they confine an egg-laying hen to one cage, connected to other hen cages in a long row. They spend the majority of their lives in these systems, leaving them unable to exhibit normal behaviours. The RSPCA has accused the government of a \u201crace to the bottom for animal welfare standards\u201d as conventional battery systems were banned in the UK in 2012. The CPTPP trade deal is due to be signed on 16 July, and campaigners are calling for the government to disallow eggs not produced to UK animal welfare standards. David Bowles, the head of public affairs at the RSPCA, said: \u201cIf this deal is agreed, it will not only set our own egg producers at a disadvantage, it will also directly impact RSPCA standards on laying hens, which account for over one in two eggs produced in the UK. The government is starting the gun on a race to the bottom for our animal welfare standards.\u201d Egg products could be imported from countries such as Mexico, which relies almost exclusively on battery cages for egg production. Such imports would undercut British egg producers who operate to significantly higher standards of animal welfare under the British Lion code of practice. Dr Nick Palmer, the head of compassion at World Farming UK, added: \u201cWithout adequate tariffs to only allow imported eggs produced to UK standards, the doors will be wide open for powdered and liquid eggs from countries with lower or no animal welfare standards \u2013 this is not what UK consumers expect of our government, which promotes high standards of hen welfare, environmental protection and food safety.\u201d There have recently been concerns about the egg supply chain, after bird flu and costs caused farms to go out of business. From late last year, there were egg shortages in supermarkets, with some sourcing eggs from Italy. The chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, Mark Williams, said: \u201cIt is almost unbelievable that the government would let consumers down like this. Shoppers will be horrified to learn that eggs in their food products could soon be coming from battery cages more than a decade after they were banned here. \u201cTo rubberstamp a deal which effectively sanctions the importation of eggs from conventional (battery) caged systems which are outlawed here is not only counter-intuitive, but it also completely undermines the countrywide standards that are adhered to by the UK egg industry. This particularly affects the egg products sector which could see the importation of low welfare eggs, whilst UK egg farmers rightly continue to invest in ensuring higher welfare standards for their birds.\u201d The CPTPP trade deal with Canada, Mexico and other countries has caused concern among animal welfare campaigners as there is also the possibility of low-welfare pork being imported. In Canada, there are more than 7,400 pig farms, and animal charities in the country say pigs there face castration, ear notching, tail docking and teeth trimming. Sows are kept for long periods in stalls that do not give them room to turn around, a practice banned in the UK. Pigs are also often left to live on cold, damp, slatted floors with no room for bedding or straw, the campaigners say. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe are committed to protecting high animal welfare standards globally, as the prime minister recently emphasised in open letter to British farmers. We have not lowered our food, animal welfare or environmental standards in order to accede to CPTPP and there have been no imports of eggs from CPTPP members to the UK since 2015. \u201cGlobal trade flows on shell eggs are minimal as it is not practical to trade shell eggs for human consumption over long distances and exports of egg products are not significant within the CPTPP membership.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f8b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/aretha-franklin-will-to-be-contested-by-her-children-in-court", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Aretha Franklin\u2019s children to contest her will in court", "lead": "Three of Franklin\u2019s four children are disputing the validity of documents left by the late singer in 2010 and 2014", "author": "Laura Snapes", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 09:33:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.952961", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/769018336ed2317a93e444a29c39919515f93460/0_279_4206_2524/500.jpg", "body": "A jury is to determine which of two handwritten wills found at Aretha Franklin\u2019s home in Detroit, Michigan, is the late musician\u2019s valid last testament, as disputed by her sons.

Kecalf Franklin and Edward Franklin, her second and fourth sons, say a will discovered in a spiral notebook under a cushion, dated March 2014, is in fact the primary will. In the latter, Kecalf is the co-executor and would inherit his mother\u2019s $1.2m (\u00a3934,000) gated mansion. Franklin, a fiercely private woman, was said to have resisted writing a formal will despite years of ill health. She died in August 2018 at the age of 76. Her assets were to be equally split between her sons until the discovery of the wills nine months later. Her fortune was estimated at $80m at the time of her death, but has subsequently been reduced to just under $6m given more recent valuations and years of unpaid taxes. A six-person jury at the Oakland County probate court will hear from three of Franklin\u2019s four children: Franklin\u2019s first son, Clarence Franklin, who has special needs and lives under a guardianship in an assisted living facility, is not involved in the case. A lawyer for his guardian told the BBC that whatever the outcome, Clarence would receive a percentage of the estate. The purpose of the case which began on Monday, Judge Jennifer Callaghan told the jurors, was to determine whether the 2014 document is a valid will.

Playing Out, a national charity set up to help parents close roads for play, has reported a rise in temporary road closures on residential streets as parents try to help children play outside safely. Its co-director Alice Ferguson said: \u201cTraffic danger is the number one reason children don\u2019t play outside like they used to. We need to reclaim the space on children\u2019s doorsteps. Children aren\u2019t getting the physical exercise they need and their mental health is at breaking point. \u201cPlaying Out is part of a growing movement of groups calling for urgent action on safer streets for children. We need government at the highest level to look at this urgently. We need to see rules of 20mph in all residential areas and we need to bring in planning law that considers children need to play outside.\u201d Simon Panrucker, a Bristol resident who says he lives on a \u201crat run\u201d, has started working with neighbours to close one of his local streets intermittently to allow children to play outside. \u201cCars speed along here and I\u2019m nervous all the time that my kid is going to run out and get hit by a car,\u201d he said. The call for a reduction of traffic on residential streets follows several high-profile road incidents involving children. Two children died after a Land Rover crashed through a school fence in Wimbledon, south-west London, last week. In Birmingham, families staged a protest after four people died, including two children, and four were seriously injured by motorists in separate incidents in a month. Brake, the road safety charity, is calling for 20mph speed limits to be implemented around all schools in the UK. In 2021, 11,580 children aged 15 or under were killed or injured on roads in the UK. The annual average over the past five years is 13,503. Provisional figures for 2022 show 48 children died on roads in the UK, equivalent to one child almost every week.

At the heart of Nato lies a commitment for each member state to defend the other if they are attacked, meaning that if Ukraine were to join while the war was continuing, it could immediately draw member states into a fight against Russia. Ukraine is hoping for a clear pathway to membership once the fighting stops but so far the US and Germany have proved resistant to agreeing any firm timescales or clear conditions, leaving Kyiv and some of its keener backers in Nato frustrated. Sunak\u2019s comments do not suggest American resistance has been overcome.

The judgment noted \u201csystemic failure\u201d, including staffing shortages, inadequate infrastructure and an \u201cinability to manage detainees\u201d with difficult behaviour. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The court ruled the Department of Justice had detained the teenage girl and two teenage boys for \u201cprolonged periods \u2013 in effect, solitary confinement\u201d \u2013 and breached the Young Offenders Act by not allowing sufficient time outside of their cells for exercise. The court granted an injunction restraining staff from further confining the youths without appropriate orders, and without providing the exercise they are lawfully entitled to. Justice Paul Tottle said the fact the minors were subjected to frequent solitary confinement was not only \u201cinconsistent with objectives and principles\u201d of the law but also \u201cwith basic notions of the humane treatment of young people\u201d. The ruling found prolonged lockdowns on already psychologically vulnerable young people had the ability to cause \u201cimmeasurable and lasting damage\u201d. The judgement noted the young detainees in their evidence said prolonged solitary confinement led to them self-harming or threatening suicide, including incidents which required treatment in hospital. Tottle ruled that the department illegally confined the teenage girl for 12 days, while the two teenage boys were confined to their cells for 133 days and 22 days, respectively. \u201cThe imposition of frequent periods of solitary confinement on young people evidences a systemic failure,\u201d Tottle said. \u201cThe seriousness of the systemic failure is made manifest by the recognition that solitary confinement is an exceptional form of detention rarely sanctioned even in adult prisons.\u201d The judgement noted Department of Justice staffing concerns contributed to the lockdowns. Eighty-eight fulltime youth custodial officer positions were listed as vacant, with mandated shift breaks affecting capacity. The Department of Justice\u2019s deputy commissioner said the centre was looking to address the issues with staffing levels, improving infrastructure \u201cand calming things down at Banksia Hill\u201d including providing staff with \u201cadditional support and training\u201d. Wayne Nannup, the chief executive officer of Aboriginal Legal Service WA, labelled the ruling \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Nannup said the Banksia Hill detention centre was in \u201ccrisis\u201d and urged the state government to overhaul systemic issues at the centre. \u201cNothing short of a drastic overhaul of the way things have been done will address the serious, systemic problems at these centres,\u201d Nannup said. \u201cThese children deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, not confined to their cells for long periods of isolation. They need fresh air, human connection, education and adults to mentor them.\u201d A spokesperson for the WA government said: \u201cThe Department of Justice has undertaken extensive work to address these issues, with updated practices to ensure any necessary confinement is within the law. \u201cOut-of-cell hours are maximised wherever there is the opportunity, noting the challenges staff face managing complex and often violent detainees. \u201cSignificant infrastructure damage and regular critical incidents have impacted efforts to provide detainees with increased time out-of-cell. \u201cThe state government\u2019s more than $100m investment in infrastructure, services and staff is delivering promising early results, with increased out-of-cell hours achieved at Banksia Hill in recent times.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Bury every skipping rope Paint the walls dark brown Abolish all hope.\u201d That\u2019s a poem just written by that wise and beloved children\u2019s champion, Michael Rosen, in response to the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick. It\u2019s a \u201cStop all the clocks\u201d for children, and a retort to Jenrick\u2019s order to staff at an asylum seeker reception centre for children to black out Mickey Mouse and Winnie-the-Pooh murals. Staff at the Kent intake unit resisted, but Jenrick was reportedly adamant, to make clear, he said, that this was a \u201claw enforcement environment\u201d and \u201cnot a welcome centre\u201d, doggedly mimicking his boss, Suella Braverman. Here was performative politics for imagined rightwing voters, but even they may have blenched, like many of his own MPs. There was little danger of this unit becoming a welcome centre, since its last inspection report found the toilets \u201cunacceptably dirty\u201d with a \u201ctoo limited\u201d range of toys for young children and \u201clittle reading material\u201d. A Tory minister going to war with Mickey Mouse is pitch-perfect political imagery for the ending of their era. May he be greeted forever by people wearing Mickey Mouse ears. Philip Pullman tweeted: \u201cCold, cruel, the act of a soul that\u2019s shrivelled and mean to its core.\u201d Stephen Kinnock, the shadow migration minister, said: \u201cAll they have left is tough talk and cruel and callous policies,\u201d as the story flew around the world to shame us all yet again. So Jenrick enters the firmament of infamy reserved for politicians who occasionally leap out of the ranks of obscurity into the history books as the perfect emblem of their political times. Ann Widdecombe was one, when she sprang to notoriety as prisons minister for shackling female prisoners to iron bedsteads with handcuffs and chains as they gave birth: the image resonated because it so perfectly captured her party\u2019s punitive politics. Jenrick\u2019s vileness reverberates because he is not some maverick child-cruncher, but an emblem of a government that has, for utterly bewildering reasons, deliberately focused its austerity on families and children. They have borne the brunt, not by accident, but with intent. Naturally, migrant children are the top target (unless they die in the sea when ministers shed a waterfall of crocodile tears). The sinister disappearance of asylum children, probably stolen, from hotels where they were dumped would normally see any civilised government set off a hue and cry to find their fate. But since British-born children receive similar negligence, it\u2019s no surprise that didn\u2019t happen: rising numbers of children in care are being dumped far away into profiteering homes in cheap and deprived areas. Let\u2019s riffle through government priorities of these past 13 years, to show this is not hyperbole. However hard the times, you might expect any civilised society to put children first, yet time and again they come last. Within a stricken NHS, maternity services have suffered especially badly; a third of health visitors are gone; and even in mental health, child and adolescent services have the longest waits. They might call this austerity\u2019s accidental collateral damage, but benefits policy deliberately impoverishes children. George Osborne led the charge with benefit cuts that stripped \u00a337bn mostly from families. His two-child limit on benefits deprived parents of \u00a32,800 for a third child, and pushed 1.1 million more children into poverty, making a total of 4.2 million last year. His benefit cap crushes those in high-rent areas. The acid tone was set by David Cameron in 2012, saying: \u201cQuite simply, we have been encouraging working-age people to have children and not work.\u201d Labour lifted 800,000 children out of relative poverty, but if the Tories are still in power by 2027 they will wipe out the last of that gain, says the Resolution Foundation. One totemic result will last: British children have shrunk in height in relation to those in similar countries. Here\u2019s another effect: the birth rate rose in Labour years, when babies were welcomed with a child trust fund at birth and with 3,500 Sure Start centres, now mostly gone or radically reduced. But since 2012, births have plummeted by an alarming and economically harmful 12.2%. Children have become unaffordable to a generation that is worse off than their parents at baby-producing age, now spending a third of their wages on nurseries, with lower incomes, higher rents and heavy debt. Look what else children have lost since 2010. Places to play are degraded by \u00a3330m cuts to parks\u2019 upkeep, often leaving wrecked playgrounds. More than 700 community football pitches have gone, along with 200 school playing fields sold off and 400 swimming pools closed. Nearly 800 libraries have gone, those havens for children on winter days. In culturally depleted schools, cuts in arts teachers has left a 40% fall in students taking any GCSE arts. All this had already happened when the pandemic struck: children paid the Covid price, locked in and shut out of school, not to save themselves but the lives of older people. Where\u2019s the gratitude for all they lost?

The Global Tuna Alliance partners, which account for 32% of global tuna sales and represent Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose, Asda, Marks &amp; Spencer and Aldi in the UK, joined the Sustainable Seafood Coalition, made up of 45 British seafood firms, to condemn the rush to mine the seabed. A growing list of countries have also called for a halt to deep-sea mining, at a key moment for the fledgling industry as the International Seabed Authority (ISA) meets this week to determine rules for mining \u2013 or, potentially, to press pause on the endeavour. The seafood groups said in a letter released alongside the study that they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the potential impacts of deep-sea mining on sustainable fisheries, given the \u201csignificant overlap\u201d between future fishing grounds and areas licensed for mineral exploration. The study, published in Nature npj Ocean Sustainability, suggests that some of the world\u2019s most valuable fisheries will increasingly overlap with deep-sea mining operations as warming oceans alter the tuna\u2019s range. It focuses on the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), an area of the Pacific Ocean south-east of Hawaii containing 1.1m sq km (424,712 sq miles) of exploration contracts. The study looked at future biomass of tropical tuna under two climate crisis scenarios: moderate and high emissions. The total biomass for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfish tuna in the CCZ is predicted to increase by 10-11%, 30-31% and by 23% respectively by the mid-21st century. This could result in increasing conflict between the two industries if more tuna catches are carried out in mining areas, researchers said. Prof Douglas McCauley, a co-author of the study from the University of California, Santa Barbara and the director of the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory, said: \u201cThese fishing grounds may be distant, but the food they produce is consumed by millions. We would be horrified at dumping mining waste across our food-producing regions on land. We shouldn\u2019t be rushing into a decision that could significantly harm ocean ecosystems essential to planetary health and global food security.\u201d Tuna populations in the CCZ could be affected by deep-sea mining in different ways, researchers said, although the effect of each has yet to be calculated. The generation of sediment plumes that can travel long distances could prevent feeding or visual communication; potentially toxic metals could be absorbed by species; and noise and light pollution could disrupt behaviour, cause stress and force changes in migratory routes. Daniel Suddaby, the executive director at Global Tuna Alliance, said he was concerned the world was entering \u201cuncharted territory\u201d of risks from deep-sea mining. \u201cFrom threats of prey food shortages due to disrupted midwater ecosystems to the potential upheaval of migration patterns caused by mining disturbances, we must navigate this uncertain landscape with caution. With climate change scenarios further complicating the picture, we cannot underestimate the stakes involved.\u201d The letter calls for a pause on deep-sea mining until there is a \u201cclear understanding\u201d of the potential impacts, and urged the ISA to agree \u201cstrong, scientifically grounded regulations\u201d before granting any exploration contracts."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f91", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/11/northern-lights-could-be-visible-dozen-us-states", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Northern lights could be visible in more than a dozen US states this week", "lead": "A geomagnetic storm forecast could make aurora borealis more visible at lower latitudes", "author": "Gloria Oladipo", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 09:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953072", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2386dfbf8b35cee49f97f4f4679096deba16f743/0_200_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "The northern lights may present themselves in more than a dozen states this week as a geomagnetic storm makes them more visible at lower latitudes than usual. On Wednesday and Thursday, the lights \u2013 also known as aurora borealis \u2013 have the potential to be seen, weather permitting, in parts of Washington, Idaho, Vermont, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Maine, according to forecasters at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Several Canadian cities, including Halifax, will also be able to view the twinkling display. The storm is slated to be the strongest on Thursday and the colors will intensify, according to the forecasters at the university\u2019s Geophysical Institute. \u201cModerate\u201d northern light activity is also expected on Friday, visible in parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, NBC News reported. The aurora is caused by atoms and molecules in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere colliding with charged particles coming down from the sun. Stronger solar storms, when the sun emits large bursts of energy, are making the northern lights more visible in areas where they are not typically seen. The term, aurora borealis, was first coined by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1619. The celestial phenomenon is named after a combination of two names: Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn, and Boreas, the Greek god of the northern wind, Space.com reports. The earliest sightings of the aurora date back almost 30,000 years. A French cave painting dated back to 30,000 BC depicted a suspected aurora, according to information from Nasa. Notably, the northern lights can be difficult to spot. The display is most visible between September and April when the sky gets dark enough, Space.com reports. The best way to catch a glimpse of the shimmering sky is to go out at night, away from city lights, and when the aurora will be most visible, between 10pm to 2am local time, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (Noaa). The organization also suggests that those eager to see the celestial show head north as they are more likely to see lights the farther northward they travel. Noaa also provides forecasts of the northern lights, and maps of where the display is most likely to be seen."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f92", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/key-pillars-of-migration-bill-have-been-abandoned-says-patel", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Key pillars of illegal migration bill have been abandoned, says Patel", "lead": "Former home secretary criticises concessions as cabinet minister insists progress can be made to stop Channel crossings", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 08:49:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953090", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5cf1eccbe2894e88b9bfc609f048a8e149a5eca1/104_172_1833_1100/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has said his \u201cplan is working\u201d to realise a re-election pledge on stopping small boat crossings of the Channel, as a former Tory home secretary said key pillars of flagship legislation on migration had been \u201cabandoned\u201d. The prime minister was reacting en route to the Nato summit in Luthuania after ministers were forced on Monday night to offer rebel Conservative MPs concessions on the illegal migration bill amid growing concern it would fail to pass through the Commons. After figures at the weekend showed more than 1,300 people had crossed the Channel in small boats over three days, with the Home Office on Friday recording highest daily figure so far this year, Sunak also said he had previously \u201csaid very deliberately that crossings would increase over the summer\u201d. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding that fact. I fully expected crossings to rise over the Summer. I said that at the time, very clearly. But I do think the plan is working,\u201d he told journalists in Vilnius. Sunak added that the government was making progress on all other aspects of its plan to realise his pledge to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, by reducing a backlog in asylum applications by almost a fifth. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress on accommodation as well, finding migrant barges as alternatives to house people, also large sites \u2026 on all those different measures, we\u2019re making progress. \u201cI always said it would be a difficult problem to fix. I always said it would take time. The bill is an important part of that and as you know it is making its progress through parliament,\u201d he said. However, pressure continued to come from the government backbenches as the former home secretary Priti Patel tweeted: \u201cWe were told that the illegal migration bill would \u2018stop the boats\u2019. Key pillars of that bill have now been abandoned.\u201d She also said her former department was now spending \u00a3500,000 a day on 5,000 empty hotel beds as a buffer for higher than expected numbers of people crossing the Channel. Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the Home Office maintains the buffer in an attempt to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. Patel\u2019s comments came as Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, was challenged before a key vote in parliament this evening after the government changed its illegal migration bill to limit detention periods for children and pregnant women. MPs will vote later on 20 changes backed by the Lords. Ministers have been forced to offer rebel Conservative MPs concessions on the bill amid growing concern that it would fail to pass through the Commons. The government has dropped nearly all of the retrospective applications of the bill\u2019s measures \u2013 a move that means Suella Braverman will no longer be obliged to deport thousands of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK this summer to a third country such as Rwanda. Ministers will also limit plans to detain children and pregnant women who arrive in the UK on small boats. They have not offered any specific compromises to protect victims of modern slavery, as previously demanded by MPs including Theresa May and Iain Duncan Smith. On another central plank of the government\u2019s plans, Stride predicted it would get the \u201cright result\u201d at the supreme court after a majority of appeal judges ruled this month that plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their applications processed were unlawful. Asked if there was a plan B, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. At the court of appeal, the lead judge was in favour of the government\u2019s decision. \u201cBut we have had the opportunity now to address some of the issues that may have been of concern to other judges. It will now go to the supreme court and I suspect it will go through with the right result from the government\u2019s point of view.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f93", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/11/football-transfer-rumours-psg-enter-the-race-to-land-harry-kane", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football transfer rumours: PSG enter the race to land Harry Kane?", "lead": "Thiago to Galatasaray? | Newcastle looking to sell Saint-Maximin? | Real Madrid keen on James?", "author": "Rob Smyth", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 08:39:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953108", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4152c2327659919c47c4c2d9de8422f38e71bd5f/0_322_4000_2399/500.jpg", "body": "Before we turn to the daily bread of transfer rumours, we must address the elephant in the room, a bit of gossip that the entire country is talking about.

In their first public appearance before Australian members of parliament since the government joined Canada, the US and the UK in banning TikTok from government-owned devices amid concerns about the company\u2019s connections to China, TikTok executives were questioned at length by a parliamentary committee examining foreign interference on social media. Liberal senator and chair of the committee James Paterson, who has led the opposition\u2019s push against the app, questioned how many times Australian user data had been accessed by TikTok staff based within China. Farrell could not provide the number immediately, but admitted it did happen. Farrell said there were \u201ca number of protections in place\u201d, including that employees only get the minimum amount of access to data to do their job, and when they access that data they need to provide a business justification that needs to be approved by their manager and the database owner within TikTok. If the data is being accessed across a national border, it has to be approved by the global security team based in the US, which also monitors all data access. \u201cEmployees can\u2019t get access without a clear justification and levels of approval,\u201d Farrell said. A similar security review would apply if an employee based in China tried to change the recommendations algorithm, he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company\u2019s local head of public policy, Ella Woods-Joyce, said China\u2019s 2017 national security law \u2013 which requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to national security \u2013 would apply to any company that had operations and staff in China. When asked on what ground TikTok would refuse to comply with the law, Woods-Joyce said TikTok had never been asked for personal data by the Chinese government and would refuse if asked. In October, TikTok\u2019s ANZ managing director, Lee Hunter, claimed in a Daily Telegraph opinion piece that reports about TikTok monitoring the specific location of American citizens were false. \u201cTikTok has never been used to \u2018target\u2019 any members of the US government, activists, public figures or journalists, nor do we serve them a different content experience than other users,\u201d he said at the time. It was revealed in December that employees had used the app to attempt to identify the source of a leak to journalists. Hunter told the committee that he stood by the sentiments expressed in his original article, and blamed \u201crogue employees\u201d who had since been fired from the company for accessing the data. He said \u201cserious misconduct from these rogue employees\u201d had taken place. He said GPS location information was not collected in Australia. Paterson took aim at another China-owned app, WeChat, which was asked to appear before the committee on multiple occasions but refused. The company has said it has no presence in Australia, and Paterson admitted this meant that the parliament could not compel the company to speak to the committee. Paterson indicated the failure to appear could lead to adverse recommendations against the app in the committee\u2019s report. \u201cCompelling evidence has been put to the committee by expert witnesses that WeChat engages in surveillance, censorship and foreign interference on its platform,\u201d he said. \u201cWeChat has an estimated userbase of 1 million people in Australia, yet does not have an Australian presence and does not feel the need to even pretend to participate in the inquiries of a parliament. \u201cIt is untenable for a company with such an influence on our diaspora communities to continue to operate with impunity and demonstrated disregard for our government without consequences.\u201d Paterson said if the recommendations of the committee were unfavourable to WeChat \u201cthey\u2019ll have no one to blame but themselves\u201d. WeChat said in a letter published by Paterson on Twitter that it would be responsive in writing to the committee and would answer any questions the committee has. Paterson said the company was continuing to show contempt for the parliament. Unlike TikTok, WeChat is not covered by a blanket restriction from federal government devices, despite similar concerns over the data collection and security on the app."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f95", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jul/11/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-germany-nato-climate-club-indigenous-voice-support-falls-robodebt-scheme-rental-crisis", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Crocodile euthanised after attack on man at NT swimming spot \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.", "author": "Emily Wind and Rafqa Touma (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 08:30:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953144", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a3dc46e4e9ca1aafd5a6443de0e624706b55bbc8/0_174_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Thanks for following along on the liveblog.

Northern Territory rangers have euthanised the crocodile that bit a man at Wangi Falls yesterday. The NT department of environment, parks and water security confirmed in a statement that the 2.4m saltwater crocodile was euthanised overnight. Access to the popular swimming spot in the Litchfield national park remains closed, and crocodile surveys will be undertaken prior to reopening. Yesterday, a 67-year-old man was swimming at Wangi Falls about 11.30am when he was struck by the reptile, sustaining non-life threatening injuries to his arm and back. The department\u2019s director for northern Australian parks, Dean McAdam, said: Public safety is our key priority, so please obey all closures and do not enter the water while we are completing the crocodile surveys. We work hard to reduce the risk of crocodiles in the management zones, however there is always the chance they can move into an area undetected.

The federal court signed off on the order today, agreed between Crown and financial regulator Austrac earlier this year. Dreyfus praised Austrac for its work. He said in a statement: Casinos are at serious risk of exploitation by criminals seeking to launder illicit funds and have a clear responsibility to help protect our financial system from these threats. Businesses who fail to meet their obligations and systematically breach the law should know that AUSTRAC will take whatever action is necessary to ensure they comply with the [Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing] Act. Dreyfus noted Crown\u2019s admission that it operated in contravention of the AML/CTF Act, that its failings were very serious, and allowed high-risk activity to go undetected or unaddressed for many years. He said: This order sends the clearest possible signal to the gambling and casino sectors that they must be vigilant to the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing and ensure they stop these criminals from using their services to launder the proceeds of their crimes. SA Health publishes weekly flu update In more health news, South Australia Health has published its weekly flu update. There are currently 33 people in hospital in the state with influenza, and 921 new cases were reported in the past week. Rise in Victorian gastro superbug cases sparks public warning Cases of a gastro superbug are rising in Victoria, prompting a warning from the state\u2019s public health chief, AAP reports. The outgoing Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has issued an alert over increasing antibiotic-resistant shigella bacteria infections, also known as shigellosis. Shigellosis is a bowel infection and can lead to acute diarrhoea, fever, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. It is highly contagious and can be transmitted through sexual contact. Sutton warned: Symptoms usually develop one to three days following exposure but can occur as early as 12 hours to as late as one week afterwards in some cases. Cases remain infectious while the shigella bacteria continue to be shed in faeces. This can last for up to four weeks after symptoms resolve. Many of the antibiotic-resistant Victorian cases have been identified among men who have had recent sexual contact with other men, while others involved returned travellers. Health officials are contacting those diagnosed with the shigellosis superbug and their contacts with advice about monitoring for symptoms, testing and exclusion requirements. Sutton urged people with gastrointestinal symptoms to practise safer sex, maintain good hygiene and avoid preparing food or caring for others. Frosty mornings in store for parts of Queensland and NSW Large parts of Queensland and NSW could be in for a chilly morning tomorrow after experiencing frost and sub-zero temperatures early today, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

Here is what he had to say before he boarded: Richard Boyle\u2019s trial has been delayed by another 12 months and will not take place until at least September 2024. Boyle, a former tax official who blew the whistle on the government\u2019s aggressive pursuit of debts, was due to face trial later this year in the South Australian district court. Boyle had sought to use whistleblower protections to end the case against him. The district court ruled against Boyle and denied him whistleblower protections earlier this year. His lawyers are currently appealing against the Public Interest Disclosure Act decision. The appeal will pose another major test of the strength of the nation\u2019s whistleblowing laws. The trial was on Tuesday delayed for a further year to allow the appeal process to be completed. His trial will now not take place until September 2024. Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender said it meant Boyle would have had a prosecution hanging over him for almost seven years by the time his trial takes place. The ongoing delay of the prosecution of Richard Boyle only underscores the injustice of the case. Boyle spoke up about wrongdoing at the tax office; he has been vindicated by multiple independent inquiries and yet his prosecution drags on. Penny Wong announces new ambassadors and high commissioners The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has announced the appointment of Australia\u2019s new high commissioners and ambassadors: David Jessup as Australia\u2019s first resident high commissioner to the Republic of Maldives. Matt Skelly as Australia\u2019s next high commissioner to Malta. Skelly will also be accredited to Tunisia. Rachel Moseley as Australia\u2019s next ambassador to Mexico. Moseley will also be accredited to Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and the Dominican Republic. Shane Flanagan as Australia\u2019s next ambassador to Qatar. Brenton Garlick as Australia\u2019s next high commissioner to Tuvalu. Vanessa Wood as Australia\u2019s next ambassador for arms control and counter-proliferation. James Larsen as Australia\u2019s next ambassador and permanent representative to the UN in New York. Wong said: The appointment of Australia\u2019s first resident high commissioner in Mal\u00e9, Maldives demonstrates Australia\u2019s increased engagement in the Indian Ocean, including through the Indian Ocean Rim Association. I thank the outgoing ambassadors and high commissioners for their contributions to advancing Australia\u2019s interests. Labor senator calls robodebt \u2018a train wreck\u2019 while Liberal MP defends Morrison\u2019s seat The Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill is speaking on the ABC about the robodebt royal commission, labelling it \u201cthe most gross failure of public office that could be imagined\u201d. It was a train wreck, being revealed, night after night in the Senate \u2026 I think we shouldn\u2019t put away the words of the commissioner, that this was a crude and cruel mechanism, it was neither fair nor legal, and it made people feel like criminals, and that\u2019s exactly what they said when they were giving evidence. The Liberal MP James Stevens said the government \u201cshould facilitate a process to determine appropriate compensation\u201d. Stevens is asked if former PM Scott Morrison\u2019s seat in parliament is feasible. Morrison has faced calls from across the political spectrum to resign in the wake of the robodebt report. Stevens argues Morrison should stay: He is the duly elected member for the seat of Cook and there\u2019s no grounds for a member of parliament to be hounded out of the parliament. You serve your full term. Google on \u2018cutting edge\u2019 of work to detect AI-generated content, senate committee hears The Greens senator David Shoebridge is continuing to provide updates on social media from today\u2019s hearing of the Senate committee on foreign interference through social media. During a hearing this afternoon, Google said it was using artificial intelligence to detect harms and enhance security online, saying: This is going to be somewhat of an arms race between attackers and defenders. Google says it is on the cutting edge of the detection work to better inform users about AI generated content. Shoebridge says there is an important role for the government to play in ensuring transparency and accountability when it comes to the use of AI and AI-generated content. He tweeted: The Government needs to be proactive in this space to ensure it protects users, social cohesion and democracy. This will take more than hoping these platforms do the right thing. Prosecco and feta among main sticking points in EU trade deal, shadow minister says The shadow trade minister, Kevin Hogan, just spoke on the ABC from Lismore on the free trade agreement negotiations between Australia and the EU. He listed the main sticking points as prosecco and feta, and other dairy products like parmesan: Just to take prosecco as one example we don\u2019t think the government should cave in any shape or form on that one \u2026 [it] was found to be a grape variety not a geographical position. \u2026 It is important for the prosecco industry in Australia that they not to lose the right to that name, as it is for feta and other dairy products. \u2026 This is life and death for them [for that industry and] we have to hold out. Hogan said that the EU has done free trade agreements before now, arguing they have \u201cgiven much better quotes than what they are offering to us now\u201d: We should get one of the best deals we can. Former EU trade boss on deal with Australia The former EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan also spoke to the ABC from Brussels. He said a lot of ground work has been done during five years of negotiations on the FTA between Australia and the EU, and it would be \u201cunthinkable if it failed this last hurdle\u201d. His assessment is that Europe wants to do a deal but needs to strike the right balance between \u201csensitivities and insight\u201d, like Australia: There are very important sensitivities, in both continents, but that is the art of the possible in politics and I hope and expect we would be able to reach an accommodation with each other. EU trade negotiations around agriculture \u2018really tough\u2019, farmers group says The National Farmers\u2019 Federation chief executive, Tony Mahar, spoke to the ABC from Brussels about Australia\u2019s fair trade agreement negotiations with the EU. He said negotiations are continuing but are \u201creally tough\u201d, especially around agriculture. He said agriculture is always one of the last issues to be agreed to and can be difficult because the agriculture is so culturally sensitive: If we\u2019re talking about things like geographical indicators for the dairy sector, beef and lamb imports, sugar, horticulture, some of these sectors are really challenging and it goes down to the different product. Mahar said the Farmers\u2019 Federation their advice to the government is to walk away from the deal if Australia doesn\u2019t get the commercial outcomes for farmers it wants: It\u2019s not worth doing a deal just for the sake of it. These negotiations have been going on for a number of years. Our advice to government is walk away, let the dust settle a little bit, come back in a few months\u2019 time, have another go. It\u2019s too important not to get it right. These agreements are in place \u2026 for decades after. So we want to make sure that we get this right for Australian farmers from the first day for the decades that follow. Sydney toll network facing \u2018number of problems\u2019, review chair says Sydney appears unlikely to ditch its reputation as one of the world\u2019s most tolled cities, as a landmark review of its patchwork toll network hears of the complexities standing in the way of radical change. On the first of three days of public hearings held by the independent review commissioned by the New South Wales Labor government, tolling goliath Transurban, which operates 11 of Sydney\u2019s paid motorways, said it was \u201copen to discussions\u201d on reform approaches floated so far to simplify Sydney\u2019s network that include toll zones as well as distance-based and time-of-day charges. However Michele Huey, NSW group executive at Transurban, appeared to downplay the company\u2019s dominance in the market, warning that other investors in its paid roads, particularly superannuation funds, would also need to be convinced that reforms would not adversely affect the toll contracts \u2013 known as concession \u2013 they\u2019re invested in. Chris Jackson, Transurban\u2019s general manager of customer experience, said the company was open to improving signage on its toll roads to communicate costs but also the time savings motorists stood to benefit from. Huey added that \u201cfrom a competition perspective, we would consider our sector to be one of the most competitive and also regulated areas\u201d, noting drivers always had the choice of a free alternative road. She also said Transurban\u2019s toll roads had freed up local roads in Sydney from pollution and wear and tear. However later on Tuesday, Bryce Spelta, manager of infrastructure at Sydney\u2019s Bayside council, said the impact of the M5 East toll in 2020 had seen heavy vehicle movements on one suburban road increase by 300% since 2015 as trucks were unable to afford the toll charges, which are routinely multiplied by three for heavy vehicles. Warren Clark, CEO of the National Road Transport Association that represents truck operators, said it was not uncommon for members to spend $100,000 on tolls a year, and that many larger operators spent this in a month. He said it costs more in tolls to distribute freight from Sydney\u2019s west to the northern beaches than the driver\u2019s wages. Allan Fels, the former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair leading the review, acknowledged the complexities raised on the first day of hearings. \u201cThere are a number of problems. If we took any one of those problems and solved it, it would be in conflict\u201d with other problems in the system, he said.

She said: You need to implement policies that will work. What we need to do now is look at the available priorities to us where we\u2019re in agreement. Jones said she looked forward to sharing ideas with Heather Holst, the Victorian residential tenancies commissioner since 2018. In recent years the state has banned all forms of rental bidding, introduced rental minimum standards, allowed modifications by renters, and expanded the definition of \u201curgent repairs\u201d to include mould and damp. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said Jones had a massive job to navigate complex legislative and marketplace changes to make renting fair. But he won\u2019t make that easier by accepting every change she recommends: We\u2019re the executive government, we\u2019ve been elected to make decisions on behalf of the people of NSW. But I don\u2019t see that being vastly different from any other commissioner that we\u2019ve employed in NSW that can provide public, independent advice about the best way to move forward. NSW rental commissioner to push for affordable housing The new advocate for NSW\u2019s two million renters will continue calling for more social housing but has shied away from a recent stance on rent bidding, AAP reports. The rental commissioner Trina Jones says she will prioritise quality, affordability and fairness as her independent office champions community-wide changes to the rental system. Jones said part of improving conditions for renters would be continuing to call for more investment in social housing. She told reporters today: The evidence and policy is clear that investment in housing that people can afford can have knock-on impacts to ensure that rental is more affordable. But she declined to say whether she would maintain the position taken in June by Homelessness NSW in an inquiry into secret rent bidding. Labor made an election promise to make rent bidding transparent, only to ditch the proposal when experts warned it could further inflate the market. Homelessness NSW told a rent bidding inquiry that an effective compromise could be banning agents and landlords from accepting a price higher than initially advertised. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has shared a clip on social media from his earlier press conference, speaking on why he is attending the Nato summit in Lithuania: Senator calls on government to mandate TikTok ban on employee devices As hearings of the Senate select committee on foreign interference through social media continue today, the shadow home affairs and cyber security minister, James Paterson, has welcomed news that consulting firm BCG has banned TikTok from the devices of its employees working on government clients. Paterson tweeted: It\u2019s time for the Albanese government to mandate this requirement for all contractors. Increased access to medical abortion \u2018so important\u2019: Tanya Plibersek Politicians are reacting to news that medical abortions will become easier to access under new rules allowing doctors and pharmacists without specialist certification to prescribe termination pills. Labor MP Tanya Plibersek said the move was \u201cso important\u201d, tweeting: Accessible reproductive health is a fundamental right. The deputy Greens leader, Mehreen Faruqi, said the decision marks another barrier down for reproductive healthcare access, particularly for those in regional and remote areas. She wrote on Twitter: Our work isn\u2019t done yet, there are still many barriers \u2026 Abortion should be accessible and provided through our public hospitals, fee-free and covered by Medicare. You can read more on the new rules here: For World Population Day, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has shared a snapshot of the nation\u2019s population 20 years ago compared to now: Ben Roberts-Smith has lodged an appeal against his defeat in a war crimes defamation trial in the federal court. Justice Anthony Besanko found last month that the newspapers he was suing had proven in their defence that Roberts-Smith had, on the balance of probabilities, murdered unarmed civilians while serving in the Australian military in Afghanistan. The judge found Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and Australia\u2019s most decorated living soldier, was complicit in four murders, and was \u201cnot an honest and reliable witness\u201d who had \u201cmotives to lie\u201d to the court. The Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times published a series of reports in 2018 that alleged Roberts-Smith was involved in murdering civilians, including kicking a handcuffed man off a cliff, ordering subordinate soldiers to kill prisoners, and placing weapons on the bodies of murdered people in order to fake combat deaths. Roberts-Smith sued for defamation. Judgment in the year-long trial was handed down last month, dismissing Roberts-Smith\u2019s claim. Roberts-Smith filed his appeal on Tuesday afternoon, two days before the deadline to appeal expired. His appeal will be heard before the full bench of the federal court at a date to be fixed. The Greens senator David Shoebridge has been tweeting highlights from today\u2019s hearings of the Senate select committee on foreign interference through social media. This afternoon, representatives from TikTok are being questioned by the chair about its connections to parent company ByteDance and the Chinese government. TikTok said its employees based in China are subject to China\u2019s national security laws, and that any business with operations and staff in China are also subject to these laws including banks and telcos. Shoebridge writes: This raises important and serious questions around the broad access to data that China may have under its national security laws and this needs to be interrogated if we are serious about transparency and foreign interference instead of just playing politics with the issue. Shoebridge said TikTok has taken on notice to provide the number of times Australian user data has been accessed by employees in China: This is important information we should be seeking from all platforms who have access to Australian users\u2019 data which may be accessible by foreign entities. \u2018People who use social security are not villains\u2019: Shorten Circling back to Bill Shorten\u2019s earlier press conference on robodebt, he said: If the opposition want to work with us, they need to work with the victims of robodebt. Having former prime minister [Scott] Morrison say he did nothing wrong makes it very hard for the opposition to be taken credibly if they want to work with us. At the end of the presser Shorten said moving forward, the rhetoric around those accessing social security benefits needs to change: Specifically, people who use social security are not villains. The level of fraud is tiny. Of course, if people owe money they have got to pay [it] back. But we\u2019ve got to change the debate that everyone on welfare is a doll bludger. We have to stop treating people who may have fallen on hard times as a second-class Australian. Who should be the next RBA governor \u2013 and who might be? Speculation continues to swirl about what the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will do with the Reserve Bank governor\u2019s role as Philip Lowe\u2019s seven-year term nears its mid-September end. We\u2019re hearing that the decision has not formally been made yet. Chalmers and Lowe head off to India next week for a G20 meeting (as keen readers of this blog will have noted last week). Should Chalmers declare his pick before the trip and choose someone other than Lowe might make for a frosty summit for the two. A handful of candidates have been identified with most of those nominated hailing from Canberra. We look at that list here and ask whom Chalmers might be best served standing next to him in a financial crisis: Lowe started at governor during a relatively calm patch, at least as market gyrations were concerned. In fact he went more than two and a half years without having to oversee an interest rate move and that first one was a cut. Quite a contrast to how his term is ending \u2013 as seems to be the likely outcome \u2013 with 12 rate rises in 14 meetings and time for two more before he heads off into a post-RBA career. During his press conference in Germany, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, touched on the ongoing negotiations between Australia and the European Union for a free trade agreement. His trade minister, Don Farrell, is in Brussels for a further round of negotiations but said today the EU must offer greater access for Australian exports. Albanese said the issue came up in talks yesterday with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz: We won\u2019t sign up [to an FTA with the EU] unless it is in Australia\u2019s interest and Chancellor Scholz is playing a very constructive role there. Albanese is heading to Lithuania for the two-day Nato summit, and is due to meet tonight with another significant EU leader, the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Asked what message he would have to Macron, Albanese said he expected an \u201copen and constructive discussion\u201d with the French president: We won\u2019t be signing up to things that are not in Australia\u2019s national interest \u2026 We\u2019re not asking for anything that other countries have not received. It is important for Australia to have access to those markets. \u2018Australia very much welcomes the release of Chau Van Kham\u2019: PM Concluding his press conference from Berlin, Albanese spoke on the release of the Australian citizen Chau Van Kham from detention in Vietnam after more than four years: Australia very much welcomes the release of Chau Van Kham. This is an issue that I\u2019ve raised during my visit to Vietnam which was a very constructive visit. And I thank our friends in Vietnam for listening and for agreeing during my visit there, for this to occur. Chau Van Kham has now been able to be reunited with his family in Australia, we welcome that. It\u2019s an example of how engagement in a constructive way achieves results in Australia\u2019s national interest. And I was very pleased that Chris Bowen was able to represent me and welcome Chau Van Kham back to Australia. \u2018We won\u2019t be signing up to things that are not in Australia\u2019s national interest\u2019: PM As Albanese prepares to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, later today, he said his focus is to conclude the free trade agreement while ensuring it is in Australia\u2019s interest: My message to president Macron will be that we want to conclude this agreement, but that we won\u2019t be signing up to things that are not in Australia\u2019s national interest. In particular, we want access to European markets and we want to have the mutual benefit that comes from free trade between Australia and Europe. France, of course, has raised some issues but I\u2019m confident that they can be worked through. And I\u2019ll be having an open and constructive discussion with president Macron. We\u2019re not asking for anything that other countries have not received. Australia a \u2018significant player\u2019 in \u2018defending democracy\u2019: PM Albanese said he accepted the invitation to attend the Nato summit because it\u2019s in Australia\u2019s best interest to have a seat at the table: And this seat at the table is one that\u2019s a recognition of Australia\u2019s contribution, and the fact we are a significant player when it comes to defending democracy, defending the rule of law, and Australia\u2019s standing is reflected by the fact that I\u2019ve been invited to the last two Nato summits. Albanese said he\u2019ll be meeting with his counterparts today and tomorrow to discuss a shared goal of a secure, stable and prosperous global community. I\u2019ll be meeting with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, senior leaders in the US congress, the prime ministers of Denmark, Portugal, the United Kingdom, as well as Emmanuel Macron, the president of France. And other leaders over the next couple of days in Lithuania. Australia to \u2018continue to provide support for Ukraine\u2019: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking live from Berlin now. He is discussing Australia\u2019s deployment of the E7 wedge tail aircraft and crew to Germany for six months: This will be a major contribution to the effort to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine and is something that has been requested. We have said that we will work with our Ukrainian friends but also work with our partners here in Nato to provide what support we can for the effort which has been undertaken to defend the people and government and democracy of Ukraine. We understand that the impact of the Russian invasion on Ukraine has been felt around the world, with the rise in global inflation and a weaker global economy. And that\u2019s why it is in Australia\u2019s interest to reach out and be involved. The Nato summit meets as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues. We\u2019ll continue to provide support for Ukraine. I\u2019m hoping to meet with president Zelensky over the next couple of days. Some robodebt victims will seek further legal advice, Shorten says Circling back to Bill Shorten\u2019s press conference on the robodebt royal commission, he said: I have watched the Coalition ministers say that merely because they haven\u2019t been referred to a criminal body, or to some other regulatory authority, that somehow it has given them a clean bill of health. I just think that there will be some victims of robodebt who will be seeking legal advice \u2026 I suspect that there will be some individuals who seek legal advice and they may well seek a remedy of suing the individual former ministers and that is why said last night I don\u2019t know why these ministers are running around acting like they are out of the woods yet. This is a shameful scandal in Australian political history. Shorten said that ministers may seek indemnity, but it will be a matter for lawyers to work through: There are a lot of people out there who want accountability and until they see accountability, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over. Penny Wong flies to Indonesia The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is flying to Indonesia today as she prepares to attend a series of regional meetings. The meetings in Jakarta include the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean)-Australia foreign ministers\u2019 meeting, the East Asia Summit foreign ministers\u2019 meeting, and the Asean regional forum. Wong said Australia saw Asean as being \u201cat the centre of a stable, peaceful and prosperous region\u201d. She said in a statement announcing her travel: We have deep family, education, tourism and business connections with the countries of southeast Asia, and our future is tied to the future of the region we share... A strong Asean is indispensable to the stability of our region. Australia will continue to work in partnership with Asean to shape the kind of region we all want. Wong said she would discuss with her counterparts any opportunities to enhance cooperation on climate change, health security, and the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. She is also scheduled to speak with young Indonesias \u201cabout our shared aspirations for the region\u201d. Tomorrow\u2019s youth dialogue event is hosted by the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia, a thinktank, and the Australian embassy in Jakarta. \u2018Shocking pathology of unlawfulness\u2019 exposed by robodebt royal commission, Shorten says Minister for government services Bill Shorten has been speaking from the Gold Coast about the fallout from the robodebt royal commission. He labelled the scheme as \u201cthe most shameful chapter in the administration of Australia\u2019s social security law since Federation\u201d: It was a mass act of unlawfulness perpetrated on hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Australians for no other reason that they were vulnerable and using a welfare system. The royal commission, which is a result Labor\u2019s election promise, has exposed a shocking pathology of unlawfulness at the cabinet level of the former Coalition government and in the senior ranks of Australia\u2019s public service. For four and a half years an unlawful scheme was perpetrated against Australia\u2019s poor and vulnerable, merely because they were on welfare. It was illegal. Fire in Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches treated as suspicious A fire that engulfed an industrial estate on Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches is being treated as suspicious and nearby residents are being urged to avoid toxic smoke and fumes spewing from the charred remains, AAP reports. Flames engulfed a tyre and mechanical workshop in Brookvale just before 7pm on Monday, and it took more than 50 firefighters and 16 fire trucks to get the blaze under control. Residents are being urged to stay indoors and shut any windows as thick, acrid smoke continues to billow from the building. Some said they could smell toxic fumes and worried of a possible chemical spill, a NSW Police spokesperson told AAP. Several cars have been damaged by the fire and falling debris, though no injuries have been reported. It is believed there was no one inside the building when the fire broke out. A crime scene has been established, with police suspecting the blaze was deliberately lit. Investigators have so far been unable to enter the building and properly assess the scene. The fire is expected to smoulder for the next couple of days as firefighters continue to douse the building using aerial ladder platforms. Yes campaigners in Perth Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney has shared a photo on social media from her travels around Western Australia this week: As reported by my colleague Josh Butler yesterday, Yes23 took its campaign to Perth in hopes of driving up support for the Indigenous voice in WA \u2013 expected to be a crucial battleground in the referendum later this year. Yes23 director Dean Parkin brought together a cross-party group of supporters in the capital city yesterday, while Burney will also spend several days campaigning around the state this week. Continued from last post: Environmental campaigners spent years calling for the NSW government to regulate the loss of surface water at mine sites. On the eve of the NSW election in March, the former state government gazetted rules directing Water NSW to issue licences to several mines, including Dendrobium, in an attempt to address this. A spokesperson for South32 said because of this earlier absence of an approved water licensing regime, it had been in talks with NRAR since 2019 in relation to past water usage at the Dendrobium mine. The spokesperson said the company had cooperated with the regulator and committed to the enforceable undertaking, with the planned water project to be developed in collaboration with the community in coming months: We welcome the surface water licensing regime announced by the NSW Government earlier this year and we are pleased the matter has been concluded. Since 2014, South32 Illawarra Metallurgical Coal has paid A$5.6 million to account for the passive take of water resulting from underground activities at Dendrobium Mine. We understand that water is a critical resource and recognise our obligation to pay for all water used by our operations in the same manner all water users do. The New South Wales water regulator says it has secured the \u201clargest and most significant\u201d agreement to compensate for breaches of water laws in the agency\u2019s history after Illawarra Coal took surface water without a licence at its Dendrobium mine near Wollongong over five years. The Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR) said it had reached a $2.9m enforceable undertaking with the company, a subsidiary of South32, for multiple instances of unlicensed, incidental use of surface water at the metallurgical coal mine. Under the agreement, Illawarra Coal will acknowledge the alleged breaches, which occurred in every financial year from 2018-19 to 2022-23, the regulator said. The undertaking includes a $2,878,139 contribution for a community project to improve the health of and restore waterways and wetlands. The company has until September to submit a proposal for the community project to NRAR and must start delivering it within three months of the proposal being accepted. The regulator said the company would pay a further $70,000 to cover NRAR\u2019s investigation, legal and monitoring costs, with an option to increase these costs after the project proposal is received. In a statement, NRAR said other aspects of the agreement included commitments from Illawarra Coal to improve surface water management with annual reporting back to NRAR and to consult with Aboriginal communities and groups connected to the area about the project. NRAR\u2019s chief regulatory officer Greg Barnes said the \u201clandmark\u201d agreement would result in tangible community benefits. He said before the regulator considered accepting an enforceable undertaking, it had to be satisfied the alleged breaches were acknowledged and the proposed actions would address them: In this [undertaking], NRAR considers that we have achieved the most effective outcome for the people of NSW which redresses the alleged breaches that occurred, delivers benefits to the local community, and puts in place much improved processes to better manage water at this mine in the future. This enforceable undertaking also takes into account the impact of the alleged breaches on the local Aboriginal community and puts in place a commitment to dialogue between the company and that community. Regional communities \u2018on frontline\u2019 of energy transition A group representing 51 regional cities around Australia has called for a nationally consistent approach to Australia\u2019s \u201crapid escalation into renewable energy\u201d, which it says has put its communities on the frontline. In a statement, the chair of Regional Capitals Australia (RCA) Kylie King said regional communities \u201cdeserve a seat at the decision-making table\u201d to make sure they had a \u201creal voice on the massive infrastructure projects occurring in their own backyard.\u201d RCA has called on the energy minister, Chris Bowen, to introduce new safeguards to make sure regional communities are consulted and protected. RCA points to a speech from Bowen last year where he estimated Australia would need to install about 40 wind turbines every month and 22,000 solar panels a day until 2030 to hit its emissions reduction target. King said: A nationally consistent framework that delivers baseline community investment and best-practice consultation should assist in delivery of a social licence. Adherence to this framework should be a regulatory requirement for all project proponents seeking to operate in regional communities. RCA said impacts of renewable energy installations could include \u201closs of vegetation and wildlife, loss of public and private land, pollution (noise/air/ground), visual impacts and loss of local amenity and long construction phase and itinerant workforce leading to impacts on local roads, housing and services.\u201d No special treatment for government on reported posts, Meta says Meta has said government departments that reported posts containing alleged misinformation received no different treatment than any member of the public would for making similar reports. During the early stages of the pandemic, Guardian Australia reported Home Affairs, under the former Morrison government, had been reporting hundreds of posts to Facebook parent company, Meta, for misinformation related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Two years later, News Corp has reported this amounted to thousands of posts, which the Australian newspaper said was censorship. Speaking before a foreign interference on social media committee, Meta\u2019s head of public policy in Australia, Josh Makin, said such reports were only assessed against Meta\u2019s existing misinformation policies and a referral didn\u2019t amount to a legal request for the content to be removed: Of course we want to be responsive to Australian government agencies \u2026 but I would want to state fairly clearly there is no special treatment applied. We have the same policies applied to it\u2026 Just because it\u2019s come from government doesn\u2019t mean we treat it differently. We would remove it if it violated our policies, but there were instances where \u2026 it did not violate our policies and we advised the government departments of that. Queensland Kiwis take up Australian citizenship Immigration minister Andrew Giles says more than 1,100 Queensland-based Kiwis have already taken important steps towards Australian citizenship. In April around 380,000 New Zealanders living in Australia became eligible to apply for Australian citizenship without becoming permanent residents first, thanks to sweeping changes restoring reciprocity to the rights of expats in both countries. Greens call for consultants to drop political donations The Greens say all four major consultancy firms should stop donating to political parties, following PwC\u2019s announcement yesterday it would no longer donate directly to parties. The decision covers contributions that are reportable to the Australian Electoral Commission as political donations, including in-kind support such as catering, services and office space. The company has yet to decide on whether it will continue to pay for memberships to organisations such as the Liberal Party\u2019s Australian Business Network and the Federal Labor Business Forum. Greens senator Barbara Pocock said PwC needed to explain its decision in more detail: Will they continue their membership of the business networks run by the major parties? It doesn\u2019t matter what pipeline you use, anyone doing business with the government should not be allowed to give them money, full stop. She told AAP all of the \u201cbig four\u201d consulting firms should stop making cash donations to parties, adding that law changes were needed to \u201cbreak the link between money and politics\u201d. - with AAP Australia threatens to walk away from EU trade talks Negotiations for a free trade agreement with the European Union have hit a crunch point, with the trade minister, Don Farrell, warning that he will \u201cnot go back to Australia with the offer that\u2019s currently on the table\u201d. The comments appear to raise the possibility that Farrell, who is in Brussels for the second time in just over a month, is prepared to walk away from a deal unless the EU offers more meaningful market access for Australian beef, sheep meat, sugar and dairy into the EU. The negotiations in Brussels are expected to resume in a few hours. Farrell said: I want to secure a fair, long-term agreement that lasts us into the future and is in both of our interests \u2013 Australia and the European Union. I will not go back to Australia with the offer that\u2019s currently on the table. This approach has the backing of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation chief executive, Tony Mahar, who is also in Brussels. In a statement issued today, Mahar urged Australian negotiators to \u201ccontinue to hold the line to ensure a fair and commercially meaningful deal with the EU\u201d: While we appreciate the years of hard work that has brought us to this point, and it would be a shame to see that wasted \u2013 we are better to walk away than to agree a dud deal. We\u2019ve made that point clearly to Minister Farrell here in Brussels. We\u2019ve said to walk away from any deal that doesn\u2019t make good business sense. We\u2019d rather this take a few extra months if necessary. Sex Assault Squad detectives have charged a WA Police Force senior constable with 17 offences after an investigation into allegations of child sex offences, according to a WA Police Force media release. The 48-year-old man works in Regional WA. He was stood down at the time police received the complaint, while the matters were investigated. It will be alleged that between 2009 and 2012 the man had a sexual relationship with a girl who was 13-years-old at the time of the first alleged offence. He is due to appear before the Perth Magistrates Court today. The media release outlines the charges of seven counts of Indecently Deals with a Child of or over 13 and under 16 years; six counts of Sexually Penetrated a Child of or over 13 and under 16 years; three counts of Sexually Penetrated a Child over 16 under their Authority.; and one count of Persistent Sexual Conduct. \u2018Welcome home Mr Kham\u2019 Shadow foreign minister Simon Birmingham has welcomed news that Australian citizen Chau Van Kham has been released after more than four years\u2019 detention in Vietnam. In a tweet, Birmingham said: This is very welcome news. This positive outcome for Mr Kham &amp; his family reflects the determined efforts of [Australian] ministers &amp; officials, including former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne, over a number of years. Welcome home Mr Kham. Young people most likely to give to others in need, survey finds Young Australians are leading the way as the country\u2019s most altruistic despite often having lower paying jobs and less in the bank, according to new research from Finder. According to a survey of 1,080 respondents, two in five Australians have lended a hand to a friend, family member, colleague or even a stranger struggling to keep up with the cost of living. Despite being the second-most financially stressed of all generations (90%) and feeling the least secure in their current job (12%), Gen Z was the most likely to step up and help others around them when they needed it the most (55%). This is followed by Gen Y (44%), Gen X (35%) and baby boomers (26%). The area where people are most likely to help out is with groceries. For the average Australian, 27% of respondents helped someone in need with groceries, compared to 40% of Gen Z. Sarah Megginson from Finder said: It\u2019s a heartening act that demonstrates the power of community and the importance of looking out for one another during tough times. Queensland police are taking a unique route to poach experienced police officers from NSW \u2013 $20,000 in incentives AND the lure of a winning state of origin team: Human Rights Watch welcomes Chau Van Kham\u2019s release More reaction is flowing in after the news that Australian citizen Chau Van Kham has been released after more than four years of detention in Vietnam. Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia director, Elaine Pearson, said in a statement: It\u2019s fantastic news that Australian retired baker and activist Chau Van Kham has been released after more than four years of detention in Vietnam. He spent far too long in prison. Vietnamese police arrested him in January 2019 and in November 2019, a Vietnamese court convicted him of \u2018terrorism\u2019 and sentenced him to 12 years prison after a trial lasting merely hours that raised serious due process concerns. The case was based on his affiliation and activities with an opposition political party, Viet Tan, which operates openly and lawfully in many countries including Australia, but which Hanoi arbitrarily labels \u2018terrorist.\u2019 He spent long periods of time isolated from family and consular staff due to pandemic restrictions. We are thrilled for Chau Van Kham\u2019s family and acknowledge the successful efforts of the Australian government at the most senior levels to secure his release. Pearson said the Australian government should \u201ccontinue to call on Vietnamese authorities to release all political prisoners\u201d. Thanks Rafqa for taking us through the morning! I\u2019ll be with you on the blog for the remainder of the day. Thanks for joining me on the blog this morning. Handing over to Emily Wind, who will take you through this afternoon\u2019s news. See you tomorrow! Meta has \u201caspiration\u201d to apply fact-checking and state media labels to accounts on its Twitter rival, Threads, but could not say when such functions will be made available. Speaking at a hearing of the parliamentary committee examining foreign interference on social media, Meta\u2019s head of public policy in Australia, Josh Makin, said while the content moderation policies on Facebook and Instagram apply to Threads out of the box, tools to identify state media and fact-checking of Thread posts aren\u2019t yet available on the platform. Noting the popularity of the site \u2013 there are now 100m users on the service less than a week after launch \u2013 Makin said \u201cit\u2019s only a couple of days old, we are still building out broader functionality and partnerships.\u201d Makin said Meta plans to build it out \u201cfairly quickly\u201d but when pressed by chair senator James Paterson on when state-affiliated news outlets like RT might be labelled as such, Makin said it was the company\u2019s \u201caspiration\u201d to get it built quickly but could not provide timing. Australian citizen and pro-democracy activist Chau Van Kham has been released from a Vietnamese jail, AAP reports. The retired Sydney baker was arrested in 2019 on terrorism charges. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison over his membership of the overseas, pro-democracy political party Viet Tan. Deputy prime minister Richard Marles thanked the Vietnamese government for its action. Marles told reporters today: They\u2019ve done this on the basis of humanitarian grounds and in the spirit of friendship, which exists between Australia and Vietnam. This is a result of careful advocacy which has been undertaken by the Australian government with the Vietnamese government over a number of months now. If consumers are in a funk, companies aren\u2019t there \u2013 yet. The last monthly survey of business by NAB shows conditions remained steady at above-average levels. Not all is going swimmingly, though, with the retail sector weakening, business confidence at \u201czero\u201d and forward orders now negative. Capacity utilisation has also dropped to 83.5%, or the lowest level since April 2022 (just prior to the RBA starting its rate-rise cycle). A bit of slack in the economy is what the central bank wants to see. Employees may be happy to see labour cost growth picking up to 2.6% in the June quarter alone, but the central bank won\u2019t be so keen. Input costs overall rose 2.3% for the quarter. NAB\u2019s chief economist Alan Oster said: Overall, the survey suggests the economy remained resilient and price pressures continued through the end of Q2, despite warning signs that growth is slowing. There are a couple of sentiment surveys out today tracking the mood of households and businesses. First up, there\u2019s the monthly Westpac/Melbourne Institute survey of consumer confidence, which showed a pickup of 2.7% to 81.3 in July. Westpac\u2019s Bill Evans said: Sentiment remains at the deeply pessimistic levels that have prevailed for just over a year now. The main drags on sentiment throughout this period of depressingly low consumer sentiment have been the surging cost of living and sharply higher interest rates. Still, the drop in monthly CPI inflation to 5.6% in May was one positive. Interestingly, the Reserve Bank keeping its cash rate unchanged in July didn\u2019t help buoy confidence. (Presumably it would have tanked if they had lifted it.) ANZ and Roy Morgan run a separate weekly sentiment survey, and that found a 0.8% decline, too, even with the RBA pause. Their gauge also tracks inflation expectations, and those retreated in the past week, a trend the central bank wants to see. We\u2019ll have the business survey shortly. Stay tuned... Greens call for free abortions after TGA changes Greens senator Larissa Waters says today\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration amendment to allow more medical practitioners and pharmacists to supply the abortion pill is a step forward in improving access to reproductive choice, but urges the government to make the abortion pill free of charge. Today\u2019s decision to allow all doctors and nurse practitioners to prescribe the pregnancy termination pill, and all pharmacies to stock it, will improve access for women and pregnant people, particularly in regional and remote parts of the country. This announcement will go a long way to improving access, but financial barriers remain and the Greens want to see zero out of pocket costs for abortion, whether medical or surgical. Waters also says \u201cit is disappointing to see midwives not included in today\u2019s announcement\u201d. She calls the government to implement all recommendations made by the multipartisan Senate inquiry into Universal access to reproductive healthcare. Industry super body wants 30-hour threshold removed Teenage workers could forgo more than $10,000 from their super balances because of a rule that bars them from automatic contributions. Hundreds of thousands of young workers are missing out on super from their employers because of a law asserting under-18 workers are not entitled to compulsory super contributions unless they work 30 hours a week for the same employer, AAP reports. Industry Super Australia revealed teenage workers are heavily penalised by the rule, with the average young worker forgoing an extra $885 a year. This amounts to a $10,200 hit to their final super balances upon retirement and after years of compound interest. The industry super body wants the 30-hour threshold law removed. Industry Super Australia chief executive Bernie Dean said modernising the rules would also benefit employers. Removing the 30-hour threshold wouldn\u2019t just be fair for young workers, it would be good for the employers who have to face the administrative nightmare of keeping track of the weekly hours of a highly casual workforce. Australia joining \u2018climate club\u2019 puts pressure on fossil fuel action at home Australia\u2019s entry into a \u201cclimate club\u201d is expected to increase pressure on the government to improve action to cut emissions, AAP reports. While prime minister Anthony Albanese was meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, he confirmed that Australia had been invited to join the initiative. The club includes countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States, and aims to increase international collaboration on climate action. Albanese said: Australia and Germany are now united in our deep commitment to tackling climate change, and I commended chancellor Scholz on his development of Germany\u2019s climate club and was pleased to confirm that Australia will join that high ambition initiative. Climate Council research director Simon Bradshaw said it was an important initiative to decarbonise industry and pursue net zero emissions, \u201cbut (it) must be backed by stronger steps at home to phase out fossil fuels and build the clean industries of the future\u201d. International collaboration is key to achieving the emissions reductions we need to combat the climate crisis. But we need to see any new international partnerships backed with real action. From 21 August, Australians will be able to ban themselves from all online gambling companies using \u201cBetStop\u201d \u2013 a national self-exclusion register that will replace systems in the states and territories that have been criticised as ineffective. You can read the full story from Henry Belot here: Ahead of the hearing on foreign interference on social media later this morning, the chair of the committee, James Paterson, has tweeted a letter from Chinese app WeChat. He has been seeking to have the company appear before the committee alongside TikTok, Meta, Google and Twitter. However, in a response to the committee, the company has said it is unable to attend due to not having any local representatives in Australia. WeChat did say however that it would be responsive in writing to the committee and would answer any questions the committee has. Paterson said the company is continuing to show contempt for the parliament. Unlike TikTok, WeChat is not covered by a blanket restriction from federal government devices, despite similar concerns over the data collection and security on the app. For the first time since 2014, Moody\u2019s Investors Service has upgraded Western Australia\u2019s credit rating to AAA \u2013 that is the highest possible rating. S&amp;P Global, a private banking company, upgraded WA to AAA credit rating in June last year. WA is the only state or territory with this rating from Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P Global\u2013 highlighting its strong financial management, as put in Moody\u2019s statement. Their financial performance is \u201can outlier to its domestic and international peers\u201d, with sustained budget surpluses and material easing in the State\u2019s debt burden under the current Government, according to the statement. Moody\u2019s AAA rating was lost under the Liberal National government in 2014. S&amp;P\u2019s rating was lost in 2013 under the same government. It is now reinstated under the Cook Labor government. Premier Roger Cook says of the rating: Under my government we continue the focus on strong financial management, invest in what matters, pay down debt, diversify the Western Australian economy and create jobs for future generations. Commuters send more than 1500 sexual harassment incidents to Victoria police In the 12 months since the launch of a text service to stamp out sexual harassment, commuters have sent police more than 1500 alerts about incidents on Victoria\u2019s public transport, AAP reports. The service, STOPIT, was launched on 11 July 2022. More than half the users are women and girls. The service is the first of its kind in Australia, which enables victims or witnesses to text a dedicated police transit team with details about incidents. Police urges anyone who has witnessed or experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on Victoria\u2019s public transport network to contact STOPIT. More than 40% of notifications sent in are about threatening and offensive behaviour, including verbal abuse and harassment. Police have arrested 13 people attached to incidents reported to the service. Victoria Police Transit Safety Division Insp Mark Zervaas thanked all those who used the service. Every piece of information received has helped us make the network a safer place for all commuters. Rental crisis shows modest signs of easing Some good news for renters (finally). The search for a rental property is now a little less competitive in most Australian cities as vacancy rates finally start ticking up, AAP reports. Vacancies edged slightly higher again last month, reaching 1.45%, with renters finding it easier to secure a new home in every capital city except Brisbane, as measured by property firm PropTrack. Vacancy rates still remain at around half their pre-pandemic levels, however. PropTrack senior economist Paul Ryan said demand was slowing but from elevated heights. It remains difficult to find a rental across the country and we expect rents to continue to grow quickly, placing additional financial pressure on renters. Read more from Peter Hannam and Tamsin Rose here: Survey shows ecologists reportedly facing gags on publicly releasing work Researchers warn suppression of science by governments and corporations is hampering efforts to address the global biodiversity crisis, AAP reports. James Cook University professor Bill Laurance points to a survey of Australian ecologists who reported facing gags on the public release of their information. He says: Imagine someone who\u2019s done years of work on a subject and has more or less been told not to talk to the media. Of 220 people interviewed by the Ecological Society of Australia, about 50% of government experts and 40% of industry respondents said they had been banned from publicly sharing their work. Laurance says the suppression of academic work was inherently dangerous in Australia \u2013 the result is poor policy outcomes, impacts on threatened species and delayed action on climate change. It often happens in situations where the stakes are high, when it\u2019s an important issue causing controversy. Reward of $1m to solve 1980s murder mystery More on the $1m reward being offered by police in a bid to solve the murder mystery of Robert Richardson, known as Jack. Police believe several people helped arrange Richardson\u2019s murder, including his friends. They are searching for who fatally shot Richardson, and anyone who helped plan the murder \u2013 likely including people formerly associated with the Painters and Dockers Union. The $1m reward will be paid at the chief commissioner of police\u2019s discretion for information leading to the apprehension and conviction of the person or people behind Richardson\u2019s murder. The 49-year-old was on bail and living with his girlfriend at St Kilda before his death. He also had a young daughter, who grew up never knowing who killed her father and why. Victoria Police Detective Insp Dean Thomas said: Given Jack\u2019s significant criminal history and associations, we also believe there is a strong likelihood that people with information were afraid to come forward at the time of his death because they feared significant retribution. We\u2019re hoping that some of those people may now be able to speak to us without those fears or concerns.\u201d The director of public prosecutions will consider granting indemnity to anyone who leads them to the perpetrators. - AAP Feel like an unsolved murder with your morning news and coffee? Because police are offering a $1m reward in a bid to solve a decades-old underworld mystery, AAP reports. On 31 March 1984, Robert Richardson, known as \u201cJack\u201d, was found dead in bushland in central Victoria \u2013 off King Parrot Creek Rd near Strath Creek. He was shot in what police believe was an execution-style killing. The 49-year-old was last seen with two unknown men at St Kilda between 1.20am and 2am on 4 March \u2013 the day before he was due to go to trial at Melbourne County Court with two co-accused charged with conspiring to traffic heroin. His killing was two years to the day after police first made arrests over the heroin trafficking investigation. Victoria Police Detective Insp Dean Thomas said it was no coincidence Richardson\u2019s death was the day before the trial was due to start. The investigation involved a high-level Melbourne organised crime syndicate connected to the notorious Painters and Dockers Union, the police believe. It was also linked to an attempted hit on a NSW Police undercover operative, who was a prosecution witness. Thomas said: Jack\u2019s death had all the hallmarks of an underworld execution, and the evidence suggests he probably had no warning he was going to be killed and trusted the person who did it. Ultimately, his fatal mistake may have been trusting the wrong person. Australia plane to aid Ukraine in European airspace Australia will deploy a surveillance aircraft for logistical support to Ukraine, but it will not enter the country\u2019s airspace, AAP reports. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is set to meet the leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea in a special session with Nato leaders in Lithuania to discuss global security. Ahead of the meeting, he announced a Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail aircraft would be deployed to Europe to help protect multinational logistics hubs. The aircraft would ensure the uninterrupted flow of military and humanitarian aid into Ukraine. It will be deployed for six months, based in Germany, and will operate within European airspace \u2013 but will avoid the territory of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. Albanese said the deployment would include up to 100 crew and support personnel from Australia. This demonstrates Australia\u2019s commitment to upholding the rules-based international order. Marles focuses on building Nato relationship not Keating\u2019s comments Policing what Paul Keating says is \u201cthe last thing I\u2019m going to do,\u201d deputy prime minister and minister for defence Richard Marles said after the former prime minister labelled the head of Nato a \u201csupreme fool\u201d. Marles said on ABC TV this morning: The last thing I\u2019m going to do is to suggest what Paul Keating should or shouldn\u2019t say. I also know that whatever I suggested is not going to have much influence anyway. Paul will have his say. That\u2019s fine. The principal message \u2026 in terms of Australia\u2019s position in the world, is that articulated by those governing Australia right now. We\u2019re very focused on building our relationship with Nato. It\u2019s important, and the prime minister is attending the summit as I said. Marles also said the government is focused on \u201cour relationship with the countries within our region\u201d: We brought down the defence strategic review and the government\u2019s response to it a month or two ago \u2026 We made clear that one of the key tasks of the Australian Defence Force now and Australia\u2019s strategic policy is around providing for the collective security of the Indo-Pacific region. At the heart of that is building our own relationships with the countries within the Indo-Pacific. And that\u2019s our focus as we see it in terms of providing for Australia\u2019s security. Government welcomes more future abortion access through health professionals The TGA\u2019s decision to remove restrictions on health professionals who prescribe and dispense MS-2 Step \u2013 medical abortion pills \u2013 has been welcomed by the government. Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care Ged Kearney says \u201cwe welcome these changes that remove red tape and improve equitable access to healthcare for all Australians,\u201d in a statement. We know that women experience structural barriers trying to access the health care that they need, particularly in regional and rural areas. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that all health practitioners can perform the care that they are already trained to provide. These changes recognise the importance of health practitioners that women see regularly \u2013 their GP, their nurse practitioner and their community pharmacist. The TGA\u2019s decision will take effect from 1 August It will be easier for women to medically terminate pregnancies up to 63 days of gestation, now that the Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved an application from MS Health to amend restrictions on the prescribing of MS-2 Step (Mifepristone and Misoprostol). MS-2 Step was only able to be prescribed by a doctor certified to prescribe the medicine, and then dispensed by a pharmacist who was a registered dispenser. Now, the drug can be prescribed by any healthcare practitioner with the right qualifications and training, with no need for certification \u2013 this may include nurse practitioners. Restrictions on dispensing by only registered pharmacists have also been lifted. The decision will assist in addressing important access issues for patients who require this medication, the TGA\u2019s media release says. Independent expert advice from the Advisory Committee on Medicines informed the decision. A new warning has been included in the product information, providing information about circumstances where a person should be referred to a medical practitioner. The Albanese government says treasury analysis of ABS data shows the economy added 465,000 jobs in its first year of office. That\u2019s the most by any first-year government (as it was for the first three, six and nine months). Just over half of the new jobs went to women, 249,000 and more than 80% were full-time. The biggest employment growth areas were health care and social assistance, manufacturing and construction. The latter is a bit surprising given the collapse of a range of large builders but is a testament to the large state and federal projects. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said: We\u2019re investing in the care economy, we\u2019re investing in manufacturing and we\u2019re investing in critical infrastructure to create secure, well-paid jobs for Australian workers. While we know that slowing global growth, higher prices and higher interest rates will impact our economy and labour market and continue to strain household budgets over the coming months, Australia is in a better position than nearly anyone else to face the challenges ahead. Labor inherited a labour market that was growing strongly, and the pace has been maintained at a level higher than economists had forecast. We\u2019ll get June jobless numbers next week. In May, the economy added more than 76,000 jobs, dropping the unemployment rate to a near-50 year low of 3.6%. Another big monthly reading like that would be good news for those looking for work but would almost certainly nudge the Reserve Bank back into its rate-rising mode. As of yesterday, the ASX\u2019s rate tracker indicated there\u2019s about a 50:50 chance the RBA will lift the cash rate from 4.1% to 4.35% on 1 August. Deputy prime minister and minister for defence Richard Marles was asked about whether there is a case for robodebt victims to sue former ministers who presided over the illegal scheme after Bill Shorten suggested it last night on 7.30. Although Marles did not give a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d he did call robodebt \u201cone of the most gross acts of maladministration that we\u2019ve seen from a government\u201d on ABC TV: I think those matters will unfold in the course of time. There\u2019s a class action that has already taken place. We\u2019ll see that play out. But I think the point I would make in relation to robodebt is that what is totally clear from the report of the royal commission is that this stands as one of the most gross acts of maladministration that we\u2019ve seen from a government, from the former Liberal government, in the culture they established, in the way in which they managed this, and half a million Australians were adversely affected as a result of this. That must never be forgotten in terms of what happened with robodebt. And the lessons that we draw from it, when you\u2019re talking about the administration particularly of a program which impacts individuals in this way, good governance must be at the heart of it, not politics. Possible raised welfare payments for robodebt compensation, says Shorten Bill Shorten has raised the prospect of former Coalition ministers involved in the robodebt scheme potentially being sued individually by victims, and didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of raising welfare payments as a form of compensation to those on social security. Shorten, the minister for government services, told ABC\u2019s 7.30 program last night that there would be further processes following the royal commission, and said Australians \u201chave a right to see what happens\u201d \u2013 referencing the sealed section of the report which goes into referrals to other agencies. Shorten noted that commissioner Catherine Holmes\u2019 report \u201csays that on the face of the evidence presented to the Commission, the elements of the tort of malfeasance in public office are made\u201d. \u201cI do not know why these Coalition ministers think that they\u2019re out of the woods,\u201d he said of those involved. This royal commission has a long way to go and a lot of lessons to be applied, but I do not know why coalition ministers with that sort of very, very damning analysis \u2026 why they think when the commissioner says there\u2019s the tort of malfeasance in public office, that people, victims, won\u2019t sue them individually. If these characters think that somehow they\u2019re in the clear, I don\u2019t read that when I read this royal commission. Shorten said that the report stated a general compensation scheme may be too costly to run, but when asked about Holmes\u2019 suggestion that welfare payments generally could be raised as a form of compensation, he didn\u2019t bat it away. We certainly have increased the Commonwealth rent support. We\u2019ve increased the single mothers\u2019 payments, we\u2019ve increased Newstart. I don\u2019t think the journey stops there. Read more on what Shorten had to say here: Senior staff from organisations like Meta, TikTok, Google and Twitter will appear today before a parliamentary committee on foreign interference through social media, AAP reports. They will be asked what steps are being taken to prevent other countries from meddling in government matters like federal elections. Concerns that social media companies were being weaponised by foreign powers were not theoretical, the committee\u2019s chair, shadow home affairs &amp; cybersecurity minister James Paterson, said: Russia and China have notoriously attempted to meddle in US and Canadian elections, with US and Canadian intelligence agencies assessing that these governments were behind online influence activities designed to undermine electoral processes. Confronting this problem is no easy task. It will require a concerted effort from governments and social media platforms on which this conduct takes place. Good morning! Thank you to Martin Farrer for kicking off the blog today. I\u2019m Rafqa Touma, and I\u2019ll be with you on the blog for the rest of the morning. If you see anything you don\u2019t want us to miss, let me know on Twitter or Threads. Let\u2019s get into it. More Melburnians adopting cats Almost 1000 lost and abandoned cats have found new homes after an animal shelter\u2019s winter adoption drive, Australian Associated Press reports. Melbourne pet rescue centre Lost Dog\u2019s Home is purring after adopting out 979 cats and kittens over a five-week period. It continues a recent trend of more Melburnians adopting feline companions, with numbers rising from 5258 in 2021-22 to 6440 in the last financial year. It was hard to pinpoint the exact cause of the feline frenzy, the home\u2019s spokesperson Suzana Talevski said in a statement. She theorised it could also be connected to more people returning to work in the office and opting for an easier pet to manage when they weren\u2019t home, or that inner-city apartment living was more appropriate for cats. Labor is the party most able to handle Australia\u2019s relations with China, according to a poll by the Australia-China Relations Institute (ACRI) and analysts at UTS. They report today that almost half of respondents nominated Labor (49%) as the political party best placed to handle Australia\u2019s China policy, a 14-point increase from 2022 (35%). The poll by ACRI, in conjunction with the Centre for Business Intelligence &amp; Data Analytics (BIDA), also found that just over a quarter of Australians (27%) say that the Morrison-led government\u2019s management of China policy had an impact on their vote in the 2022 federal election. Just over half of Australians (51%) say that \u201cMilitary conflict with China within three years is a serious possibility\u201d, while 67% of Australians say that \u201cthe Australian government is right to increase defence spending, to balance, among other considerations, China\u2019s growing military might\u2019. NSW welcomes first rental commissioner The New South Wales government has appointed Homelessness NSW chief executive, Trina Jones, as the state\u2019s first rental commissioner. Jones will work alongside the Labor government on reforms to make the rental system fairer including making it easier for renters to keep pets, ending no-grounds evictions and introducing a portable bond scheme. Jones said her mission was to \u201camplify the voice of renters\u201d. The position was promised ahead of the March election amid growing calls for the state government to meaningfully intervene in the housing crisis. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said: I\u2019m looking forward to working with the new commissioner to make our state a fairer place for both renters and owners. We can\u2019t fix years of problems in the rental market overnight, but we have already made a start and we are determined to do more. It comes amid a report pointing to some very modest easing in the rental crisis gripping Australia. Rental vacancy rates nationally increased 0.02 percentage points to 1.45% last month, according to data group PropTrack, while those in capital cities edged 0.03 percentage points higher to 1.42%. Both were just shy of half the rates in March 2020. Full report here: ----- Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage.

Anthony Albanese will travel to Lithuania later today for the Nato summit after a productive trip to Berlin which saw him ink a new arms deal with Germany and announce that Australia was sending a surveillance plane to Germany to help protect supply lines to Ukraine. He also officially confirmed that Australia will join the Climate Club \u2013 a new international grouping led by Germany focused on reducing emissions in heavy industry and bringing \u201cgreen steel\u201d and \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d onto the market quickly. Corporate debt collectors are facing calls to return more than $11m in taxpayers\u2019 money they earned by chasing down welfare recipients for debts raised under the unlawful robodebt scheme. The issue was highlighted in last week\u2019s royal commission report into the scandal, while pressure was building for full disclosure of its findings. A Guardian Essential poll has found that support for the Indigenous voice has dipped, although a majority of Australians questioned \u2013 47% to 43% \u2013 intend to vote yes rather than no. It found that the remaining 10% of voters were unsure about which way to go."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f96", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/11/cabinet-minister-parliamentary-privilege-name-bbc-presenter", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cabinet minister says he will not use privilege to name BBC presenter", "lead": "Parliamentary privilege should be used sparingly, says Mel Stride on scandal engulfing corporation", "author": "Jamie Grierson, and Dan Sabbagh in Vilnius", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 08:09:28", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953162", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f3e62147700de3af63dfb7d41c02872e8d1d6ca3/0_94_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "A cabinet minister has said he would not use parliamentary privilege to identify the BBC presenter at the centre of a scandal over alleged cash for explicit images, in an apparent move to discourage fellow MPs from taking that decision. A prominent male BBC presenter was suspended at the weekend after allegations he spent \u00a335,000 buying explicit images from a young person, who was allegedly 17 years old when they started talking online. The work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, also suggested that whether the young person involved was in \u201cadulthood or childhood was material\u201d to how the allegations should be responded to. Asked on Sky News if he would use parliamentary privilege \u2013 in effect a form of legal immunity that grants MPs protection in the House of Commons \u2013 to name the presenter involved, as some of his colleagues have suggested they might, Stride said he would not. \u201cI can only speak for myself. I would personally certainly not be doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a privilege that should be used very sparingly and with great thought.\u201d Asked the same question on LBC, Stride said: \u201cI can only tell you what I would do, which is that I would not be naming anybody in the House of Commons. \u201cParliamentary privilege is a very special and privileged thing and it should be used very, very sparingly. My own view is that, regarding the BBC situation, not enough is known yet by the outside world of absolutely what has been going on here. \u201cAnd until we know all the facts \u2013 and we won\u2019t know I think until this whole matter is concluded \u2013 I think it would be wrong to prejudge things and jump to conclusions that people should be named or otherwise.\u201d Earlier on Sky News, Stride said developments overnight \u2013 specifically that the young person issued a statement in which they claimed the key allegations were \u201crubbish\u201d \u2013 underlined the importance of not rushing to conclusions. He urged people to \u201cresist \u2026 the urge to opine\u201d on how the allegations were being dealt with by the BBC. \u201cOnce it\u2019s all over and concluded, I think that is most certainly the time to be looking at whether things were done correctly or not,\u201d Stride said. \u201cBut at the moment, it seems to me this is a highly fluid, unknown situation and we should give the BBC a bit of space. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that all of us resist, to the extent that we can, the urge to opine on what was right, or what was outrageous or wrong, until we know all the facts.\u201d Asked about the BBC\u2019s handling of the situation, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough of the facts to be able to start pointing too many fingers yet at the process. I think we have to wait till this has played out as quickly and effectively as possible, and that\u2019s what the secretary of state [for digital, culture, media and sport] has been pushing for. And then we can start to make those judgments.\u201d The young person\u2019s mother made the allegations in the Sun newspaper, which published her claim that payments from the BBC presenter helped fund her child\u2019s crack cocaine habit. In a dramatic turn of events, on Monday evening the young person\u2019s lawyer issued a statement saying the mother and the Sun had made false claims. Speaking to reporters on his way to a Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, Rishi Sunak said the allegations regarding the presenter were alarming but ministers had been reassured by the corporation that its investigation would be quick. \u201cThey were shocking and concerning allegations,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThe culture secretary spoke to the director general on Sunday and is reassured the process they are taking is rigorous and will be swift. We\u2019ve had those reassurances and that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d It was important for those investigating the situation, such as the BBC and the police, to be allowed to reach a conclusion, Sunak added.

This, apparently, is a fallacy; contrary to quicksand\u2019s reputation among 12-year-olds as the most feared method of improbable death, you can\u2019t sink all the way in. As unfortunate American hiker Josh (Allan Hawco) points out: \u201cThe weight of the mud\u2019s density is heavier than the human body.\u201d He must be feeling pretty confident, because he jumps in to save his wife Sofia (Carolina Gaitan). Actually, what we have on our hands is more of a bog. So \u201cQuagmire\u201d might have been a better title. A floundering couple, on the brink of divorce, take the surefire route of repairing relations by deciding to go on a testing outdoor hike in the Colombian wilderness. After falling victim to a carjacking, they flee into an off-limits zone notorious for its soupy terrain. Alas, the film doesn\u2019t do a reputational salvage job on Colombia itself, whose national parks are apparently full of venomous reptiles and venal criminals, where hotel receptionists are in league with the criminals, and where police attention is lackadaisical. Once Josh and Sofia are enmired, Colombian director Andres Beltran\u2019s survivalist caper is underplotted even at 85 minutes; some ants and the aforementioned snakes are pretty much all that are mustered. More critically, with your characters lodged in mud up to the shoulders, all attempts at drumming up surplus interest are rendered faintly ludicrous. This includes a feeble backstory (recovering alcoholic Josh reveals he\u2019s still on the sauce when he uses his stashed vodka to fend off the ants) and box-ticking feminist aspirations (Sofia identifying with a fellow mother in her snake tormentor, who is trying to protect her egg). It doesn\u2019t help that the film takes itself with Deliverance-like seriousness, and fails to really acknowledge its absurdity. The couple\u2019s immobility also spotlights the unfortunate disparity in the two lead performances, with Gaitan relentlessly high-strung and Hawco comically placid. More reminiscent of Beckett\u2019s Happy Days (with added fauna and minus existentialism) than the vice-like B-movie strangulation it wants to be, Quicksand at least provides an interesting possible new avenue for marriage-guidance counselling sessions. \u2022 Quicksand is available on Shudder on 14 July."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f98", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/11/uk-interest-rates-rise-labour-market-unemployment-pay", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK interest rates likely to rise again despite slowing labour market", "lead": "Rising unemployment and slowing jobs growth will not counteract strong pay pressure", "author": "Larry Elliott Economics editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 07:41:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953200", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e5830e11db7f35ab85b9ff63353d0b7a6e59d1ec/0_0_3859_2315/500.jpg", "body": "Unemployment is up. The number of job vacancies is down. The rate of jobs growth is slowing and at a time when the number of people looking for work is rising. There are signs that the UK labour market is starting to slow. These developments have to be put into perspective. They are straws in the wind rather than evidence that demand for jobs is about to collapse. And, crucially, the signs of a possible turning point will almost certainly not be conclusive enough to prevent the Bank of England from raising interest rates again next month. That\u2019s because pay pressure remains strong and much higher than the Bank considers compatible with meeting its 2% inflation target. Regular pay in the three months to May was 7.3% higher than in the same period a year earlier \u2013 the same as in the three months to April and the joint highest since modern records began. Look closely enough and there are hints that earnings growth may have peaked. Looking at the single month of May rather than the quarterly figure, the annual rate of growth in regular pay slipped from 7.8% to 7.4%. As the Capital Economics analyst Ashley Webb points out, this is an indicator closely monitored by the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. There was a similar pattern for private sector wage growth, where the annual rate of increase picked up from 7.6% to 7.7% on a quarterly basis, but eased back in May alone from 8.1% to 7.4%. For the interest-rate doves on the MPC, the latest pay data will be proof that the 13 successive increases in interest rates are working. They will argue that the labour market is a lagging indicator of the state of the economy, a better guide to what has happened in the past than a predictor of what will happen in the future. There are reasons why the rate of pay growth may be slowing. Employment growth in the three months to May stood at just over 100,000, well down on the 250,000 increase in the three months to April. The unemployment rate rose from 3.8% to 4% because the growth in employment was less marked than the number of previously inactive people looking for work. Will this evidence be enough to stay the MPC\u2019s hand when it meets next month? Almost certainly not, given its fears about a wage-price spiral. But it should make it wary of overkill and force the financial markets to think again about whether interest rates will need to rise above 6%, as they currently expect."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f99", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/11/ashley-young-everton-medical-aston-villa-free-agent-sean-dyche-signing", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ashley Young due for Everton medical after leaving Aston Villa as free agent", "lead": "Ashley Young is due for a medical at Everton on Tuesday with a view to joining as a free agent after leaving Aston Villa", "author": "Fabrizio Romano", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 07:41:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953217", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/96d32595866772d9c971305bf993cac7a8018f90/199_151_3239_1944/500.jpg", "body": "Ashley Young is due for a medical at Everton on Tuesday with a view to joining as a free agent after leaving Aston Villa.

Stick to the plan. We\u2019re all in this together. Your rent is going through the roof and your bills are turning red, and your local supermarket has started putting security tags on the cheese, but the sunlit uplands are at hand. Desperate parents are stealing baby formula and corporate profit margins are fattening and there seem to be a lot more mattresses on the street these days, but trust the process. And in the meantime, try to avoid asking for a pay rise, buying branded goods or watching live sport. Full disclosure: I\u2019m probably not the best person to be writing about the rising cost of attending sport in this country. I get to do it for free. It\u2019s the most pathetic excuse for a job yet invented. Likewise, among the sports media as a whole, ticket prices have always been something of a blind spot: a war we so rarely have to fight, a huge segment of the sporting experience to which, with a cheery wave of a lanyard, we remain largely oblivious. But really it\u2019s time somebody started kicking up a fuss, because it\u2019s getting ridiculous out there. \u201cWe are acutely aware that everyone is currently impacted by the rising cost of living,\u201d Tottenham announced in April, as they froze season-ticket prices for the 2023-24 season. \u201cWe recognise the ongoing commitment our fans continue to make,\u201d the club added. Begrudging grunts of approval all round. Spurs finally get it. Spurs, the Premier League side most famous for punching themselves in the face, decide to stop punching themselves in the face. Well, for about three months. Last week the club quietly increased its match-day ticket prices by around 20%: more in some areas, less in others. The cheapest adult ticket to watch the home games against Wolves or Nottingham Forest is now \u00a348, a price that applies to only a tiny sliver of seats. The list of premium Category A fixtures (\u00a365-\u00a3103) has been subtly extended. Many parts of the ground do not offer child discounts. \u201cOur match ticket prices are comparable to other London clubs,\u201d Tottenham argued, as if disgruntled Spurs fans were ever going to form an orderly queue outside the Emirates or Stamford Bridge instead. This, of course, is the subtext of the whole exercise. If you\u2019re a loyal Spurs fan who wants to see them live, you\u2019re trapped. There are no other clubs. There is no Lidl own-brand mince to which you can downgrade. What is a fair price for a ticket? It is exactly what the club says it is, and you will fork it out for as long as you are able: not so much pay-what-you-can, as pay-until-you-can\u2019t. Once you no longer generate sufficient financial value for Enic Group, it will replace you with somebody richer. Maybe that someone richer was you once. Well, circle of life and all that. And of course Spurs are just the sticky time-sensitive example here. Promoted Sheffield Wednesday have just announced a top-price ticket of \u00a359 to watch \u2013 with the greatest of respect to the Championship \u2013 the Championship. Stockport County tried to charge fans \u00a327 to watch League Two football, only to cut their prices again after a huge backlash. For smaller sports, meanwhile, the window of opportunism is far smaller, which in this straitened post-pandemic landscape has ignited some spectacular increases. Take the Friday of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. I don\u2019t fully understand the appeal of watching cars not racing each other, but in 2019 the market valued a ticket for the first practice session at \u00a350, and now it costs \u00a3169. The cheapest adult tickets for the Ashes Test at Old Trafford were around \u00a340 in 2019 and about \u00a360 this week. The Wimbledon ground pass \u2013 once a cheap and cheerful way of introducing children to grand slam tennis \u2013 now costs \u00a327. In a way this is a process that has been under way for years, a slow boil of avarice and speculation, a gradual socioeconomic cleansing of the sporting audience. We tend to hear lots of prevarication about \u201cthe wider economic picture\u201d, about the rising cost of energy and supplies, about the basic inevitability of the doom spiral. Hold your nerve, guys. We\u2019re in this together. Once energy costs come down, interest rates peak and supply chains free up, the clubs and governing bodies who leaned on you so heavily during the hard times will surely drop their prices again as a reward for your devotion. The \u00a320 Premier League ticket is just a few turbulent economic cycles away. Trust the plan. People in sport love talking about all the good that sport does. As a communal experience, as a teacher of values, as a form of exercise, as a source of joy and wonder and inspiration, as an expression of local and national pride, as an extension of identity, as a safe space, as a pillar of the community. So what does it say about a sport when it seeks to court the most affluent audience possible, when it raises its barriers to entry, when a whole generation of people \u2013 disproportionately young, disproportionately non-white \u2013 is being walled out, priced out, cut adrift? Perhaps that only rich people deserve good things. Perhaps that the worth of a person is bound up in their ability to pay for stuff. In this respect you might observe that British sport serves as a depressing analogue for Britain at large.

As hot takes on household appliances go, this one intrigues me most. After all, no one gets het up over kettles.

On the one hand, I can see how they got there, as for many years microwaves did mean \u201cbad\u201d cooking. Popularised in the late 1970s, the gadget spawned a slew of microwave cookbooks, which advocated zapping everything from french toast to roast beef. My dad microwaved scrambled eggs throughout his single parenting years, and though my brother and I liked them at the time, I can still recall their \u2026 solid texture. Then came the 80s, and its brightly packaged, highly processed ready meals, and the microwave was tarnished by association when those foods started \u2013 rightly \u2013 falling from grace. But to associate microwaves only with ready meals reveals a mindset that is stuck in the past \u2013 and real foodies know that using them makes eating healthier and more convenient, not lazier. Take lasagne, for example. Call me fussy, but I refuse to condone the belief that melted-then-solidified mozzarella and bechamel sauce is \u201cbetter\u201d fridge-cold. A microwave is the best (because quickest, tastiest and most energy-efficient) way to reheat it so it\u2019s oozing and bubbling again. Reheating food \u2013 particularly curries, stews and pies \u2013 brings out flavours that have had time to develop overnight, an effect the Waitrose cooking report informs me is known as \u201ckokumi\u201d or \u201crich taste\u201d. Reheating cooked pasta lowers its GI, transforming it into a slower-releasing carbohydrate. And a microwave\u2019s ability to cook greens while preserving the nutrients they contain makes it a gadget for life, not just for leftovers. As with every story, this one\u2019s more complicated than it seems, not least by time and trends in food and society. When it comes to ultra-processed food, it is clear the microwave is not the organ grinder but the monkey \u2013 and the issues go far beyond \u201cmicrowave meals\u201d. As for my dad\u2019s eggs \u2013 well, while they\u2019re no threat to Delia Smith\u2019s, they do point to the microwave\u2019s power to help people muddle through when they\u2019re struggling. I think of a microwave and I think of my late grandpa, who at 100 years old was still able to live alone thanks to that and Wiltshire Farm Foods ready meals delivery service. I think of my grandma, who batch cooked for my mum so she could maintain her career and still feed us kids well in the evenings. I think of everyone tight on money and time, trying to minimise waste and maximise energy efficiency. On a lighter note, I think of myself and my preference for leftover hot food to be hot when I eat it the next day. So I\u2019m delighted with Waitrose\u2019s report, which as well as giving me a new word, is helping to rehabilitate my much-loved, much-maligned gadget. I\u2019m Clare, I drink just wine, ride a bike with five gears \u2013 and I\u2019m that person who has a microwave.

In a matter of minutes, the 5.5 magnitude quake that hit Haiti\u2019s west coast on 6 June flattened houses, blocked main roads and inundated healthcare facilities with patients. At the Saint-Antoine hospital in the regional capital J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, people with open wounds and dislocated joints were forced to stand in the corridors wailing, say doctors. Though the earthquake was not the strongest in Haiti\u2019s horrific history of natural disasters, it shook the flimsiest of foundations. It cruelly came just days after flash floods had displaced more than 13,000 people and killed at least 50. \u201cDisasters keep hitting Haiti, left and right. People have not had sufficient time to recover from previous disasters, only to be hit by flash floods, an earthquake, and landslides in a matter of days,\u201d says Dr Didinu Tamakloe, Haiti country director for Project Hope, a humanitarian aid organisation responding to the crisis in J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. Officially four people were killed and 37 were injured in the earthquake, but many were unable to reach hospitals due to landslides and blocked roads, and prohibitively expensive fuel prices. The collapse of the Haitian state in recent years means there is little help for people to rebuild their houses and lives. \u201cThe local government has no capacity to respond. Each time a disaster happens, a cyclone, an earthquake, we are left to help ourselves,\u201d says 51-year-old Orelin Esnaille. His arm is in a sling after dislocating his shoulder during the quake. He will need help as he recovers from extensive shoulder surgery over the coming months and will have to rely on friends to feed, house and care for him. \u201cWithout work I cannot pay my children\u2019s school fees, I cannot pay for my medication, I cannot even find money to eat,\u201d he says. Since Haiti\u2019s president Jovenel Mo\u00efse was killed in July 2021 the country has spiralled out of control as armed gangs fight for control. The economy has been paralysed, millions are going hungry and cholera has returned. On 1 July, the health ministry reported 400 weekly cases of the bacterial disease since the earthquake, four times the number reported on 31 May. Some health centres remain just rubble after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that struck the south of the country in 2021, while beds in other hospitals sit on cinder blocks and are tended by overworked nurses who lack basic medicine and medical supplies. \u201cThese conditions are expected to continue \u2013 and potentially worsen \u2013 throughout hurricane season,\u201d says Brenda Rivera-Garc\u00eda, senior director of Americares Latin America and Caribbean programmes. The NGO is currently preparing a team to send to J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. \u201cPeople by any legal or illegal means are leaving the country. There is no more hope,\u201d says Flavia Maurello, Haiti country director of Italian NGO AVSI. Many NGOs have also left because the country has become too unsafe or difficult to work in. MSF has suspended its operations at its hospitals or closed centres in Port-au-Prince a number of times in the past two years. On Friday, it suspended all activities at its hospital in the Tabarre district of the capital after 20 armed men stormed the building and seized a patient at gunpoint. The organisation has said that Port-au-Prince \u201ccontinues to sink into exponential violence\u201d. About 90 gangs now control about 80% of the city, but civilians remain caught up in street skirmishes between rival factions, self-defence brigades and the police. A month after the earthquake, NGOs are warning that the mental and emotional impact of the disaster, added to the violence and previous calamities, will be felt for generations unless addressed. The cumulative trauma Haitians have experienced has made them fragile, says Hannah Mackynzie Archer, Project Hope\u2019s monitoring and learning manager. \u201cAll this takes a toll on a person\u2019s mental health, a community\u2019s wellbeing and the ability to heal in an empowered way that allows you to overcome obstacles,\u201d she says. Marie Joseph, who watched her neighbours\u2019 house topple over, killing the three people inside, says she is constantly anxious about whenthe next tremor will come. \u201cWe do not feel safe or comfortable \u2026 we know our houses are not safe,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew those people that died. They were my neighbours and it is traumatic to run outside, watch their house fall and them die under it. I have no support for this. Our children grow up surrounded by trauma. The whole community feels stress \u2026 and that stress develops in other symptoms, you can\u2019t sleep, you get sick, you can\u2019t work, you can\u2019t live like that \u2026 we have no time to heal.\u201d Leaders across the world agree Haiti urgently needs international help to restore order and end the country\u2019s abject suffering, but there is no diplomatic consensus as to how. Haiti\u2019s prime minister, Ariel Henry, has called for the UN to send troops but that would mean backing a government with little legitimacy. Previous international missions have also been mired in scandal, making diplomatic resolutions tricky. Last month, the UN official William O\u2019Neill called for an arms embargo, saying: \u201cThe survival of an entire nation is at stake.\u201d In the meantime, Haitians are left to rebuild their houses knowing that another disaster will come soon and there is little they can do to prepare for it. \u201cWe do not have the construction or building materials to make better housing that will not fall during an earthquake. A lot of people know that their homes are not safe, but what else can we do?\u201d Esnaille says."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5f9e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/11/afternoon-update-ben-roberts-smith-appeals-defamation-ruling-clare-nowlands-family-sues-nsw-government-and-abortion-pill-access-made-easier", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Afternoon Update: Ben Roberts-Smith appeals defamation ruling; Clare Nowland\u2019s family sues NSW government; and abortion pill access made easier", "lead": "The former SAS soldier filed his appeal this afternoon, two days before the deadline", "author": "Antoun Issa", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 06:37:51", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953310", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8ed4e0371c1f1594910543544fbceefe4bf60426/0_0_2500_1500/500.jpg", "body": "Good afternoon.

The queue is the most well run and efficient. The security office where I collected my pass was the most immaculate I\u2019ve ever seen; the attendant\u2019s uniforms were spotless, the clocks were by Rolex. That order continues once you\u2019re on site. There are smartly turned-out young members of all the armed services (including the \u201credcaps\u201d of the military police) helping with both security and directions. There are perfect crocodiles of ballboys and girls marching at a regulated distance apart. With their socks all pulled up to an agreed length. There are water refill stations wherever you might need them. The line judges, and greensmen and greenswomen (I had to look them up, but they\u2019re the young people, older than ballboys and ballgirls, but uniformly at least two decades younger than me, who wear green and who hold the umbrellas above the players as they rest between games) are all head to toe in Ralph Lauren. I\u2019ve always liked the commitment Wimbledon and the All England Club has to its visual identity. The green and the white of the courts, the player\u2019s whites stripped of all but the smallest emblems from their sponsors. When Ralph Lauren first sponsored the uniforms some thought they aped a \u201cBritishness\u201d that seemed too self-conscious. An American\u2019s idea of what British people are; a preppy version of Frasier\u2019s Daphne. But they were wrong. That\u2019s what is genius about the uniforms: the white collars and immaculate peaked caps of the line judges speak to a nostalgia for something that never was. The slight unreality seems to mitigate the possibility for jingoism. Wimbledon feels as British as The Wicker Man does, but not sinister, and not political. The flag is green purple and blue rather than red white and blue. Everyone working at the tournament has a uniform of some sort even the photographers. All of us fortunate to secure a pass are issued the sleeveless, mesh pocketed jackets beloved of anglers and supporting artists dressing as press photographers in ITV crime dramas. I would usually have been embarrassed to wear that get up, but there\u2019s no point being embarrassed when everyone else is also wearing them, and it turns out lots of big pockets are actually quite useful. There are not a huge number of photography passes issued, and I was extremely grateful to have received mine. Obviously most photographers there are sports photographers, and they\u2019re the best in the world at this. I am definitely not a sports photographer. I walked past the open laptops, with shots from the courts, in the photographer\u2019s centre in awe, feeling like a fraud carrying just my small rangefinder with a prime 35mm lens and an old 1980\u2019s flashgun. I wanted to commit to one style and one technique. I like the way a fill flash, particularly when used on a bright sunny day, can give a slightly hyperreal effect. Zachy, 6, is autistic. His mother felt this picture of him enjoying the event may encourage other parents of autistic children. And I like the personal challenge of using just one specific lens for a series of images. I find it means you really have adjust the way you think and see through the lens rather than the other way round. Here, this way of working presented a challenge, in that you most definitely are NOT allowed to use a flash courtside for very obvious reasons. Rather than filing a series of Wimbledon images with no actual shots from the tennis courts, I asked a photographer friend with years of experience of working there to tell me which side of the court to sit and at what time when the light would be low and directly behind me so that it would visually match with the images taken with a fill-flash. It\u2019s a \u201ccheat\u201d, but I\u2019m Ok with that in the circumstances. The final shot of Andy Murray does slightly bend the rules I\u2019d set myself with light, but it is shot on a 35mm. He\u2019s my sporting idol, and sitting courtside and seeing him play on Centre Court, and hearing both his roars and the crowd was both a thrill and such a privilege."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fa0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/11/kashmir-opens-first-care-homes-for-the-elderly-but-not-everyone-is-happy", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Kashmir opens its first care homes for old people \u2013 but not everyone is happy", "lead": "Many fear the new homes will speed up a shift away from the traditional ways of family life where elderly people are looked after by extended family.

He was moved to the home in Budgam from hospital, where he was being treated for kidney failure. When Dar died in March, staff at the home in Indian-administered Kashmir struggled to find a place to bury him because he didn\u2019t have a family burial plot. In Kashmiri society, elderly people usually live with their children. Beyond the immediate family, extended relations and strong kinship ties have offered a safety net to people as they age. Failing to support parents or relatives is seen as shameful. But this year, the Kashmir authorities opened the first residential homes for old people in the region. Run by NGOs on behalf of the government, they are to meet a small but growing need that indicates a shift in attitudes. Mohammad Shafiq Chak, director of social welfare in Kashmir, says the fact that the 10 homes only have a few residents \u2013 currently 45 \u2013 is \u201cgood news\u201d and means the situation \u201cisn\u2019t alarming yet\u201d. But Sumaya Ramzan, superintendent at a home in Srinagar and a social worker, is concerned. \u201cIndividualism has crept up strongly over the last few years and traditional values that emphasises the welfare of the whole family as a unit, where elderly people would find a place of importance, are receding,\u201d she says. The idea of care homes remains problematic, however. \u201cWhen we were looking for spaces to rent for the home, people would not let to us after they came to know the purpose. They would resent the idea of an old age home,\u201d says Ramzan. \u201cIn one place, the father of the man who was going to rent us the building told him: \u2018Today, you open this here, tomorrow you will admit me into it.\u2019\u201d Mohammad Afaaq Sayeed, who runs the NGO Social Reforms Organisation, Kashmir, abandoned plans for a home after resistance from colleagues. \u201cWe got a lot of negative comments about it, people said don\u2019t do this.\u201d Sayeed believes it will take years for full acceptance of care homes. But residents are not retired people who choose to live there for comfort. They are from the margins of society who have been abandoned by families. Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an activist who arranged for Dar to stay in the Budgam home, says he was initially against their establishment, \u201cbut \u2026 for those people who have no one or who have been abandoned, it is very important that such places should exist. Dar\u2019s case is relevant. If there wasn\u2019t such a place, where would we have taken him?\u201d Abdul Majid*, 75, had been homeless for a month when he was taken to a residential care home by Hope, an NGO in Baghi Mehtab, Srinagar, about four months ago. He had left the family home after being abused by his sons. \u201cMy nose was broken, my clothes were torn, I was locked [indoors] during the day,\u201d he says. No relatives or neighbours came to his aid. He now lives with two other men in the home, which has five rooms, a kitchen, two washrooms and three staff. One resident recently left after being reunited with her family. The days consist of walks, television and playing carrom, a board game. They have found camaraderie. \u201cI had never thought I would end up like this,\u201d says Majid. \u201cWhen I came to the old age home, when they saw my condition, they kept me. I just want a place to stay.\u201d Bashir Ahmad* moved in after being made to feel a burden by his brothers and sister, who he had lived with since the death of his mother. He says he now feels content. \u201cHere, you can freely converse and share your heart\u2019s musings. There, you couldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThe disintegration of the joint family structure makes the elderly population more vulnerable to issues of care, neglect, abuse,\u201d says Dr Farah Qayoom, an assistant professor of sociology at Kashmir University. \u201cSince Kashmiri society is in transition, there are not many agencies to take care of this growing problem of elderly neglect and abuse. Senior citizen homes can help in solving this social problem. \u201cElderly abuse is a stigmatised topic in our society. Many a time, the neglected parents shy away from narrating the stories of abuse and neglect by children, fearing their societal reputation.\u201d *Names have been changed"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fa1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/11/the-best-recent-and-thriller-writing-review-roundup-mj-arlidge-eye-for-an-eye-riley-sager-only-one-left-shari-lapena-everyone-here-is-lying", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The best recent crime and thriller writing \u2013 review roundup", "lead": "The past catches up with nine criminals; a carer finds work with a woman accused of murder; and more than one child goes missing", "author": "Alison Flood", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 06:00:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953365", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c780958c90471b35e81d066803169c5fd441300e/0_78_1000_600/500.jpg", "body": "MJ Arlidge\u2019s Eye for an Eye (Orion) opens with a horrific death. Mark Willis is on his way home when three men wearing latex pig masks corner him. He can\u2019t escape. But this propulsive thriller isn\u2019t an investigation into his death \u2013 or at least not that alone. Mark was one of a handful of criminals in the UK granted lifelong anonymity and a change of identity because of the appalling nature of their crimes. Somehow his identity has been leaked \u2013 and the probation service now fears that eight others in the same situation are also about to be exposed. Arlidge shifts perspectives between these (somewhat) rehabilitated offenders, the victims\u2019 relatives, still traumatised, and the vigilantes responsible for the leaks. \u201cHe would see that they were punished for their crimes, enduring the anguish that they had inflicted on their victims. They would feel the terror, the agony, the fear that was their due.\u201d Eye for an Eye is fast-moving, disturbing and thought-provoking. Caregiver Kit hasn\u2019t worked since being suspended without pay six months earlier. She\u2019s desperate for a job when her boss offers her a post working for an elderly patient who requires constant attention. Unable to speak, able only to move one hand, Lenora Hope lives in a mansion outside of town. She\u2019s the subject of a rhyme children chant in the playground: \u201cAt 17, Lenora Hope/ Hung her sister with a rope/ Stabbed her father with a knife/ Took her mother\u2019s happy life./ It wasn\u2019t me, Lenora said/ But she\u2019s the only one not dead.\u201d Kit takes the job and learns more about what really happened all those years ago in this \u201cmansion teetering on the edge of the ocean. Inside of which is a woman most people assume murdered her family. A woman who has now offered to tell me everything.\u201d Riley Sager\u2019s The Only One Left (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) is melodramatic, very creepy \u2013 and a lot of fun. Bestseller Shari Lapena\u2019s latest, Everyone Here Is Lying (Bantam), opens with a corker of a premise that had me racing through the book. Nora and William have been having an affair, but she has just ended it and they both return to their respective families. When William gets home, desperate for peace and time to wallow in his misery, he finds his difficult nine-year-old daughter, Avery, unexpectedly there. She\u2019s unpleasant to him. He loses his temper and hits her, hard \u2013 then leaves the house. Later that afternoon, when his son, Michael, gets home, Avery is missing. As the police search ramps up, William holds his tongue about the last time he saw her, hindering detectives Gully and Bledsoe\u2019s investigation into what really happened. It\u2019s a clever twist \u2013 I was desperate for the pair to pin the bullying William down on his lies. But the truth proves elusive as they dig into the community, with titbits from neighbours and anonymous phone calls sending them in all sorts of directions. The ending is a little far-fetched for me, but it was a thrilling ride. How many thrillers these days start with a small town and a girl who vanished years earlier, her body never found? Many, is the answer \u2013 with at least two this month. There\u2019s the luminous, unforgettable Kala by Colin Walsh (Atlantic), which we reviewed last month, in which Kala Lannan disappeared from the Irish town of Kinlough 15 years ago. Now her remains have been discovered, and her old gang of friends are reunited and re-examining what really happened back then. Gorgeous and lingering, it is not to be missed. Lucy Campbell\u2019s debut, Lowbridge (Ultimo Press), is more standard thriller fare, although none the worse for it. Moving between 1987, when 17-year-old Tess goes missing from her sleepy Australian town, and 2018, when her mother, Katherine, becomes obsessed with what happened to her, it is intriguing and compelling. \u2022 To order any of these books for a special price click on the title or go to guardianbookshop.com.

Ushers were guiding opera-goers down the cobbled streets and over the bridge which earlier that afternoon had swung open to allow us to sail into Savonlinna. This is one of the world\u2019s most unusual music festivals. It takes place every July in the 15th-century Olavinlinna fortress on an island in Finland\u2019s south-eastern lake district. Traditionally, the seating has verged on the medieval, too. Less a case of the princess and the pea, more of hardcore opera buffs willing to sit on wooden benches or hard chairs for three or more hours. But these days, while you still file up the maze of stone staircases to the auditorium, you find softer chairs, improved views of the stage and an awning offering protection from downpours \u2013 all of which were added last year to make the event more accessible. This summer\u2019s programme includes, appropriately enough, a double bill of Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Bluebeard\u2019s Castle and Outi Tarkiainen\u2019s A Room of One\u2019s Own \u2013 a combination of the Hungarian\u2019s symbolist operatic drama and Virginia Woolf\u2019s most feminist work. The other operas are Romeo and Juliet, The Magic Flute and The Barber of Seville, with a musical, Fiddler on the Roof, and a pop concert by Katie Melua as more mainstream offerings. All make full dramatic use of the all-enveloping thick stone ramparts that seem to echo a protagonist\u2019s torments in a way no opera house can match. The festival is unique, but for another one-of-a-kind experience, this is also the place to try a lake cruise. Finland has nearly 200,000 lakes, and Savonlinna proved a good starting point for a cruise, given the comfortable four-hour ride on a doubledecker train from Helsinki, which boasts a children\u2019s play area as well as a restaurant car. Once you arrive, everything is in walking distance, including the string of craft on the quayside. There are 15 cruises from Savonlinna, which run mostly from June to August. They range from short \u20ac15 trips and dinner cruises to multi-night stays. You can choose to travel on a historic steamship or a motor cruiser, or one of the newly added electric eco boats. My parents and I took one of the more traditional craft for a two-day round trip heading northwards. Inside the comfortable salon we sat down to coffee and pastries and gazed out at the landscape. At times we were cruising through narrow, rocky channels. At other times we could scarcely see the shore. Lake Saimaa has 14,000 islands, many dotted with summer houses painted in traditional red and white. As the sun came out so did swimmers, tentatively climbing down ladders on the jetty before hurrying back to saunas to warm up again. Lunch was a simple, inexpensive salmon dish, and while eating we scanned the horizon for our fellow fish-eaters: seals. The Saimaa ringed seal is one of only three species of freshwater seal, left there by the ice age. As late as 11,000 years ago a sheet at times nearly two miles thick covered the country, creating this fissured landscape of ridges and channels. Soon the tempting aroma of an early supper wafted into the cabin, as the tower of Kuopio, with its revolving restaurant, came into view. This gives a bird\u2019s-eye view of a landscape where in summer one day merges into another and time appears to stand still. If you want a change on the return route, you can sail to the Orthodox monastery at Valamo. Or you can break your journey at Savonlinna with visits to nearby attractions such as Punkaharju, a spit of land that is home to Lusto, the surprisingly fun forestry museum. It reveals how Finland is pioneering sustainable practices in the forests that cover nearly four-fifths of the country. Or visit Kerim\u00e4ki, which has the world\u2019s largest Christian wooden church. You can also combine the cruise with a bike ride \u2013 the Kerma canal to Savonlinna route is popular. Many boats carry bikes for an extra \u20ac10 or so. Finland\u2019s right to roam gives you the freedom to enjoy most outdoor pursuits regardless of who owns the land, as long as you stay a reasonable distance from people\u2019s houses. It is this connection with nature that Finns say has put them at the top of the world\u2019s happiness report for six years running, with Finnish doctors saying just 15 to 20 minutes in the mossy forest \u2013 roamed by bears, elk, wolves and lynx \u2013 lowers blood pressure and improves mood. Back in the boat all was calm, even when we were navigating the rapids that threatened to engulf the fishers, up to their thighs in water, and kayakers, who like ducklings followed their leader into locks. Even sturdy tugs pulling kilometre-long islands of timber behind them seemed to be reduced to a standstill by the current. After such tranquillity, returning to the relative hustle and bustle of Savonlinna felt almost overwhelming. A soprano was performing the daily afternoon recital in front of the harbourfront restaurants \u2013 a call back to a more scheduled life. I had time for a dip from one of the many sandy beaches into Saimaa\u2019s clear dark waters, just like its seals. Then I hurried back to the hotel, which like many in Finland comes with an en suite sauna, before it was time for another immersion: a cultural plunge with a different thrill into our next opera. The Savonlinna opera festival runs from 1 to 30 July. From Helsinki you can take the train to Savonlinna, changing at Parikkala.

Australia\u2019s players will scatter across the UK and Europe for a few days of rest and recreation: tennis enthusiast Steve Smith heads to Wimbledon, a group of golfers to Scotland, while other destinations include live-music hub Bristol, the rolling hills of the Cotswolds, and the continental lights of Paris, Amsterdam and Spain. They will return to camp from 14 to 16 July. The break means that Josh Hazlewood\u2019s return to the bowling lineup is all but guaranteed, with Scott Boland likely to make way, while McDonald said that Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s series of unconverted starts still demonstrated that his technique was up to the challenge. The bigger question is how to accommodate Mitchell Marsh, after a dominant century while filling in for the briefly injured Cameron Green, and whether that might be as a makeshift opener replacing David Warner. It hasn\u2019t been ruled out. \u201c[Marsh] did pretty well down the middle order. To put him up to open in English conditions would probably be something we haven\u2019t discussed yet. But we do have some time between now and the next Test,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cYou\u2019ve also got to reflect on what the opening partnership\u2019s been able to do across the six innings and there\u2019s been three 50-plus partnerships in there. Albeit it didn\u2019t function to its level [in the third Test], in some ways it\u2019s done well so far in this series.\u201d More likely, in a team that tends to minimise change, Marsh will keep the No 6 spot ahead of Green for the time being. \u201c[He] was positive, showed great intent and he\u2019s a fine player of the short ball. So there\u2019s a lot to like with how he matches up against England. I thought he was impressive with the ball as well, and he\u2019s done that before in England so that\u2019s nothing new. \u201cThere\u2019s not a straightforward answer really. Cameron Green is important to the structure of the team as well, with his all-round capabilities \u2026 we\u2019ve got a decision to make.\u201d Squeezing out the spinner would not be considered, even though Todd Murphy bowled only 9.3 overs in the Headingley Test to buy one wicket when Ben Stokes was trying to hit every ball for six. The Australia captain, Pat Cummins, explained Murphy\u2019s peripheral role as being based on conditions and the brevity of both England innings, but Old Trafford has a more notable history of bringing spinners into the fray. \u201cWe like to have a balanced attack and it gives you options, you can take pace out of the game,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cYou become one dimensional \u2013 whether it be with the right-arm bowlers or just pace bowlers in general \u2013 without the ability to turn to a spinner. I think that leaves you a bit short at times, and England played a very aggressive side here with Moeen [Ali] at seven and four quicks, but they value the spinner as well just to change the pace of the game. We\u2019ll have to assess that, but as it sits at the moment we do like to have the spinner in the team.\u201d As for Australia\u2019s tendency to use the short ball with catchers out on the fence, expect that to continue despite the game-changing counterattack that England\u2019s lower order employed in the first innings at Leeds. \u201cThe short ball\u2019s been used more regularly in this series than I\u2019ve ever seen before and with the short ball comes the risk of runs,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s going to be a plan that\u2019s employed throughout the series.\u201d Decisions of when exactly to turn to that plan are the captain\u2019s prerogative, but the coaching staff have plenty of input. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty regular on and off the ground, anything we see there Pat encourages us to communicate to him out there and vice versa. So I think it\u2019s all hands on deck in terms of reading where the game might go and what tactics will be used. We set most of the plans in the morning and then go from there once we get new information.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fa5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/11/retroland-by-peter-kemp-readers-guide-to-dazzling-diversity-of-modern-fiction-review-an-author-preoccupied-by-his-past", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Retroland by Peter Kemp review \u2013 an author preoccupied with his past", "lead": "The veteran Sunday Times critic\u2019s survey of 50 years of British fiction rattles through titles, authors and genres, but often at the expense of insight", "author": "Anthony Cummins", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 06:00:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953440", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/25cd766748d65d517809303ea1481015ac5b8e42/0_0_4018_2411/500.jpg", "body": "No violins please, but I don\u2019t think the day belongs to a literary critic who would dare to imagine their work between hard covers. Because \u2013 bluntly \u2013 who the hell buys a book of book reviews? True, publishers still find it worth their while to collect the odds and sods of a Zadie or Salman-tier novelist for \u00a320 a pop. And, yes, enough writers manage to house review-adjacent output under the sexed-up rubric of memoir (think of Joanna Biggs\u2019s recent A Life of One\u2019s Own: Nine Women Writers Begin Again or Rob Doyle\u2019s Autobibliography). Yet for entirely sensible reasons there\u2019s no great clamour to immortalise the rough and ready ephemera of the week in, week out yay or nay; otherwise DJ Taylor, a longstanding reviewer for Private Eye, probably wouldn\u2019t have brought out his recent collection Critic at Large: Essays and Reviews 2010-2022 (no sexing that up) with tiny Nottinghamshire outfit Shoestring Press, which unwary readers might well mistake for an invention of one of Taylor\u2019s Bookworm columns. All of which makes Retroland, a pell-mell survey of the past half-century of British fiction from veteran Sunday Times critic Peter Kemp, land as something of an intriguing oddity. Styled as honest-to-goodness lit crit for a mainstream audience (academic criticism being another game altogether), it sets out to argue that modern novels are overwhelmingly preoccupied by the past; a thesis that\u2019s persuasive enough, and one that possibly goes some way to explaining why, come Booker time, writers who buck the trend by staying in the here and now \u2013 Gwendoline Riley, Sarah Moss, Ross Raisin \u2013 seldom get a look in. Kemp\u2019s tantalising introduction sketches the extent of what his subtitle dubs the \u201cdazzling diversity\u201d of fiction in the period at hand, taking in \u201ca novel that uses only the 483 words spoken by Ophelia in Hamlet\u201d (Let Me Tell You by Paul Griffiths), another \u201cnarrated by the first edition of Joseph Roth\u2019s 1924 novel Rebellion\u201d (Hugo Hamilton\u2019s The Pages), and another \u201cthat excludes the verb \u2018to have\u2019\u201d (Next by Christine Brooke-Rose). Yet you won\u2019t find any of them in Retroland proper, home, instead, to discussions of Midnight\u2019s Children, Atonement, Possession, et al \u2013 not so much off the beaten track as stuck on the M25. But no matter; you read on eagerly, keen to know Kemp\u2019s explanation for the patterns he justly identifies: the \u201cpervasive[ness of] the dual-narrative, double time-scheme novel which juxtaposes a contemporary story with one set in an earlier era\u201d (yes! What\u2019s with that?); the ubiquity of the \u201ctrauma plot\u201d (ditto); and the enduring 90s revival of historical fiction, which the late Helen Dunmore attributed to pre-millennial anxiety about what lay ahead in \u201cthe blank, silent sheet of years around the corner\u201d. Kemp agrees that uncertainty seems a factor, \u201cbut... only one\u201d, as if there\u2019s some other killer analysis up his sleeve; there isn\u2019t. Despite the setup, Retroland is really a pretext for a whistlestop tour of dozens of novels loosely bunched into four groups \u2013novels of empire, novels of \u201cburied trauma\u201d, novels about history and novels built on older novels (such as Smith\u2019s On Beauty, pegged to EM Forster\u2019s Howards End, or Jeanette Winterson\u2019s Frankissstein), all of which rush by in a largely contextless blizzard of titles, names and plots, with next to nothing by way of logical signposting (\u201cIt\u2019s to fiction about personal trauma... that we should now move\u201d, declares Kemp, and that\u2019s that). Any sense of reading as feeling \u2013 of joy, desire, fun, fear and rage \u2013 goes grievously astray in his account of whatever the novel in English has been up to over the past 50 years. When Kemp invokes Mark Haddon\u2019s scintillating Shakespeare reboot The Porpoise, all he has to say about it is that it\u2019s a novel featuring \u201csexual abuse of a daughter... a situation numerous modern authors have broached\u201d, before speeding off into a 400-word blitz through other examples from Ian McEwan, Deborah Moggach, Alexander Stuart, Edna O\u2019Brien, Beryl Bainbridge, Alice Thomas Ellis, Elizabeth Jane Howard, PD James, Ruth Rendell, Simon Brett, Buchi Emecheta, Alice Walker and Graham Swift. About his subject, Kemp knows all there is to know \u2013 that\u2019s clear \u2013 yet as a tour guide he left me muttering at the back of the group, itching to sneak away to the dodgier locales we\u2019re warned off. In the face of so much tasteful commendation (writers who are \u201ckeenly intelligent\u201d or \u201csuperlatively acute\u201d or \u2013 Christ \u2013 \u201can affecting chronicler of human forlornness\u201d), my ears pricked up to hear him pooh-pooh the multi-millennia saga People of the Black Mountains by \u201cWelsh Marxist writer\u201d Raymond Williams as \u201cdaunting\u201d and \u201cdisorientating\u201d. Bring it! Sometimes Retroland reads less like a literary-critical survey than the minutes of a 50-year colloquy between every author who ever put pen to paper: \u201cThe most remarkable portrayal of the consequences of paternal abuse of a son came from Edward St Aubyn...\u201d After a quick trot through Melrose (\u201ca jamboree of jet-black satiric farce\u201d), we go again: \u201cTrauma inflicted on a son by his father is also at the root of fiction by David Vann\u201d. That\u2019s how Retroland rolls, one heroic bridging sentence after another, but when Kemp tells us \u201cthe CAT scan of Vann\u2019s imagination... would probably resemble a bruise\u201d, I finally twigged (via Google) why the book reads like stitched together reviews; it is. When Kemp segues from Sarah Waters\u2019s The Night Watch to The Little Stranger to The Paying Guests to Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s The Stranger\u2019s Child and The Sparsholt Affair, or from John Lanchester to Zadie Smith and Sathnam Sanghera, or from Francis Spufford to Carys Davies and George Saunders, he\u2019s just pasting his old Sunday Times reviews right in. Those examples account for about 10% of the text and there\u2019s a lot more where they came from \u2013 he\u2019s been reviewing for 40 years. Sure, the text isn\u2019t always exactly verbatim; Kemp will switch \u201cvenerates\u201d for \u201cloves\u201d, say, or \u201cgrim\u201d for \u201cghastly\u201d, or \u201cengrossing\u201d for \u201cgripping\u201d (every working reviewer will get a twinge of fellow feeling there). And where his 2011 take on Julian Barnes\u2019s Booker-winning The Sense of an Ending plausibly suggested that Barnes \u201cteasingly... borrows\u201d the novel\u2019s title from Frank Kermode\u2019s 1967 book about \u201cthe play of consciousness over history\u201d \u2013 a theme that\u2019s also Barnes\u2019s \u2013 the review text that Kemp reuses in Retroland now says only that Barnes \u201ccoincidentally... shares\u201d the title, a change presumably made in view of the novelist\u2019s subsequent (and frankly unbelievable) claim that he had never heard of Kermode\u2019s book, let alone read it. Did Kemp think no one would notice that Retroland is substantially an elaborate patchwork of self-plagiarism? Or does it not matter? They\u2019re his reviews, after all; but then why not be upfront and republish them as a collection? It\u2019s not as if much has been added by way of overarching analysis. Yet in the end these aren\u2019t even the most pressing of Retroland\u2019s unanswered questions. Essentially the book gives us too much and not enough: witness the treatment of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, \u201cthe bleakest modern novel set in the future\u201d, which needlessly blurts out the ending while having not a word to say about the novel\u2019s most striking feature, its language. Did Kemp (or his editor) even figure out who Retroland was for? Either way, it\u2019s a runaway train \u2013 and the carriages are full of recycled plot summary. \u2022 Retroland: A Reader\u2019s Guide to the Dazzling Diversity of Modern Fiction by Peter Kemp is published by Yale University Press (\u00a320).

Although the 180-degree plot pivots start to get a little ridiculous by the end, the script (credited to writer-producer Chen Sicheng, Shuyi Gu and Yixiong Yin) zips along with such gleeful mischievousness that the ride is too fun to resist. Intriguingly, it is supposedly based on a 1990 Russian film called A Trap for Lonely Man, which was itself an adaptation of a stage play by French writer Robert Thomas for which Alfred Hitchcock once bought the rights. You can see traces of what Hitch might have liked about it, because it\u2019s all about dopplegangers, femmes fatale and paranoia spoiling what should have been a nice holiday abroad. The unlucky holidaymakers in this instance are Chinese couple He Fei (Yilong Zhu, in an outstandingly good performance) and his wife Li Muzi, who come to Belandia, a fictional south-east Asian island-nation, to celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary. However, Li Muzi goes missing just days after they arrived. With his tourist visa about to run out, He Fei is first met frantically trying to convince the local police to look for her, but with little success. When he wakes up in his hotel the next day, there\u2019s a beautiful vampy woman there (Janice Man) who claims that she\u2019s Li Muzi, but He Fei insists she\u2019s an impostor, even if she has pictures on her phone, a passport and all the supposedly secret knowledge that supports her claim. Is He Fei, once a diving instructor, suffering from a neurological condition brought on by his line of work or is this woman a con artist? He hires local Mandarin-speaker Chen Mai (Ni Ni, also terrific) to help him investigate his wife\u2019s disappearance and liaise between him and the cops. A tough cookie who drives like Lewis Hamilton and seems honest enough, Chen Mai insists that He Fei tell her the whole truth about the circumstances of his wife\u2019s disappearance. Turns out he\u2019s not been completely honest, of course, and directors Rui Cui and Xiang Liu start skilfully peeling back the onion. The lightly stylised cinematography looks lush, and the pacing adroit, but as Lost in the Stars slides into full-on silliness in its last act, it also gets sticky with sentimentality, serving up soppy slow-tempo ballads in the background and a sob story for one of the main characters. Even so, the film goes to a pretty dark place in the last minutes, which is ballsy. \u2022 Lost in the Stars is released on 14 July in UK cinemas, and is screening now in Australia."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fa7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/first-edition-nato-summit-ukraine-sweden-turkey", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tuesday briefing: Ukraine\u2019s future, Sweden v Turkey and the big questions at Nato\u2019s annual summit", "lead": "In today\u2019s newsletter: World leaders descend on Vilnius, Lithuania this week for Nato\u2019s annual summit \u2013 but what\u2019s on the agenda?", "author": "Nimo Omer", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 05:40:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953476", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8588cc6bfd4124419b681f16cf3608fcce25cb22/0_94_2587_1552/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning. Today, Nato members are gathered in Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital, for their annual summit. Before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the military alliance seemed to have lost a lot of its purpose, and was desperately seeking relevance. Now, thanks to the threat posed by the Kremlin, it has been revitalised. The agenda is packed and the goal is to try to create common ground and settle the conflicting goals and desires of its members, as well as making key decisions on the war in Ukraine and redefining what the future of a relationship between Russia and Nato might look like. Will Ukraine finally get clarity on when it will join Nato? Will member states increase their defence spending? Will Joe Biden give Erdo\u011fan fighter jets despite a lack of congressional approval? These are just some of the questions that will be hashed out in the coming 48 hours. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, about what\u2019s on the table at the Nato summit. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories BBC | The young person at the centre of a scandal over a BBC presenter reportedly paying for explicit pictures has issued a statement through a lawyer claiming the key allegations are \u201crubbish\u201d. The lawyer told BBC News a denial was provided to the Sun before the publication of the original story but the tabloid pressed ahead, without including the young person\u2019s side. Immigration | Controversial plans to house asylum seekers on a barge to reduce reliance on expensive hotels will save less than \u00a310 a person a day, according to a report from the NGOs Reclaim The Seas and One Life To Live. UK news | A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a male teacher at a school in Gloucestershire was stabbed and taken to hospital. The school was placed into lockdown until Monday afternoon when pupils were sent home to their parents. The teacher was later released from hospital. Environment | The beginning of July was the hottest week on record for the planet as a whole, according to the World Meteorological Organization. This year had already seen the hottest June on record, the UN body said, driven by climate change and the early stages of an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. Theranos | Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 prison sentence was quietly shortened by two years, new records show. Holmes had reported to a minimum-security, federal women\u2019s prison camp in Texas after being convicted in November 2022 on four counts of defrauding investors and sentenced to 11 years and three months. In depth: What\u2019s at stake as world leaders descend on Vilnius *** When will Ukraine become a Nato member? Ukraine has been trying to become a Nato member for years, but Putin made it clear that if the alliance were to cultivate closer ties with Ukraine \u2013 let alone admit it as a member \u2013 there would be significant consequences. And then the invasion happened. Nato has, for the last year and a half, been helping Ukraine by supplying equipment, money and training \u2013 but immediate membership has never been less likely, even though Kyiv formally requested a fast track accession last September. The reasons are pretty simple. Nato\u2019s core Article 5 collective defence principle, which means that an attack on one member state is an attack on all members, would effectively result in a global war. \u201c[Nato] would actually have to be sending troops, possibly ground troops, into battle. That\u2019s why they can\u2019t do it now,\u201d Patrick says. So \u2013 if not now, when? One alternative route, supported by a number of Nato members is that Ukraine could be given a fast track in the same way that Finland has. \u201cThis would mean that when the war is over, Ukraine would automatically be allowed to join on the basis that most of its weaponry will be compatible with Nato and that it will be in tune with how Nato thinks and operates,\u201d Patrick says. However, from the latest reports on the last-minute talks before the summit starts today, the expectation is that Nato members will not set clear preconditions for Ukraine\u2019s membership. Some have argued that giving Ukraine a clear timeline almost incentivises Russia to keep the war going to stop that from happening. Others have said that framing Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership like this effectively gives Putin a veto. The US and Germany want to tread even more carefully in case of further antagonising Putin, who has been paranoid about Nato expanding eastward towards Russia\u2019s border. \u201cA lot of it ultimately comes down to a dispute about what will be the future relationship between the west and Russia once this war ends,\u201d says Patrick. *** Security guarantees for Ukraine Outside of membership, another key part of the summit will be the question of security guarantees for Ukraine as the war grinds on. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an extension of what\u2019s already happening but put on a longer timeframe,\u201d Patrick says. Nato will continue to supply arms, particularly weaponry that is compatible with Nato, and there will also likely be some kind of joint production of ammunition and weaponry between Ukraine and Nato members. \u201cThe value of the security guarantees will depend on how specific they are and, as far as I can see, they\u2019re still being worked out even though we\u2019re on the eve of the summit,\u201d Patrick adds. *** Sweden joining Nato Ukraine is not the only country wanting member status \u2013 Sweden has been trying to join the alliance since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion, ending decades of neutrality and military non-alignment. Most of the members had no objections. However, for the past year, Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has stood in the way of Sweden\u2019s accession, alleging that the country is housing Kurdish separatist \u201cterrorist\u201d groups, in particular the militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). Things were further complicated when Erdo\u011fan threw in fresh demands that the EU renew talks with Turkey to finally get a seat at the EU table \u2013 where there is no enthusiasm to allow Turkey to join. \u201cErdo\u011fan is the kind of guy who looks for leverage and traction. He saw that if he vetoed Sweden\u2019s membership he would have a bargaining chip, which he didn\u2019t have hitherto,\u201d Patrick says. For a while, it really looked the stalemate between Turkey and Sweden would remain. However, after last-ditch talks last night, Erdo\u011fan finally agreed to set aside his veto and support Sweden\u2019s accession. This leaves Hungary as the last country standing in the way, though its prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has implied he will move soon. *** Money matters Ukraine and Sweden are just two of a plethora of topics that leaders will have to go through. There is a lot of discussion to be had about the amount of support the eastern flank of Nato will receive. \u201cThe feeling is that the security situation in Poland may have changed as a result of the Wagner group installing themselves in Belarus, so there\u2019s quite a push by the Poles to get more support,\u201d Patrick says. And then there is the small question of budgets and spending. In 2014, members agreed to move towards spending 2% of their GDP on defence by 2024. As that deadline approaches, leaders in Vilnius will agree to make 2% the floor \u2013 rather than the ceiling \u2013 of spending. \u201cIn reality, there\u2019s still a lot of Nato member states that have not reached 2% but will soon,\u201d Patrick adds. Nato allies have 48 hours to settle divisions and disparate goals, all the while the conflict continues. \u201cThe leaders have ended up with a global blancmange of issues,\u201d Patrick concludes. \u201cTrying to get them all sorted and aligned at the same time is really hard.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading I really enjoy a Guardian How we made where you really, genuinely have no clue how the thing in question came together, and the latest \u2013 on Hot Chip\u2019s wonderfully weird Over and Over \u2013 doesn\u2019t disappoint.

Justice Anthony Besanko found in June that three newspapers had proved Roberts-Smith had, on the balance of probabilities, murdered unarmed civilians while serving in the Australian military in Afghanistan. The judge found Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and Australia\u2019s most decorated living soldier, was complicit in four murders and was \u201cnot an honest and reliable witness\u201d who had \u201cmotives to lie\u201d to the court. The Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times published a series of reports in 2018 that alleged Roberts-Smith was involved in murdering civilians, including kicking a handcuffed man off a cliff, ordering subordinate soldiers to kill prisoners, and placing weapons on the bodies of murdered people in order to fake combat deaths. Roberts-Smith sued for defamation. Judgment in the year-long trial was handed down in early June dismissing Roberts-Smith\u2019s claim. Roberts-Smith filed his appeal on Tuesday afternoon, two days before the deadline to appeal expired. His appeal will be heard before the full bench of the federal court at a date to be fixed. It is likely to be next year before the appeal is heard, Guardian Australia understands. Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in the battle of Tizak, in southern Afghanistan, in 2010. Roberts-Smith was also appointed chair of the Australia Day Council and recognised as father of the year. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But in 2018, the three newspapers published a series of articles that alleged he engaged in war crimes, including murdering civilians and ordering subordinate soldiers under his command to kill civilians in so-called \u201cblooding\u201d incidents. Roberts-Smith sued the newspapers, telling the court their stories portrayed him as a criminal \u201cwho broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement\u201d and \u201cdisgraced\u201d his country and its military. The newspapers defended their reporting as true. The trial heard more than 100 days of evidence over more than a year, including extraordinary testimony of murders committed by Australian soldiers, and of a spiteful and factionalised SAS regiment, deeply riven by internecine fighting over decorations and medals and in thrall \u2013 on some evidence \u2013 to a \u201cwarrior culture\u201d steeped in violence. Three SAS soldiers accused of murder on separate missions refused in court to answer questions about what they did in Afghanistan, objecting on the grounds that any truthful answer they gave would be self-incriminatory. The most dramatic allegation concerned the killing of an Afghan father of six, Ali Jan. The court was told that during a 2012 mission to the village of Darwan, Roberts-Smith marched a handcuffed Ali Jan to stand at the precipice of a 10-metre-high cliff dropping down to a dry riverbed. Ali Jan was held by the shoulder by a subordinate Australian soldier, known before the court as Person 11. \u201c[Roberts-Smith] kicked Ali Jan off the small cliff or steep slope into the dry creek bed below,\u201d Besanko said in his judgment. Ali Jan was badly injured but alive at the bottom of the cliff. He was dragged to a cornfield by Australian soldiers, where he was shot dead by the same subordinate soldier, on the orders of Roberts-Smith. \u201cPerson 11 shot Ali Jan who at that point was standing and still handcuffed,\u201d the judge found. \u201cRoberts-Smith was party to an agreement with Person 11 to murder Ali Jan.\u201d Roberts-Smith told the court the man was a legitimate target because he was a scout for enemy insurgents. However, Besanko found Roberts-Smith knew this was false and that he \u201cwas conscious that the killing of Ali Jan was unlawful\u201d. The court also found Roberts-Smith murdered a disabled man with a prosthetic leg during a raid on a compound known as Whiskey 108, in the village of Kakarak, in 2009. On the same mission, Roberts-Smith ordered a subordinate soldier to execute an elderly unarmed prisoner. Further allegations made by the newspapers against Roberts-Smith \u2013 including that he committed an act of domestic violence against a woman with whom he was having an affair \u2013 were not found proven to the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. But the judge ruled those could be defended as \u201ccontextually true\u201d \u2013 and caused no further harm to Roberts-Smith\u2019s reputation \u2013 because of the gravity of the allegations the newspapers had already proven. No criminal charges have been laid against Roberts-Smith and he maintains his innocence. He remains under active investigation by the federal government\u2019s Office of the Special Investigator which was established to investigate allegations of war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fa9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/11/tv-tonight-danny-dyer-is-back-and-starting-fires-in-an-australian-drama", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TV tonight: Danny Dyer is back \u2013 and starting fires in an Australian drama", "lead": "Secrets simmer beneath the surface in a thriller starring the former EastEnder.

A study questions the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) review process for this guideline for clinicians dealing with CFS, also called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), and its use of scientific standards in considering the evidence. One of the study\u2019s lead authors, Prof Trudie Chalder from the psychiatry department at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThe decision to change the guideline has had a direct effect on doctors\u2019 and therapists\u2019 ability to treat patients. Services are no longer able to provide a full range of evidence-based therapeutic interventions. \u201cThis could have a devastating impact on people\u2019s lives in that they will no longer be able to access the treatment that could help them the most.\u201d ME/CFS is a long-term condition believed to affect about 250,000 people in the UK. It has a wide range of symptoms, including extreme tiredness, muscle pain, mental fogginess and insomnia. In 2007 Nice produced its first guideline, which recommended two forms of rehabilitation: graded exercise therapy (GET), which starts patients on exercise very slowly and gradually increases over time, and CBT, a type of talking therapy. In 2021 Nice reviewed the scientific evidence, concluding that the benefits from CBT and GET were low, that GET was unsafe, and CBT should only be used to manage symptoms and distress, not to aid recovery. Chalder said the research evidence base for both therapies had \u201cstrengthened, not weakened\u201d since the 2007 guideline. Instead, the new guideline recommend energy management, providing advice on how to live with the illness and make the best use of energy. However, the researchers said there was little evidence that this was effective. The study, which was published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry and draws on 50 international experts, identified eight methodological, scientific, statistical and epidemiological flaws in the process for establishing the new guideline. The researchers concluded there had been \u201cremarkably little\u201d aggregation and meta-analysis of research, falling short of international standards and making it hard to establish what treatments worked. Another weakness involved the use of a new definition of chronic fatigue, not used in most previous studies, meaning that most trials were excluded. Nice also downgraded all self-reported fatigue-related outcomes on grounds it was too subjective, even though there is no other means of establishing whether a treatment has worked. Co-author on the review Paul Garner, a professor who has worked in evidence synthesis and guideline methodology for 25 years, said: \u201cNice has not followed international standards for guideline development, which has led to guidance that could harm rather than help patients.\u201d Garner said the backdrop to the guideline relates to how poorly understood chronic fatigue is, in part due to limited understanding of the relationship between the brain and the body. Some sufferers feel that in the past their condition has been dismissed by the medical establishment as \u201call in the head\u201d, he said. Many sufferers believe ME/CFS is purely biomedical, whereas some experts think it may be a brain-body disorder. Many patients are sensitive to the inference psychological factors such as stress may contribute to the condition and dismiss psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy, he added. Such sensitivities have led to controversy over whether rest is an appropriate treatment. Although sufferers may feel exhausted after doing things, rest can \u201cperpetuate the illness\u201d, he said. A Nice spokesperson said: \u201cWe reject entirely the conclusions drawn by the authors of this analysis, and in particular their conclusion that Nice has not followed international standards for guideline development which has led to guidance that could harm rather than help patients. In developing our guideline, as well as bringing together the best available scientific evidence, we also listened to the real, lived experience and testimony of people with ME/CFS to produce a balanced guideline which has their wellbeing at its heart. \u201cWe will provide a detailed response to this analysis and in the meantime we are confident that system partners and the ME/CFS community will continue to work together to make sure the important recommendations in our guideline are implemented.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 July 2023.

In reality, it is more likely that much of the gas would be exported overseas to the highest bidder, as is currently the case with about 60% of the UK\u2019s gas production. Over the same period, new oilfields would supply at most about five years of oil demand, if none was exported, according to analysis of government data by the campaigning group Uplift. The UK currently exports about 80% of the oil produced in the North Sea. Ministers are considering scores of potential new licences for exploration or development of new oil and gas fields in the North Sea. A decision on the Rosebank field, one of the largest, is expected imminently. The government has said the new fields are needed for energy security, at a time of rising gas prices, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. However, even former ministers have said the new fields would not reduce energy prices in the UK, as they will take years to come onstream, and the fuel produced will be sold to the highest bidder globally, with little impact on UK prices. Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said the analysis of the fields showed that the government\u2019s energy security claims were unfounded. \u201cIt is pure fantasy to think that the North Sea can somehow satisfy the UK\u2019s demand for gas. As this research shows, there just isn\u2019t that much gas left in UK waters. Opening new fields will only give us one extra year\u2019s worth of gas between next year and 2050. Stopping drilling is not \u2018turning off the taps\u2019, as some have put it, for the simple fact that the taps aren\u2019t flowing any more, they\u2019re dripping.\u201d The decision to move ahead with new licences comes despite advice from the International Energy Agency, commissioned by the UK government, that no new exploration and development of oil and gas fields around the world should now take place if the world is to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Campaigners calculate that greenhouse gas emissions from the Rosebank field alone would exceed the proportion of the UK\u2019s carbon budget that should be for oil and gas. Lord Deben, who stepped down as chair of the climate change committee at the end of June, has also strongly advised against the new licences, though he supports maintaining production from existing fields in the short tterm. Labour has vowed to halt the licensing of new oil and gas fields, if elected. However, if any \u2013 such as Rosebank \u2013 clear the final regulatory hurdles before the general election, Labour has admitted it will be unable to rescind them. The energy minister, Grant Shapps, and prime minister, Rishi Sunak, have sought to \u201cweaponise\u201d Labour\u2019s stance by attempting to draw parallels with the Just Stop Oil protests. At the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had told an internal meeting he \u201chated treehuggers\u201d, seeing the rows over energy and environment policy as an electoral problem. Ed Miliband, shadow climate secretary, said the party\u2019s policies to halt new licensing and boost clean energy would improve energy security and lower bills, and accused Shapps and Sunak of \u201crejecting science in pursuit of a climate culture war\u201d. He said: \u201cAfter 13 years of failure, the Conservatives have left our country deeply exposed with families and businesses paying the price. Rather than learning the lesson of this crisis, they risk a perpetual cost of living crisis with their decision to throw billions at a strategy to double down on fossil fuels instead of pursuing the clean energy sprint Britain needs.\u201d He added: \u201cThe only way to deliver lower bills and energy security for our country is to move away from fossil fuels, and on to clean, cheap, homegrown power. That is what Labour\u2019s world-leading mission to make the UK the first major world economy to have a clean power system by 2030 will deliver.\u201d Uplift\u2019s analysis, based on data from the North Sea Transition Authority, which regulates the industry, found that existing gas fields in the North Sea contain enough gas for just over five years at predicted levels of demand. Khan said this showed that ministers concerned with energy security should be investing in low-carbon energy, which is cheaper and will not run out. She pointed to research from the UCL Energy Institute, which concluded that with greater policy ambition the UK could be entirely fossil fuel free by 2045. Demand for natural gas could be cut to nearly zero by 2045, with no imports from 2040. She warned: \u201cThe UK will be forced to import more and more expensive gas unless we shift away from fossil fuels to heat our homes. This is a fact that the government is either ignorant of, refusing to confront, or is withholding from the public. The longer they sit on their hands, the longer people and businesses in the UK will be facing sky-high energy bills.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cWe\u2019re building a future diverse energy mix that is cleaner, cheaper and more secure and avoids an increased reliance on foreign oil and gas imports as we move to net zero. The transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we\u2019re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent climate change committee. Sourcing gas domestically is also better for the environment as it has a lower carbon footprint.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/11/labour-urged-again-to-vow-to-scrap-tories-two-child-benefit-limit", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labour urged again to vow to scrap Tories\u2019 two-child benefit limit", "lead": "Exclusive: Data shows policy, deepening poverty among low-income families, affects about 1.5 million children", "author": "Patrick Butler, Michael Goodier and Aneesa Ahmed", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 05:00:33", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953568", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/971147f797e7f8ecb987b48a9e234e245edb6945/362_606_1492_895/500.jpg", "body": "Labour has come under fresh pressure to vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap after it emerged one in four children in some of England and Wales's poorest parliamentary constituencies live in families left at least \u00a33,000 a year out of pocket as a result of the policy. The party\u2019s stance on the policy, which critics say has been a major driver of deepening poverty among low-income families, is estimated to affect about 1.5 million children and is seen by some in Labour as an indicator of the strength of its determination to tackle child poverty. Keir Starmer has promised an incoming Labour government will be \u201claser-focused on poverty\u201d but has so far refused to be drawn on detail such as whether it will dismantle the two-child limit, a Tory policy regarded by even some in the Conservative party as an exemplar of austerity-era cruelty. The two-child limit bars parents from claiming child tax credit or universal credit for any third or subsequent child born after April 2017. It was designed to force parents of larger families to find a job or work more hours, but academic studies showed its main function has been to impoverish families rather than increase employment. The backbench Labour MP Kim Johnson, who is leading a Westminster debate on the policy on Tuesday afternoon, told the Guardian while she understood Labour\u2019s caution on spending commitments, abolition of the two-child policy must be a pillar of a \u201cbig and bold\u201d party manifesto to tackle child poverty. Johnson hoped the future of the two-child policy would become a key debate within the party over the coming months. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a magic wand \u2013 this government has crashed the economy and the country is in dire straits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be very difficult. But tackling poverty has to be a cornerstone of our policies.\u201d The policy is likely to surface at the party\u2019s national policy forum in Nottingham later this month, when activists, unions, MPs and the leadership will debate party policy before general election preparations begin at its autumn conference. Abolishing the two-child limit would cost \u00a31.3bn a year but lift 250,000 children out of poverty and a further 850,000 children out of deep poverty, say campaigners. Joseph Howes, chair of the End Child Poverty Coalition, said: \u201cIt is the most cost-effective way that this, or any future, government has of reducing the number of children living in poverty.\u201d The parliamentary constituency of Blackley and Broughton in Manchester was worst hit by the two-child limit, with 28% of children affected, according to data collected by the End Child Poverty Coalition. In a further seven seats, at least a fifth of children were affected. Many of the seats worst affected are in the Midlands and north of England: 12% of children living in \u201cred wall\u201d seats \u2013 key battlegrounds at the next election \u2013 are affected by the policy, compared to 9% outside of the red wall. In the most ethnically diverse constituencies 14% of children are hit by the cap, compared to just 8% in the areas with least minority ethnic people, reflecting its disproportionate impact on religious and racial groups more likely to have larger families. Almost a quarter of children in Birmingham Hodge Hill \u2013 the seat in England and Wales with the highest proportion of Muslim residents at the time of the census (62.4%) \u2013 are affected by the two-child limit. The leading social policy academic professor Jonathan Bradshaw has called the two-child policy \u201cthe worst ever social security policy\u201d in a crowded field going back to the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, as well as \u201cmorally odious\u201d and \u201cvindictively conceived\u201d. The two-child policy was even disparaged by Lord Freud, an austerity-era Conservative welfare minister, who last year called it \u201cvicious\u201d and an \u201cexcrescence\u201d. He said it was foisted on reluctant ministers by the Treasury as the price of introducing universal credit, and should be scrapped. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: \u201cWe know people are struggling with rising prices, which is why we are providing record financial support worth around \u00a33,300 per household and bearing down on inflation to help everyone\u2019s money go further. \u201cThe two-child policy asks families on benefits to make the same financial decisions as families supporting themselves solely through work, and there continues to be careful exemptions and safeguards in place within the policy to protect people in the most vulnerable circumstances.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fad", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/11/eu-to-drop-ban-of-hazardous-chemicals-after-industry-pressure", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "EU to drop ban of hazardous chemicals after industry pressure", "lead": "Exclusive: Leaked documents show that as little as 1% of products containing hazardous substances could be prohibited", "author": "Arthur Neslen", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 05:00:33", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953586", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/04f7f3dbe53d1a0da0d4dcde29ee7262b1a64a14/0_264_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The European Commission is poised to break a promise to outlaw all but the most essential of Europe\u2019s hazardous chemicals, leaked documents show. The pledge to \u201cban the most harmful chemicals in consumer products, allowing their use only where essential\u201d was a flagship component of the European green deal when it was launched in 2020. It was expected that between 7,000 and 12,000 hazardous substances would be prohibited from use in all saleable products in an update to the EU\u2019s Reach regulation, including many \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2013 or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) \u2013 which accumulate in nature and human bodies, and have been linked to various hormonal, reproductive and carcinogenic illnesses. But the Guardian has learned that the EU\u2019s executive is on the brink of a climbdown under heavy pressure from Europe\u2019s chemical industry and rightwing political parties. The industry-led backlash is causing internal disquiet over the threat to public health and policymaking. One EU official said: \u201cWe are being pushed to be less strict on industry all the time.\u201d A leaked legislative document seen by the Guardian proposes three options that would restrict 1%, 10% or 50% of products containing hazardous chemicals currently on the market. The EU typically selects the middle option. Tatiana Santos, the head of chemicals policy at the European Environmental Bureau, said: \u201cThe EU\u2019s failure to control harmful chemicals is written in the contaminated blood of almost all Europeans. Every delay brings more suffering, sickness and even early deaths. The EU\u2019s regulatory retreat could be the nail in the coffin of the European green deal, fuelling cynicism about untrustworthy elites doing deals with big toxic lobbies, unless the commission makes good on its promise to detox products and stand up to polluters.\u201d The leaked 77-page impact study forms part of a revision of targets in the EU\u2019s Reach regulation covering chemicals law, which is dated 13 January 2023 and due to be launched by the end of this year. The text could be altered but officials say the options under consideration have not substantially changed. The draft analysis estimates that health savings from chemical bans would outweigh costs to the industry by a factor of 10. Reduced payments for treating illnesses such as cancer and obesity would amount to \u20ac11bn-\u20ac31bn (\u00a39.4bn-\u00a326.5bn) a year, while adjustment costs to businesses would be in the range of \u20ac0.9bn-\u20ac2.7bn a year. As well as PFAS, EU regulators found that 17% of European children were at risk from combined exposure to mixtures of phthalates \u2013 linked to developmental and reproductive illnesses \u2013 in a survey of 13,000 EU citizens\u2019 blood and urine last year. Traces of the reprotoxic endocrine disruptor bisphenol A were found in 92% of adults. The study\u2019s coordinator, Dr Marike Kolossa-Gehring, said that more than 34m tonnes of carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances were consumed in Europe in 2020. But the Reach update was delayed after a split between the two commission departments tasked with drafting the new law: the environment directorate, which pushed for robust measures; and the internal market directorate, which resisted. An EU official speaking on condition of anonymity said efforts to dilute the legal revision were helped by \u201ca complete change in the wave of support for consumers and the environment\u201d in Brussels, as MEPs in EU president Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s European People\u2019s party (EPP) became queasy about environmental reform. The official said: \u201cThe feeling in the commission is almost like it\u2019s a given that we cannot create too much trouble for industry \u2013 irrespective of the public health benefits \u2013 and that companies suffer a lot from our regulations on chemicals, so we should try to make it easier on them.\u201d Several EU heads of state added to the pressure. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for a \u201cregulatory pause\u201d in environmental law to help industry, while the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said in May: \u201cIf we are overburdening people with rules and regulations, we risk losing the public support for the green agenda.\u201d The EPP first proposed \u201ca regulatory moratorium [to] delay those acts that would unnecessarily increase costs for businesses \u2026 such as Reach\u201d last September. Its move coincided with an announcement by the German chemicals giant BASF of a \u201cpermanent\u201d downsizing in Europe, which it linked to \u201coverregulation\u201d. Germany\u2019s VCI industry association had called for a postponement of the chemicals ban as far back as March 2022. The VCI director, Wolfgang Grosse Entrup, said last month that a related proposal to ban forever chemicals would have \u201cfatal\u201d effects for German industry. \u201cWith each and every one of these substances that is banned in the EU, the risk of further emigration of our industry to less strictly regulated regions increases,\u201d he said. Last year the VCI gave the EPP\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union parties in Germany more than \u20ac150,000. \u201cA ban on chemicals based on percentage targets would make little sense, as the hazard profile, applications and thus the potential risk of substances vary widely,\u201d the VCI said. Instead, the commission should pursue a \u201crisk-based approach, as this is often the only way to achieve effective, efficient and proportionate risk management,\u201d it added. Eleven PFAS industry players in Germany employed 94 lobbyists and spent a combined \u20ac9m in the most recent annual data, according to analysis by Corporate Europe Observatory due out later this week. In Brussels, 12 members of the PFAS industry have 72 individual lobbyists active and an annual spend of between \u20ac18.6m and \u20ac21.1m, the paper says. One significant lobby battle focuses on a new inventory for polymers \u2013 the building blocks for plastics \u2013 in the Reach reform, the EU official said. The current situation resembled a \u201cregulatory capture\u201d by incumbents, to stifle a growing alternative chemicals industry, they added. The Reach reform was initially a commission priority. The commission\u2019s first vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said in 2020: \u201cIt is especially important to stop using the most harmful chemicals in consumer products, from toys and childcare products to textiles and materials that come in contact with our food.\u201d A commission spokesperson said that Brussels \u201cstrives to take into account comments from stakeholders from all sides in a balanced way. This reflects all objectives of the Reach regulation, which aims at a high level of protection of human health and the environment while enhancing the competitiveness and innovation of the European chemical industry. The commission also needs to ensure proportionality and policy coherence with other important objectives such as climate neutrality, digital transformation and reducing excessive dependence on imported strategic materials.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/heaviest-rain-ever-causes-deadly-floods-and-landslides-in-japan", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Heaviest rain ever\u2019 causes deadly floods and landslides in Japan", "lead": "Mud engulfs houses and cars as island of Kyushu bears brunt of annual rainy season that is worsening with climate change", "author": "Justin McCurry in Tokyo and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 04:55:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953604", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d8b6da42bfdf9af191a747fa18529d0533842784/0_0_3298_1979/500.jpg", "body": "Six people died and three others were missing after the \u201cheaviest rain ever\u201d triggered floods and landslides in south-west Japan.

However, the agency on Tuesday downgraded an earlier special warning for heavy rain covering more than 1.7 million people in northern parts of the island.

The city of Kurume saw precipitation of 402.5mm in the 24 hours to 4pm on Monday \u2013 the highest ever recorded there \u2013 the meteorological agency said. A mudslide in the city hit seven houses, burying 21 people. Six were able to escape, while workers extracted nine alive and were working to remove five others. A man in his 70s was later confirmed dead.

Scientists say global heating is increasing the risk of heavy rain in Japan. The weather agency said it had already been raining for more than a week in parts of northern Kyushu. Officials in the city of Asakura said they believed the rain had peaked, but warned there was still a risk of flooding. \u201cWater levels in rivers are rising so we are staying vigilant against the possibility of overflowing,\u201d said Takaaki Harano, a local official. Landslides represent a serious risk in Japan, where many homes are built on flat land at the foot of hills and mountains. In 2021, a landslide in the hot spring resort of Atami killed 27 people; and in 2018, floods and landslides killed more than 200 people in western Japan during the rainy season.

Sea blends into rocky shore in a convoluted landscape where every few metres perspectives change. It\u2019s like inhabiting a child\u2019s kaleidoscope, a shifting and wholly absorbing picture framed against today\u2019s clear blue sky. The focus on Oronsay is its long-defunct priory, emptied in the Reformation, and the grand farmhouse next door. Both are tucked against the island\u2019s highest hill, mighty Beinn Orasaigh. There are a handful of permanent inhabitants and this is where they live, marooned twice a day. The walls of the priory remain, a chapel and barn, and an elegant colonnade. In front of the priory, pasture stretches evenly towards the coast. The shellfish that create the island\u2019s stunning white beaches have also rewarded Oronsay with a calcareous substrate that grass relishes. The RSPB manages the land here in a canny balance of livestock farming and conservation; there\u2019s a rare colony of choughs and corncrakes to protect. It was the shellfish that first brought humans here. Oronsay is famous for its five middens (heaps) of shells and fish bones dating back 6,000 years to the Mesolithic. One is located close by the priory. Every winter, for several centuries, when the fish moved offshore, the original islanders camped here, collecting shellfish to eat and tossing the remains on to growing piles. Limpets were favourite \u2013 like chewing a pencil eraser, but more nutritious than whelks or periwinkles. Archaeologists have found the pieces of deer antler \u2013 probably from nearby Jura or Islay \u2013 that these pioneers used to chisel the meat from its shelter. Outside the priory is a weathered cross, more than 600 years old, broken and later reassembled: faith setting stones against the world\u2019s turning. The rock is rough and weathered from numberless gales; you can\u2019t help but run your hands across it.

The 87-mile (140km) Tamara Coast to Coast Way broadly tracks the River Tamar, which forms most of the border between Cornwall and Devon, taking in landscapes ranging from wooded valley to rolling farmland, heather-covered moors and areas shaped by the region\u2019s mining history. Announced on Tuesday, one of the aims of the walk is to draw visitors who often stay on the coasts to an often neglected but beautiful hinterland. Will Darwall, the manager of the Tamara Landscape Partnership Scheme, said he hoped the route would inspire people to get out and explore parts of the far south-west of Britain that can be missed in the dash for the coast. \u201cPeople can now not only enjoy a largely overlooked natural landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is huge history and beauty to find here and walkers will also benefit local enterprises along the way, such as local B&amp;Bs and pubs.\u201d The route stretches between the village of Cremyll, overlooking Plymouth Sound, in the south and Marsland Mouth near Morwenstow in the north. Linking the two coasts has created a new 387-mile circular walking route around Cornwall, which has been named Kylgh Kernow, Cornish for \u201ccircuit of Cornwall\u201d. The hardy will be able to walk the Tamara Coast to Coast Way and link up to the South West Coast Path. Darwall said that in the north, walkers would pass the source of the Tamar, marked by a newly placed hefty granite boulder. Further south, the river broadens into a leafy river valley. The route zigs into Devon and back \u2013 though there are alternatives for purists who would prefer to remain in Cornwall if at all possible. Darwall said one of his favourite spots was Horsebridge, a few miles north of Callington, which has a beautiful stone river crossing and a pub. \u201cWe hope it will be well walked,\u201d said Martin Howlett, the chair of Tamar Valley area of outstanding natural beauty. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for the public to enjoy not just the Cornish coastline but the inland countryside, of which we are very proud. It\u2019s a special and unique landscape.\u201d The route takes in two existing paths \u2013 the Discovery Trail in the south and the Bude Canal Trail in the north. A new permissive path on the Pentillie estate near St Mellion, which means walkers do not have to tackle a busy road, helped make the route possible. Its planners have suggested people take seven days to cover the route, with stages ranging from just over four miles (6.5km) to 17 (27km). But walkers \u2013 or runners \u2013 are welcome to do it as quickly or slowly as they choose. The link to the coastal path is likely to be particularly attractive. Walking in the far west of England has been popular for centuries but the publication of the The Salt Path, Raynor Winn\u2019s award-winning description of an emotional walk of the South West Coast Path, has made the area even more of a destination for hikers. Nicky Wilson, the regional engagement officer for the walking charity the Ramblers, said she thought the coast to coast way, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, was \u201creally exciting\u201d. \u201cI think it will attract a mixture of long-distance walkers but people will also do sections,\u201d she said, adding that she was also pleased because she lived in the south and her sister lived in the north, so they would be able to set off along the path and meet somewhere in the middle. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely that these sort of connections are being made.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fb1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/queen-of-a-bathtub-speaks-life-today-controversial-play-revived-israel-after-50-years", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It speaks to life today\u2019: controversial play revived in Israel after 50 years", "lead": "Palestinian performers say musical satire Queen of a Bathtub is more relevant than ever", "author": "Ben Lynfield in Jaffa", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 04:00:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953661", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3da8dbf5babcae1a05824b231c1d8b2896f5814a/0_634_9504_5702/500.jpg", "body": "Hanoch Levin\u2019s Queen of a Bathtub is widely held to be Israel\u2019s most controversial play \u2013 a musical that used satire to attack perceived militarism, self-righteousness and racism in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s victory in the 1967 war and was cancelled after just 19 performances in 1970. This came after a bomb scare at Tel Aviv\u2019s Cameri theatre, rock throwing at actors in Jerusalem and allegations that a \u201csatanic\u201d Levin was stabbing the country in the back as it fought for survival. It is now, more than half a century on, being revived in Jaffa amid a sense among its Palestinian performers it is more relevant than ever. Levin, who died in 1999, highlighted what he saw as as a gap between the way Israelis saw themselves as moral people who are \u201cOK\u201d and the reality of their country\u2019s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, in his view, that they oppress Arabs, prefer keeping occupied land over trying to make peace and send their children to die in battle for no good reason. He had zero tolerance for the wave of nationalist euphoria that swept most of the country with the seemingly miraculous victory in the 1967 six-day war and the \u201cliberation\u201d of biblically resonant sites. On the contrary, in one sketch of the musical, he has Israelis revoke the Ten Commandments given to their forebears at Mount Sinai for reasons including \u201cstate security\u201d. In another, he has the then prime minister, Golda Meir (the queen in the play\u2019s title), apply pressure to the foreign minister Abba Eban\u2019s crotch to ensure he does not make any dovish proposals. Amid settler violence, Israeli army operations on the West Bank, Palestinian attacks in Israel and heightened pressure on Palestinian citizens of Israel by the most far-right government in the country\u2019s history, the play is back on stage, showing that the issues at hand did not start with Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say it\u2019s 50-year-old satire. It definitely speaks of where we are today,\u201d says Shai Bar Yaacov, the theatre critic for Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. \u201cI would say that 80 to 90 % of Israelis still want to see themselves as \u2018OKk\u2019 people who are moral and have values. But together with this, we have not a few flaws of racist thought and admiration for militarism.\u201d This production at the Jaffa theatre has a twist: the show is still in Hebrew but the cast \u2013 Mouna Hawa, Wattan El-Gani, Bassam Biromi and Rami Saliba \u2013 are all Palestinian citizens of Israel, something they and the producer, Rabia Huri, hope gives added irony and power to Levin\u2019s texts. \u201cWe can really express our pain and anger through what Levin wrote,\u201d Huri says. \u201cEvery person has his protest and role to bring change or express anger. This play is one of the ways I convey protest as a Palestinian.\u201d In Huri\u2019s view, the racism Levin accuses Jewish Israelis of is older than the country itself. \u201cIt\u2019s been there always. There are periods and then there are periods. The descent didn\u2019t stop and it can get even worse.\u201d One sketch that has deep resonance for Huri concerns a Palestinian from the occupied territories who is employed by Israelis. They marvel that he walks on two legs like they do, and can hardly hold back their desire to beat him to a pulp. They scorn the Arab for not recognising how humane they are for not smashing his skull. When they are about to harm him anyway, one of the Israeli women, who identifies herself as the mother of a combat soldier and a daughter of Holocaust survivors, intervenes and advises not to hurt the Arab \u201cbecause there are a lot of dirty dishes in the kitchen\u201d. \u201cWhat did this Arab do? Nothing. Levin is showing the violence, racism and supremacism of these people,\u201d Huri says, traits that he argues are now reflected on a larger scale through settler revenge onslaughts against civilians and their property in the West Bank. Hawa, a proud Palestinian from Haifa, is cast in many roles including as Meir. \u201cPart of me didn\u2019t want to do something in Hebrew, in their language, but I believe that art can make people think and change their perception. \u201cThis play is like putting a mirror to them and the fact that I\u2019m Palestinian gives it an added layer. After a lot of shows and seeing the reactions I can say it\u2019s a slap in the face to the audience and I feel I am part of a process of waking people up.\u201d Hawa is sharply critical of the mass protests in Israel against the weakening of the supreme court, saying the current system the demonstrators are trying to preserve is inherently racist. \u201cSaying it\u2019s the Jews\u2019 country and a democracy in the same sentence doesn\u2019t even make sense to begin with,\u201d she says. But Rami Erez, a writer of children\u2019s and sports books who, as head of Hebrew University\u2019s student union in 1970, protected the cast from being harmed, says he feels Israel has in some respects changed for the better, citing the mass turnout at the anti-government protests as proof. Queen of a Bathtub is no longer relevant, he argues. \u201cPeople today are more aware of complexities. Society has changed.\u201d Hawa disagrees: \u201cThings today are even more extreme and dangerous.\u201d She notes that on Thursday an Israeli court acquitted a police officer who three years ago shot to death an autistic young Palestinian, Iyad Halak, in a case that for Palestinians symbolises Israel\u2019s disregard towards their lives. \u201cThis is just a reminder that these protests [against the judicial bill] have nothing to do with our human rights as Palestinians.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fb2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/11/the-orca-uprising-whales-are-ramming-boats-but-are-they-inspired-by-revenge-grief-or-memory", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The orca uprising: whales are ramming boats \u2013 but are they inspired by revenge, grief or memory?", "lead": "A pod in the strait of Gibraltar has sunk three boats and damaged dozens of others, and their story has captivated the world.

You\u2019ve probably gathered the basics: orcas are \u201cattacking\u201d yachts. To be strictly factual, since 2020, a small pod of orcas in the strait of Gibraltar has been interacting with sailing boats in a new way: ramming vessels, pressing their bodies and heads into the hulls and biting, even snapping off, the rudders. Over three years, more than 500 interactions have been recorded, three boats sunk and dozens of others damaged. Last month, the first instance of this behaviour was recorded in another place, when an orca rammed a boat near Shetland. \u201cWhat I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,\u201d said the Dutch yachtsman targeted, Dr Wim Rutten, who had been fishing for mackerel. \u201cMaybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.\u201d There are two fascinating things about this. First, of course, what are the orcas doing? But the second is about another species entirely: us. Why do we like this story so much? Because we do: people \u2013 including me \u2013 love the idea of orcas attacking boats. Browsing through orca memes, there\u2019s an orca as the sickle in the hammer and sickle, with the headline \u201ceat the rich\u201d, and a Soviet-style graphic of a heroic orca emerging under a superyacht. \u201cWhat if we kissed while watching the orcas take back the ocean,\u201d reads one tweet with 1m views, while a much-used image of an arm holding a microphone up to a captive orca has been repurposed endlessly to highly entertaining effect \u2013 I like one where it\u2019s \u201csinging\u201d a bespoke version of the Meredith Brooks classic: \u201cI\u2019m a bitch / I\u2019m an orca / Sinking yachts /Just off Majorca [sic] / I\u2019m a sinner I\u2019m a whale / Imma hit you with my tail.\u201d We\u2019re taking great pleasure in projecting extremely human narratives and motivations on orcas. But how wrong is that, and why does it appeal? The first question is easier to answer, or rather not to answer: we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or why. \u201cWhat I think is most exciting about this is that actually, we don\u2019t know at all,\u201d says Tom Mustill, a biologist and film-maker, who wrote How to Speak Whale, after a humpback whale landed on his kayak (the jaw-dropping footage is on YouTube). \u201cWhen we step outside our rush to project, it\u2019s actually very reflective of where we\u2019re at with cetacean sciences: we\u2019re starting to understand that they\u2019re so complicated and nuanced, and that individuals are very different from one another.\u201d Even if we\u2019re in the conscious incompetence phase of learning about orca behaviour, there are expert theories. \u201cIt could be a curious and playful behaviour,\u201d suggests the 2021 report from the Grupo Trabajo Orca Atl\u00e1ntica (GTOA, or Atlantic Orca Working Group), a partnership of Spanish and Portuguese scientists. That\u2019s a popular hypothesis that Philip Hoare, the author of Leviathan and Albert and the Whale, broadly supports. Hoare experienced his own orca interaction in Sri Lanka, when a small pod head-butted and charged his boat: \u201cI have never been so excited and so fearful in my life,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey\u2019re tremendously powerful, incredibly intelligent, incredibly well organised; if that species wanted to do anything with us in the ocean, they could.\u201d There are no reported instances of wild orcas killing people, but, says Mustill: \u201cIf killer whales wanted to start attacking people, disabling small vessels is a very strange way of going about that. They could just start eating swimmers all over the place.\u201d There are alternative theories. The fibreglass hulls of sailing boats might just feel nice \u2013 and orcas enjoy the sensory feedback: some Canadian pods seem to enjoy rubbing themselves on smooth pebbles (you can watch them on a webcam); or it might just be a trend. As Mustill explains, a number of observed orca fads are not obviously examples of \u201cadaptive\u201d behaviour (meaning \u201cuseful\u201d) \u2013 most famously the one for wearing salmon as hats. They\u2019ve also mimicked sea lions, and some pods engage in \u201cgreeting ceremonies\u201d, described as like \u201ca killer whale mosh pit\u201d. Social learning \u2013 from each other \u2013 is well documented in orca culture and, yes, \u201cculture\u201d is how behavioural science describes it. \u201cThese are cultural beings,\u201d says Barbara J King, professor emerita of anthropology at the College of William &amp; Mary, Virginia, and author of Animals\u2019 Best Friends. \u201cThe networks of individuals in orca societies, which are led by females, are highly attuned to each other\u2019s behaviour, so traditions evolve over time that become, in some cases, cross-generational.\u201d But how about revenge, as many of the memes suggest? The Atlantic Orca Working Group 2021 report also suggested the interactions might be responding to individual orcas\u2019 experiences: \u201cA behaviour induced by an aversive incident, and therefore a precautionary behaviour.\u201d Given a single \u201cmatriarch\u201d orca, \u201cWhite Gladis\u201d, appears to have started these interactions, it has been suggested a prior injury or entanglement could have led her to act. Does that make it revenge? King doesn\u2019t dismiss the idea out of hand. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about capacity, it\u2019s not outside the realm of reasonable expectation and it would not necessarily be anthropomorphic,\u201d she says, though, \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting this in support of an \u2018uprising\u2019 at all.\u201d King has worked extensively on animal grief: her Ted talk on one orca, Tahlequah, who in 2018 carried her dead calf for 17 days and 1,000 miles, has had 3.5m views. \u201cI don\u2019t believe grief is a human emotion; I feel the same way about joy and sorrow. So what about revenge?\u201d She points to narratives around elephants perpetrating destructive acts, which has also been presented as possible retribution for poor treatment. \u201cBoth orcas and elephants have the memory capacity and the intelligence to put these things together.\u201d Some primates, she says, also use \u201ckin-redirected aggression: where if a monkey is attacked, that monkey within a short period of time redirects aggression to the relatives of the opponent.\u201d Orcas, Hoare says, will have a clear sense of what humans have done to their environment. As demonstrated by the actions of White Gladis, orca society is matriarchal, and females can live to 100: \u201cThey will have a memory, almost a generational memory, of a time when the ocean was not dominated by human beings; when there were not seismic surveys, steam engines then diesel engines, military sonar \u2026 The most important thing for them is sound: there will be individual whales that remember when the sea was not that noisy.\u201d So they know what we\u2019ve done and we know what we\u2019ve done too. I think one of the reasons the #orcauprising resonates is our sense of collective guilt or, as Mustill puts it, \u201cWe feel like there\u2019s something deeply unfair happening in the ocean.\u201d From films such as Free Willy to Blackfish, we have become aware of how grotesque the idea of keeping captive orcas is, and we\u2019re ever-more conscious of the degraded state of our seas. Hoare says pictures of the Iberian whales suggest they are in poor condition, with ribs showing on one of the most widely used pictures. \u201cThey\u2019re skinny. They are signifiers of this massively impacted environment.\u201d As Grimes tweeted: \u201cWe deserve to have our boats rammed, frankly.\u201d King is frustrated that our response has been typified by the silliness of social media posts. \u201cIf people truly believe that this is about orcas responding to human harms, then why isn\u2019t the response not just this jokey \u2018orca uprising\u2019?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this the moment that people say: \u2018Whatever the orcas are doing, I recognise anthropogenic harms. This is an opportunity for me: I\u2019m going to stop eating their prey; I\u2019m going to support ocean restoration; I\u2019m going to support the idea of marine sanctuaries for captive orcas\u2019?\u201d But fitting their behaviour to a narrative that suits us is entirely in keeping with our perennial misunderstanding of cetaceans. Hoare sees these interactions and our reaction to them as representative of how, over our shared history, \u201cwhales have had to change according to what we want them to be.\u201d We\u2019ve always imposed a narrative on whales, he explains, from their appearance in creation myths and religious texts, coupled with a view of whales as terrifying monsters, reinforced by Moby-Dick. The \u201cutter and absolute depredation of whale populations\u201d of the early 20th century was eventually countered by the early conservation movement and, crucially, bio-acoustician Roger Payne\u2019s Songs of the Humpback Whale, shifting our perception of them from monstrous killers to mystical barnacled angels that sing. We see them, as Mustill says, as \u201cincredible, empathic, beautiful\u201d, which is also an oversimplification. A friend, he says, was recently rhapsodising about orcas. \u201cI said: \u2018You know they also toy with sea turtles and, like other cetaceans, they do infanticide?\u201d Both Hoare and Mustill note that their rebranding from \u201ckiller whale\u201d to \u201corca\u201d was not particularly popular with scientists, as it was an accurate name for consummate predators. \u201cMaybe they\u2019d like to be thought of as killer whales?\u201d says Mustill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them hunting and they do these things which look like celebrations \u2013 they\u2019re active, they leap out of the water and make a lot of noise splashing. It\u2019s not necessarily a shameful thing to kill.\u201d One very human-coloured notion is the idea that orcas aren\u2019t just taking back the ocean but are somehow fomenting revolution, since the yachts they are ramming are so intimately associated with the ultra-wealthy. White Gladis has been called \u201ca communist orca\u201d. As one post reads: \u201cThe orcas have done more for the working class than our elected officials ever have\u201d; another captions the famous John Cusack boombox scene from Say Anything: \u201cMe standing outside the yacht club playing orca sounds.\u201d It\u2019s silly, but so appealing. \u201cI must admit it\u2019s very attractive,\u201d says Hoare, though he emphasises that he doesn\u2019t want to see anyone hurt. \u201cI love it too,\u201d says Mustill. \u201cWe see something intrinsically fair in these giant, clever, enigmatic killers righting a wrong.\u201d There\u2019s also a sense of wish fulfilment. \u201cIt speaks to our feeling of powerlessness,\u201d says Mustill. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been going out sinking billionaires\u2019 yachts, even though we could.\u201d \u201cThe killer whales are not our friends\u201d read the headline on a much-memeified recent Atlantic article (\u201cJacob Stern [the author] will be the first to go in the orca revolution\u201d as one tweeter put it). But, if they\u2019re not friends, what are they to us? What are we to them? Could we be allies? Mustill recalls a strange and wonderful story from 19th-century New South Wales in Australia, where orcas assisted a family of whalers, who were hunting baleen whales, in return for a share of the catch (the tongue) for more than 40 years. \u201cThey\u2019re very interested in us,\u201d says Hoare. \u201cEvery whale I\u2019ve met, and I\u2019ve met thousands, they\u2019re all interested in us. Because they know there\u2019s nothing out there in their ocean \u2013 other than other whales \u2013 that is like us. We\u2019re talking about all this now; there\u2019s an equivalent conversation going on in orca society. Orca are podcasting. Literally podcasting. I\u2019ll copyright that joke!\u201d He sends me a 10-second recording of sound captured during his own interaction with the orca pod in Sri Lanka \u2013 a complex soundscape of clicks, rasps and squeaks that gives me goosebumps. \u201cIf you could only translate that, everything that has been written about this would be rendered defunct. We\u2019ll all be proved wrong.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fb3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/11/clare-nowland-tasering-victim-family-sue-nsw-government", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Clare Nowland: family sues NSW government after 95-year-old allegedly Tasered in nursing home", "lead": "<strong>Exclusive</strong>: civil proceedings against the state were initially filed while aged care resident was still fighting for her life in hospital", "author": "Christopher Knaus", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 03:07:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953697", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/08792f0a00bd01bda6a934a735e811fe85f9d8c3/0_44_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "The family of 95-year-old Clare Nowland, who died in May after being allegedly Tasered by police in an aged care home, is suing the New South Wales government.

When her husband arrived in Sydney on Tuesday morning, Quynh said the family was overjoyed to be reunited. \u201cWe wish to thank the Australian government for their care and support whilst in custody, especially the tremendous efforts by various departments in securing his return to Australia and to his family today.\u201d Quynh thanked her husband\u2019s legal team and \u201cthe many organisations and individuals in Australia and all over the world who have helped to lobby for his return\u201d. Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia director, Elaine Pearson, said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d at Chau\u2019s release and acknowledged the successful efforts by the Australian government \u2013 \u201cat the most senior levels\u201d \u2013 to secure his release. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news that Australian retired baker and activist Chau Van Kham has been released after more than four years of detention in Vietnam. He spent far too long in prison.\u201d Pearson said Chau was one of more than 150 political prisoners in Vietnam, held for peaceful acts of free expression. \u201cThe one-party state has no tolerance for anyone who expresses a narrative contrary to the government, and the Australian government should continue to call on Vietnamese authorities to release all political prisoners.\u201d Chau was born in Vietnam and served in the South Vietnamese army before 1975. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for three years before he fled Vietnam by boat, arriving in Australia in 1983. In Sydney, he worked as a baker for decades, rising before dawn to work at a modest suburban bakery. In 2010, he joined Viet Tan, becoming a key Australian organiser of pro-reform rallies and an outspoken advocate for democratisation in Vietnam. The UN describes Viet Tan as \u201ca peaceful organisation advocating for democratic reform\u201d, but it was formally proscribed as a terrorist organisation in 2016 by the Vietnamese government, which said it was \u201ca reactionary and terrorist organisation, always silently carrying out activities against Vietnam\u201d. Chau sought to return to Vietnam in 2019 to meet fellow pro-democracy advocates but was refused a visa. He crossed into Vietnam via a land border with Cambodia in January that year, carrying a false identity document. He was arrested after meeting a democracy activist along with two Vietnamese nationals who were later sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively. Chau was convicted and sentenced at his first appearance in the people\u2019s court of Ho Chi Minh City after more than 10 months in detention. The single-day judge-only trial, held simultaneously with four other people, saw him tried and convicted on charges of \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d and sentenced to 12 years in jail, all within four hours. Viet Tan condemned Chau\u2019s hearing as a \u201csham trial\u201d and said it would \u201ccontinue to support human rights defenders on the ground\u201d. Over his four years in detention, Chau\u2019s case was consistently raised by the Australian government with Vietnamese politicians and officials. On a state visit to Hanoi last month, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, raised Chau\u2019s case with his Vietnamese counterpart."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fb5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/pure-magic-snow-falls-on-johannesburg-for-first-time-in-11-years", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Pure magic\u2019: snow falls on Johannesburg for first time in 11 years", "lead": "Residents of the South African city delight in rare snow day caused by a surge in humidity and cold temperatures", "author": "Helen Sullivan and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 02:30:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953734", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9856119c26420ccceca99ba39c83e5c7ac28c668/0_0_3862_2318/500.jpg", "body": "Residents of South Africa\u2019s biggest city, Johannesburg, were stunned by the first snowfall in over a decade on Monday, with some children seeing snow for the first time. While parts of South Africa regularly receive snow over the southern hemisphere winter months of June to August, Johannesburg last had snow in August 2012. After getting her picture taken on Nelson Mandela Square in the financial district, Jennifer Banda told the Reuters news agency that she was pregnant the last time it snowed. \u201cEleven years down the line, it\u2019s exciting that we have snow,\u201d she said. On social media Johannesburg residents described the snow as \u201cpure magic\u201d, \u201chectic\u201d and a \u201cwonderful start to the week\u201d. University of Witwatersrand professor of physical geography Jennifer Fitchett told South Africa\u2019s Times newspaper that the snow was unlikely to last, and had been caused by a surge in humidity, cold temperatures and a cold wind. \u201cIt happens once every 10 years or so. We\u2019re not an area that has a lot of snowfall and that\u2019s partly because in winter we have dry conditions. We\u2019ve got a strong, high pressure cell which is why we don\u2019t have any or very little rain in winter months. And so don\u2019t have much moisture in the air.\u201d It last snowed in 2012 and before that 2007, she said. Snow falls in Johannesburg once every five years on average, with heavier snow like that seen on Monday occurring once every 10 to 20 years, University of the Witwatersrand climatology professor Francois Engelbrecht told the Daily Maverick news website. South African Weather Service meteorologist Wayne Venter told the Daily Maverick the conditions were not exceptional and could not be said to be due to climate change. South of the city in Brackenhurst, a Reuters photographer saw children making snowballs and snow angels in a school\u2019s grounds. But for others, like delivery driver Chenjerai Murape whose motorbike would not start, the snow made life difficult. \u201cI\u2019m trying to warm the engine so that it can start \u2026 otherwise I will kick the bike all day,\u201d he said. The South African Weather Service has issued warnings because of the cold front that has struck Gauteng province, which contains Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria. Snow also fell on Monday in the coal belt in Mpumalanga province, where many of struggling utility Eskom\u2019s power stations are located."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fb6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/sydney-childrens-hospital-gender-research", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gender research at Sydney children\u2019s hospital to be reviewed after ABC report, health minister says ", "lead": "Ryan Park says independent body will examine Westmead research which Four Corners reported was seized upon by critics of gender-affirming care", "author": "Tamsin Rose", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 02:19:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953752", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/44511709b254365a7630d37745b191b5babc5ea6/0_64_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "The New South Wales health minister, Ryan Park, has vowed to improve the care available to transgender children and review gender research after a media report highlighted issues many people face trying to get help.

ABC\u2019s Four Corners program on Monday night reported three new patients had been seen at the gender clinic at Westmead children\u2019s hospital this year compared with 88 new patients in 2022. Park has since spoken with the secretary of the health department and the deputy secretary about the issues raised in the program, including staffing. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said a new framework to guide clinicians on care would be established along with a new care hub for south-west Sydney. Two new advisory bodies will help ensure best practice, the minister said. The ABC alleged a number of staff had left the Westmead service following the publication of research initiated in 2013 that was being \u201cweaponised by anti-trans activists and proponents of alternative forms of gender care\u201d. The Sax Institute, an independent organisation that seeks to use evidence to improve health policies, has since been charged with examining that research, Park said. The minister said the institute would \u201clook at that research and ensure that we are at best practice\u201d. He vowed to make changes to ensure clinicians were able to speak up when they had concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be robust debate,\u201d Park said. \u201cBut we also need to make sure that when people on the front line feel as though things are not working, we need to make sure those things are in place.\u201d The premier, Chris Minns, said he would talk with the minister about the \u201ccomplex\u201d area of care and staffing levels. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex and evolving area of health care and it\u2019s understandable that health care professionals in NSW will be looking at best practices from around the world and making sure they\u2019re providing that care to people who come in for treatment,\u201d he said. The ABC reported the research covered links to family trauma, \u201crapid-onset gender dysphoria\u201d and \u201cthe concept of \u2018desisters\u2019 which often refers to someone who no longer identifies as trans\u201d. Park apologised for the death of 14-year-old boy Noah O\u2019Brien who took his own life in January while awaiting specialised gender-affirming treatment. Four Corners reported his death followed a referral for \u2013 but not provision of \u2013 specialist gender support at Westmead children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThat is a very very sad situation and my heart goes out to the family,\u201d Park said on Tuesday. \u201cI am very sorry they have had a system that let them down.\u201d A spokesperson for the Sydney Children\u2019s Hospitals Network said all care at Westmead was \u201cbased on the best available medical evidence and is in line with international best practice\u201d. \u201cSCHN expresses our sincere condolences to Noah\u2019s family,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDue to patient privacy and confidentiality, SCHN is unable to provide further information about his specific care.\u201d The spokesperson said the research project and papers published had been reviewed and found to meet their requirements. \u201cSCHN is committed to providing transparency in communicating the results of research undertaken by the network and is informed by research in ensuring evidence-based care for children, young people and their families.\u201d In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Should the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, replace Lowe when his seven-year term ends on 17 September his successor is unlikely to enjoy such a tranquil beginning. Indeed, it\u2019s feasible the initiation could be a testing one. Rich economies are slowing as central banks elevate interest rates to thwart inflation, intensifying the risks for overstretched borrowers going bust, triggering financial market panic. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup Geopolitical tensions in Europe and Asia, too, remain high, while record global temperatures and a looming El Ni\u00f1o could unleash other unpredictable threats. Chalmers and Lowe plan to attend a G20 gathering in India next week, offering a chance to announce an extension of Lowe\u2019s term before they go or \u2013 more likely \u2013 his replacement on their return. A dozen interest rate rises have made him a popular scapegoat. The treasurer may also prefer a new chief to enforce changes recommended by a rare review of the RBA, including creating a separate board to focus on monetary policy. The bank\u2019s currency issuance and more mundane tasks can be left to the old board. Given the financial portents, Chalmers will do well to ensure his choice can provide wise counsel in private and a project a calming gravitas in public. Treasury tells us not to expect \u201ca radical choice\u201d. The candidate shortlist doing the punditry rounds include two presently on the RBA board who \u2013 with Lowe \u2013 helped steer the economy through Covid calamities. These are Michele Bullock, the deputy governor, who would make history as the first female governor if she won a promotion, and Steven Kennedy, the Treasury secretary inherited from the Morrison government, who would shift his crisis management chops sideways if he accepted any offer. Another potential candidate, Jenny Wilkinson, is used to breaking through barriers after becoming the first female head of an economic agency, the Parliamentary Budget Office, but has been secretary of the finance department less than a year. Her husband, David Gruen, heads the Australian Bureau of Statistics and is also considered to be in the running. The remaining two are outsiders but with extensive insider nous. One, Martin Parkinson, is a former Treasury secretary who introduced the carbon price. The other, Guy Debelle, is an former deputy governor who worked closely with Lowe during Covid and held senior roles during the global financial crisis. Debelle was widely assumed to be Lowe\u2019s successor before he quit last year to work for Andrew Forrest. One former RBA staffer predicted Debelle would receive \u201ca hero\u2019s welcome\u201d from his erstwhile colleagues if picked. Economists including Warren Hogan of Judo Bank say Chalmers would err if he picked someone from Canberra. \u201cThey will not have that understanding of banking and financial markets,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually what monetary policy is. \u201cThe only real option is Guy Debelle. He\u2019s borderline brilliant \u2026 a pretty straight shooter.\u201d John Hawkins, previously a senior official at Treasury and the RBA and now a University of Canberra lecturer, agrees that Kennedy\u2019s closeness to the government may count against him. Investors may see an undermining of the RBA\u2019s independence and fear that fighting inflation will get a lower priority. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t want it to look like it was a takeover by Treasury of the central bank,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThere might be a case for extending [Lowe\u2019s] term for another year so as to give Bullock time to get across areas of the RBA.\u201d Jonathan Kearns, who left the RBA in January to join the funds manager Challenger, said one challenge facing a new governor would be timing the length of any rate pause. \u201cFrom September on there probably won\u2019t be many \u2013 if any \u2013 rate rises,\u201d Kearns said. The jobless rate is almost certain to increase, as will private and business insolvencies as loans turns bad. \u201cThere will be a lot [he or she] will be facing: an economy in recession, or trying to avoid that, and the question of when you start cutting [rates],\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fb8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/11/robodebt-class-action-law-firm-prepared-to-sue-for-alleged-misfeasance-in-public-office", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Robodebt class action law firm prepared to sue for alleged \u2018misfeasance in public office\u2019", "lead": "Gordon Legal, which previously ran a $1.8bn class action, hopes federal government will reach out-of-court settlement offering further compensation", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 01:45:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953790", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e5670995d86cf15184230163c4e61900e1aabba2/0_0_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "The law firm behind the $1.8bn robodebt class action says it is prepared to launch a fresh civil case alleging misfeasance in public office, potentially against former ministers and public servants, unless a settlement for further compensation is reached. Peter Gordon, a senior partner at Gordon Legal, confirmed on Tuesday the firm had written to the Albanese government seeking to address wrongs that weren\u2019t compensated by the original case. The federal government services minister, Bill Shorten, warned on Monday night that former Coalition ministers were not \u201cout of the woods\u201d and could face further action. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He cited comments from the robodebt royal commission, which found that \u201cpeople may have individual or collective remedies\u201d because \u201con the evidence before the commission, elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office appear to exist\u201d. Despite the fact the royal commission did not recommend a compensation scheme, the Albanese government could face the invidious choice of reaching an out-of-court settlement or defending the actions of former ministers. It hasapproved their legal expenses in relation to robodebt. Misfeasance was argued in the original case but that element was dismissed due to a lack of evidence \u2013 but the release of the robodebt report could support a fresh claim. Gordon told Guardian Australia the firm has already received instructions from robodebt victim clients and was \u201cexploring a number of legal avenues\u201d including a claim of misfeasance in public office \u2013 which is both a civil tort and a crime \u2013 \u201cand a range of other causes of action\u201d. \u201cThe settlement approved was for the claim in unjust enrichment, it did no more than get the money back the government had stolen, and then provided for $110m in interest and other minor forms of damage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have always said there was no opportunity on the pleaded causes of action to recover damages for pain and suffering, for other forms of loss, for example, if they lost their homes or job opportunities. There was nothing for distress and no punitive damages.\u201d Gordon said that \u201cnot everyone\u201d would be entitled to sue for misfeasance or eligible for punitive damages for \u201cegregious conduct\u201d, particularly if they repaid debts with no great difficulty, but a \u201clarge number\u201d would. Gordon said a misfeasance claim could explore \u201ccoverups, sanitisation of legal advice and other reports, misrepresentations and systemic dishonesty\u201d which prevented parties in the class action from knowing the full extent of the wrongdoing. \u201cA claim for misfeasance in public office would necessarily be made against both the former ministers of the crown and senior public servants \u2026 who were responsible.\u201d Gordon Legal, which is representing its clients on a no-win no-fee basis, has written to the government inviting them to \u201csit down with us and find the best way to advance this\u201d, Gordon said. Asked about an out-of-court settlement, Gordon said: \u201cWe believe there could be and should be. The commissioner has said it wouldn\u2019t be an easy thing to do \u2026 but the government ought to pay for it. These were people serving in the name of the Australian government.\u201d Gordon praised the Albanese government for establishing the royal commission, but said it now had an opportunity \u201cto go some way to restoring justice after one of the most egregious episodes of government wrongdoing in the country\u2019s history\u201d. On Monday night, Shorten noted that a number of former Coalition ministers were the subject of adverse findings. \u201cI do not know why Coalition ministers with that sort of very, very damning analysis by the royal commission, why they think when the commissioner says there\u2019s the tort of malfeasance in public office, why they think that people, victims, won\u2019t sue them individually,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s 7.30. Asked about compensation, Shorten noted the government had already raised jobseeker and promised not to \u201cstigmatise those on welfare\u201d, in line with the royal commission\u2019s recommendations. Shorten last week noted the commissioner had concluded a general compensation scheme was \u201cnot feasible\u201d and noted \u201cthere has been some compensation\u201d through the class action. A Coalition source told Guardian Australia Shorten \u201cappears to have taken any further compensation off the table\u201d despite the fact the class action \u201cdelivered very little\u201d for victims. \u201cIt is time for Bill Shorten to find a way forward.\u201d Guardian Australia does not suggest any particular ministers or public servants were named in the royal commission\u2019s sealed section or were referred for potential civil or criminal prosecution. The former prime minister Scott Morrison has said he \u201ccompletely\u201d rejects adverse findings, claiming they were \u201cwrong, unsubstantiated and contradicted by clear documentary evidence presented to the commission\u201d. As the minister who brought the robodebt proposal to cabinet, Morrison said he had \u201cacted in good faith and on clear and deliberate department advice that no legislation was required to introduce the scheme\u201d. Lawyers for former attorney general Christian Porter have said he \u201cdischarged his ministerial responsibilities acting in good faith based\u201d on advice. The ex-minister Alan Tudge has said he strongly rejects \u201cthe commission\u2019s comments of the way I used the media and that I had abused my power in doing so\u201d. Coalition colleague Stuart Robert maintains he tried to shut down robodebt. \u201cAs the minister that worked hard to get the legal advice and close down the income compliance scheme I welcome the [royal commission] report and its sensible recommendations,\u201d he said on Friday.

This year had already seen the hottest June on record, the UN body said, driven by climate change and the early stages of an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. It is the latest in a series of records halfway through a year that has seen a drought in Spain and fierce heatwaves in China as well as the US. \u201cThe world just had the hottest week on record, according to preliminary data,\u201d the WMO said in a statement, adding that temperatures were breaking records on land and in the oceans, with \u201cpotentially devastating impacts on ecosystems and the environment\u201d. \u201cWe are in uncharted territory and we can expect more records to fall as El Ni\u00f1o develops further and these impacts will extend into 2024,\u201d said Christopher Hewitt, WMO director of climate services. \u201cThis is worrying news for the planet.\u201d Global sea surface temperatures were at record highs for the time of the year both in May and June, said Hewitt. \u201cIt is not only the surface temperature, but the whole ocean is becoming warmer and absorbing energy that will remain there for hundreds of years.\u201d \u201cIf the oceans are warming considerably, that has a knock-on effect on the atmosphere, on sea ice and ice worldwide,\u201d said Michael Sparrow, chief of the world climate research programme at the WMO. But Sparrow said El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s effects would probably be felt more acutely later in the year. \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o hasn\u2019t really got going yet,\u201d he said. Europe\u2019s climate monitoring service Copernicus told the AFP news agency that its data also showed last week was likely to be the hottest since records began in 1940. Copernicus said that its data suggested Thursday was likely to have seen the highest global average temperature, after several record-breaking days earlier in the week. \u2018Out of control\u2019 Along the US-Mexico border, federal agents reported that extreme temperatures over the weekend contributed to 10 people dying and another 45 people being rescued. The south-western US is bracing for another week of blistering temperatures, with forecasters on Monday extending an excessive heat warning through the weekend for Arizona\u2019s most populated area, and alerting residents in parts of Nevada and New Mexico to stay indoors. The metro Phoenix area was on track to tie or to break a record set in the summer of 1974 for the most consecutive days with the high temperature at or above 110F (43C). Last week the Canadian ministry of natural resources said the number of wildfires in the country \u2013 more than 670 on Friday \u2013 was \u201coff the charts\u201d with a long and difficult summer ahead. Smoke from the fires so far this season has polluted the air in Canada and neighbouring US, affecting more than 100 million people. In the US, Texas was experiencing a prolonged \u201cheat dome\u201d in which warm air is trapped in the atmosphere like a convection oven, while in Europe, Spain was bracing for its second heatwave in a matter of weeks. In southern Iraq, the fabled marshland was having its worst heatwave in the past 40 years, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Monday, warning of a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on the ecosystem as well as farmers and fisheries. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said \u201cthe situation we are witnessing now is the demonstration that climate change is out of control\u201d. Heat-related deaths Higher than normal temperatures also cause health problems ranging from heatstroke and dehydration to cardiovascular stress. Research published on Monday found that more than 61,000 people died due to the heat during Europe\u2019s record-breaking summer of 2022. The majority of deaths were of people over the age of 80 and about 63% of those who died due to the heat were women, according to the research published in the journal Nature Medicine. Experts say heat exhaustion and heatstroke are likely to become more common as the impacts of climate change grow more and more extreme. Heatstroke is the most serious heat-related illness and happens when the body loses its ability to sweat. Jon Femling, an emergency medicine physician and scientist at the University of New Mexico, said the body tried to compensate by pumping blood to the skin as a way to cool off. The more a person breathed, the more they lost fluids, becoming increasingly dehydrated. \u201cSo one of the first things that happens is, your muscles start to feel tired as your body starts to shunt away,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you can start to have organ damage where your kidneys don\u2019t work, your spleen, your liver.\u201d The stress on the body may result in the brain not getting enough blood, he said. With heat exhaustion, the body could also become cold and clammy. Older people, children and those with health conditions could face greater risks when the temperatures were high.

Squeezeways are walkways built into the bottom part of the round underground tunnels. They are about 80cm wide and involve the user literally squeezing along the side of a train stuck in the tunnel. Guardian Australia has obtained documents that show Sydney Metro is actively considering the option, which was rejected on earlier projects, for the two newest metro lines: Metro West from the CBD to Parramatta and the line from St Marys to the new airport at Badgerys Creek. The move appears to have been motivated by pruning costs and has caused consternation among staff, who fear the cheaper option will compromise safety. \u201cThe project span is about 80cm, give or take, and a person who is not ambulatory will certainly have trouble getting though it,\u201d one insider said. \u201cThe issue from an engineering safety perspective is: we have no idea who proposed this idea and why our leaders are supporting it. Why are they deviating from an already approved design used on the City Southwest line?\u201d Sydney Metro said: \u201cThe squeezeway design is a low-level walkway to allow access along the side of the train designed for operational activities and emergency services only, including Fire and Rescue NSW \u2013 not for passenger use. \u201cPassengers would need to exit from the front or back of a stuck train,\u201d it said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The elevated walkways which have been elsewhere in the metro network are about 1m wide, are cantilevered from the wall at the widest part of the circular tunnels and have a hand rail. They can be accessed from all doors in the train. \u201cThe squeezeway is to support the movement of tunnel occupants or emergency services alongside a stranded train or for regular access by maintenance staff,\u201d one document explains. It is described as a \u201cvalue-based solution of modifying the low level side walkway within the tunnels\u201d. Last year Sydney Metro was forced to backtrack on a plan to build cross-passages every 500 metres instead of the Australian standard of 240 metres apart on the same two lines, after safety concerns were raised by Fire and Rescue NSW. The greater spacing between the cross-passages, which link the main tunnels going in either direction, would have shaved $100m from the $27bn Metro West and the $11bn airport line. The squeezeway proposal will require the approval of safety authorities. Sydney Metro said it continued to consult Fire and Rescue NSW, adhering to the agreed formal process of engagement to ensure design specifications met relevant standards. A number of metros around the world had used the same approach, including Munich, Singapore and Hong Kong, it said. The documents appear to indicate that the cross-passage exits have already been designed low down to align with squeezeways. Fire and Rescue NSW declined to comment specifically on the sqeezeway design, referring enquiries to Sydney Metro. The acting deputy commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW, Trent Curtin, said his organisation had a very important role in reviewing tunnel design in relation to the safe evacuation of occupants and safe access for emergency responders. A spokesman for the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator said the organisation was \u201cactively monitoring this process\u201d and when the designs were finalised the proponent would need to satisfy the regulator that it had addressed safety risks to the legal standard required. \u201cONRSR is not a technical regulator with responsibility for approving designs. While we are aware of squeezeway solutions being used in major infrastructure projects overseas, each project and design is unique, as are any and all associated safety risks,\u201d the regulator said. The source inside Sydney Metro said a variation of the squeezeway design had been rejected by the ONRSR previously on a different line."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fbb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/ozzy-osbourne-cancels-live-return-show-illness", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m just not ready yet\u2019: Ozzy Osbourne cancels first show in nearly five years due to health", "lead": "The 74-year-old singer makes \u2018painful\u2019 decision to withdraw from Power Trip festival in California to avoid giving \u2018half-assed\u2019 live performance", "author": "Sian Cain", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 01:27:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953845", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fa68a1b70375f46f65dabbd731cbbc39fd933b80/0_173_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Ozzy Osbourne has pulled out of what would have been his first live performance in almost five years, saying that \u201cmy body is telling me that I\u2019m just not ready yet\u201d.

Called Sky News The Voice Debate, the rolling news channel will broadcast press conferences, government and community announcements and town hall meetings, as well as news, analysis, commentary and documentaries. Some high-profile Sky News commentators, including prime-time hosts Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin, are critics of the voice and are actively campaigning against it. Chris Kenny, who hosts a weeknight current affairs program on the network, is a rare supporter of the voice on the channel. Last week, the Bolt Report was critical of Linda Burney\u2019s speech to the National Press Club when the Indigenous Australians minister said the no campaign should not be allowed to get away with using Trump-style politics in Australia. Bolt said: \u201cLinda Burney. Please, please stop embarrassing yourself. Stop hoodwinking voters too, about your racist voice\u201d. Credlin has claimed the voice would \u201ctake away rights for every other citizen who is non-Indigenous\u201d. The new channel follows the launch in recent years of two other dedicated channels: the Sky News Covid-19 channel and the Sky News election channel. Sky News The Voice Debate will be available to Sky\u2019s subscribers as well as regional viewers of free-to-air TV with access to Sky News Regional which has been broadcasting since 2021.

The one-hour documentary will examine the potential of a proposed law to alter the constitution by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice, Sky said. Cunningham said the voice had become \u201ca heated debate not only in Canberra but also among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\u201d. \u201cAdvocates argue that the voice is crucial to give Indigenous Australians a say in the laws that affect them, while opponents believe it could create a separate form of government and undermine the current political system,\u201d Cunningham said. The objectivity of Sky News content came under question during the pandemic when the channel was banned from uploading content to YouTube for seven days after violating its medical misinformation policies by posting numerous videos which denied the existence of Covid-19 or encouraged people to use hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin. Sky News later sought to justify misleading Covid commentary then-host Alan Jones put to air, saying it was balanced by coverage of the daily Covid press conferences.

An update to Holmes\u2019 profile on the website of the Bureau of Prisons now projects her release date as 12 December 2032, two years sooner than initially scheduled. A spokesman for the federal agency confirmed the update but said he could not comment further citing \u201cprivacy, safety, and security reasons\u201d for inmates. Holmes had reported to a minimum-security, federal women\u2019s prison camp located in Bryan, Texas, on 30 May after being convicted in November 2022 on four counts of defrauding investors and sentenced to 11 years and three months. Her new date of release means she will instead serve about nine years and seven months. She had been out on bail since she was indicted on fraud charges in 2018 over her role as the head of the failed blood-testing firm. During that time, she had two children with her partner, Billy Evans. Inmates in the US can have their sentences reduced for good conduct, including completing job assignments, following orders, and completing substance abuse programs and other rehabilitation courses, the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement. That gained time can also be revoked or forfeited over disciplinary concerns or other infractions. The reduction seen by Holmes is in line with federal sentencing guidelines, which states that people convicted of federal offenses must serve 85% of their mandated sentence, even if they get time shaved off for good conduct. Lawyers for Holmes did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sentencing change comes after her co-conspirator, Sunny Balwani, also saw two years shaved off of his 13-year sentence, with his projected date of release now 1 April 2034, according to the Bureau of Prisons website. Holmes and Balwani were convicted in separate trials for their actions at the head of Theranos, a multibillion-dollar biotech company that collapsed spectacularly after reporting from the Wall Street Journal and others revealed its technology to be largely fraudulent. Government lawyers for the prosecution teams did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Holmes will also face three years of supervised release after her sentence ends and has been ordered to pay $452m in restitution to victims of the fraud, though a judge has delayed those payments due to her \u201climited financial resources\u201d.

But in the lead-up to Saturday\u2019s byelection in the conservative stronghold of Fadden, one familiar face is conspicuously absent from Caldwell\u2019s side on the campaign trail. The retiring MP \u2013 the former Morrison government human services minister Stuart Robert \u2013 hasn\u2019t spoken to Caldwell for weeks. \u201cHe\u2019s given me some time and space to be able to earn my place in the community,\u201d Caldwell told the ABC last week. Few people think there is any chance that Fadden, a northern Gold Coast seat held by the Liberal National party on a 10.6% margin, could change hands. But the shadow campaign \u2013 the battle for national momentum between Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton \u2013 remains a live contest, particularly in the shadow of the robodebt royal commission report, which included strong criticism of Robert. Robert has maintained that he had tried to have robodebt shut down: \u201cAs the minister that worked hard to get the legal advice and close down the income compliance scheme I welcome the [royal commission] report and its sensible recommendations.\u201d But Dr Paul Williams, a political analyst at Griffith University, says robodebt is \u201calive and well\u201d as an issue in Fadden. \u201cNo one should be surprised if there is a slight swing to Labor, given that \u2026 Stuart Robert was named in the report and Labor is doing its best to remind voters that that\u2019s the case,\u201d Williams says. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup That might be counteracted, Williams says, by declining public support for the voice referendum, a state Labor government facing political pressure, and cost-of-living concerns. Labor has \u201cnothing to lose and everything to gain\u201d if it wins a swing, even a minor one, in Dutton\u2019s home state. \u201cIt\u2019s not terminal but it could be quite injurious to Peter Dutton\u2019s leadership if there\u2019s a sizeable swing away from the LNP,\u201d Williams says. \u201cEven a small swing to Labor is a moral victory. There\u2019s more for the opposition to lose. It would be humiliating, and the bigger the swing, the bigger the humiliation.\u201d The federal education minister, Jason Clare, said last week the byelection was being held in \u201cPeter Dutton\u2019s back yard\u201d. Labor has also said a 4% swing to the Coalition would be a \u201cbenchmark\u201d. Both comments appear to downplay expectations but also ratchet up pressure on the opposition leader if he loses ground in his home state. Williams says the Gold Coast is \u201cnot a conservative constituency\u201d, despite being a Queensland Liberal stronghold. \u201cIn terms of cultural or social policy, it\u2019s not Gympie or Mount Isa or Charleville,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s full of \u2018small l\u2019 liberal values. If there\u2019s a swing against the LNP in Fadden, at least some of it will be a rejection of what people see as Peter Dutton\u2019s arch conservatism, and a Liberal party that people see as spending too much time fighting cultural wars.\u201d Caldwell, the chair of the Gold Coast council\u2019s planning committee, represents some of the most affluent suburbs in the area, around Paradise Point and the exclusive Sovereign Islands. He won preselection ahead of the 2021 Queensland Australian of the Year, Dr Dinesh Palipana, who had been heavily backed by the increasingly influential moderate state MP, Sam O\u2019Connor. Caldwell had previously been slated to run for the state seat of Broadwater in 2012 but was dumped after revelations he attended a swinger\u2019s club in 2009. At the time he said he had attended the club with his wife for \u201ca social drink\u201d but that there was not any impropriety. He made it through the LNP\u2019s vetting process before standing for preselection in Fadden. Albanese has said Labor\u2019s candidate, Letitia Del Fabbro, a nursing academic who ran against Robert in 2022, is at \u201clong odds\u201d. \u201cPeople will ask why is it that this money is having to be spent on this byelection with someone who just has made that resignation,\u201d Albanese said last month. \u201cWe think this is unnecessary and shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d And so the cloud left over the electorate by Robert\u2019s disappearing act \u2013 he has not attended parliament since he announced his resignation, and has not appeared on the campaign trail \u2013 grows longer. The findings of the robodebt royal commission have been heaped upon repeated controversies related to Robert\u2019s expenses, his alleged private business dealings and claims made in parliament about his conduct as a minister. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Williams says voters tend to \u201cget annoyed\u201d when MPs resign midterm for reasons other than ill health. \u201cWhen [a resignation is] expedient, the electorate is very unforgiving. [The robodebt report] puts that right back in the frame.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fbf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/09/sydney-and-melbourne-to-bask-in-unseasonal-warmth-after-weekend-of-strong-winds", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Warm weather forecast for Sydney and Melbourne after weekend of strong winds", "lead": "Strong gusts led to flights being cancelled in and out of Sydney airport, disrupting school holiday plans", "author": "Royce Kurmelovs", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 23:32:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953922", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2746e7229e04d47518761f4518d1be85ef45d744/0_346_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "Sydney and Melbourne can expect a week of unseasonal warmth \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 thanks to an abundance of uninterrupted sunshine over inland Australia.

Melbourne is predicted to have a week of 16C maximums with some rain. These are unusual numbers for this time of year in both cities. According to the BoM\u2019s 150-year historical weather averages, the mercury should be 4C lower in both. In Sydney, average maximum temperatures in July are usually around 16C. The average maximum for Melbourne at this time of year is 13.5C. BoM meteorologist Angus Hines said though this data is useful, the \u201cindustry standard\u201d is to compare temperatures going back the past three decades. When looking at data between 1991 and 2020, the maximum average temperature for Sydney in July is 17.9C and 14.5C in Melbourne. \u201cSydney is going to be a little bit warm over the next few days,\u201d Hines said. \u201cThere\u2019s a few different reasons for that, part of it is to do with the pattern over Australia at the moment.\u201d Hines said clear skies and \u201clots of uninterrupted sunshine\u201d were warming up areas inland and strong westerly winds left in the wake of a cold front were \u201cgoing to pull [those] slightly warmer conditions over Sydney\u201d. Melbourne has an additional factor in its slightly warmer temperatures. \u201cNormally through the winter months it\u2019s common to get cold outbreaks and that\u2019s when conditions drop lower than average, but we don\u2019t have any cold outbreaks over the course of this week so there\u2019s nothing to bring in any chilly temperatures,\u201d he said. The BoM has damaging wind warnings in place across parts of New South Wales but expects these conditions to fade into next week. \u201cAs we finish the weekend and move into next wind, that westerly wind will ease away,\u201d Hines said. \u201cWhile it will be coming from the same direction, the strength will be easing.\u201d The world recorded its hottest week on record last week. Average global air temperatures reached 17.18C on Tuesday, according to data collated by the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction. These temperature readings were even higher than the 17.01C reached on Monday. For the seven-day period ending on Wednesday, daily average temperatures were 0.4C higher than any week in 44 years of record keeping.

Overview England travel to Australia and New Zealand as Euro 2022 winners, intent on global domination. Crucially, Sarina Wiegman\u2019s side understand the perils of more haste less speed and will remain patient as they endeavour to win a first Women\u2019s World Cup. They also harbour few fears about shape-shifting from their preferred 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formations. During last summer\u2019s Euro quarter-final against Spain, when England looked close to defeat, Wiegman switched to a 3-4-3 and was rewarded with a watershed victory. It also helps that the Lionesses\u2019 Dutch coach and her influential assistant, Arjan Veurink, are no slaves to philosophy and happily tailor the team\u2019s style and tactics to opposition strengths and weaknesses. Although England are generally big on patient passing they are not afraid to go direct or counterattack at speed. Under previous managers the aim was for the Lionesses to be fitter, stronger and quicker than every rival. But, while Wiegman\u2019s sport science staff remain hugely influential, there is a bigger emphasis on nuanced ball work. She also excels at gauging precisely when to introduce impact substitutes. Yet caveats remain: there is a performance-related bonus issue rumbling on and England are without the injured trio of Beth Mead, the Golden Boot winner as they eclipsed all comers last summer; their captain, Leah Williamson; and the attacking playmaker Fran Kirby. Meanwhile record goalscorer Ellen White and the experienced midfielder Jill Scott have retired. Key defender Millie Bright is still not fully recovered from knee surgery, so Wiegman may ultimately regret exiling the Lionesses\u2019 former captain, 35-year-old Steph Houghton, following a stellar season in Manchester City\u2019s backline. England\u2019s coach can be ruthless and, while in charge of the Netherlands, was noted for unemotionally phasing out older players. Few, however, question her outstanding clarity of thought and communication skills. \u201cSarina\u2019s a top, top coach; one of the world\u2019s best,\u201d says her Chelsea counterpart, Emma Hayes. \u201cShe\u2019s got the skills, the experience, the personality and the right staff.\u201d Scott agrees. \u201cLed by Sarina we can win the World Cup,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few injuries and it\u2019s a young squad but it\u2019s still very strong. It\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d The coach Sarina Wiegman succeeded Phil Neville as England\u2019s manager in 2021 and led the Lionesses to Euros glory in a Wembley final against Germany a year later. The former PE teacher from The Hague had previously won Euro 2017 with her native Netherlands and steered the Oranje to a World Cup final defeat by the USA in 2019. A former defensive midfielder, the University of North Carolina graduate was capped 104 times by her country. After moving into coaching Wiegman accepted a secondment with Sparta Rotterdam men where she became the first Dutch women to coach at a male professional club. Routinely described as a control freak by former colleagues, she is famously unsentimental and a firm believer that the devil really is in the detail. Star player Many decent judges believe Keira Walsh is now the world\u2019s best central midfielder and she arrives in Australia having just helped Barcelona win the Champions League. The general rule is that if Walsh plays well, so too do England. Nick Cushing, her former manager at Manchester City, describes the Rochdale-born 26-year-old with an unerring eye for a pass as \u201cthe most tactically intelligent player I\u2019ve worked with\u201d. A longstanding fan of both City and the Spain men\u2019s team, Walsh grew up idolising David Silva. Rising star At age 20, Brighton winger Katie Robinson is the baby of the squad. Robinson is Cornish and grew up in Newquay where she still enjoys bodyboarding and surfing. \u201cI\u2019m happiest when I\u2019ve got the ball at my feet and I\u2019m running at a defender,\u201d says the former Bristol City player who could prove an important impact substitute in this tournament. Has recovered splendidly from an anterior cruciate ligament rupture which sidelined her for almost the entire 2020-21 season and has already acquired five senior caps. Did you know? Lucy Bronze was eligible to play for Scotland (she was born in Berwick and has Scottish relatives) and Portugal (the country of her father\u2019s birth) as well as England. Bronze is also the first Englishwoman to win the Champions League with two different clubs: three times at Lyon and once with Barcelona. England\u2019s right-back has also undergone six knee operations. Standing of women\u2019s football in England? Women\u2019s football was wildly popular in England after the first world war but in 1921 the FA banned women from playing on affiliated grounds for 50 years. Once that edict was finally lifted it took time for the game to recapture its mainstream appeal but the Lionesses\u2019 achievement in securing a bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup in Canada represented a watershed, while their Euro 2022 triumph turned England players into household names. The government\u2019s recent pledge to offer all schoolgirls access to football should entrench its growing appeal. Realistic aim at the World Cup? Winners. After winning a home Euros and reaching the last two World Cup semi-finals, lifting the trophy is a feasible ambition. Even so, England are on the tricky side of the draw. If they qualify from a group containing Haiti, Denmark and China, England appear on course to meet Australia or Canada in the first knockout round, with Germany and France to quite possibly follow at the quarter-final and semi-final stages."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/11/900000-older-people-ae-lack-of-nhs-care-at-home", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lack of NHS home care \u2018forces 855,000 older people into English hospitals each year\u2019", "lead": "Age UK says acute shortage of services outside hospitals is resulting in elderly people suffering avoidable harm", "author": "Denis Campbell  Health policy editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 23:01:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953957", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2c11b1aee5212de10903351d2ae2c918aee3e84d/0_0_4248_2549/500.jpg", "body": "Almost 900,000 older people are admitted to hospital in England every year as an emergency because the NHS is failing to keep them healthy at home, Age UK has warned. A major lack of services outside hospitals means elderly people are also suffering avoidable harm, such as falls and urinary tract infections, the charity said. In a new report it urges NHS bosses to push through huge changes to how the \u201chospital-oriented\u201d service operates and establish \u201chome first\u201d as the principle of where care is provided. Doing so would reduce the strain on overcrowded hospitals and leave the NHS better set up to respond to the increase in the number of over-65s and especially over-85s, Age UK said. Its report, on the state of health and care of older people in England, concluded that \u201cour health and care system is struggling, and too often failing, to meet the needs of our growing older population.\u201d It added that the \u201chuge financial costs to our country and the harm to older people from continuing with our current outmoded way of working are too high\u201d to allow the status quo to remain. The NHS\u2019s emphasis on hospitals and lack of community-based services mean that older people are more likely to fall ill and end up needing A&amp;E care or a spell as an inpatient, Age UK said. \u201cIt\u2019s older people who are suffering, who aren\u2019t getting the help that they need,\u201d said Ruthe Isden, its head of health influencing. \u201cTheir health is deteriorating, they\u2019re experiencing these avoidable crises \u2013 falls, UTIs \u2013 that are taking them into hospital and turning their lives upside down.\u201d Hospitals in England admitted 855,000 older people as an emergency during 2019/20. \u201cThey could have been avoided with the right care at the right time,\u201d the charity said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply worrying that many older people are ending up in hospital due to lack of the right sort of services in the community. No one wants to be in hospital but for older people all too often it can lead to an avoidable deterioration in their health,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director. Prof Adam Gordon, the president of the British Geriatrics Society, said the report \u201cmakes grim reading [and] rightly identifies that older people are currently being let down by NHS and social care services\u201d. NHS care must give much greater priority to prevention of illness and early intervention, to stop older people ending up in a medical crisis to the extent that they need to go into hospital, and use community-based health teams to work in that way, he added. Age UK said NHS England\u2019s recent development of initiatives such as falls prevention schemes, \u201cvirtual wards\u201d and hospital-at-home care were useful steps in the right direction. However, such services \u201care only patchily available\u201d and need to become commonplace, it added. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \u201cWith 855,000 older patients admitted as a potentially avoidable emergency in 2019/20, this report shows the scale of how many people could benefit from a ramping up of prevention initiatives and community services, along with long overdue investment in social care.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to Age UK\u2019s concerns. Instead, a spokesperson listed several policies intended to improve care and support for older people. They include a plan to spend up to \u00a3700m improving adult social care and another \u00a31.6bn \u201cto support timely and safe discharge from hospitals into the community, giving people access to rehabilitation and prevention initiatives, including local falls services\u201d."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/11/ending-private-school-tax-breaks-raise-15bn-state-sector-thinktank", "primaryCategory": "education", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ending private school tax breaks would raise \u00a31.5bn for state sector, thinktank says ", "lead": "Labour\u2019s pledge to remove independent schools\u2019 tax benefits would have \u2018limited effect\u2019 on pupil numbers, according to research by IFS", "author": "Sally Weale Education correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 23:01:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953975", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c7a2732b659eb6b87ba919e2ec66cf3d886a7fda/0_58_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Warnings of a mass exodus from private schools if Labour carries out its pledge to scrap their tax breaks have been dismissed by a leading economic thinktank. . Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that Labour\u2019s plans to add VAT to private school fees would generate up to \u00a31.5bn in additional revenue, \u201ca small but potentially worthwhile sum\u201d providing a 2% boost in spending on England\u2019s state schools. The policy would have \u201ca relatively limited effect\u201d on pupil numbers, the research found. Contrary to predictions of families quitting independent schools due to rising fees and moving their children into the already creaking state sector, the IFS said it expected higher fees would have \u201ca weak effect\u201d on demand, potentially reducing private school numbers by as little as 3% to 7%. As the political parties set out their stalls for the next general election, the private schools policy has become one of Labour\u2019s most eye-catching and hotly debated pledges. The latest IFS research answers some of the challenges to the policy, which others believe does not go far enough. \u201cIf the main aim of removing tax exemptions from private schools is to raise revenue, then this is likely to be achievable,\u201d the report\u2019s author, Luke Sibieta, said. \u201cIf the aim is to encourage more pupils into the state sector and reduce inequalities by school attended, then this policy package is likely to have only minor impacts.\u201d Prof Francis Green of the Private Policy Education Forum, which also co-authored the study Engines of privilege: Britain\u2019s private school problem, said: \u201cThe removal of charity status from private schools is right. But, without further measures, this will do little to lessen the unfairness in our class-segmented school system.\u201d The IFS analysis, published on Tuesday, confirms Labour\u2019s calculation that ending private schools\u2019 tax breaks would increase tax revenues by about \u00a31.6bn and estimates that, taking into account additional costs to the state sector of around \u00a3100-\u00a3300m a year, the policy would lead to a net gain to the public finances of \u00a31.3bn-\u00a31.5bn. If the numbers transferring into the state sector are low, tax revenues from private schools will be healthy and the cost of incorporating more pupils into the state sector will be limited, though the paper points out that with pupil numbers expected to fall dramatically over the next decade, state schools might welcome extra pupils. Julie Robinson, CEO of the Independent Schools Council, said the number of pupils moving from independent schools into the state sector would be higher than the 20,000 to 40,000 estimated by the IFS. She said: \u201cThis is the second report in less than a month to confirm what we have consistently said: Labour\u2019s policy will not raise the money it claims it would. Even an over-optimistic estimate \u2013 which this most certainly is \u2013 leaves Labour significantly short of funding the education policies they claim a tax on parents would pay for.\u201d In a keynote speech last week, Keir Starmer said money raised from removing tax breaks on private schools would be used to give primary schools cash for \u201cworld-class early language innovation\u201d. The party has also said the funds would be used to help recruit more than 6,500 new teachers into the state sector. The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the IFS analysis reinforced the fact that that all of Labour\u2019s policies are fully costed and fully funded. \u201cThe Conservatives have crashed the economy and have no plan for growth which will mean we face tough choices in government,\u201d she said. \u201cLabour will fund our fully costed plans to drive high and rising standards in our state schools by ending private schools\u2019 unjustifiable tax breaks.\u201d Josh Hillman, director of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the research, said: \u201cThis timely analysis shows that the combination of levying VAT on fees and the tax exemptions associated with removing charitable status from private schools would raise a small but potentially worthwhile sum of money for use in state education. \u201cHowever, to make a significant contribution to reversing the widening gap in achievement between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils, a wealth of other research suggests it would need to be spent carefully on well-targeted funding streams and evidence-based programmes and practices.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/11/uk-retailers-sales-hot-june-weather", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK retailers report sizzling sales in hot June weather", "lead": "Shoppers snap up barbecue food, swimwear, beach towels, outdoor games and garden furniture in June", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 23:01:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.953994", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3bb7a2e47874908d0a85b1e8f7cfea2553ac2aaf/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Britain\u2019s retailers recorded a sharp rise in spending in June as hot weather prompted consumers to buy summer clothing and outdoor goods, despite growing pressure on budgets from the cost of living crisis. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said sales increased by 4.9% in June, above the annual average growth rate, as shoppers hit the high street to buy swimwear, beach towels, outdoor games, garden furniture and barbecue food. Much of the increase was driven by high inflation pushing up the overall value of spending, masking a drop in sales volumes. However, the figures suggest a pickup in sales from May when a trio of bank holidays, including for King Charles\u2019s coronation, failed to get shoppers spending. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cSun-seekers headed to their favourite retailers to buy swimwear and beach towels, and outdoor games, garden furniture and barbecue food were boosted as families came together to celebrate Father\u2019s Day. \u201cPeople were much more cautious about big-ticket purchases like furniture and technology equipment.\u201d The Met Office confirmed June was the hottest on record for the UK, eclipsing the previous hottest by nearly a full degree, amid growing anxiety over the pace and scale of global heating. Retailers warned that consumer confidence remained fragile as high inflation, running at 8.7% in May, erodes the spending power of households. Millions of mortgage holders are also facing an increase in borrowing costs after 13 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, draining billions of pounds of spending power from the economy. Prices remain high and are rising fast, adding to pressure on struggling households. Official figures show food and drink inflation is at the highest levels since the late 1970s, running at 18.3% in May after a modest drop from 19% in April. The BRC said food sales increased by 9.8% on a total basis, driven largely by high inflation. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said: \u201cConsumers have so far remained resilient, but the triple threats of further interest rate hikes, resolute double-digit food inflation and an economy recovering at slower rate than predicted could hamper a return to much needed profitable growth across the retail sector.\u201d Barclays said the surge in living costs meant two-thirds of shoppers were looking for ways to reduce the cost of their weekly shop, with as many as two in five buying more \u201cyellow sticker\u201d short-dated food and drink to help their finances go further. The bank, which processes nearly half of the nation\u2019s credit and debit card transactions, said spending in restaurants in June fell by the most since the start of the year, as consumers cut back on eating out to offset rising household bills. However, it said the overall value of sales rose 5.4% on the year as sunny weather tempted shoppers to buy new summer outfits. Pubs, bars and clubs recorded strong growth in sales, helped by warmer weather, rising beer prices and Father\u2019s Day. After a drop in sales in May, sports and outdoor retailers benefited from rising temperatures and the start of the festival season, as consumers bought camping equipment and other goods. Will Hobbs, the chief investment officer at Barclays\u2019 UK wealth management division, said the economy remained in a \u201cprecarious spot\u201d. \u201cDifficult quarters lie ahead as the surge in interest rates continues to put pressure on household cashflows,\u201d he added."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/11/celebrities-back-unicef-uk-appeal-for-urgent-government-child-support", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Celebrities back Unicef UK appeal for urgent government child support", "lead": "Children\u2019s charities call for a \u2018baby and toddler guarantee\u2019 to help parents struggling with cost of living during summer holidays", "author": "Sally Weale Education correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 23:01:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954015", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/11f984f07fda796650f5a847f391ace6abe147da/565_0_2143_1286/500.jpg", "body": "Celebrities including the tennis player Andy Murray, the actor David Harewood and the singer-songwriter Rita Ora have joined children\u2019s charities and childhood development experts to call for a national \u201cbaby and toddler guarantee\u201d.

Organised by Unicef UK, the letter says UK families are struggling to access services including maternity, health visiting, mental health support, affordable, high-quality childcare, and support for special educational needs and disabilities (Send). Children\u2019s centres and childcare settings have shut, health visitor appointments have been lost because of staff cuts, and mental health support for parents and children is hard to access, the letter says. The baby and toddler guarantee would set out the basic services every young child is entitled to, and ensure they get the proper support they need, wherever they live. The actors Olivia Colman and Ewan McGregor, the former journalist and politician Martin Bell, the TV presenter Cat Deeley and the explorer Levison Wood have also signed the appeal alongside the NSPCC, Save the Children UK and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Jon Sparkes, Unicef UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cEvery child deserves a bright future, but as families recover from the impacts of the pandemic and face unprecedented rises in the cost of living, this future is under threat. \u201cBasic services like health visits and mental health care provide essential support that households need during these turbulent times. They should be there for every baby and young child during their vital early years, but across the country, this isn\u2019t the case and urgent action is needed.\u201d A petition calling for the government to commit to the guarantee has been signed by almost 50,000 members of the public. More than 300 parents have shared their experiences to illustrate the crisis. One Northamptonshire mother said: \u201cI have twin boys who I found myself being a single parent to, and they saw a health visitor just once before their second birthday. I had massive postnatal depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and I was forgotten.\u201d A mother in Kent described her battle to get help for her preschool-age son, who is autistic. \u201cThe early-years provision in the area has been awful.

Summer holidays are just around the corner and instead of looking forward to fun-packed, carefree days, many families are faced with the worrying reality of not being able to put food on the table as they struggle to make ends meet.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are rolling out the largest expansion in free childcare in history, worth \u00a36,500 a year for an average working family using 30 hours a week and delivering a cost of living support package worth an average of \u00a33,300 per household. \u201cOn top of this, we are providing a holiday and activities food programme which is backed by \u00a3200m per year to 2025, and expanding and transforming mental health services in England so that two million more people will be able to get the mental health support they need.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Home Office paying for thousands of empty beds reserved for asylum seekers", "lead": "Government keeps \u2018buffer\u2019 of 5,000 beds to avoid repeat of overcrowding seen at Manston last year", "author": "Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 22:34:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954033", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d92195381ae755af6deece80faf1b8118812a851/0_73_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The Home Office is paying for thousands of empty hotel beds reserved for people seeking asylum to avoid a repeat of dangerous overcrowding at a processing centre last year, MPs have heard. Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a \u201cbuffer\u201d of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for about 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the number of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people were processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was \u201cmaking sure we\u2019ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds \u2026 so we\u2019re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]\u201d. \u201cWe have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,\u201d he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office\u2019s most senior civil servant, said: \u201cWe have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don\u2019t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. \u201cI hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.\u201d Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 \u2013 peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the department. The disclosure of the Home Office\u2019s \u201cbuffer\u201d comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. \u201cWorryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,\u201d Neal said in a report summary. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, wants to use barges and sites including converted military bases to house asylum seekers and reduce the \u00a36m daily cost of hotel accommodation while people await a decision on their status. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was \u201con track\u201d to meet Rishi Sunak\u2019s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was \u201cconfident\u201d it would have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said about 1,700 asylum decisions were being made by the Home Office per week and it was on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed \u2013 five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall, where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 people from crossing the Channel in small boats each year. The policy was rejected by the courts last month. Braverman is challenging the decision in the supreme court."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/gloucestershire-school-locked-down-due-to-ongoing-incident-tewkesbury", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teacher discharged from hospital after Gloucestershire school stabbing", "lead": "Teenager arrested after attack at Tewkesbury academy which led to hundreds of children being locked down", "author": "Steven Morris and Jamie Grierson", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 21:35:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954051", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5304300de45b45f19e77074175390ea31a31ab3f/127_182_3234_1940/500.jpg", "body": "A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a maths teacher was stabbed in a Gloucestershire school, leading to hundreds of children being kept in lockdown for more than five hours.

Police said the teenager, who is from Tewkesbury, remained in police custody. Sarah Penny, a parent of a child at the school, said her child was \u201creally, really frightened\u201d. She said: \u201cThey are going to be so traumatised. They had to put a small cabinet across the door to keep them safe. One of my friend\u2019s sons sent a message to his dad saying they were in lockdown and to come and get him because he didn\u2019t want to die. That\u2019s the level of anxiety.\u201d The Guardian saw a series of text messages between a parent and pupil during the lockdown. The messages said: \u201cWe are stuck in a classroom. Mum I\u2019m really scared \u2026 They had guns, they had armed police and dogs were out.\u201d Asked who had guns, the pupil said: \u201cThe police, I saw armed police come into the school. I\u2019m just still scared. My school is in lockdown and it\u2019s really scary.\u201d Later the pupil added: \u201cWe are gonna be let out soon but I can\u2019t call anyone. They are taking us to the gym by year group, when everyone is there and safe I think they will let us out.\u201d At 1.25pm pupils began emerging from the school, a year group at a time. There were hugs and tears as parents greeted them. \u201cWe\u2019re so relieved,\u201d said Julie Gardiner, who was picking up her child. \u201cYou see these things on the news but they don\u2019t happen locally.\u201d The child said: \u201cThe doors and windows were locked. It was quite scary. The teachers did a good job keeping us calm. We had sweets and did a geography quiz.\u201d Another child said: \u201cA teacher locked the door and we were there for four hours. When we went for a toilet break we could see lots of police cars. Then there was an assembly. They told us a member of staff had been harmed. It\u2019s sad, I don\u2019t know why it happened.\u201d His mother, Michelle Smith, said: \u201cAs soon as they said we could bring him home, I was here like a shot. The teacher is one of Alex\u2019s favourites. He\u2019s very popular. I\u2019m very concerned about him. We know the kids are safe, we need to know he\u2019s OK. \u201cEverything is mixed up, nobody really knows. We know he was loose and managed to get over a fence.\u201d Ian Barnes, whose 12-year-old daughter is a pupil, said: \u201cI drove past and noticed police cars. I thought it was an accident.\u201d His daughter added: \u201cThe police came into our classroom to check if we were OK. I was quite scared. After we did our main work we got to chill out.\u201d The assistant chief constable Richard Ocone said police received a call just after 9am from someone reporting a threat to a teacher. He said: \u201cMinutes later, we received a call from the ambulance service telling us a male teacher had been stabbed in a corridor. \u201cIt was initially thought the suspect had hid himself in the school grounds. Our officers, including armed police, attended and carried out a thorough search. This search was complex and meticulous. \u201cThe academy was locked down and two neighbouring schools were asked to close their doors as a precaution. Specialist forces including the national police air service and plainclothes officers were deployed to search the wider area and the suspect was arrested by firearms officers in Stoke Orchard at 11am. \u201cA knife was seized. The motivation behind the attack is unclear and there is no evidence to suggest it is terrorism-related. However, we are keeping an open mind.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/10/nebraska-mother-daughter-abortion-pills-burying-fetus-guilty", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": " US mother pleads guilty to giving daughter abortion pills and burying fetus", "lead": "Jesssica Burgess of Nebraska admits to providing abortion after 20 weeks and tampering with human skeletal remains", "author": "Guardian staff and agency", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 21:32:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954069", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/99f6492b4c0d94af69ab0adfb6322cb27f17c87a/0_54_2470_1482/500.jpg", "body": "A Nebraska mother has pleaded guilty to giving her 17-year-old daughter pills for an illegal abortion last year and helping to burn and bury the fetus. Under a plea agreement, Jessica Burgess, 42, of Norfolk, admitted to providing an abortion after 20 weeks of gestation, false reporting and tampering with human skeletal remains. Charges of concealing the death of another person and abortion by someone other than a licensed physician were dismissed. Burgess was accused of helping her then-17-year-old daughter, Celeste Burgess, end her pregnancy. Madison county district court documents show she ordered abortion pills on the internet. After the teen aborted the 29-week-old fetus, the two burned the remains and buried them in a field north of Norfolk in north-eastern Nebraska. Authorities later found the burned fetus. Madison county attorney Joe Smith has said it is the first time he has charged anyone with illegally performing an abortion after 20 weeks, a restriction that was passed in 2010. In May, the Republican governor, Jim Pillen, signed a 12-week abortion ban. After pleading guilty last Friday, Jessica Burgess is set for sentencing on 22 September. Two of the counts against her are felonies, one is a misdemeanor. Celeste Burgess, now 18, was charged as an adult and pleaded guilty in May to removing, concealing or abandoning a dead body. She is scheduled to be sentenced on 20 July. She faces up to two years in prison. Via Facebook messages, the two discussed terminating the pregnancy and plans to destroy the evidence. The messages, which law enforcement acquired using a search warrant, were detailed in court documents. Last summer, a man pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor for helping the women bury the fetus on his parents\u2019 land. Last June, the conservative-dominated US supreme court struck down the national right to an abortion in the US, upending almost 50 years of precedent after overturning Roe v Wade as part of the Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case. It has sparked a year of protest, political backlash and some surprises by pro-choice campaigners and voters and more incidents of extreme difficulties for women wanting or needing to access abortion. The power on abortion rights passed to the individual states, some of which have enshrined protections, while others have heavily restricted or all but banned the procedure."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/10/labour-would-use-ai-to-help-people-find-jobs-says-jonathan-ashworth", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labour would use AI to help people find jobs, says Jonathan Ashworth", "lead": "Shadow work and pensions secretary will talk up possibilities of artificial intelligence as colleague discusses dangers for workers", "author": "Kiran Stacey", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 21:30:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954087", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf14ac8bd7a5fc2d88c8e405d0c65c12331a1de8/304_134_3196_1917/500.jpg", "body": "Labour would use artificial intelligence to help those looking for work prepare their CVs, find jobs and receive payments faster, according to the party\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary. Jonathan Ashworth told the Guardian he thought the Department for Work and Pensions was wasting millions of pounds by not using cutting-edge technology, even as the party also says AI could also cause massive disruption to the jobs market. Both Ashworth and Lucy Powell, the shadow digital secretary, are making speeches on Tuesday about AI as the party hones its policies concerning one of the fastest-moving areas in the technology industry. But while Ashworth will talk up the potential benefits of the technology for public services, Powell will say it can leave workers disempowered and excluded. Ashworth will say AI could make as big a difference to job-seeking as when the Blair government set up Jobcentre Plus in 2002. \u201cJobcentre Plus services was an important reform of the Blair/Brown years, but it needs to get better at getting people back into work,\u201d he will say. \u201cDWP broadly gets 60% of unemployed people back to work within nine months. I think by better embracing modern tech and AI we can transform its services and raise that figure.\u201d Both Labour and the Conservative government have been rushing to update their AI policies in recent weeks to keep up with how quickly the technology is developing. The advent of ChatGPT, coupled with warnings from some of those at the forefront of the industry about the damage it could do to humans, have forced both parties to look into how it should both be regulated and used by the public sector. Speaking at an AI industry event in London on Tuesday, Powell will say the technology could trigger a second deindustrialisation, causing major economic damage to entire parts of the UK. She will highlight the risk of \u201crobo-firing\u201d. There was a recent case in the Netherlands where drivers successfully sued Uber after claiming they were fired by an algorithm. She will say in her speech: \u201cWorkers can either be empowered or excluded by technology, finding themselves on the wrong side of biased algorithms and robot firing.\u201d Powell has previously called for a licensing regime for those working on large datasets for AI tools, which would force them to provide transparency to users and policymakers about what they are using and how. Ashworth will strike a more upbeat note on the possibility of algorithms reshaping public services. He will say Labour would use AI in three particular areas. Firstly, it would make more use of job-matching software, which can use the data the DWP already has on people looking for work to pair them up more quickly with prospective employers. Secondly, the party would use algorithms to process claims more quickly. And thirdly, it would use AI to a greater extent to help identify fraud and error in the system. DWP already has a pilot scheme to use AI to find organised benefits fraud, such as cloning other people\u2019s identities. Ashworth said, however, humans would always be required to make the final decisions over jobs and benefit decisions, not least to avoid accidental bias and discrimination."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fc9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/10/tottenham-ange-postecoglou-harry-kane", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I love a rebuild\u2019: Ange Postecoglou warms to Tottenham challenge", "lead": "Incoming manager determined to do things his way and insists he is unconcerned by uncertainty over Harry Kane\u2019s future", "author": "David Hytner", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 21:30:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954105", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/52bc2be82a89033adf1ed2845c0c55e9fec3ea6a/325_428_3028_1816/500.jpg", "body": "Ange Postecoglou lost the sweepstake. Truth be told, the new Tottenham manager lost it by a distance. He and his coaches had speculated on how long it would take at his media unveiling before the subject of Harry Kane was raised. The answer was three questions. \u201cI think Mile Jedinak has won,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cI had over six because I thought you\u2019d care more about me.\u201d Written in black and white, the line can look a little chippy, which was not really the case. It was dry and quite funny, getting a few laughs. Yet there was an edge to it, just as there is an edge to the man who Spurs hope can turn around their fortunes. Are we talking about Kane, already? Yes, Ange, we are. And there is a decent chance that the state of affairs will persist. This is what happens when a club talisman has 12 months to run on his contract, no immediate plans to re\u2011sign and is being aggressively courted by Bayern Munich. Postecoglou knew what to expect when he entered the room. He had been briefed. And, essentially, his presentation came down to how he handled the Kane issue. He did so by focusing on what he knew and could control, staying resolutely on track, refusing to be drawn into speculation. And his points with regard to the centre-forward, who will report for pre-season training on Wednesday before the departure for the tour of Australia (where Postecoglou was raised), Thailand and Singapore on Friday, chimed neatly with his broader message. The Postecoglou project at Spurs will not be defined by any individual, no matter how talented; rather a team in the truest sense, playing and, as he stressed repeatedly, behaving in a particular way. There was a point, as he discussed the need for open minds, to avoid being dragged down by expectation levels or history, when he made clear that he would do things his way and his way alone. Players could either get on board, or look for alternative transport. \u201cWhen there is resistance, it slows the process down,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve made clear is it won\u2019t change the process, it won\u2019t change me. It\u2019ll maybe derail it for a little bit but it won\u2019t derail it for long because I won\u2019t allow it. The quicker they jump on the train, the quicker we\u2019ll get to our destination.\u201d Postecoglou was not talking directly about Kane but it felt in keeping with the general tone towards him. Towards everybody, in fact. Tanguy Ndombele, for example, has returned from a loan at Napoli with a Serie A title winner\u2019s medal, and supporters wondering whether he could revive his Spurs career. Postecoglou said he was pleased to have Ndombele as part of the squad but at present it was difficult to be definitive. \u201cHe may decide that this is not for him, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Postecoglou said. In other words, he could jump on or ship out. Will Kane get on board? Postecoglou appeared relaxed about the situation, even though it threatens to dominate the countdown to the new season. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any assurances [from the club on Kane] and I wouldn\u2019t expect any assurances,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when you\u2019re dealing with these kind of things you\u2019re never dealing with definites or certainties. I concentrate on the things I know right now. What I know right now is that Harry is part of this squad and he\u2019s looking forward to coming back to training. If I spend too much time worrying about the impact it might have either way, I\u2019m going to miss trying to build a team because ultimately that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make us successful. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my role to sit down and treat people in a [certain] manner because of their circumstances. I\u2019m really big on treating everyone the same. Harry has already entrenched himself in the history of this football club. He\u2019s one of the premier strikers in the world and I want him involved. My conversation with him will be about how we can make this club successful.\u201d Postecoglou denied that Bayern\u2019s public courtship was annoying. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t register,\u201d he insisted, and it would only do so if it affected Kane or the squad. \u201cI guess it\u2019s how we react as a football club that\u2019s going to be important and that will get tested, for sure,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019m not going to lose time or sleep on conjecture because then you\u2019re jumping at shadows. Nothing\u2019s landed on my desk from anybody at the club to say there\u2019s a decision to be made there. Not even close to that.\u201d Postecoglou talked about playing on the front foot, about being proactive and dominant. He said in response to more than one question that he did not want to set limits, and that included any targets for the season. He opened up on leaving Celtic, saying it was hard but also necessary. \u201cI\u2019ve needed to have that instinct inside me to know when to move on because I\u2019ve had to be faultless in my career to get to this point. It\u2019s because no one\u2019s going to rate an Australian manager, are they? If I had any significant failures, I was never going to get here. Part of that process is knowing that I need to keep moving to be at my best.\u201d What lingered after Postecoglou had taken his leave was the relish he had for the rebuild in hand \u2013 whether that proves to be with or without Kane. \u201cI can\u2019t resist a challenge,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019m at my best \u2026 when the challenge is the biggest. I love a build, I love a rebuild. All my career, I\u2019ve always taken over a side who have one. This challenge had all the elements I need to get going again.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fca", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/no-clear-pathway-expected-for-ukraine-nato-bid-amid-german-and-us-caution", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "No clear pathway expected for Ukraine Nato bid amid German and US caution", "lead": "Ukraine looks likely to be offered closer integration rather than clear pre-conditions as war with Russia continues", "author": "Dan Sabbagh Defence and security editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 21:30:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954125", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8a10330a8ceafe5cc56154eaf225e4623f2b3dc3/0_146_4347_2610/500.jpg", "body": "Nato members are not expected to set clear pre-conditions for Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership to the military alliance in the face of caution from the US and Germany while the war with Russia continues. Ukraine wants clarity on when and how it can join the alliance after the war with Russia ends, believing that western military protection is the only way it can remain unthreatened by its neighbour. However, it looks instead likely to be offered closer integration with Nato and a stronger political declaration in favour of its membership in principle. As the US president, Joe Biden, met the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in Downing Street on Monday, American and British officials emphasised that setting specific hurdles for Ukraine to clear was unrealistic given the uncertainty of the ongoing conflict. At the heart of Nato is article 5 of its founding charter, which states each member agrees \u201cthat an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all\u201d. It requires member states to join in defending the country under attack. Colin Kahl, the US undersecretary for defence, visiting London alongside the president, said there was resistance in the White House to any suggestion \u201cthat there\u2019s a degree of automaticity or immediacy\u201d to Nato membership. British sources concurred, although Downing Street said the UK wanted \u201cto support Ukraine on a pathway to joining the alliance\u201d ahead of a critical leaders\u2019 meeting in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on Tuesday and Wednesday. Kyiv won a concession on Monday, with Nato members agreeing to eliminate formal requirements for it to sign up to a membership action plan, a formal pathway to membership that has taken other countries several years to complete. \u201cI welcome this long-awaited decision that shortens our path to Nato\u201d said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s foreign secretary, but he added the summit would be \u201cthe best moment to offer clarity on the invitation to Ukraine to become a member\u201d. Negotiations on a final summit text were expected to continue into Monday evening, to agree what is expected to be a carefully constructed statement intended to go somewhat further than a previous commitment given to Ukraine in 2008, that the country could become a member at an indefinite point in the future. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, emphasised that the summit would reach a consensus. \u201cAll allies agree that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance and I\u2019m confident that the summit will make decisions which will be strong and positive on Ukraine,\u201d he said at a press conference. But it appears that the UK, France and other Nato members in eastern Europe have found no way to persuade a cautious White House into a more specific membership commitment. On Sunday, Biden said Ukraine was \u201cnot yet ready\u201d for Nato, and that the country would \u201ctake some time to meet all the qualifications\u201d. Nato members are also expected to make further bilateral military aid commitments to Ukraine. On Monday, the UK announced it had agreed a \u00a3190m contract with BAE Systems to increase the production of 155mm Nato standard shells eightfold, many of which are expected to be given to Kyiv\u2019s military. \u201cWe have also seen the Nato alliance come together like never before in support of Ukraine and with firm determination that Russia cannot succeed,\u201d Sunak said as he announced the ammunition boost, adding: \u201cThat is work we need to continue this week.\u201d However, a separate package of security guarantees for Ukraine, from the US, UK, Germany and France, is not now expected to be announced until the end of the summit at the earliest, amid last-minute wrangling. These are intended to commit the countries to providing military aid and economic support to Kyiv in the long term. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is expected to attend on Wednesday at an inaugural meeting of a Nato-Ukraine council designed to foster closer cooperation \u2013 having previously warned he may not attend at all if his membership pathway demands were not met. Downing Street also said that the UK would shortly publish a defence paper outlining further reforms to the armed forces, reflecting lessons learned from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The document, expected to confirm greater investment in artillery and drones, is anticipated early next week. But Labour said the UK was one of the few Nato members heading into the summit without having revised its defence plans in the light of the Ukraine war. Its research found that 26 out of 31 Nato countries had recast their defence strategies, with Germany committing to spend an extra \u20ac100bn and Poland lifting spending to 4% of GDP. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said: \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing for the UK to go to the Nato summit as one of only five Nato nations that has not rebooted defence plans since President Putin invaded Ukraine.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fcb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/tory-rebels-offered-concessions-on-key-anti-asylum-legislation", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tory rebels offered concessions on asylum legislation", "lead": "Ministers axe plan obliging Braverman to send thousands of asylum seekers who arrive this summer to Rwanda", "author": "Rajeev Syal and Diane Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 21:23:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954145", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/06a497d9ec32641988436ab2ff01207ace3f2ffb/0_59_3248_1949/500.jpg", "body": "Ministers have been forced to offer rebel Conservative MPs concessions on key asylum legislation amid growing concern that it would fail to pass through the Commons. The government has dropped nearly all of the retrospective applications of the illegal migration bill\u2019s measures \u2013 a move that will mean Suella Braverman will no longer be obliged to deport thousands of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK this summer to a third country such as Rwanda. Ministers will also limit plans to detain children and pregnant women who arrive in the UK on small boats across the Channel. They have not offered any specific compromises to protect victims of modern slavery, as previously demanded by MPs including Theresa May and Iain Duncan Smith. The changes will mean that the duty on the home secretary to remove anyone who comes to the UK through an irregular route such as a small boat will not apply retrospectively and will instead be applied after the bill receives royal assent, which may not happen before September. It is a U-turn on plans announced in March, when Home Office sources told the Guardian: \u201c[The retrospective application is] to stop people smugglers seizing on the opportunity to rush migrants across the Channel to avoid being subject to the new measures.\u201d One Tory MP said the change could result in a rise in arrivals via small boats. \u201cIt looks as if the government is running scared. We are going to see the number of arrivals from France this summer go up because smugglers will encourage migrants to travel before the ban.\u201d But others disagree. Lucy Moreton, the professional officer for the ISU union, which represents border force staff, said: \u201cIt is not going to make much difference to the number of arrivals. Migrants are becoming more cynical because there has not been action following other reports.\u201d The bill, which is meant to fulfil Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, will complete its final stage in the House of Lords with a vote on Monday night. The draft legislation returns to the House of Commons on Tuesday for MPs to consider the 20 amendments made to it by peers. Changes tabled on Monday will mean that the first-tier tribunal can grant immigration bail after eight days to unaccompanied children detained for the purpose of removal, instead of the current proposed 28 days. A further amendment will mean that the government will keep the current rules on the detention of pregnant women, which will mean they can be detained for a maximum of 72 hours. This can be extended to seven days on the authorisation of a minister. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, condemned the bill despite the amendments: \u201cThe changes put forward by the government today are in no way compassionate, nor do they deal with the challenges facing the asylum system. \u201cThe government continues to treat people seeking safety, including children, in a manner comparable to criminals and their proposals do nothing to tackle people-smuggling gangs or the record-high asylum backlog.\u201d After MPs vote on the bill on Tuesday, it will be passed back to the Lords to decide whether the upper chamber will once again amend the bill in a process known as \u201cping-pong\u201d. Ministers are seeking to ensure that the bill will enable the detention of asylum seekers who arrive by irregular means and their deportation to a third country such as Rwanda. More than 1,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats in just two days, taking the yearly total to 12,503. On Saturday 384 people crossed in seven boats and 686 people crossed in 13 boats on Friday, a new daily record. The rise contrasts with claims made by Sunak last month that his plan was \u201cstarting to work\u201d after pointing to figures showing year-on-year figures were down 20%. Downing Street said the number of people using small boats to cross the Channel was \u201ctoo large\u201d. \u201cI think we always knew that, as we move into the summer months, crossings will escalate,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said. \u201cWe are continuing to stop significant numbers of crossings. I still believe that you are more likely to be stopped and turned back than to make the crossing, and that\u2019s because of the work with our French counterparts and the extra support that we have put in. \u201cBut clearly the numbers making the journeys are still too large and that\u2019s why we need the other elements of our \u2018stop the boats\u2019 package.\u201d That included the Rwanda deal, the spokesperson said, which is the subject of a legal battle set to reach the supreme court, and the illegal migration bill, which has suffered a mauling in the House of Lords.

The Twitter rival has grown rapidly since its launch last Wednesday, with Zuckerberg seeking to woo users with a promise that the platform would focus on \u201ckindness\u201d. Twitter\u2019s Elon Musk has responded with a threat to sue Meta, the parent company of Threads, over its launch of a \u201ccopycat\u201d app. Writing on his Threads account, Zuckerberg said the new app had reached 100 million users over the weekend. By contrast Instagram, owned by Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta empire, took a week to reach 100,000 users when it launched as an independent platform in 2010. \u201cThreads reached 100 million sign-ups over the weekend,\u201d wrote Zuckerberg. \u201cThat\u2019s mostly organic demand and we haven\u2019t even turned on many promotions yet. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only been five days!\u201d Threads users need an Instagram account to log into the new app, with the ability to transfer over the accounts they follow on Instagram to the new platform. Despite Zuckerberg\u2019s focus on kindness, the US non-profit group Media Matters said rightwing figures have signed up to Threads including the white nationalist Richard Spencer and Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and outspoken antisemite. However, Meta has since taken down Spencer\u2019s account. Twitter has gone through a period of prolonged upheaval since Musk\u2019s $44bn (\u00a338bn) takeover last year, with the billionaire making a series of changes, such as swingeing job cuts and imposing viewing limits. Mike Proulx, the research director at the analysis firm Forrester, said the Threads launch so far had been a \u201ccase study on what to do right\u201d. He added: \u201cThe meteoric rise of Threads, in just five days, demonstrates just how many people have longed for an alternative to what Twitter has devolved into.\u201d However, Proulx said Threads needed to prove that it can manage sustained growth and getting people to use it repeatedly. Meta, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, has delayed launching Threads in the EU amid doubts over how the bloc will regulate the app\u2019s use of personal data. On Sunday the web services firm Cloudflare claimed that website traffic to Twitter, which has more than 250 million daily users, according to Musk, was \u201ctanking\u201d. The Cloudflare managing director, Matthew Prince, posted a graph on Twitter showing a drop in Cloudflare\u2019s domain server ranking for Twitter in mid-2023. The drop in early July appeared to coincide with Musk imposing viewing limits on Twitter and the launch of Threads. Twitter has, however, retained the support of the senior Taliban leader Anas Haqqani, who endorsed the app over Meta\u2019s Threads, which he said has an \u201cintolerant policy\u201d. \u201cTwitter has two important advantages over other social media platforms. The first privilege is the freedom of speech. The second privilege is the public nature &amp; credibility of Twitter,\u201d he said on Twitter. Twitter has been contacted for comment."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fcd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/10/youtuber-colleen-ballinger-shows-canceled-alleged-inappropriate-behavior", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "YouTuber Colleen Ballinger loses shows over alleged inappropriate behavior", "lead": "Comedian known for Miranda Sings character faces accusations of inappropriate behavior with minors and wearing blackface", "author": "Edwin Rios", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 21:21:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954181", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c9fc3c607959794fecaa1c2785ce38cac18151a5/0_89_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Colleen Ballinger\u2019s podcast Oversharing and several of her live shows have now been canceled as the YouTuber known for her satirical teenage persona Miranda Sings continues to face criticism for allegedly behaving inappropriately toward underaged fans and wearing blackface. Ballinger\u2019s co-host, Trisha Paytas, called the ordeal \u201cembarrassing\u201d in a YouTube video this week, confirming that the duo\u2019s podcast would end after just three episodes. \u201cWhen I say I\u2019ve never wanted a chapter in my life to be over faster than this, even though it was a really small chapter, I mean it,\u201d Paytas said in the video. The cancellations marked a staggering halt to Ballinger\u2019s career. Ballinger created Miranda Sings as a student at a Christian university in 2008 and eventually attracted millions of followers, earning a Netflix show that lasted for two seasons. She had been in the midst of a national tour as allegations from former fans emerged of bullying and inappropriate behavior with minors. An upcoming show on 10 August in St Louis, Missouri, was cancelled due to \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d. Back in April 2020, YouTuber Adam McIntyre claimed in a video that Ballinger befriended him when he was between 13 and 16 years old. McIntyre, who believed he was legitimately friends with Ballinger, claimed he exchanged texts with her and had access to her social media accounts. Ballinger reportedly sent lingerie to McIntyre, an act that Ballinger later said would become a \u201cbig joke within the fandom\u201d in a video addressing McIntyre\u2019s claims. \u201cNo, I should have never sent a fan underwear, how stupid am I? No, I definitely should have never given him access to my Twitter account, and no, I shouldn\u2019t have talked to him as often as I did,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cBut I am not a monster and I am not a groomer.\u201d Since then, more allegations of impropriety surfaced after KodeeRants, another former fan and YouTuber, released a video detailing private exchanges allegedly between Ballinger and McIntyre in a group chat reserved for fans called \u201cColleeny\u2019s weenies\u201d. The exchange, now in since-deleted videos from KodeeRants, showed Ballinger, who was in her 30s, reportedly asking McIntyre, who was 15, if he was a virgin and what his favorite sex position was. The inappropriate behavior extended to the stage as well, with Ballinger putting teenagers in awkward, sexualized situations for the sake of comedy. Another fan accused Ballinger of sending nude photos of her eventual podcast co-host, Trisha Paytas, to him that were taken from Paytas\u2019s OnlyFans page. Video clips also surfaced of Ballinger allegedly performing Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Single Ladies in blackface, an accusation her legal team denied in a statement to Vulture. They noted Ballinger had instead painted her face green modeled after the witch in the Broadway hit Wicked before she performed Single Ladies. In late June, Ballinger denied the allegations in a YouTube video, in which she sang about the \u201ctoxic gossip train, chugging down the tracks of misinformation\u201d while playing the ukulele."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fce", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/10/wimbledon-2023-djokovic-rybakina-jabeur-and-alcaraz-in-action-on-day-eight-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon 2023: Alcaraz beats Berrettini; Jabeur and Djokovic through \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Alcaraz and Rune progress to set up youngest ever QF.

What a joy watching Alcaraz. And to think he\u2019ll take on Rune in the quarterfinal. They\u2019re both only 20-years-old. I hope the documentary makers are taking note. At the risk of jinxing them this could be a generational rivalry. Anyhoo, I\u2019m off to bed. I\u2019ll leave you with Tumaini\u2019s report. I\u2019m back again for the late shift tomorrow. See you then. Take a look at this photo. Recognise these two youngsters? You\u2019ll get to watch them play on Wednesday. Men\u2019s singles quarterfinals locked in. 1 v 6. 2 v 7. 3 and 8 also in the mix. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty impressive draw. There\u2019ve been some sensational shots today, but the main talking points came as a consequence of a racket-less hand. First Victoria Azarenka of Belarus walked off the court to boos as she made a \u2018handcuff gesture\u2019, knocking her wrists together. She was beaten by Elina Svitolina of Ukraine who came back to steal the match after a tiebreak. Do I need to explain the political context here? Then, Mirra Andreeva refused to shake the umpire\u2019s hand when she was adjudged to have thrown her racket shortly before losing to Madison Keys. It was an iffy call. I think she did lash out but I\u2019ve seen a lot worse go unpunished. Tennis is filled with so many decent people right now. Call me naive or idealistic or over sentimental, but it feels like good folk are doing the business. Yes, I know some not so good folk are also claiming victories, but let me have this win, yeah? Here\u2019s Chris Eubank with a moving post match interview after beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in five sets: Some big games on Court 1 as well: Jessica Pegula [4] v Marketa Vondrousova and Jannik Sinner [8] v Roman Safiullin. Play starts at 1pm BST. \u201cAlcaraz seems the real deal, but wishing his career away so he can have an offspring and start a dynasty seems a little hasty. Live in the moment!\u201d Ha! Very good, Liam Collett. I know you\u2019re kidding (about the kids I mean) but you\u2019re actually right. It\u2019s so easy to get carried away by young talents. Fair play, let\u2019s enjoy the moment. (And quietly hope we\u2019re witnessing the start of something truly great). Thanks for writing in. Some tasty matches tomorrow. Let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s happening on your Tuesday: On Centre Court we\u2019ve got Iga Swiatek [1] v Elina Svitolina before Anrey Rublev [7] v Novak Djokovic [2] Just the 27 grand slams then at the most prestigious arena in the sport. Shot of the tournament? Maybe you\u2019ve seen something better but I\u2019m not sure I have. This kid is unreal. And he seems like a really likeable lad. I wouldn\u2019t mind if he goes on to create a dynasty. Phew, what a day. We\u2019ve got plenty of reading for you. So, if you want to stuck into some of the best tennis writing on the planet, why not wade through this: Here\u2019s Carlos: I knew that it was going to be very tough. Matteo is playing great. Of course it\u2019s not easy. After losing the first set I knew I had to take my chances and stay focused. That is something I\u2019ve been working on. I think I did great in that part and I\u2019m very happy to win a great match. I\u2019m hungry for more [he says to big cheers]. This is something I wanted. I really wanted to play in a quarterfinal here. Once I got it I\u2019m looking for more. My dream is to win this title one day. I hope to reach that dream this year. Right now it\u2019s great to reach the quarterfinal. The young guys are reaching their dreams. [He\u2019s talking about playing Rune]. That;\u2019s great for tennis. We\u2019ve played in a lot of tournaments, from when we were 12-years-old. Playing in a quarterfinal against him in a grand slam is something I\u2019m going to enjoy. I\u2019m sure he feels the same way. It was a ropey start but once he got going there was only going to be one winner. He was better in evert facet of the game. Ruthless with his trademark forehand, accurate with the backhand, intelligent with his drop shots and unnerving with his serve, winning points 80% of the time he landed one. He only procured 4/16 breakpoints which shows how dominant he was. In fact, the scoreline flatters Berrettini. The world number one will play Holger Rune in the next round in a battle of the 20-year-olds The first time that\u2019s ever happened at Wimbledon in the last eight. Can\u2019t wait. Deuce! Alcaraz keeps us waiting. He dominated that rally and moved to the net to volley for the winner. But he got too much on that forehand and sent it beyond the baseline when really anywhere would have seen him through. Alcaraz with match point. Another thumping drive is too good for Berrettini. Alcaraz to serve for the match. Another error means this one could be over very soon. Berrettini can\u2019t hang with the world\u2019s top ranked player and he\u2019s now 3-5 down in the fourth set. 15-40. Alcaraz clubs a forehand into the corner. He whips his body round and his elastic right arm follows. A cracking stroke. He\u2019s a point away from serving for this match. Berrettini misses two shots and is now 0-30 down. One was a gimme from centre court. The next it seemed he got his feet stuck at the baseline. But oh wow, he slams an ace to make it 15-30. Huge point. Alcaraz canters to an easy win. That game didn\u2019t last long. Quick fire ground play and some accurate, spitting serves means the world number one wraps that up in no time. They\u2019re showing a graphic on the screen, when Alcaraz goes wide with his first serve, especially to Berrettini\u2019s forehand, he\u2019s winning every point. He\u2019s 4-3 up in this fourth set. Berrettini\u2019s best hope is to hang on for a tiebreaker. Bang! Berrettini has an almighty serve and he holds here after a nervy start to the game. When he nails that first serve he\u2019s a heck of a prospect. Too bad he hasn\u2019t been able to string enough points together. Still, he takes the game and this fourth set is locked at 3-3. Oh wow! How has Alcaraz rescued that? First he had to stoop to return a fierce serve. Then he shunted back an overhead smash from Berrettini and did so again with a looping lob. When Berrettini when for another overhead smash winner he clattered the net from close range. 15-15. Alcaraz holds. 3-2 up in the fourth set. Winner plays Rune in the last eight. Berrettini seriously needs to break him at some point but he\u2019s first got to hold his own serve. Back under way. Alcaraz serving. He\u2019s 2-1 up and it\u2019s level in this fourth set at 2-2. Alcaraz and Berrettini are warming up. Again. Electric lights and a change in atmosphere means they need to acclimatise. Shouldn\u2019t be long now. Rune is gushing, as you\u2019d expect: It feels amazing. Today was a crazy match. Grigor is an incredible player and he pushed me to the limit. We both pushed each other so I think it was a really, really great match and tough match. It was long also. I\u2019m fighting until the end always. That\u2019s what I focus on especially when I\u2019m in the tough situation. Also, I tell myself that there is Wimbledon is once a year so I\u2019m going to fight until I have the chance to win. Seems that Berrettini insisted on the roof. I was watching Rune claim his victory but I understand the Italian was complaining about the fading light. He better up his game now. He\u2019ll have no excuse if he gets spanked from here. Here\u2019s how he did it. Patience. Not many 20-year-olds have it. Then again, not many 20-year-olds have the talent of this fella. They\u2019re closing the roof at Centre Court. Will that impact Alcaraz as he marches towards victory? He\u2019s level with Berrettini in the fourth set, 2-2, after winning two consecutive sets for a 2-1 lead. Sensational from the 20-year-old Dane. After being put away in the first set, he battled back, won two tiebreaks and triumphed in four sets after Dimitrov succumbed after a lengthy rally, shunting his backhand wide down the tram.. That\u2019s a first ever Wimbledon quarterfinal for him after making his first grand slam quarterfinal in Paris earlier this year. A talent on the rise. Remember the name. Match point for Rune. Standby. I\u2019ve switched over to Rune v Dimitrov as the 20-year-old Dane is serving for the match. Not long now. Alcaraz holds. Berrettini last had a break point in the first set \u2013 which he won. Since then it\u2019s been one way traffic on the Spaniard\u2019s serve. Another impeccable game that\u2019s polished off with a mighty, whipping forehand. Alcaraz is 2-1 up in both sets and games in the fourth. Rune is serving for the match. Dimitrov won the previous game to make it 3-5 in the fourth set, but now Rune will serve to settle it. He\u2019s 15-0 up. Alcaraz double faults. Is that a turning point? Probably not. But it\u2019s sloppy in the third game of the fourth set. Never mind. He wins the next point to take a 30-15 lead. Game Berrettini. When he serves like that he\u2019s a force. Pity he can\u2019t string it together or return with enough venom on Alcaraz\u2019s serve. Still, impressive game and he\u2019s levelled the fourth set 1-1. Alcaraz holds in the first game of the fourth set. Berrettini led 0-30 but Alcaraz comes storming back. The world number 1 lost the first set 3-6 but has been imperious since, winning the second and third sets 6-3. He\u2019s 1-0 and has this game squared at 15-15. Rune breaks Dimitrov. Massive moment on Court 1. After two tiebreaks Rune upends Dimitrov\u2019s serve. He\u2019s 4-2 up in the fourth set and is serving as we speak. He\u2019s also up 2-1 on sets. Hold this and he\u2019ll at least be serving for the match next time round. Berrettini blows a lead. He was 0-30 up on Alcaraz\u2019s serve but he goes long with a backhand and it\u2019s no 30-30. He simply has to break the Spaniard to keep this game alive. This first game of the fourth set is as good a time as any. It\u2019s just not tennis. Here\u2019s an intersting one from Geneva Abdul. Wimbledon, it seems, has chose to turn the other cheek to a variety of offences. Is the sport better for it? Read on and decide for yourself. Alcaraz takes 2-1 lead. A second break on Berrettini\u2019s serve means Alzaraz takes a giant step towards the quarterfinals. Berrettini has taken won points from just 33% of his second serve and that is proving the difference. Alcaraz annihilated a cross court forehand winner that might have broken the ball. That gave him the advantage before he put away another winner. He\u2019s climbing through the gears. Berrettini is faltering. Hard to see a way back for him. Alcaraz returns from one knee. Well, almost. He stooped down real low to almost overhand that return from a spitting Berrettini serve. He then lobbed an inch perfect floater that ended with him taking a 15-40 lead. Berrettini fought back to take it to deuce, but that exchange perhaps underlined the potential of both players. The Italian is hanging on. The Spaniard is putting on a show. Alcaraz one game away from a 2-1 set advantage. Clinical once again. He leads 5-3 in the third. Rune takes the third set. This could go down as the match of the tournament. I\u2019m sticking with the world number one but I won\u2019t mind if you switch over. After losing the first set 3-6, Rune has pipped Dimitrov in two consecutive tiebreaks. 8-6 and then 7-4. The 20-year-old now leds 2-1 and has claimed the first game in the fourth set. Berrettini won\u2019t lie down. He continues to cling on with a mighty service game. A clean sweep there. His forehand is working well too. Lovely technique to seal the winning point. Still, he\u2019s 3-4 down in the third set with Alcaraz about to serve. Alcaraz has it on a string now. His serve is clicking but it\u2019s the stroke play that\u2019s really catching the eye. A meaty forehand into the corner makes it 30-15 and then a deft inside-out drop across the court makes it 40-15. He finishes the game with a closed forehand that flatfoots Berrettini. Momentum all with the Spaniard. He\u2019s absolutely dominating. He\u2019s up 4-2 in this third set. Berrettini holds. A real feature of this match has been the quality of soft touches around the net. The Italian serves and gets it to spit, he moves towards the net and dinks a drop just over the net to claim the game. He\u2019s still 2-3 down in this third set. 1-1 in the match. Alcaraz to serve for a healthy lead. Deuce after Alcaraz comes close to breaking again. The No 1 seed has grown in this game and came close to securing a real stranglehold on this third set. But an overhead smash from Berrettini extends the set and takes it to deuce. He then wins another point to take the advantage. Another tiebreak on Court 1. Rune leads this latest one in the third set 2-0. He won the second set on a tiebreak after Dimitrov claimed the first 6-3. Alcaraz holds to take 3-1 lead in second set. He couldn\u2019t land his first serve but his second kicked off a length. Berrettini returned deep but not deep enough and Alcaraz leaned on a backhand across the court to seal the game. Delightful from Berrettini. An innocuous looking backhand return looked destined to land outside the white chalk but it swerved like an in-swinger in cricket and landed just inside. He\u2019s fought back on Alcafraz\u2019s serve to take it to deuce. Just when you think he\u2019s buried he comes roaring back to life. Alcaraz finally breaks to take 2-1 lead. At long last, the No. 1 seed makes it count. A firm forehand followed up by a drop and then finished off with a thrilling overhead forehand sees him through. Berrettini resisted but couldn\u2019t keep the Spaniard out despite a near perfect lob. Alcaraz roars to a crowd that has been subdued until now. He knows that\u2019s a big moment in this match with the pair locked at a set apiece. Fifth break point. That Alcaraz inside out forehand is blistering. He;s 1/9 on breakpoints though. Can he make this one count? Nope. Berrettini\u2019s forehand takes it back to deuce. Second deuce. Fourth break point. On we go. Alcaraz keeps missing his chance to break Berrettini. That inside out forehand was too long and now Berrettini has bis first advantage in this exchange. Alcaraz is kicking himself! He had a break point and went for the kill with a back hand to one that kicked up into his body. Maybe it was rushed but that was a handy second serve from Berrettini. Deuce with the third set square at 1-1. Berrettini now with upper hand. The commentators suggest that \u201cboth have played good tennis, but neither have played great tennis\u201d. I\u2019d go along with that. This is waiting for someone to grab the initiatve. Alcaraz holds his serve to make it 1-1 before Berrettini takes a 30-0 lead with his serve. Rune levels it on Court 1. A bewildering match continues as Rune holds serve to make it 4-4 in the third set,. He lost the first set to Dimitrov 3-6 but then won the second set tiebreaker. Now, into the third set, neither man is giving any ground. 1-0 Berrettini. He had to stretch there after Alcaraz sent one back that clipped the net. Good feet meant Berrettini was able to reach and dink a soft shot up and over from close range. A monster serve from Berrettini \u2013 not the first time I\u2019ve typed that \u2013 sees him take a 30-15 lead. They then rally and he wins the point. 40-15. Serving for the first game. A 6-3 win apiece has Alcaraz and Berrettini locked at 1-1. The Italian to serve first in this third set. Alcaraz gets it with a drop shot. That particular stroke was causing him problems in the first set that he lost 3-6. He was taking them from far too deep. This set he\u2019s picked his moments. He\u2019s now cantered a 6-3 set win and appears to have the bit between his teeth. 101mp/h. That\u2019s the speed of Alcaraz\u2019s inside out forehand winner that couldn\u2019t have been better placed in the corner. What a shot. 40-0. Berrettini\u2019s serve is still a threat. He\u2019s winning points on 70% of his first serves but only landing 69% of them. When they find their mark he\u2019s a force and he\u2019s held that game to make it 3-5 in the second. Alcaraz serving for the set. Berrettini is doing a lot more running. I wonder if that will be decisive if we go the distance. Another sumptuous drop shot \u2013 from well inside the baseline \u2013 from Alcaraz has his opponent scampering almost the length of the court. He can\u2019t reach it and goes 15-0 down. Two more impressive shots, including another drop, makes it 40-0 before he closes out the game with a string serve. Alcaraz now leads 5-2. Berrettini gets back to basics. When he nails his first serve he\u2019s close to unplayable. Clinical to make it 2-4 in the second. Alcaraz into a 4-1 lead. The Spaniard has rediscovered his touch. Gone are those ambitious drop shots from the back of the baseline. Now opting to accelerate through the shot. He looks much more assured when he\u2019s giving it a good ol\u2019 fashioned tonk. Mind you, still plenty of touch on show. Rune takes the second set! What remarkable spirit shown by the Dane. He clinched the second set tiebreak 8-6. That game against Dimitrov is now all square at 1-1. 40-0. Alcaraz has found his radar with his serve. that\u2019s 10 points in a row for the Spaniard as well. My mistake! I misread that. Alcaraz broke Berrettini and now has the advantage. He leads 3-1 and is serving well. Slowing down on that latest serve, getting it to kick off the surface. 30-0 up and looking good. Alcaraz holds. Both have been put under pressure on their own serve. Both have held their nerve. 2-1. I\u2019ve committed to Alcaraz v Berrettini but if you\u2019re able, check out this crackerjack match. Rune leads the second set tiebreak 7-6 after losing the first set 3-6. Alcaraz has gone round the pole! First of all, how\u2019s he reached that? Second of all, how\u2019s he managed to steer that lunging backhand round the pole and land it in court? Outrageous shot. Berrettini holds. He resists the fightback with two monster serves. That part of his game is thrumming along rather nice. Alcaraz needs to find a way to combat it. I thought he had but the Italian has discovered a second gear. What a point! Alcaraz now has the chance to break. Two monster forehands from both is followed by a delicate touch from the No 1 seed. Berrettini can\u2019t quite get it. But he hammers down a cracking serve to take it to deuce. That was a big point. This one goes on and on. Is that the sixth or seventh deuce? Hard to keep track. Just when you think Alcaraz has the initiative Berrettini replies. But eventually, the No 1 seed holds and takes a 1-0 lead in this set. But Alcaraz slams a forehand winner. My goodness this is tennis of the highest quality to take it to deuce. They are hammering the ball. Berrettini is growing. That is a remarkable backhand down the line to give him a 30-40 lead. Just sublime. Berrettini goes down. Another player slips on the thin grass at the baseline. Alcaraz goes across to see if he\u2019s OK. He is, so they carry on. 15-15 thanks to a slickl backhand drop and follow up from Berrettini. 30-15 after a booming serve from Alcaraz. Back at Court 1, 20-year-old Rune has fought back against Dimitrov. The young Dane has taken a 6-5 lead in the second set. He lost the first 3-6 but has refused to lie down. Set, Berrettini. Well now. That\u2019s shaken things up. Booming serves and impressive stroke play at the baseline means the Italian underdog has nudged ahead. And you know what, that\u2019s no fluke. He\u2019s fully deserved that. Deuce. An ace handed Berrettini a set point but Alcaraz chased down two returns in either corner and kept the game, and set, alive. Class from Alcaraz. He squares the game with a cross-court forehand that sat up and begged to be spanked. He duly obliged. 30-30. Alcaraz seems to be unraveling. OK, maybe that\u2019s hyperbolic, but what on earth was he thinking there? The shot from Berrettini defects off the net and that gives Alcaraz the time to run around and take it on the forehand. But rather than whack it he tries a drop from behind the baseline. It does\u2019t clear the net and now, with a 5-3 lead in the set, Berrettini is 15-0 up. Berrettini breaks Alcaraz! Massive moment in this set. Alcaraz challenges but his driving shot is wide. Berrettini has two break points. Some poor shot selection by Alcaraz in that game \u2013 some soft touches when more force would have been the wiser option. An overhead slam from Berrettini gives him the chance to take control. Berrettini holds. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised and yet I am. What fortitude from the Italian. Just when I think he\u2019s about to break he holds. 4-3 up after winning that battle at deuce. Strong forehand and delicate touches on the slice backhand. This is a contest. Be still my beating heart! That is some drop shot from Berrettini. He\u2019s playing so well. Alcaraz just couldn\u2019t reach it and we go to deuce. Lovely tennis. Alcaraz is definitely getting the read of Berrettini\u2019s serve. They\u2019re locked at 30-30 but it feels that the No 1 see is reading his first serve and getting on top of his second. He\u2019s now 30-40 up after Berrettini over cooks a booming inside out forehand. Dimitrov has broken Rune and now leads 4-2. The 21st ranked Bulgarian is taking control of this match. He\u2019s got the No. 6 Dane on the ropes after winning the first set 6-3. Berrettini holds and has a bounce in his step. Alcaraz sends the return long so the Italian leads 3-2. But Alcaraz is getting a good sight of his serve. I think a break is forming over the horizon. Backhand slam! Berrettini is here to play. That doubler backhand winner into the corner had smoke on it. Alcaraz then fails to clear the net to give the Italian a 40-15 lead. But the Spaniard holds his balance to send a backhand of his own screaming down the line. He then gets it it deuce. Cracking tennis from both men. Game Alcaraz. A love game as Berrettini\u2019s back hand slice hits the net. 2-2 in the first. Berrettini suited to grass. So say the commentators who point out that the Italian\u2019s serve kicks off the skidding surface and makes life tricky for the opposition. He\u2019s just fallen victim though to a delicious drop from Alcaraz. The Spaniard is 40-0 up. Thanks Dan! Another Dan here. Silky Alcaraz versus the upstart Berrettini. Can the Italian shake off the disappointment from last year? He\u2019s just gone 2-1 up in the first set and I\u2019m all in. Rune holds to love in the opening game of set two, and with that, my watch is over. Here\u2019s Daniel Gallan to coax you through the remainder of the day \u2013 thanks all for your company and comments. Peace. Berrettini and Alcaraz are away, the former holding in game one. It\u2019s so great to see him back \u2013 I can\u2019t for a second imagine the frustration of being an injured sportsman \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to see how he can win today, or any major, without growing himself a drive backhand. Every other aspect is in place, but if that one isn\u2019t by now, it seems unlikely it\u2019s going to be. Ruen makesd 15-40, frames a return and running in for it Dimitrov slips \u2026 gets up and makes a fine backhand volley! Superbly done! A service winner follows, but on advantage comes another terrific rally, ended when Rune lays a drop and Dimitrov nets. These two are really bringing the best out of each other, the Dane saving a second with point with a soft-handed volley. But then he nets and that\u2019s the first set 6-3, Dimitrov playing the biggest points better; I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next because that was excellent - those nine games took 54 minutes. \u201cWhat do you get if you cross a tennis player with a four cornered garment?\u201d responds Jake Bundy. \u201cSurely the answer is Poncho Gonzales?\u201d Ha! I don\u2019rt think a poncho is mandatorily four-cornered, but. How often do we see that? One player fails to break, then other does break, Dimitrov making 15-40 and going long, then slipping \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t matter because Rune goes long. Babyfed leads 5-3 and will now serve for set one. Here come Alcaraz and Berrettini\u2026 Dimitrov annihilates down an ace, and that\u2019s a massive hold for 4-3 in the first. However it\u2019s worth noting that Rune, who\u2019s not played much on grass, looks better acclimatised than both Medvedev and Tsitsipas. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s better than either at this point, but I do think he will be before very long. At 3-3, Dimitrov saves two break points, then up advantage again, Rune plays a fine volley \u2026 which the Bulgarian chases down to sprit a winner down the line! Then our commentator, praising the kick serve with which he makes advantage, tells us that 20 years ago, that wasn\u2019t possible, it was just slice, but the thicker grass has changed the game. I dare him to tell Stefan Edberg that. Anyhow, we go back and fourth through deuce \u2013 Dimitrov saves three break points \u2013 and we\u2019ve been going almost 10 minutes in the game. Next on Centre: Carlos Alcaraz [1] v Matteo Berrettini. Jabeur says she respects what Kvitova has done for women\u2019s tennis and beating her is huge. When she won the first set she told herself that was the start of the match because she knows you can take a 6-0 set off Kvitova then lost one by the same score. Rishi then tells her she has great support because she\u2019s so nice, and she explains that she\u2019s really grateful for it and hopes the crowd remember when she meets Rybakina. She wants her revenge for last term\u2019s final, and I urge you not to miss it. Jabeur greets Kvitova and the umpire then performs her leaping celebration. She meets Rybakina next in a repeat of last year\u2019s final, and that match should be exceedingly serious. Oh that\u2019s lovely! Down 0-30, Kvitova tries a drop, but Jabeur runs in to lift her riposte down the line and into the corner, raising three match points. This is an absolute hiding. Jabeur holds easily for 6-0 5-3 and is a game away from another quarter-final. This Dimitrov v Rune match is shaping up \u2013 it\u2019s a really good contest so far with the Bulgarian, who has the edge in guile, leading the Dane, who has the edge in power, 3-2 on serve. And on Centre, Kvitova has taken back a break so Jabeur leads her 6-0 4-3. \u201cSo disappointed by the BBC coverage of Eubanks,\u201d says Kavya McLoughlin. \u201cI heard a commentator the other day suggest that Eubanks\u2019 run was over after his third-round win. And today during the match the commentary was elitist and patronising. They clearly were expecting him to lose and kept talking about his background without explaining why it was that he was continually toe-to-toe with Tsitsipas. They should stick to commenting on the actual play instead of the narrative around it.\u201d I said yesterday that of all the sports I watch, the one that has most work to do in terms of the sophistication of its coverage is tennis, which ignores so much tactical and strategic complexity. I was watching three matches during Eubanks v Tsitsipas so didn\u2019t notice the commentary, although I did learn off the radio that he\u2019s been working as an analyst Tennis TV and thinks he\u2019s become a better player as a consequence. \u201cTsitsipas is a bit soft to be a real killer,\u201d reckons James W. \u201cVery nice hair. Very nice backhand. Good on clay. Just doesn\u2019t have what it takes to win a slam. And with Alcaraz improving at his current rate, I don\u2019t see that changing in a hurry. Also, hashtag karma for knocking out Andy Murray in Murray\u2019s best form coming into the tournament in years. That match was decided on such fine margins with Murray\u2019s serve not broken till the final set and the same happened today. It\u2019s just Eubanks got all those fine margins this time.\u201d I agree and disagree here. I don\u2019t think Tsitsipas lacks the ruthlessness of a killer but do think his game has holes. His backhand is nice, as you say, but it isn\u2019t good, and it\u2019s hard to see him beating either Alcaraz or Djokovic in a major and it seems unlikely he can win one without doing that. Jabeur breaks again and Kvitova, who \u2013 inexplicably in mine \u2013 was favourite for this match, can\u2019t get near her. She leads 6-0 4-1. What do you get if you cross a tennis player with a four-cornered garment? Stefanos Tsitsitpas. \u201cCan\u2019t say I agree that Tsitsipas dominated the match,\u201d writes John Graham. \u201cEubanks was always in it and deserved the win. He\u2019ll be the crowd favourite to beat Medvedev, that\u2019s for sure, great on court personality too.\u201d Eubanks sort of said it himself afterwards \u2013 he won because he managed to win the key moments \u2013 and two of those were Tsitsipas doubles. Of course he deserved to progress \u2013 there\u2019s a metric devised for measuring that precise aspect known as the score \u2013 but in terms of general play, you could see why one is five in the world and one is 43. Dimitrov serves an ace at 40-15, it\u2019s called out, and he opts not to challenge \u2013 an error as it was in. Shortly afterwards, he\u2019s down advantage, saving the situation with a service winner down the middle before prevailing in a net exchange. He leads Rune 1-0 while Jabeur consolidates for 6-0 3-1. Serving at 3o-40, Kvitova thinks she\u2019s made deuce when a Jabeur backhand is called out. But a challenge shows it was in, just, a double follows \u2013 Kvitova\u2019s fourth of the match \u2013 and that\u2019s the break! This is five to over now, and not the match I was expecting or hoping for. Jabeur 6-0 2-1 Kvitova On No1, Dimitrov and Rune are almost ready to go while, on Centre, Kvitova tries to settle herself, holding at the start of set two before Jabeur does likewise. Two things I learnt while breaking: 1) Hubert Hurkacz likes to go as \u201cHuby\u201d and 2) Novak Djokovic had a haircut just before he went onto court. No wonder he lost the first set of the day, he must\u2019ve been itchy as hell. Thanks Dominic and hi again. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen a player as totally tennised as Tsitsipas there. By which I mean he dominated that match, but a point lost here and there \u2013 kept Eubanks in it, so he was still around to hit a seam in the decider. That double in the second-set tiebreak will, I\u2019m certain, stay with him a while, and his quest for debut major \u2013 unlikely top be this one, in fairness \u2013 continues. A slight interlude in proceedings on the main courts, then, and a perfect chance to hand back over to Daniel Harris. You haven\u2019t missed much, Dan \u2026 Jabeur takes the first set 6-0 against Kvitova. It took little more than 20 minutes. The two-time champion has some serious thinking to do. An email from Johan Denis on Eubanks: 2 days ago I wrote your colleague Sarah Rendell a message at the beginning of the match between Eubanks and O\u2019Connell. I wrote I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him beat Tsitsipas. But to be honest... I would bet against him now! Guess Medvedev is really focused to go further here and will be able to make the semis. And recently he had an encounter with Eubanks and he will not underestimate the guy. But anyway... what a tournament Eubanks has had so far. What a delightful interview from Eubanks. He\u2019s got charisma in spades, as well as a good dash of modesty. Eubanks said a while back that he \u2018hated playing on grass\u2019 \u2026 \u2018those words will never come out of my mouth again\u2019, he vows, speaking to the BBC just now. While we\u2019re catching our breath after that match, Ons Jabeur has taken to Centre Court against Petra Kvitova and taken a rapid 4-0 first set lead. Meanwhile, here\u2019s the report on Djokovic\u2019s earlier win from our man Tumaini Carayol at the All England Club. Eubanks stands and salutes the Wimbledon faithful and puts his hands to his face. He can barely believe what he\u2019s achieved this afternoon. That final game was far from perfect, but he muscled a number of forehand winners to keep Tsitsipas at bay. The No 5 seed bows out. What a performance from this man! The Wimbledon debutant storms into the quarter-finals \u2026 and who\u2019d bet against him to go further? A remarkable victory against the (almost) indefatigable Tsitispas. Eubanks isn\u2019t having it all his own way in this vital game. Tsitipas botches a break point opportunity, though, and it\u2019s deuce. And it\u2019s tense. A cakewalk in the second set for Sabalenka, who shoots into the quarter-finals at breakneck speed. Tougher assignments await, but that\u2019s an impressive outing. Tsitispas looks agitated, perhaps a feeling that\u2019s being exacerbated by the pure theatre of Eubanks\u2019 responses to every point won. The American wheels away after a volleyed winner to more whoops from the crowd. But despite getting to within two points of the match, Eubanks can\u2019t contain his opponent\u2019s serve. 5-4 and Eubanks to serve for the match It\u2019s a hold. And a very big hold from Eubanks, to make it 5-3 and pile the pressure on Tsitsipas. A massive service game for him now. You sense the crowd on No 2 court are with the American. But is hubris getting the better of him? Some sloppy stuff on serve sees him 0-30 down \u2026 before the inevitable jackhammer of a forehand winner. Back to 30-30. Tsitispas v Eubanks is now resembling that scene in Star Wars when Anakin and Obi-Wan are floating along a river of lava, desperately aiming blows at each other, evading them, with the balance of power swinging this way and that. Eubanks has broken immediately back! He completes it with a gleeful backhand down the line, which is followed by a cup of the ear. This boy is loving life right now. Humility from the man Djoko here. Oh my. Tsitsipas breaks back. Strap yourselves in, guys and girls, this one\u2019s going DEEP. Does somebody want to grab Chris Eubanks and tell him this is a Wimbledon fourth round deciding set? He looks so relaxed. That blissful sense of blithe may have got the better of him in consecutive points, serving at 3-2, however, as he drops from 30-0 to 30-40. Unforced errors, Christopher, unforced errors. Sabalenka breaks the Alexandrova serve at the vital moment and bags herself the first set, 6-4. She looks good value for the quarters. Djokovic described that match as \u2018not very enjoyable\u2019 and the prospect of facing Hurkacz\u2019s serve as \u2018miserable\u2019. Cheer up, Novak, you\u2019re in the last eight mate. Eubanks smashes a serve down the T to extend his fifth set lead to 3-1, still with that break. HE. IS. INEVITABLE. \u2018Not at his very best,\u2019 says the BBC\u2019s Tim Henman, but isn\u2019t that part of the impenetrable force that is Djokovic? He\u2019ll meet Rublev in the quarter-final tomorrow and, sure, will have to improve to continue his ridiculous Wimbledon winning streak (32 matches and counting). Just pivoting back to Centre Court to see if Novak Djokovic can serve this out for yet another Wimbledon quarter-final appearance. Hot take: I reckon he can. Game Eubanks. A brutal backline down the line prompts a gleaming smile at the changeover. Tsitsipas is broken at the first time of asking in this deciding set. My goodness. Sabalenka is serving to remain in the first set on No 1 Court. Hurkacz is serving to stay in the match on Centre. No 2 Court is where the action is right now, though. Tsitsipas recovers from a bassline stumble to win a vital point on serve via a delicate slice. After whipping up the crowd, he volleys into the net on the next point. Sublime to ridiculous. Chris Eubanks is playing in his first ever Wimbledon, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves. He\u2019s 27, so no rookie, but this is uncharted territory for the towering American. He\u2019s now pushed Tsitispas to deuce in the opening game of the fifth set. Yep, it\u2019s a third five-setter for the big Greek in four rounds at Wimbledon 2023. Thiem and Murray fell victim in the previous two. Can Eubanks cause a major upset and win this set to reach an unlikely quarter-final? Over on Centre, Hurkacz has been broken by Djokovic in the fourth set and might not be long for this tournament now \u2026 Thanks Daniel. And what a moment to take over, as Eubanks wallops a serve down to take the second set 6-4! Tsitsipas is going the distance once again at Wimbledon. Right, at this injudicious juncture I must leave for the school run; here\u2019s Dominic Booth to nurse you through the next hour. Eubanks is starting to make an impression on the Tsitsipas serve now, and at 30-all he wins another net exchange, noising up the crowd before playing break point. Tsitsipas serves into the net \u2026 then follows it with a wide one, and in 90 seconds, the American will serve for a decider at 5-4 in the fourth! The doubles are costing the Greek, while Eubanks is starting to believe, pushing the pace for the first time in the match! Hurkacz is playing with far greater conviction than last evening, forging in front in the fourth at 3-2; Djokovic isn\u2019t getting near his serve at the moment, and he\u2019s also winning some of the longer rallies \u2013 not something that was happening last evening. Meantime, Eubanks and Tsitsipas are 4-4 in the third, Tsitsipas leading 2-1, while Sabalenka leads Alexandrova 3-2 in the first, on serve. Now then: with Tsitsipas serving at 2-1, 3-3 and 30-all, Eubanks wins a net exchange for break point \u2026 but when he chip-charges, a forehand pass quickly screeches by him and from there, the number five seed quickly cleans up. On Centre, meanwhile, Hurkacz and Djokovic are 2-2 in the fourth, and on No1, Alexandrova and Sabalenka are 2-2. Interesting: when she was 12, Alexandrova played a tournament in the Czech Republic, discovered the tennis set-up there was good and much better than in Russia \u2026 so her dad moved their whole family there. I imagine he\u2019s pleased with the call. Sabalenka and Alexandrova \u2013 playing her first grad slam round four \u2013 begin with a hold apiece, likewise Djokovic and Hurkacz in their set four. It\u2019ts a minor tweak because all that happened yesterday was Hurkacz lost two tie-breaks to six, but I think he\u2019s attacking the big points with greater enterprise today and Djokovic, probably the best returner we\u2019ve ever seen, has won four points on his serve since we resumed. Meantime, Tsitsipas, 2-1 up on Eubanks, holds for 3-2 in the third. Hurkacz holds for a 6-5 lead in set three then, at 1530, strokes a gloooorious backhand winner down the line, raising two set points! Djokovic saves the first with a fine serve out wide \u2013 he came in behind that \u2013 then, although Hurkacz doesn\u2019t properly attack a second delivery, he stomps into court, punishes a forehand into the corner, which means that\u2019s the break and with it the set! Hurkacz (6)6-7 (6)6-7 7-5 Djokovic Alexandrova and Sabalenka appear onto Court 1 and will be away soon. I guess they weren\u2019t ready when the last match ended unexpectedly early, but they\u2019re good to go now. Back on Court 2 it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that Eubanks cannot beat Tsitsipas unless Tsitsipas beats himself; the Greek breaks again, this time to 15, thanks to a forehand winner, and he now leads 6-3 6-7 6-3! Hubert Hurkacz is one of my favourite tennising names, and he holds again for a 5-4 lead in set three. The problem he has is that Djokovic\u2019s tiebreak form is absurd \u2013 six out of six in Paris, winning 42 out of 55 points, and five out of five here, winning 35 out of 60 points. Hurkacz holds again for 4-3 in the third and we look headed for another breaker; Tsitsipas consolidates in double-quick time, to lead Eubanks 6-3 6-7 4-2. Oh dear, now it\u2019s Eubanks\u2019 go to butcher himself with a double, served at 2-2 30-40; it gives Tsitsipas the break and we\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest it\u2019s retrievable. He\u2019s three holds away from a 2-1 lead. Hurkacz gets 15-30 on the Djokovic serve before Djokovic closes out for 2-2 in the third having won the first two sets on breakers. In co-comms, Mac and Henman are asked how they\u2019d play him; neither has any ideas but Hurkacz is playing better today than yesterday \u2013 the break must\u2019ve come at a good time for him because he was so tentative then. And it\u2019s also 2-2 on Court 2, Tsitsipas and Eubanks having split the first two sets. It is odd that Medvedev is a major champion and number three in the world, but no one expects him to win here. I could see him beating Tsitsipas, perhaps, if that ends up being the match, but I can\u2019t see any way he gets by Alcaraz or Djokovic, who\u2019ll get his serve back and keep him moving. Next on Court 1: Ekaterina Alexandrova [21] v Aryna Sabalenka [2]. On Centre, Djokovic and Hurkacz are away in set three, Djokovic having taken two breakers last evening. Meantime, Medvedev says he thought Lehecka was OK as often, he\u2019s not feeling good then he wins a point, a game or a break and realises it\u2019s fine. This is his fifth Wimbledon and his first quarter-final, but he\u2019s never lost on Court 1 so wants to stay there. On which point, Eubanks finds big serves when he needs them and, after making almost no impression on the Tsitsipas serve \u2013 no break points, the Greek winning 95% of first-delivery points and 73% of second \u2013 a double is the difference in the breaker and we\u2019re at one set-all! Ach, Medvedev cedes two set points, takes his third, and Lehecka can\u2019t go on. He\u2019ll be back though \u2013 he\u2019s got massive weapons and is just coming into his own \u2013 but for now, disappointment. Medvedev meets Eubanks or Tsitsipas next. Leading 3-2, Tsitsipas hoists a lob that looks to have turned the rally in his favour, but Eubanks clumps a forehand into the tape and the ball drops over to keep us on serve \u2026 then Tsitsipas sends down a double and at 5-3, Eubanks is two points from the set. Tsisipas closes to 4-5, but if he can\u2019t take back the mini-break, we\u2019re at 1-1\u2026. A hold apiece on Court 2, so Tsitsipas and Eubanks will play a second-set breaker, Tsitsipas having taken the first 6-3; Medvedev, meanwhile, has broken Lehecka again and will shortly serve for a 2-0 lead at 5-2 in the second. Mervyn King, by the way, has perhaps the greatest nickname in all sport \u2013 though feel free to correct me if you think I\u2019m wrong. Really, he should be Mervyn \u201cThe\u201d King, but Mervyn \u201cThe King\u201d King is also tremendous. For a moment, I was excited. They must\u2019ve copied the wrong address off the rolodex. Lehecka seems to be moving better now, saving four break points at 3-6 1-3 before two serve-volleys close out the game and keep him in touch in the second set. Meantime, Djokovic and Hurkacz prepare to walk out on centre while Eubanks makes 5-5 having lost the first to Tsitsipas 6-3. We\u2019re about to get going again on Court 1, the woman who was struggling in reasonable shape. Godspeed, old mate. A forehand winner, stepping into court to attack a short ball, gives Tsitsipas break point at 6-3 4-3, but Eubanks finds a big first serve then allows a backhand to drop fractionally wide \u2013 that\u2019s good judgment and a backhand volley at the net keeps us on serve in set two, just. Tsitsipas now leads Eubanks 6-3 3-3 while, on No1, there\u2019s a medical emergency in the crowd. So the match pauses and Lechecka drops to his haunches, which suggests his toe isn\u2019t giving his as much grief as before. Next on Centre but not before 2.30pm BST: Novak Djokovic [2] 7-6(6) 7-6(6) Hubert Hurkacz [17]. Rybakina feels bad for Haddad Maia but is glad to be through and felt she was hitting the ball well. She\u2019ll probably have today off then get back to it tomorrow, and finally, we learn that she\u2019s into roller coasters and also wants a shy at skydiving, but her coach won\u2019t let her. Rybakina meets Jabeur or Kvitova next and that\u2019s such a shame \u2013 for Haddad Maia but also for us because this could\u2019ve been a jazzer. Oh man, Haddad Maia returns, wants to continue, and she\u2019s almost in tears as Rybakina holds to love. This is going to be it, I\u2019m afraid, and Rybakina comes around to her side to console her as she defaults. She\u2019ll be back \u2013 she\u2019s made huge strides this season \u2013 but we can well understand her distress, playing on Centre Court against the champ while in the form of her life. Lehecka isn\u2019t at all happy, wincing as he plays. I imagine he\u2019ll have taken something for the pain and will be waiting for it to kick in; in the meantime, he\u2019ll be grateful that Medvedev plays a poor game which allows him to hold through deuce for 1-0 in set two. Poor Haddad Maia looked in a lot of discomfort; let\u2019s hope she can get herself sorted. Ach, no sooner is Lehecka back than Haddad Maia has the trainer out \u2013 she seems to have a lower back complaint and leaves the court to be treated in private. Rybakina leads 3-1. Rybakina earns a break point and Haddad Maia nets; the champ leads 3-1 while, on Centre, Tsitsipas serves out to lead Eubanks 6-3. He\u2019s playing well and his opponent hasn\u2019t yet got going. The issue is between the little and adjacent toe. It could be very sore there, but hopefully he takes a painkiller and is good enough to go. Leheckha, though, didn\u2019t properly compete for the last two points and has a problem so opts to take a medical timeout, removing his shoe and sock. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s no biggie. Medvedev serves out to love for a 6-4 set, and slowly, he\u2019s growing into this tournament. It seems unlikely that he\u2019s able to beat Alcaraz in a semi, but if he serves well you never know. Lehecka is asked to save a set point but he does it well with a big first serve and Medvedev must now sort it on his own delivery at 5-4; on Centre, Haddad Maia holds for 1-1, while Tsitsipas leads Eubanks 4-2. On No1, a patron catches a stray ball in his Pimms, looking as pleased with himself as one might. Medvedev holds for 5-3, so Lehecka will now serve to stay in set one, while Tsitsipas leads eubanks 3-2 with a break. On Centre, Haddad Maia and Rybakina are away. This could easily be the match of the day because both have power, touch and form; the champ holds for 1-0. Eubanks goes long on the forehand and that\u2019s a break to love for Tsitsipas which might just mean 1-0 \u2013 Murray, one of the greatest returners of all time, managed one against him in five sets. Medvedev leads Lehecka 4-2 now. \u201cLeheckha has the weapons \u2013 big serve and forehand, really clean ball-striker \u2013 and keeps getting close against the big guys but can\u2019t get over the line.\u201d says Coach Calv. I imagine Tsitsipas will be feeling much better about himself after toughing out that win over Murray. He knows his game isn\u2019t quite grass-court ready, but will feel that he\u2019s getting closer. Eubanks and Tsitsipas are away already, Eubanks holding in the first game. \u201cEubanks is on serious form and swinging,\u201d says Calv Betton. \u201cHe\u2019s massive, huge serve, swings at both groundstrokes, and he\u2019s a brilliant lad. I\u2019m still not convinced by Tsitsipas, but he probably edges it.\u201d Today\u2019s thing I\u2019m currently enjoying: Algorithm Party by Roy, or PJ Smith as he\u2019s also known. The voice is a kind of Scouse Irvine Welsh, though I\u2019m generally uncomfortable comparing things to other things because each is its own entity. Feel free to send in your own suggestions. One thing about Andreeva, though: she\u2019s very slight. Of course, she\u2019ll grow and thicken, but with the likes of Sabalenka and Rybakina about, she\u2019ll need a plan for facing immense power, and find a kill-shot of her own. On No1, Medvedev has broken Lehecka immediately ands now leads 2-1. Next on No2: Christopher Eubanks v Stefanos Tsitsipas [5]. Andreeva, though. after showing terrifying composure through the tournament, lost it a bit when the going got tough, and she\u2019ll be miles better for the experience. I can\u2019t wait to see where she goes from here. Keys doesn\u2019t know how she turned that around, and that she was playing a brilliant player under no pressure. She knew she needed to take a chance to break if she got one, then when she did she tried to maintain momentum, and didn\u2019t want to be the person who lost to a teenager making their first quarter. She hoped her many many years on tour would help her out, and this is her first Wimbledon quarter since 2015. Asked if she enjoyed the match \u2013 it was a jazzer \u2013 at one point she reminded herself that this is where she wants to be, and much as I wanted to see Andreeva progress, I\u2019m delighted that Keys is back going deep. If she lkeps playing like she did at the end, she\u2019s a handful for anyone. That\u2019s a brilliant win for Keys, who found herself at the last moment \u2013 she meets Sabalenka or Alexandrova next. But let\u2019s not forget Andreeva, who slinks off court quicksmart; she\u2019s lit up this tournament, and she\u2019s going to light up our world for many years to come. Andreeva squeals as Keys nets a return, but when she challenges the ball was well out. Here comes match point again, this time on a second serve\u2026 Oh no! Serving at advantage, Andreeva takes exception to a superb Keys volley and, overbalancing, brings her racket over her head and drops it into the turf. It\u2019s really no big deal, but the umpire penalises her and, because she hurled it earlier, she\u2019s penalised a point meaning she\u2019s now match point down. She complains to the umpire, saying she slipped, which she did, but she did also introduce graphite to grass, just with no venom. And on No2, Keys seals her hold and at 5-2 is a game from an improbable win while, returning to her chair, Andreeva refrains from tossing her racket \u2013 just. She\u2019s feeling it. On No1, Medvedev and Lehecka are out knocking up. \u2026but a big serve opens up the point for Keys, though she too has to rely on a net cord \u2013 unnecessarily so \u2013 before finishing the point. Keys is just taking a little bit longer over her shots, I think, getting to the ball then striking. But at 30-15 she\u2019s a little slow to the ball and nets a slice; half a chance for Andreeva. And after a net cord followed by a drop, it\u2019s a proper chance, a break-back point at 30-40\u2026 Andreeva guts \u2013 gutses? \u2013 out a hold for 2-4, and the pressure on Keys ratchets up. She\u2019s two holds from the last eight. Ah man, Andreeva\u2019s crying in her chair at change of ends, and I guess she\u2019s not had to contend with that much sporting adversity so far, probably thought this match was hers. Still, though, she\u2019s going stratospheric, and even if this isn\u2019t her time, her time is coming. A hold apiece and, at 1-4, Andreeva is running out of road. But, on the plus side: Keys holds through deuce \u2013 Andreeva isn\u2019t trying many drops now \u2013 and leads 3-0 in the decider. Goodness me. A poor drop allows Keys to charge in and despatch a forehand winner; it gives her 0-40, and I wonder if this is the match here. Andreeva saves on break point, but a tame double comes next, and just as her opponent paused to rethink things, now she needs to \u2013 before it\u2019s too late. Keys finds herself break point down, but averts the immediate danger with a big serve and forehand combo. She does need to save another, but then closes out for 1-0 and, for the first time, we\u2019re seeing Andreeva struggling for ideas. Roughly 25 minutes from now, Daniil Medvedev and Jiri Lehecka will be out on No1 Court. This is shaping up into a day. A serve out wide, a long return, and Keys, who was a point away from trailing 6-3 5-1 is now level in the match at 3-6 7-6(4)! She was so close to elimination but worked out a plan just in time and her power is currently dictating to Andreeva\u2019s consistency. Oh, and at the end of that breaker, Andreeva chucks her racket over to her chair \u2013 the first sign of proper emotion from her \u2013 for which she\u2019s warned. I cannot wait for this decider. But then Andreeva lands a ball on the line, it doesn\u2019t bounce, and there\u2019s the mini-break back \u2026 except two big forehands then a solid service-point give Keys 6-4, and she now has two points for a decider! Keys is dominating now, planting her feet and sending forehands to the corners while intimating that she might come in \u2013 20 times in set two versus six in set one. She leads4-2. Aha, on the start-time point, this from today\u2019s Times: Seemingly oblivious to the fact that the average length of tennis matches is increasing \u2014 due both to the improved physicality of the players and the slowing down of surfaces \u2014 Wimbledon organisers pandered to the BBC two years ago by changing the Centre Court start time and introducing 20-minute breaks between matches. They may not like to admit this in public but it is acknowledged privately that this was done to improve the chances of play extending into the evening for a prime-time audience without introducing a specific night session.\u201d Another solid hold from Keys, and this breaker could be something \u2026 which it already is, Andreeva dictating on the forehand only to watch a booming forehand whistle past her, cross-court for an immediate mini-break. Andreeva holds for 6-3 6-5, securing herself a tiebreaker \u2013 at least. Keys will now serve to stay in the match for a second time. Yeah, here she is. Well done Madison Keys. She plays another good game for 5-5 and has done well to work her way back into a match that looked like it was forsaking her. A hold apiece leaves us at 5-4 Andreeva, meaning Keys will now serve to stay in the match. And, though she\u2019s improved the last 10 minutes, getting broken here would, I\u2019m afraid, be the absolute height of her. More good play from Keys makes 15-40, but she misses an admittedly tricky putaway at the net but HAVE AN ABSOLUTE LOOK! Dominating the next rally, Keys finds herself in trouble when Andreeva sends a terrific riposte across her that looks like it\u2019s bouncing away from her backhand \u2026. so she pats a gentle left-hander back across the net! that\u2019s absolutely brilliant, securing the break-back, and has she woken up just in time? Andreeva leads 6-3 4-3. Again, Keys finds herself down break point, Andreeva\u2019s forehand cross-court setting up the opportunity. But this time, she spanks a backhand winner down the line, and needs more of them, many more, if she\u2019s to make a match of this. in fairness, I know exactly how she feels, because I had my arse handed to me by a bunch of 15-year-old boys playing back-garden Wembley on Shabbat \u2013 though, in fairness, I\u2019d had a fairly hectic relaxing afternoon prior to. Keys closes out really well for 3-6 2-4, and that was much better from her. Keys tries her best to thrash away but Andreeva is just so competent, doing the right things at the right time and holding to 15. She leads 6-3 4-1 and a comeback looks inconceivable \u2013 partly because Keys doesn\u2019t appear tp have the minerals, but also because she\u2019s just so solid. No one can collapse like Maddy, but she just about hangs onto her serve, winning her first game in eight, to keep the deficit at a set and a break. Meantime, Andreeva goes about her business. Keys rustles up a break point but then nets a forehand while, on the other side of the net, Andreeva keeps doing what she\u2019s doing, calmly dictating play with no outward sign of nerves. She\u2019s won seven games on the spin now and leads 6-3 3-0. She\u2019s an absolute superstar, and we\u2019ll be talking about this run for decades. Keys can\u2019t decide whether to try and end rallies quickly by going for winners, or accept the need to be patient and get moving. As such, she\u2019s falling in between the two approaches and getting nowhere, soon 0-40 down in a game you feel she must win. She manages to save one break point, but coming to the net, Andreeva whacks a forehand by her ankles, and in her first grass-court tournament is four holds away from the last eight! It\u2019s windy out on Court 2, which suits Andreeva whose footwork is better and who\u2019s trying to do less with the ball. And when Keys unloads a pair of monstrous forehands for deuce, Andreeva quickly closes out, ending the game with a drop shot-lob combo of rare deftness. She leads 6-3 1-0. Leading 40-30, Keys sets up a volley with a really good slice, only to net, then on deuce Andreeva disburses another fine backhand winner down the line; set point. And when Keys nets a again, a forehand slapped into the tape, that\u2019s the first set to Andreeva, 6-3 after being broken at the start. Did I mention she\u2019s 16? Also going on: \u201cThe late starts on the show courts are absolutely bonkers,\u201d reckons Darragh Morrissey. \u201cI can only assume they start late so their esteemed guests in the corporate seats can stuff their bellies full of delicious lunch and then they saunter out to the court for a 1:40 start. It\u2019s basically an acknowledgement that the special guests watching are more important than the stars they are there to see. It has to be pushed forward to 12pm for next year.\u201d Yes, my guess is also there\u2019s a corporate trough angle, not because people are more important than tennis but because money is. A lovely deft drop earns Keys a break-back point, but she goes at a serve that\u2019s not there to be whumped sending the ball long and plenty, then Andreeva nails a backhand winner down the line and closes out from there. She leads 5-3 having won five of the last six games, and this is just incredible behaviour. Andreeva is into this now, raising two break points. But she stands up a drop that Keys really should put away \u2026 except instead, the ball is directed at her, leaving almost the whole court open, and a winner into the space gives her 4-3. She\u2019s 16! Leading 3-2, Keys arranges another break point, saved by Andreeva putting her on her bike and cleaning up when she tries a moon ball. She closes out for 3-3 and looks like she was born to be in this moment. Looking at today\u2019s schedule, it looks extremely possible that we end up with another unfinished contest overnight, which again raises the question as to why we don\u2019t start earlier. Just an hour extra on the show courts would make a difference, and just as the All England Club go to lengths to preserve the integrity of the tournament by keeping the roofs open if they possibly can, so they should by trying to ensure matches are done in a oner. A love hold from Andreeva makes it 2-2 and already the pattern of the match is set. If Keys can impose her power-game and control the rallies, she wins, but if Andreeva gets her moving so she can\u2019t plant her feet and bang, it\u2019s up for grabs. a hold to love gives Keys 3-2. Excellent from Andreeva, who misses two break-back points but nabs another through deuce and at 1-2, is on the board. Keys has started well and a double gives her 15-40; Andreeva saves one break point with a well-directed serve, but is then drawn to the net with a drop and, when she gets the ball back, passed. Keys leads 2-0 and I\u2019d love for this to be her moment. She\u2019s made one Grand Slam final, at Flushing Meadow in 2017, but overwhelmed by the occasion and her close mate, Sloane Stephens, standing on the other side of the net, she shrank. Shonuff, here\u2019s Calv Betton, our resident coach, with his thoughts on this one: Match will hinge on whether Keys can over power her. Andreeva is good but still a bit lightweight. If Keys lands her shots then she\u2019ll win, Andreeva is gonna be a star though.\u201d He\u2019ll be delighted to know I agree. If Keys plays well \u2013 and her win over Kostyuk in the last round was very impressive \u2013 I don\u2019t think this\u2019ll be that close. And she starts well, holding to love and securing the game with an ace. This time last year, Andreeva was ranked 834 in the world; she\u2019s now at 102. That is ridiculous, and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019ll ever have to qualify for a major again. Righto, our players are with us and knocking up. Keys had yesterday off while Andreeva had to fight hard for her passage against Potapova. Hi everyone and welcome to Wimbledon 2023 \u2013 day eight! It\u2019s not Manic Monday, no, but it remains an extremely manic Monday that has absolutely no one wishing it was Sunday \u2013 great though that was. We begin on Court 2, which will host a classic battle of power against consistency \u2013 with a twist. Madison Keys remains a terrific talent, but at 28 she\u2019s running out of time to realise her potential while, over the other side of the net, Mirra Andreeva is everything she is not \u2013 steady, focused, fearless \u2026 and 16-years-old! 16! Why, it\u2019s almost as though it\u2019s inessential to spend one\u2019s teenage years feasting on one\u2019s 90 Minutes, Wham Bars, Irn Bru bars, Astrobelts, Space Raiders, Chilli McCoys, Hooch, Scotch Bitter and Dunhill International. After that, the surging Christopher Eubanks faces Stefanos Tsitsipas, by which time we should be ready for action on Court 1, where Daniil Medvedev takes on Jiri Lehecka, who\u2019s bidding for a second straight major quarter-final. Opening proceedings on Centre, meanwhile, is an absolute weapons-grade match between Beatriz Haddad Maia and the defending champ Elena Rybakina, after which Novak Djokovic and Hubert Hurkacz play to a finish \u2013 Djokovic leads overnight by two sets to love. And goodness us, that\u2019s not even close to it. We\u2019ve also got Ekaterina Alexandrova v Aryna Sabalenka and what looks like a proper belter as Ons Jabeur ruckuses Petra Kvitova before, rounding out the day, the in-form Griggzy Dimitrov meets Holger Rune and the returning Mario Berrettini, beaten finalist in 2021, takes a shy at Carlos Alcaraz.

As new ailments frequently sprung up and old wounds failed to heal, his body was crumbling under the strain of professional tennis. He spent his days before the tournament considering whether it would be worthwhile to simply withdraw. Instead, he chose to play, tearing through the draw to reach the second week. On Monday, the Italian provided Carlos Alcaraz with one of the most difficult tests of his young career on the grass court, yet Alcaraz responded to the challenge supremely. After trailing by a set, the top seed recovered to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the first time in his career, defeating Berrettini 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. \u201cI\u2019m really, really happy to get through this amazing match. I\u2019m really happy to be able to play my first quarter-final here in Wimbledon. Really excited about it. Let\u2019s keep rolling,\u201d said Alcaraz. It is, perhaps, Alcaraz\u2019s best career grass-court victory and a signifier of the progress he continues to make on the surface. A former Wimbledon finalist in 2021, Berrettini has won four of his seven career ATP titles on grass and he is a rare player of this generation whose strengths are actually accentuated on this surface. After losing the opening set, the top seed stepped up and thoroughly outplayed him. Before the tournament, it seemed unlikely that the 27-year-old would play any role past the opening round. After an injury-ravaged 2022 season, which included being forced to withdraw from Wimbledon because of Covid, his issues worsened this season. Upon his return from an abdominal injury at the beginning of the grass season in Stuttgart, Berrettini was demolished 6-1, 6-2 by Lorenzo Sonego and he left the court in tears. After withdrawing from Queen\u2019s Club a week later, he doubted whether his body would last a match at Wimbledon. From being a non-entity at the start of the tournament, though, Berrettini\u2019s form exploded with straight sets wins over Alex de Minaur and Alexander Zverev. He stepped on to Centre Court against the top seed as one of the in-form players in the draw. As the Spaniard imposed his game, Berrettini\u2019s confidence was reflected in how readily he navigated difficult moments in opening service games, saving three break points in the first set. Each time Alcaraz loomed, Berrettini kept him at arm\u2019s length with a big serve or wicked forehand. Deep in the first set, it was Berrettini who took the first break. Despite trailing by a set, the world No 1 could still take solace from his level of play despite failing to take his opportunities. Against one of the best servers in the world, Alcaraz was able to impose pressure in most return games. He forced himself back into the match with more stellar returns, constantly taking the initiative with his explosive forehand and bringing Berrettini forward with his usual mixture of drop shots. His recovery included one of the shots of the tournament as he flicked a backhand around the net post at full sprint for a clean winner. Alcaraz broke serve early and saw out the set. As Alcaraz\u2019s game flowed, his far greater returning, athleticism, backhand and the freedom with which he struck his forehand marked the difference between them, and he stormed through the final three sets to secure a brilliant victory. Afterwards, Berrettini maintained perspective despite his disappointment: \u201cProbably in a few hours, a few days, I\u2019m going to appreciate even more what I did. I really thought about not playing two days before the tournament. So being in the fourth round and losing like this against Carlos, it\u2019s something I have to be proud of.\u201d Wednesday will mark the first time in the open era that two male players under the age of 21 face each other in a Wimbledon quarter-final as Alcaraz faces Holger Rune, his fellow 20\u2011year\u2011old. Rune, the sixth seed, also reached his first Wimbledon quarter-final by defeating Grigor Dimitrov 3-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4), 6-3. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about this match,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cWe shared a lot of great moments. We played together since we were 12 years old. We\u2019ve not texted each other, but obviously we know each other really well. Yeah, I\u2019m really excited about it. I think he\u2019s the same.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fd1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/10/united-airline-amsterdam-flight-diverted-airplane-food", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "United flight to Amsterdam reportedly diverted to Chicago over meal choice", "lead": "An unruly passenger was allegedly upset about the menu and raised a stink after plane took off from Houston", "author": "Lauren Aratani", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 20:44:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954253", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0a2bb30e679029a7379d3547f5034c32888400c9/0_130_2700_1620/500.jpg", "body": "A United Airlines flight heading from Houston to Amsterdam was diverted to Chicago after an unruly business class passenger interrupted the flight, reportedly because his first meal choice was unavailable. The flight took off at 4.20pm local time in Houston on Sunday, and was in Chicago airspace two hours into the flight. Flight tracking website Flightradar24 showed that the plane circled Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport as it had to use up fuel, known as dumping fuel, or it would have been too heavy to land. Aviation insider XJonNYC posted internal United communications on Twitter that reported a \u201cdisruptive [passenger] on board\u201d and a threat level of one, the lowest level of threat. In another tweet, he reported that the passenger seemed to be enraged over meal choice. In a statement to the Guardian, United said: \u201cUnited flight 20 from George Bush Intercontinental Airport to Amsterdam diverted to O\u2019Hare International Airport and landed safely following a passenger disturbance. Law enforcement met the aircraft at the gate and escorted the passenger off the plane. The aircraft then continued to Amsterdam.\u201d According to Flightrader24, the flight ended up landing just over three hours after its scheduled arrival, touching down at about 12.30pm local time in Amsterdam. The typical total flight time for the trip is nine hours and 30 minutes. While it is unclear exactly what meal the unruly passenger had gotten upset over, business class passengers on United are typically offered a full three-course meal in addition to more food throughout the flight. The airline has faced criticism that its in-flight meals had failed to return to pre-pandemic norms and it announced last year it was upgrading its business class fare. Travel review website Live and Let\u2019s Fly reported that business class passengers flying from Newark to Amsterdam had a choice between seared beef short rib, seared lemon grass salmon, or ricotta salata and wild honey manicotti as their main meal. A one-way business class seat on the Houston to Amsterdam United flight typically costs $6,927. The Federal Aviation Administration can impose fines on passengers for unruly behavior, up to $37,000 for each violation, with each incident having the potential for multiple violations. Passengers are also subject to being prosecuted on criminal charges. The International Air Transport Association reported earlier this year that unruly passenger incidents increased 47% in 2022 compared with the year before, with an incident occurring once every 568 flights."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fd2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/10/us-marines-david-berger-republican-abortion-protest", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US Marines without leader for first time in 150 years as Republican blocks nomination", "lead": "Gen David Berger steps down as Alabama senator stages months-long blockade of successor to protest over abortion policies", "author": "Joan E Greve in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 20:12:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954273", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9e163176d02db54f9e07db4a1d1e6afa612ff5c4/0_413_7575_4547/500.jpg", "body": "The commandant of the US Marine Corps, Gen David Berger, stepped down on Monday, leaving the military branch without a confirmed leader for the first time in more than 150 years. The vacancy comes as one Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, has staged a months-long blockade of Pentagon nominations to protest against the department\u2019s abortion policies. Berger\u2019s assistant commandant and potential successor, Gen Eric Smith, has stepped in as the acting leader of the marines while his nomination remains stalled in the Senate. Smith became the marines\u2019 first acting commandant since 1859, when Archibald Henderson died in office. Smith\u2019s nomination is one of more than 200 high-level Pentagon nominations that have already been affected by Tuberville\u2019s blockade. In February, Tuberville launched his campaign of obstruction in response to the Pentagon\u2019s new policy, enacted after the reversal of Roe v Wade, to cover travel costs for service members or service members\u2019 spouses who have to leave their state to access abortion care. The Senate generally confirms non-controversial nominees like Smith by unanimous consent, but any single senator\u2019s objection forces a floor vote. The laborious process of approving hundreds of stalled nominations via floor vote would probably take months, sparking criticism among Democrats that Tuberville\u2019s antics may jeopardize military readiness. \u201cWhat the senator is doing by holding these nominations, it\u2019s a threat to our national security. Period. That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing,\u201d the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said last month. \u201cThese are important nominations that we need, that the American people need to keep our country safe.\u201d Tuberville has rejected such criticism, writing in a Washington Post op-ed last month: \u201cMy hold is not affecting readiness. Acting officials are in each one of the positions that are due for a promotion. The hold affects only those at the very top \u2013 generals and flag officers. The people who actually fight are not affected at all.\u201d Tuberville shows no sign of abandoning his blockade, and the standoff could soon affect the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the highest-ranking US military officer, as Gen Mark Milley, retires in September."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fd3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/10/johnson-allies-avoid-punishment-for-interfering-with-partygate-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Johnson allies avoid punishment for interfering with Partygate inquiry", "lead": "MPs take no further action as Partygate parliamentary proceedings conclude", "author": "Aubrey Allegretti Senior political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 20:11:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954292", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f7d64eca2dcf056fee511f05eb2d29cec7ae3381/0_0_8192_4915/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson\u2019s allies have avoided being punished over the parliamentary Partygate inquiry after MPs endorsed a report that found they sought to interfere in the process but an attempt to make them face further action failed. Penny Mordaunt, the House of Commons leader, said she hoped the move would \u201cbe the end of this sorry affair\u201d after a testy debate that was the culmination of 15 months of Conservative infighting. But despite the government\u2019s attempt to move on from the saga, Johnson\u2019s allies continued to deny any wrongdoing. Former cabinet ministers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg said \u201cit was legitimate and it is legitimate\u201d to question the impartiality of the Labour MP Harriet Harman, who chaired the investigation that concluded that Johnson deliberately misled parliament. In a combative debate, Johnson\u2019s allies huddled on one side of the government benches with Tory members of the committee and their own supporters grouped together on the other. MPs heard how agitating by Johnson\u2019s followers had forced the parliamentary security services to urgently reassess committee members\u2019 safety at their constituency offices, homes and events. Harman, who at one point was teary-eyed when a Tory MP came to her defence by reminding colleagues she had lost her husband 14 weeks before taking on the job, spoke of how it had felt like \u201copen season\u201d for attacks on the committee. Despite the bloodletting on both sides lasting for three hours, the debate marked what appeared to be the end of formal parliamentary proceedings against Johnson and his supporters. MPs endorsed a report that found the former prime minister committed five contempts of parliament \u2013 including misleading the Commons \u2013 last month. On Monday they debated a supplementary report by the privileges committee that criticised a \u201csustained\u201d and \u201ccoordinated\u201d attempt to undermine its work, naming seven Tory MPs and three peers. A motion that endorsed the second report and banned MPs from interfering in further such investigations was passed without any dissenting voices. An attempt by the Liberal Democrats to prolong the political pain for Sunak by referring the seven MPs to the privileges committee for a new investigation was unsuccessful after the amendment was not selected by Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker. In her opening speech, Mordaunt said the row was \u201centirely unprecedented\u201d. \u201cI hope colleagues who have been named will reflect on their actions,\u201d she said of Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel, Nadine Dorries, Mark Jenkinson, Michael Fabricant, Brendan Clarke-Smith and Andrea Jenkyns. The Commons leader revealed that one MP named in the report had \u201ctaken the time to speak with regret to some other members of that committee\u201d and urged others to \u201cacknowledge that obligation we have to one another as colleagues\u201d. She added: \u201cI live in hope that today will be the end of this sorry affair.\u201d Labour sought to use the issue to claim that Sunak\u2019s government was mired in sleaze. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow Commons leader, said many had thought \u201cstandards in public life had hit rock bottom\u201d over Partygate but that the \u201cshameful\u201d action by Johnson\u2019s allies had damaged public trust in parliament \u201cfurther still\u201d. Harman was in the chamber to make a rare public comment on the process, and defended the move to censure seven of Johnson\u2019s allies. She said it was important for MPs not to \u201ctry to wreck the process\u201d in further such investigations. When some of those named in the report argued their comments had been taken out of context or were not a criticism of the inquiry, Harman shot back at them that she took their indignation to mean they did not believe the committee was a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. There was little sign of contrition from Johnson\u2019s allies. Rees-Mogg said there was no evidence that some MPs\u2019 criticism was coordinated and argued \u201cI don\u2019t think [Harman] was wise\u201d to serve as chair after sending three tweets about Johnson\u2019s conduct. Patel took issue with being named in the report without being given any notice or a chance to respond, saying some comments had been taken out of context. She added that the contents of the special report being reported first in the Guardian before its formal publication could also merit a further investigation. There are further headaches over Partygate still facing Sunak. The Metropolitan police announced last week it was investigating potential Covid breaches \u201cat a \u2018jingle and mingle\u2019 lockdown party at Conservative headquarters\u201d. Scotland Yard is also looking into an event in parliament that the Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who sits on the privileges committee, is said to have attended.

The Monday night breakthrough came in last-ditch talks on the eve of the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. The surprise announcement ended nearly a year of brinkmanship by Turkey, which had insisted it would not accede to Sweden\u2019s application to join Nato unless Stockholm did more to clamp down on exiled Kurdish activists it accuses of terrorism. The announcement was made by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who had overseen the talks between Erdo\u011fan and the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, in Vilnius. Stoltenberg said at a press conference: \u201cI\u2019m glad to announce ... that President Erdo\u011fan has agreed to forward the accession protocol for Sweden to the grand national assembly as soon as possible, and work closely with the assembly to ensure ratification.\u201d Kristersson described the news as a \u201cvery big step\u201d, telling reporters: \u201cThis feels very good, this has been my aim for a long time, and I believe we had a very fine response today and took a very big step towards membership.\u201d The Nato chief avoided answering precisely when Sweden would be joining the alliance, saying that Erdo\u011fan had agreed to push ratification in parliament \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. It took two weeks for Turkey\u2019s parliament to ratify Finland\u2019s membership. Hungary is also yet to approve it, although the government of the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has vowed it will not be the last to make the step, implying it will move soon. Joe Biden, who held last-minute talks with Erdo\u011fan during his flight to Europe on Sunday, was quick to welcome the announcement, saying in a statement: \u201cI stand ready to work with President Erdo\u011fan and Turkey on enhancing defense and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic area. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Kristersson and Sweden as our 32nd Nato ally. And I thank Secretary General Stoltenberg for his steadfast leadership.\u201d The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, tweeted: \u201cThis is an historic moment for NATO that makes us all safer. Sweden, we look forward to welcoming you into the Alliance.\u201d The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, described the development as good news. \u201cThere is finally a clear pathway for Turkey\u2019s ratification of Sweden\u2019s Nato membership. Our joint efforts have paid off. With 32 allies at the table we are all safer together. Congratulations, Sweden!\u201d she wrote on Twitter. A statement issued after the three-way talks between Nato, Turkey and Sweden said that the two countries would work closely in \u201ccounter-terrorism coordination\u201d and also boost bilateral trade ties. \u201cSweden will actively support efforts to reinvigorate Turkey\u2019s EU accession process, including modernisation of the EU-Turkey Customs Union and visa liberalisation,\u201d the statement said. Stockholm was also reported to have reassured Ankara that it would not support \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d and that a new bilateral security mechanism will be created between Ankara and Stockholm. That agreement came after Erdo\u011fan paused his talks with Stoltenberg and Kristersson for a side meeting with the EU chief Charles Michel, president of the European Council. Michel hailed a \u201cgood meeting\u201d, adding that they had \u201cexplored opportunities ahead to bring EU-Turkey cooperation back to the forefront and re-energise our relations\u201d. However, EU members remain sceptical of Ankara\u2019s commitment to democratic and rule of law reforms, and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, insisted Sweden and Turkey\u2019s ambitions were not linked. \u201cSweden meets all the requirements for Nato membership,\u201d Scholz said in Berlin. \u201cThe other question is one that is not connected with it and that is why I do not think it should be seen as a connected issue.\u201d Sweden\u2019s Nato accession has been held up by objections from Turkey since last year, and earlier in the day the prospects of a deal had appeared to recede when Erdo\u011fan threw in fresh demands that the EU reopen talks about Turkey\u2019s accession to the EU. Speaking at the airport before departing for the Nato summit, the Turkish president said: \u201cFirst, let\u2019s pave the way for Turkey in the European Union and then we will pave the way for Sweden just as we did for Finland.\u201d Turkey has been in talks over joining the EU in one form or another since 1987 but membership talks have been at a standstill since 2018, and there is no enthusiasm for letting such a large country with a questionable human rights record join. Sweden and Finland submitted simultaneous membership applications last May, abandoning decades of military nonalignment to seek security as Nato members after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Turkey soon abandoned its objections to Finland joining Nato, but the hope that the two Nordic nations would be able to join together was dashed when Erdogan claimed Sweden had not done enough to rein in Kurdish separatist demonstrations in Sweden. Finland joined the alliance earlier this year while negotiations with Sweden continued. In May, Swedish lawmakers voted to tighten the country\u2019s anti-terrorism laws, in an apparent attempt to convince Turkey that it would crack down on exiled members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party, or PKK, as well as Kurdish militia groups and the Fet\u00f6 organisation of the exiled cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fd5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/live/2023/jul/10/biden-uk-nato-ukraine-supreme-court-politics-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US supreme court: Clarence Thomas reportedly accepted more undisclosed gifts as calls for reform grow \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Media reports say justice has benefited from being part of elite, wealthy circle; campaigners to call on Congress calling for corruption investigation", "author": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 20:00:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954327", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/654468ba6cd40c3d73bf4cb97ecf625bb6a7e4f7/0_346_7395_4437/500.jpg", "body": "Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: A diverse coalition of advocacy groups have sent a letter to Congress today calling for formal hearings and investigations into alleged corruption in the court. The letter comes amid reports that conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito had accepted previously undisclosed gifts and trips from wealthy stakeholders whose business interests at times clashed with cases before the supreme court. The federal prosecutor overseeing the criminal case against Hunter Biden said the justice department never impeded him from bringing charges. In a letter to Republican senator Lindsey Graham, Delaware US attorney David Weiss denied allegations that he ever formally sought permission from attorney general Merrick Garland to be designated as special counsel. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon has been ordered by a New York judge to pay his former attorneys nearly $500,000 in unpaid legal fees. Judge Arlene Bluth ruled on Friday in favor of the law firm, Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron, after they filed a lawsuit against Bannon for breach of contract related to several cases. An exclusive circle of \u201cextraordinarily wealthy, largely conservative\u201d Americans is in the spotlight after a New York Times investigation revealed how the supreme court justice, Clarence Thomas, has benefited from being a member. The latest revelation comes amid scrutiny over Thomas prompted by a report revealing that he had received gifts from the Republican mega-donor, Harlan Crow. Joe Biden visited London where he met with Britain\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and King Charles III.

A major branch of the US military does not have a Senate confirmed leader for the first time, as a result of Republican senator Tommy Tuberville\u2019s blockade on all senior military nominations. Commandant Gen David Berger stepped down from his position as leader of the marine corps on Monday, after more than 40 years of service. Hill Harper, an actor known for his roles on \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d and \u201cCSI: NY\u201d, has announced he is running for Michigan\u2019s Senate seat. Harper is the sixth Democratic candidate to enter the race to replace retiring Democratic senator Debbie Stabenow, who announced in January that she would not be seeking a fifth term in 2024 in the battleground state. Ron DeSantis has made \u201cvery large, critical errors\u201d in the Republican presidential primary, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, the biggest of which is the Florida governor\u2019s attempt to \u201cout-Trump Trump\u201d and appeal to the hard-right GOP base. George Santos, the Republican congressman whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has been shown to be largely fabricated and who has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of fraud, money laundering and theft of public funds, stoked outrage by comparing himself to the great civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks. A major branch of the US military does not have a Senate confirmed leader for the first time, as a result of Republican senator Tommy Tuberville\u2019s blockade on all senior military nominations. Commandant Gen David Berger stepped down from his position as leader of the marine corps on Monday, after more than 40 years of service. His successor, Gen Eric Smith, is the acting commandant until he is confirmed by the Senate. Tuberville, an Alabama Republican and Senate armed services committee member, placed a hold on all senior military promotions in protest of the Pentagon\u2019s new policy that provides paid leave and reimbursement costs for travel for troops if they cannot obtain abortions in their state. Defense secretary Lloyd Austin, at a ceremony marking Berger\u2019s departure, said: You know, it\u2019s been more than a century since the US Marine Corps has operated without a Senate-confirmed commandant. Smooth and timely transitions of confirmed leadership are central to the defense of the United States. He added: I am also confident that the United States Senate will meet its responsibilities, and I look forward to welcoming an outstanding new commandant for our Marine Corps and to adding many other distinguished senior leaders across the joint force. Former vice president Mike Pence criticized his former boss, Donald Trump, after the former president claimed he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. Pence, who is running against Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, was asked on Fox News how he believes the war in Ukraine will end. Pence said: There\u2019s some talk, my former running mate likes to talk about solving it in a day. The only way you\u2019d solve this war in a day is if you gave Vladimir Putin what he wanted. Pence also said he supported Joe Biden\u2019s decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine, saying that it was in the US interest \u201cto give the Ukrainians what they need to stop [Russians] there.\u201d Away from US politics, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the majority of Nato members stood together with his country and the Vilnius summit must confirm that Ukraine is a de-facto member of the military alliance. \u201cThe majority of the Alliance stands firmly with us,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video message. \u201cWhen we applied for membership of Nato, we spoke frankly: de-facto, Ukraine is already in the Alliance. Our weapons are the weapons of the alliance. Our values are what the alliance believes in. Vilnius must confirm all this.\u201d Zelenskiy said further weapons supplies for Ukraine in its war against Russia would also be discussed at the summit and added: \u201cI am sure that there could well be positive news regarding weapons for our men from Vilnius.\u201d Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has said she believes the US and China wanted to stabilize their economic ties with \u201ccandor\u201d and \u201crespect.\u201d Yellen said she believed her trip, during which both sides discussed \u201csignificant disagreements,\u201d had succeeded in putting a floor under the relationship. In an interview with Marketplace, taped shortly before her departure from Beijing on Sunday, she said: \u201cThere are challenges, but I believe there is a desire on both sides to stabilize the relationship and to constructively address problems that each of us see in our relationship, to do so frankly, with candor, with respect and to build a productive relationship going forward.\u201d The supreme court has concluded another term that upended Americans\u2019 lives. Last week, the court\u2019s conservative supermajority ruled against race-conscious decisions in college admissions, overturning decades of precedent supporting affirmative action. A day later, the six conservative justices both struck down Joe Biden\u2019s student debt forgiveness plan and sided with a Colorado-based business owner who wanted to refuse service to same-sex couples. As the conservative justices\u2019 decisions attracted criticism, their behavior away from the bench also sparked alarm. Reports emerged that conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito had accepted previously undisclosed gifts and trips from wealthy stakeholders whose business interests at times clashed with cases before the supreme court. The outcry unleashed over the justices\u2019 ethics scandals, combined with the widespread disapproval of their opinions, has intensified calls to reform the supreme court. And although court reform efforts have previously been denounced as radical overreach, more Americans are warming to the idea in the face of a six-three conservative supermajority issuing decisions viewed as largely out of step with the country\u2019s principles and priorities. \u201cDemocracy is at risk,\u201d Congressman Hank Johnson, a Democrat in Georgia, said. We must save this supreme court from itself, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we do court reform now. Read the full story by my colleagues Joan E Greve and Ed Pilkington. Hill Harper, an actor known for his roles on \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d and \u201cCSI: NY\u201d, has announced he is running for Michigan\u2019s Senate seat. Harper is the sixth Democratic candidate to enter the race to replace retiring Democratic senator Debbie Stabenow, who announced in January that she would not be seeking a fifth term in 2024 in the battleground state. Harper faces a tough test challenging Elissa Slotkin, a three-term Democratic House member who has raised $5.8m in just over four months, according to her campaign. In an interview with The Associated Press before his announcement, Harper said that not being a \u201ccareer politician\u201d would serve as an advantage in Congress and that he plans to run a campaign \u201cpowered by the people, for the people\u201d. Michigan\u2019s Senate seat is crucial for Democrats if they hope to maintain control of the Senate. The state flipped from Donald Trump in 2016 to Joe Biden four years later. Joe Biden described relations with the UK as \u201crock solid\u201d during talks in London with Rishi Sunak. The president, on a brief stopover in the UK before the Nato summit in Vilnius, said before the start of formal discussions in the Downing Street garden: We\u2019ve got a lot to talk about. Our relationship is rock solid. Couldn\u2019t be meeting with a closer friend and a greater ally. The meeting with Sunak, their fifth in as many months, was dominated by discussion of Ukraine and its aspirations for Nato membership, a subject that is likely to dominate the Nato summit and has the potential to reveal frictions in the UK-US alliance. In his talks with Biden, Sunak focused on the planned \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d an informal alliance of Nato countries intended to provide Ukraine as an interim measure before it received the full protections of Nato membership. Biden and Sunak also agreed to differ over the US decision to accede to Ukraine\u2019s request to provide cluster munitions on certain conditions, and as a bridge until the supply of more conventional armaments picks up. The UK prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said providing the weapons \u201cwas a difficult choice for the US\u201d that had been \u201cforced on them by Russia\u2019s war of aggression\u201d. The two leaders \u201cdiscussed the commitments that UK has under that convention, both not to produce or use cluster munitions and to discourage their use\u201d. Asked if Sunak complied with that commitment to discourage the use of the weapons in his talks with Biden, the spokesperson said: Yes, they discussed the requirements the prime minister is under because of this convention, and the UK is upholding that. The federal prosecutor overseeing the criminal case against Hunter Biden said the justice department never impeded him from bringing charges. In a letter to Republican senator Lindsey Graham, Delaware US attorney David Weiss denied allegations that he ever formally sought permission from attorney general Merrick Garland to be designated as special counsel \u2013 a status that would have allowed him to bring federal charges in any district across the nation against the president\u2019s youngest son, Reuters reported. Weiss, who was appointed by Donald Trump, wrote: I have not requested Special Counsel designation. Rather, I had discussions with Departmental officials regarding potential appointment ... which would have allowed me to file charges in a district outside my own without the partnership of the local U.S. Attorney. I was assured that I would be granted this authority if it proved necessary. His comments appear to debunk claims made by Gary Shapley, an IRS criminal supervisory agent who worked on the Hunter Biden investigation, who alleged the justice department repeatedly stonewalled the probe. Shapley also claimed that when Weiss sought permission from Garland to be designated as special counsel, so he could bring charges from anywhere in the country, his request was denied. Garland has denied the claim. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon has been ordered by a New York judge to pay his former attorneys nearly $500,000 in unpaid legal fees. Judge Arlene Bluth ruled on Friday in favor of the law firm, Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron, after they filed a lawsuit against Bannon for breach of contract related to several cases. The firm represented Bannon in a series of legal problems, including his fight against a congressional subpoena investigating the 6 January 2021, US Capitol attack, as well as criminal investigations into his efforts to crowdfund a wall along the southern US border. According to the firm, Bannon made partial payments totaling $375,000 out of the more than $850,000 billed. In a six-page order, Bluth ordered Bannon to pay $480,487.87 in unpaid bills as well as \u201creasonable legal fees\u201d to his former lawyers. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted in New York state court in Manhattan on money laundering and conspiracy charges over the planned wall. He pleaded not guilty. He was previously indicted on federal fraud charges for the fundraising effort but was pardoned by Donald Trump during his final days in office. An attorney for the three remaining survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre said they will appeal an Oklahoma judge\u2019s recision to reject a lawsuit seeking reparations for the 1921 massacre. Judge Caroline Wall on Friday dismissed with prejudice the lawsuit, preventing Lessie Benningfield Randle, 108, Viola Fletcher, 109, and Hughes Van Ellis, 102, from refiling in the Oklahoma district court their lawsuit against the city of Tulsa and others. Originally filed in 2020, the lawsuit sought reparations for the attack in the city\u2019s Greenwood district, at the time one of the wealthiest Black neighborhoods in the US. It argued that large swaths of Tulsa\u2019s Black community still suffer from the damage brought on by the massacre, more than a century on. A group supporting the lawsuit said in a statement: Judge Wall effectively condemned the three living Tulsa Race Massacre Survivors to languish \u2014 genuinely to death \u2014 on Oklahoma\u2019s appellate docket. There is no semblance of justice or access to justice here. One of the attorneys representing the survivors told the Washington Post that her legal team intends to appeal the judge\u2019s decision. She told the paper in a statement: Black Americans, especially Black Tulsans, carry the weight of intergenerational racial trauma day in and day out\u2014a weight they cannot relinquish or cavalierly dismiss. The dismissal of this case is just one more example of how America\u2019s, including Tulsa\u2019s, legacy is disproportionately and unjustly borne by the Black community. The head Democrat on the House armed services committee, Adam Smith, said he is \u201cworried about the extreme right-wing amendments\u201d that have been attached to the House version of the annual defense bill, which members are set to take up on Wednesday. More than 1,000 amendments have been filed, including ones addressing abortion in the military, diversity programs, the origins of the coronavirus, guns and on many more political and cultural topics, the Washington Post reported. Smith told the paper he was concerned about GOP measures on \u201cabortion, guns, the border, and social policy and equity issues\u201d. He said: We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what amendments are made in order when the bill is debated on the House floor. He added: Depending on which amendments pass, I will make an evaluation on whether I support the final bill. George Santos, the Republican congressman whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has been shown to be largely fabricated and who has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of fraud, money laundering and theft of public funds, stoked outrage by comparing himself to the great civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks. \u201cRosa Parks didn\u2019t sit in the back, and neither am I gonna sit in the back,\u201d Santos told Mike Crispi Unafraid, a rightwing podcast. Santos also said he will run for re-election in his New York seat, which covers parts of Long Island and Queens. Now honoured by a statue in the US Capitol, Parks was a seamstress and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People secretary who carved her place in history when on a bus in Alabama in 1955 she refused to move to make way for a white passenger and was arrested and jailed. Read the full story here. An exclusive circle of \u201cextraordinarily wealthy, largely conservative\u201d Americans is in the spotlight after a New York Times investigation revealed how the supreme court justice, Clarence Thomas, has benefited from being a member. The Times reported on Sunday that just months after Thomas joined the bench in 1991, he was welcomed into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, where he forged relationships with an exclusive circle of wealthy and powerful members \u201cwho lionized him\u201d and gave him proximity to \u201ca lifestyle of unimaginable material privilege.\u201d The paper writes: While he has never held an official leadership position, in some ways he has become the association\u2019s leading light. He has granted it unusual access to the Supreme Court, where every year he presides over the group\u2019s signature event: a ceremony in the courtroom at which he places Horatio Alger medals around the necks of new lifetime members. One entrepreneur called it \u2018the closest thing to being knighted in the United States.\u2019 This organization granted him access to wealthy friends who gifted Thomas with luxurious vacation retreats and VIP tickets to sporting events, as well as invited him to parties, according to the paper. Thomas did not disclose many of the gifts and trips over the last two decades reported by the Times. The latest revelation comes amid scrutiny over Thomas prompted by a ProPublica report revealing that he had received gifts from the Republican mega-donor, Harlan Crow. ProPublica has reported that gifts from Crow to Thomas included luxury travel and resort stays, purchase of a property in which the justice\u2019s mother lives rent-free, and schooling for Thomas\u2019s great-nephew. Ron DeSantis has made \u201cvery large, critical errors\u201d in the Republican presidential primary, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, the biggest of which is the Florida governor\u2019s attempt to \u201cout-Trump Trump\u201d and appeal to the hard-right GOP base. \u201cThe dynamics of these races change from day to day,\u201d the New York progressive congresswoman told MSNBC. \u201cI think that Governor DeSantis has made some very large, critical errors. You can\u2019t out-Trump Trump, right? And that\u2019s what he\u2019s really been trying to do. His attacks on teachers, on schools, on LGBTQ+ Americans, I think, go way too far in the state of Florida. And I think that they are a profound political miscalculation and an overcompensation. DeSantis is a clear second in polling regarding the Republican nomination but lags as much as 30 points behind Donald Trump. The former president is the clear frontrunner despite an unprecedented 71 criminal indictments, a $5m civil penalty after being held liable for sexual assault and defamation, and the prospect of more charges to come regarding attempted election subversion. DeSantis, a former US congressman, won a landslide re-election in Florida last year. He has pursued a hard-right agenda, including signing a six-week abortion ban, loosening gun controls and attacking the teaching of race and LGBTQ+ issues in public schools. But he has struggled to make an impact on the campaign trail, observers suggesting he lacks the skills to truly connect with voters, even in a Republican primary, let alone in a general election. On Sunday, DeSantis told Fox News: The media does not want me to be the nominee. I think that\u2019s very, very clear. Why? Because they know I will beat [Joe] Biden. But, even more importantly, they know I will actually deliver on all these things. Head-to-head polling shows Biden and DeSantis in a tight race. Recent surveys from Emerson and Yahoo News gave Biden leads of six and three points respectively. NBC News found the two men in a tie. The letter by the coalition United for Democracy calling for lawmakers to hold formal hearings and investigate supreme court ethics and recent scandals involving its justices reads: We write today on behalf of the tens of millions of Americans we represent to urge Congress to finally address a broken and captured Supreme Court that is overturning precedents, shattering judicial norms, and consistently siding with billionaires, massive corporations, and their extreme right-wing allies over workers, families, communities, and our democracy. In the letter sent to party leadership on Capitol Hill and leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the coalition said the court has \u201cexempted itself from the most basic oversight\u201d and that revelations about ethics and corruption \u201chave undermined public trust and made a mockery of the idea that every American should be treated equally under the law\u201d. This Supreme Court majority has gone too far on behalf of their donors and benefactors. Enough is enough. People across the country, including the tens of millions we represent, are increasingly disillusioned with today\u2019s biased and unfair Supreme Court. We want a Supreme Court that protects our freedom to make a good living, to breathe clean air and drink clean water, to walk through our communities without the fear of gun violence, to make our own health care decisions, and to know our kids will learn and grow at school. The letter does not name any particular justice. The Republicans who lead three key House committees are joining forces to probe the justice department\u2019s handling of charges against Hunter Biden. Leaders of the House judiciary, oversight and accountability, and ways and means committees on Friday opened a joint investigation on Friday into the federal case into the president\u2019s youngest son, in the wake of the justice department\u2019s plea deal with Hunter Biden. Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, James Comer of Kentucky and Jason Smith of Missouri and issued a series of requests for voluntary testimony from senior officials at the department, FBI and internal revenue service after making sweeping claims about misconduct and improper interference. Republicans also want a special counsel appointed to investigate retaliation that has been alleged against the whistleblowers who came forward with the claims. The chair of the Senate judiciary committee, Dick Durbin, launched an attack on chief justice John Roberts last Thursday, promising a vote on ethics reform legislation after a term beset by scandal. \u201cThe highest court in the land should not have the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Durbin said. I\u2019m sorry to see Chief Justice [John] Roberts end the term without taking action on the ethical issues plaguing the court \u2013 all while the court handed down decisions that dismantled longstanding precedents and the progress our country has made over generations. In May, Roberts turned down an invitation to testify to the committee regarding ethics reform and, although supreme court justices are notionally subject to the same ethics rules as other federal justices, in practice they govern themselves. Joe Biden is in London today, where he met with Britain\u2019s prime minister Rishi Sunak and King Charles III. Biden flew into Stansted airport late last night for a trip that the White House said was designed \u201cto further strengthen the close relationship between our nations\u201d. He will then leave Britain for Vilnius, Lithuania, where Nato leaders will gather for a key summit. Biden is then expected to travel to Helsinki for a meeting with Nordic leaders. Calls for structural reform seem to have as little chance of success as calls for justice Clarence Thomas to resign or be impeached \u2013 calls perhaps likely to increase after the publication by the Times on Sunday of an investigation of the justice\u2019s membership of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, \u201ca cluster of extraordinarily wealthy, largely conservative members who lionised him and all that he had achieved\u201d. Republicans control the House and trail Democrats by two seats in the Senate, all but ensuring a block on any such move. Furthermore, Joe Biden is against major reform, such as changing the size of the court or imposing term limits. Speaking to the former Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki, congressman Ro Khanna told MSNBC: Voters know that the court is just out of touch with their lives, that the court is taking away their rights, taking away women\u2019s rights to control their own body, taking away students\u2019 relief in terms of the student loans. The president forgave the loans. The supreme court took that money away. [Voters] see these justices, they see all the ethical conflicts, and they\u2019re saying, \u2018Enough with it. Let\u2019s have a clean slate and term limits.\u2019 I\u2019ve said everything should be on the table, but \u2026 it\u2019s not an easy thing to do. Often people see that it is polarising or partisan. I guess term limits is an easier first step \u2026 and a judicial code of conduct of ethics. The Senate judiciary chair, Dick Durbin, has promised a vote on ethics reform. Any measure would be highly unlikely to pass the Republican House. The chief justice should testify before Congress about ethics scandals besetting his supreme court \u201cfor the good of democracy\u201d, a leading Californian progressive said. The justices are \u201cso cloistered, they\u2019re so out of touch\u201d, the congressman Ro Khanna told MSNBC on Sunday. They don\u2019t have a sense of what life is like, so my plea to him would be for the good of democracy come testify. What are you afraid of? The Democratic-controlled Senate judiciary committee has requested that Roberts testify about reports regarding relations between justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch and rightwing donors or, in Gorsuch\u2019s case, the chief of a prominent law firm involved in a property purchase. Questions have also been raised about the career of Roberts\u2019 wife, Jane Sullivan Roberts, who, according to the New York Times, \u201chas made millions recruiting lawyers to prominent law firms, some of which have business before the court\u201d. In April, turning down the invitation to testify before the Senate judiciary committee, John Roberts cited concerns about the separation of powers. Good morning, US politics blog readers. A diverse coalition of advocacy groups called United for Democracy, which banded together last month with the aim of moving the needle on supreme court reform, will send a letter to Congress today calling for formal hearings and investigations into alleged corruption in the court. The group includes Democratic power players such as Planned Parenthood and MoveOn, plus prominent labor unions and grassroots organizations. In the letter, the group argues that recent \u201crevelations about ethics and corruption at the court have undermined public trust and made a mockery of the idea that every American should be treated equally under the law.\u201d The letter does not make mention of specific names or revelations, but comes amid reports that conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito had accepted previously undisclosed gifts and trips from wealthy stakeholders whose business interests at times clashed with cases before the supreme court. The Democratic-controlled Senate judiciary committee has requested that the chief justice, John Roberts, testify about reports regarding relations between justices Thomas, Alito and Neil Gorsuch and rightwing donors or, in Gorsuch\u2019s case, the chief of a prominent law firm involved in a property purchase. Public trust in the court is at all-time lows. The outcry unleashed over the justices\u2019 ethics scandals, combined with the widespread anger over decisions on abortion, affirmative action, student debt relief and anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, has intensified calls to reform the supreme court. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching today: Joe Biden is in London where he has met with Britain\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and King Charles III. Biden will then head to Vilnius, Lithuania, for a critical Nato meeting \u2013 where Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine will top the agenda \u2013 and finish his trip with a stop in Finland. The Senate will meet this afternoon to resume consideration of the nomination of Xochitl Torres Small\u2019s nomination for deputy agriculture secretary. They will vote at 5.30pm. The House is out."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fd6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/10/surrey-v-nottinghamshire-lancashire-v-essex-county-cricket-updates-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Notts toil at Surrey in Haseeb Hameed\u2019s first game as captain \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "The champions are in a strong position at the Oval, while Kent struggled against Warks as Sussex piled on the runs", "author": "Tanya Aldred and Kyra Sethna-Mcintosh at The Oval", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 19:52:47", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954365", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/53cd62c66df86872b4b4e24625e408ed43e1248d/0_215_3482_2090/500.jpg", "body": "Haseeb Hameed\u2019s first opportunity to captain in Championship cricket proved tricky, Nottinghamshire hampered as both Brett Hutton and Jake Ball left the field at the Oval clutching various parts of their body. Things had started well with Rory Burns out to the second ball of the day, and again with Surrey 70 for four, but a steady innings from Ben Foakes and big hitting from Jordan Clark \u2013 who cracked his first century of the year \u2013 left the champions in a strong position. Casey Aldridge and James Rew kept Somerset in the hunt at Taunton, coming together after a familiar top-order fumble, this time at the hands of Hampshire\u2019s Kyle Abbott who grabbed four for 20 and a run-out. Somerset rested some key players before the Blast Finals Day but Dom Bess returned on a short-term loan from Yorkshire. Matt Parkinson, on loan to Durham before moving to Kent, took three wickets at the Riverside to haul back Gloucestershire, including a ripper to remove James Bracey\u2019s off stump. There were half\u2011centuries from Chris Dent and Miles Hammond. Kent were dismissed for 171 by Warwickshire, who were already in touching distance by stumps. Kent\u2019s blushes had been saved by a late-order swashbuckle from Grant Stewart. It was a carefree day\u2019s batting for Sussex against Derbyshire at Hove, Tom Clark top\u2011scoring with 96 and Ollie Carter passing 50 for the third match in a row. Meanwhile Northamptonshire meandered to 219 all out against Middlesex. At New Road, Finlay Bean and Adam Lyth knocked up 154, Yorkshire\u2019s highest opening stand for six years, before the weather intervened. Worcestershire dropped three catches. As The Oval groundstaff tart up the pitch for tomorrow, the flags on the pavilion still flapping away, pigeons tucking into grassy delights, time for me to go. Rain still playing its hand in July, but plenty to keep an eye on \u2013 from Jordan\u2019s Clark century, to the orgy of runs from Sussex and Kent\u2019s wobble at Canterbury. Thanks from me and from Kyra \u2013 till tomorrow \u2013 bye!

As Clark approaches a game-changing hundred at The Oval, I\u2019d better disappear to write up for the paper. Do keep chatting BTL. Talk of Nick Compton BTL, when you have a moment read this empathetic interview with Don McRae. There is only one game currently in progress in Division Two, at Hove, where Sussex have galloped away to 306-5. Clark a 168 ball 96; Haines a 96-ball 86 and Carter a 121-ball 56 not out. Thomson 3-69. A final look around the grounds before I write up: Sixteen overs to be bowled at Blackpool where Essex have been preserved in aspic at 12-1 since this morning. Warwickshire have lost Davies and Rhodes, but Yates potters on (37). Warwicks 112-2 -59 behind Kent. Northants 177-6, a useful partnership of 42 Oooof and here at The Oval, Brett Hutton is walking off again to warm applause after trying to bowl and first falling over, then pulling up just before delivery. The big man finally admits defeat. Surrey 262-6. And Somerset 177-5, the young pairing of Rew (70) and Aldridge (43) pulling off a rescue act. Surrey collect just their fourth batting point since mid-May. Surprising n\u2019est pas for the Division One leaders? Missing Parky (made for social-media) moments? Here you are - Thanks Kyra, brilliant to have a different eye here on CCLive! Did I mention that Foakes had been out? A fourth catch for Moores. Foakes an unshowy 46 that held together a sticky patch in a way that might be useful elsewhere. Surrey 229-6. Hutton back on the pitch. Incredibly, only one hundred has been made at The Oval in the Championship this year \u2013 Pope\u2019s beauty against Hampshire. It isn\u2019t, my learned friend next to me in the press box says, the batsman\u2019s paradise it used to be. Hi Kyra here, as we go into the final session of the day, I will be leaving and Tanya will be taking over for the last entries of the blog. What an exciting morning and afternoon we\u2019ve had of cricket though, and hopefully many more to come! DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 171 v Warwickshire 69-0 Blackpool: Lancashire v Essex 12-1 rain Merchant Taylors\u2019 School: Middlesex v Northamptonshire 144-6 Taunton: Somerset 102-5 v Hampshire The Oval Surrey 200-5 v Notts DIVISION TWO The Riverside: Durham v Gloucestershire 257-5 Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan v Leicestershire no play yet today, rain Hove: Sussex 247-4 v Derbyshire New Road: Worcestershire v Yorkshire 142-0 rain Round the grounds: rain still at Blackpool, Sophia Gardens and New Road. Division One Kent hauled themselves to respectability from 95-8, thanks to Grant Stewart and Matt Quinn. But 171 all out looking meagre as Warwicks race to 65-0. Northants wobbling in the face of TRJ and Higgins: 144-6. Play at Taunton, but Umeed a fourth wicket for Abbott. Now Aldridge must rebuild with Rew (29): Somerset a proceed-as-normal 98-5. Notts\u2019 bowlers falling to pieces in the July sunshine. James completing Hutton\u2019s over after he had to leave the field clutching bits of body. Jake Ball also injured out. Leggie Calvin Harrison taking the Pavilion End. Thanks Kyra! Clarks leans back and slams a pie from Hutton through the covers for four: 36 of his 43 runs in boundaries the BBC man tells me. We\u2019ve just had the pleasure of speaking to a member of the crowd, here at The Oval. Max told us his thoughts on the Foakes situation. He said straight away that he \u201cthinks he should be in the England team\u201d and that \u201cFoakes should get in somehow.\u201d Max also told us that having watched him a fair amount this summer he can see that \u201cHe\u2019s pretty consistent for Surrey \u2026.like now he\u2019s just holding the innings together \u2026 he\u2019s a crucial player\u201d. So should Foakes come back for the next Test at Old Trafford? Clark on 29 has already overtaken Foakes in 30 balls, Surrey 168-5. Hi Kyra here again. Back at The Oval, the sun is shining and the game is in full swing! All eyes are on Foakes wearing number seven this afternoon. With the crowds getting ever so slightly depleted here since lunch however, the atmosphere still stays strong! Dancing around Division Two. Rain at New Road where grizzled and fresh, Lyth and Bean, have put on 142. And still no play at Sophia Gardens. Sussex have lost another \u2013 Coles a second for Thomson, for 14 \u2013 but still fizzing along, 197-3 v lost-their-mojo Derbys. And Gloucestershire, led by Chris Dent\u2019s 75, are 178-3. South African Roelofsen the new man at the crease. Jacks has a rush of blood, fizzing up the pitch to Paterson, edges, hesitates for a moment, checking the catch has carried to Moores, but has to stroll off: Surrey 130-5, after a partnership of 60 with Foakes. The more powerful Jacks outscoring Foakes, racing along to 34 to Foakes\u2019 14. Surrey 124-4, rebuilding, rebuilding. South overpowers north in the T20 quarters: No luck on my call (not a euphemism), so back to the cricket. The Sussex runaway train has been halted, Haines gone for 86, Alsop for 9: 181-2. Foakes, long sleeves buttoned to the wrist, elegant as a parasol, number 7 on his back, watches calmly from the non-striker\u2019s end. Surrey 91-4. Please excuse me for ten minutes while I make a work call. Rain in the west: no play at Blackpool, Sophia Gardens and Taunton. Kent, alas, are 91-7. Pillar of stability Muyeye is back in the pavilion, Evison has joined him. A post-prandial email lands gently in the box. \u201cPleased to see Sussex motoring along in third in Division 2,\u201d writes Paul Griffin, \u201cvindicating their shock decision to drop rookie batter Steve Smith a few weeks ago after he failed to exploit Glamorgan\u2019s ingenue spinner Marnus Labuschagne. But I wonder what will become of them.\u201d Tasty vegan steak for lunch courtesy of The Oval\u2019s excellent kitchen, even tastier shot for Foakes to get off the mark. He\u2019s going to get a hundred, isn\u2019t he. Isn\u2019t he? Surrey 81-4, picking up the pace sine lunch with Jacks and Foakes at the crease. We\u2019re off to grab some lunch, with Sussex and Yorkshire skitting into run heaven. Back shortly! DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 77-5 v Warwickshire Blackpool: Lancashire v Essex 12-1 rain Merchant Taylors\u2019 School: Middlesex v Northamptonshire 71-2 Taunton: Somerset 74-4 v Hampshire The Oval Surrey 70-4 v Notts DIVISION TWO The Riverside: Durham v Gloucestershire 94-2 Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan v Leicestershire no play yet today, rain Hove: Sussex 150-0 v Derbyshire New Road: Worcestershire v Yorkshire 128-0 Surrey! A second for James \u2013 Latham lbw to a full one on the stroke of lunch. Surrey lose three for four, and they trot back to the pavilion with the Champs 70-4 at sandwiches. With ten minutes till lunch, Kent and Somerset\u2019s batters have had the worst of the morning. Kent 72-5, including two for Rushworth and a run-out. Muyeye, 37 not out, can only regard the mess. And a third wicket for Abbott at Taunton: Umeed, in his first red-ball game of the year, and Rew rebuilding the roof. Somerset 74-4. Thanks Kyra and thanks for the welcome BTL! I told her you were a friendly bunch. That breakthrough just before lunch brings in the talented Jamie Smith, who, ah, is out before he has a chance to get in, a tip-top catch behind the stumps from a nip backer by Lyndon James. Enter BEN FOAKES. Surrey 67-3. From observing the game from the Vauxhall End, I have to say the precision both these bowlers and batters use is amazing to watch. To have such accuracy and ease when bowling or batting is very admirable. Surrey have just lost Dom Sibley for 34: now 66-2. As the Notts player Hutton starts to bowl, one can\u2019t help but notice the magnificent background and architecture that The Oval provides the players and fans alike. A truly momentous ground for the home of Surrey County Cricket, with the two towers and British Flag standing over us, it really does feel like the players are performing for the world to see ! The suns just starting to reappear for us here in the Oval this afternoon, along with a nice breeze, which is perhaps a welcome change for the Surrey and Notts players, after the recent run of rain and humidity this past week. Thank you Tanya, great to be here. The atmosphere here is great, and it is so good to see so many people , from children to adults, all watching the cricket and soaking in the ambience the Oval has to offer ! Right, I\u2019m now going to put my feet up and hand over to Kyra for a while. Her number one sport is athletics \u2013\u2013 but she\u2019s enjoying The Oval\u2019s Monday morning ambience. Before I hand over to Kyra, a quick look around the grounds. Here at The Oval, four slips waiting as Paterson rumbles in. Latham taps the ball away and wanders away to do some gardening. A strong wind billows the flags. Surrey a pedestrican 32-1. At Canterbury, Chris Rushworth has struck, Compton the unlucky man, caught for nine. Kent 25-1. Raining still at Blackpool, Essex 12-1. Northants have lost Vasconcelos, whose season hasn\u2019t quite slipped into gear this summer. A wicket for Higgins, Northants 33-1. Somerset, bravely choosing to bat against Hampshire, may regret their decision. The usual early wickets: two to Abbott\u2019s bowling arm, one, a run out, to Abbott\u2019s throwing arm. Somerset 41-3. In Division Two: no play yet at Sophia Gardens; a wicket for Potts at the Riverside, Gloucestershire 41-1; and carefree batting for Sussex (63-0 v Derby) and Yorks (53-0 v Worcestershire).

I saw this story about the ECB trying to bring forward the date when Muyeye \u2013 Wisden\u2019s schools cricketer of the year in 2020 \u2013 will be eligible for England, after arriving in the UK as an asylum seeker. Rain at Blackpool, Essex 12-1. Rain still at Sophia Gardens. Could be a day for brollies up and down \u2013 this is the Met Office\u2019s best guess: \u201cAfter a mostly fine start, it will quickly cloud over with rain across the southwest, moving northeast during the day. Some heavy showers expected across Scotland. Breezy, especially in the southwest. Warm in the east but cooler in the southwest.\u201d We\u2019ve got a delayed start at Sophia Gardens, elsewhere only two wickets have fallen as I type \u2013 Rory Burns here at The Oval, Surrey 13-1, and Nick Browne, done by Bailey/de Grandhomme at lovely Stanley Park \u2013 Essex 8-1. In lovely news for those who have followed his career since he was wet behind the ears, the Notts captain today is Haseeb Hameed, with Steven Mullaney injured. Not the start the Champions were hoping for, while people cleared their throats and rifled for their sandwiches, Rory Burns lbw to Hutton second ball. Surrey 0 for 1. Is this the start of a beautiful homecoming? I\u2019ve got Kyra Sethna-Mcintosh with me today, on a Guardian internship, and she will take over the blog a little bit later. Out on The Oval field, the mowers are pushed to and fro, to and fro, and the groundstaff dust the wickets. 1 Durham (8) 131 2 Leicestershire (8) 95 3 Sussex (8) 94 4 Worcestershire (8) 84 5 Glamorgan (8) 84 6 Yorkshire (7) 68 7 Gloucestershire (8) 60 8 Derbyshire (7) 51 1 Surrey (played 8) 129 2 Essex (8) 106 3 Hants (8) 103 4 Warwicks (7) 93 5 Lancs (7) 88 6 Somerset (8) 88 7 Nottinghamshire (8) 78 8 Kent (8) 72 9 Middlesex (7) 51 10 Northants (7) 39 Good morning!

A prominent male BBC presenter was suspended at the weekend after allegations he spent \u00a335,000 buying explicit images from the young person, who was allegedly 17 years old when they started talking online. The young person\u2019s mother made the allegations in the Sun newspaper, which published her claim that payments from the BBC presenter helped fund her child\u2019s crack cocaine habit. Yet in a dramatic turn of events, on Monday evening the young person\u2019s lawyer issued a statement saying the mother and the Sun had made false claims. The lawyer said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place between our client and the BBC personality and the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish.\u201d The lawyer told BBC News they had provided a similar denial to the Sun before the publication of the original story, telling the tabloid there was \u201cno truth\u201d to the article they were preparing to publish. The tabloid pressed ahead, without including any denial from the young person. A spokesperson for the Sun said: \u201cWe have reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child. Their complaint was not acted upon by the BBC. We have seen evidence that supports their concerns. It\u2019s now for the BBC to properly investigate.\u201d The young person\u2019s parents on Monday night said they \u201cstand by\u201d the claims. \u201cIt is sad but we stand by our account and we hope they get the help they need,\u201d the mother told the Sun. \u201cWe did this to help \u2013 and the presenter has got into their head. How did they afford a lawyer? We are so sad.\u201d The stepfather said: \u201cWe are disappointed they made a statement. It\u2019s not true.\u201d Sources in the Sun newsroom suggested there was growing nervousness about the newspaper\u2019s handling of the story, which has dominated the headlines for several days, led to the suspension of a prominent BBC presenter, and forced multiple on-air stars to publicly deny they have been suspended. The young person\u2019s statement was released after the Metropolitan police said they were still considering whether to launch an investigation into the allegations. If the young person sent any explicit pictures when they were 17 then this could count as images of child sexual abuse, a serious criminal offence. But if the explicit photos were exchanged only after the young person turned 18 then it is possible that no law was broken. The age at which individuals can share explicit photographs is higher than the age at which they can legally have sex. The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, is due to answer questions about the allegations on Tuesday morning, as he meets journalists to launch the corporation\u2019s annual report \u2013 an event scheduled several weeks before this story broke. He will be accompanied by the newly appointed interim BBC chair, Dame Elan Closs Stephens, in her first public appearance in the role. The BBC presenter has not been named by media outlets, although there is not believed to be any court order or injunction banning publication of the individual\u2019s name. Instead, the presenter has relied on the strong privacy protections offered under English and Welsh law after recent legal rulings. Hanna Basha, of the law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said judges tried to balance the reputation of the individual and the public\u2019s right to know what was going on: \u201cThe law recognises the privacy of suspects in investigations unless there is an overwhelming public interest in naming them.\u201d As a result, it is possible that both the BBC and the police could ultimately conclude the presenter has no case to answer and he is never publicly identified. Earlier on Monday, detectives from the Metropolitan police\u2019s specialist crime command had a virtual meeting with BBC representatives to discuss the allegations against the presenter. The Met does not consider the threshold for a criminal investigation to have yet been reached. In a statement it made clear the force would carry out further work, but falling short of a formal criminal investigation that would give officers powers of arrest and search. Detectives are trying to work out what, if any, criminal offence may have been committed by the suspended presenter. A police spokesperson said: \u201cThey are assessing the information discussed at the meeting and further inquiries are taking place to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed. There is no investigation at this time.\u201d The statement suggests the police are still at the \u201cscoping\u201d stage of the inquiry, where they do not commit to a particular course of action, but leave open the option of launching a full investigation. The Sun\u2019s decision not to name the presenter has had other consequences, with prominent male BBC presenters making clear they are not the suspended individual. On Monday, the BBC presenter Nicky Campbell said he had been to police over false social media claims that he was the suspended individual. Campbell said he had had a \u201cdistressing weekend\u201d after being the subject of online smears and had made a report under the Malicious Communications Act."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fd8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/10/fox-news-tucker-carlson-ray-epps-jan-6-insurrection-lawsuit", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fox News may face lawsuit over Tucker Carlson\u2019s January 6 conspiracy theory", "lead": "Network could see \u2018fairly strong\u2019 suit from Ray Epps, who Carlson alleged was a secret government agent behind the attack", "author": "Gloria Oladipo", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 19:37:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954407", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/425587e8fecb908331b22b7acca1c4258cd00769/0_200_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Experts say conservative network Fox News could face a \u201ca fairly strong\u201d lawsuit from a man who Tucker Carlson repeatedly accused of working as a government agent and carrying out the January 6 insurrection. Carlson, who was fired from the network in April, repeatedly alleged that Ray Epps was a secret government agent who coordinated the January 6 riots, the New York Times reported. Epps, a Trump supporter and former marine, has been at the center of a far-right conspiracy theory after an article by a rightwing website argued that he was spared from criminal charges because of his covert role. Carlson and other rightwing figures, including members of Congress, have latched onto the false theory that Epps was a government agent involved in whipping up the January 6 attack. In almost 20 episodes of his talkshow, Carlson reiterated the conspiracy theory that Epps was an undercover operative who \u201chelped stage-manage the insurrection\u201d. Carlson repeatedly argued that Epps was recorded on camera urging others to enter the Capitol, but never entered the building himself. In one 10-minute video posted to YouTube, Carlson claimed that it was \u201chighly strange\u201d that Epps hadn\u2019t been arrested and alluded that the Times\u2019 coverage on Epps was attempting to \u201ccover something up\u201d. Epps has been questioned by the January 6 committee, and could still face charges as the investigation continues, the Times reported. He and his wife have received death threats and fled from their home in Arizona, fearing for their safety, according to the Associated Press. Michael Teter, a lawyer representing Epps, sent Fox News network a cease-and-desist letter, demanding an on-air apology and a retraction of the conspiracy theory, the Times reported. Teter told the Times that Fox did not respond to their suit, and a lawsuit is being prepared against the network. Experts have said that Epps\u2019 potential case against Fox News could have standing and become a real issue for the conservative news network. David D Lin, an attorney at Lewis and Lin LLC Internet Law Counsel, told the Guardian that Epps\u2019 lawsuit against Fox could be viable and present a potential issue for the network. \u201cI think there is a lot of potential risk here to Fox and they need to take the claims very seriously,\u201d said Lin to the Guardian, adding that Carlson could be personally liable depending on if the lawsuit includes him. Siddartha Rao, a lawyer at Romano Law PLLC, called the potential suit \u201ca fairly strong claim\u201d. \u201cBased on the facts that have been reported, I think it\u2019s gonna look like Tucker Carlson at least recklessly disregarded the truth when he made his statements about Mr Epps,\u201d said Rao, adding that Epps will have to demonstrate how his reputation has been damaged by the theories. Rao noted that given that Epps did attend the January 6 riots, the focus of his legal team may be on Carlson\u2019s conspiracy theory of Epps\u2019 being a federal agent. Unlike Dominion, which is a business, Epps is a private individual who will have to meet a lower standard for defamation suits compared to a public figure or government official, said Lin. \u201cIn a sense, it could be much easier for him to pursue a defamation claim against Fox News,\u201d said Lin, adding that Epps needs to prove the statements made on Fox are false and caused damage to his reputation and financial damage. Lin added that if a lawsuit moves forward, Fox News could argue that statements made about Epps were an opinion or that the claims would be regarded as obviously false to listeners. Rao noted that while the lawsuit will likely be against Fox, Carlson could face consequences as an individual, depending on his arrangement with Fox. \u201cThere might be claims from Fox to come out against Carlson,\u201d said Rao, given that the alleged defamation happened during his show. Fox News and Tucker Carlson could not be reached by the Guardian for an immediate comment."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fd9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/tennis-wimbledon-novak-djokovic-centre-court", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Djokovic calls for Wimbledon to move start of play forward on Centre Court", "lead": "Novak Djokovic has called for the start of play on Wimbledon\u2019s Centre Court to be moved forward to midday from 1.30pm following scheduling issues", "author": "Paul MacInnes at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 19:25:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954426", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbb1631ba0ce7659245d7e446b8a9ed60a13811/0_0_4793_2877/500.jpg", "body": "Novak Djokovic has called for the start of play on Centre Court to be moved forward, following scheduling issues that led to his fourth-round match falling foul of an 11pm curfew. On Monday the Wimbledon champion completed his victory against the Polish No 17 seed Hubert Hurkacz in four sets, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (6), 5-7, 6-4, after the game was suspended overnight. Djokovic said uncertainty over when matches will take place has affected his preparations and that start times should be brought forward from 1.30pm to midday. \u201cThe matches could be pushed at least to start at 12pm,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would make a difference. Obviously curfew is probably something that is much more difficult to change, I understand, because of the community and the residential area we are in.\u201d Djokovic started his match against Hurkacz in still conditions under the roof at 9pm on Sunday, and finished with the roof open and a strong breeze the next day. \u201cOnce the time is over 8pm, you know that there\u2019s a high probability you won\u2019t finish your match,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI warmed up [for the match] around 1pm, something like this. Should you go back to the accommodation, the house nearby, or should you stay? Yesterday I decided to stay. I stayed basically for seven hours waiting for my match to start. That\u2019s a lot.\u201d Earlier on Monday the chief executive of the All England Club, Sally Bolton, had defended the start times, which also affected the second-round match between Andy Murray and Stefanos Tsitsipas, with the Greek reversing an overnight deficit to win. Bolton said timings will be looked at as part of the Championships annual review but insisted an afternoon start was part of Wimbledon\u2019s heritage and popular with ticket holders and television audiences. \u201cEvery year we look at everything, and we get feedback from all of our guest groups, from the player groups and from all of our stakeholders,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so in the same way, as we always do, we will have a look at that beyond this year\u2019s Championships. \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve always started play on our show courts around early afternoon. And that\u2019s very much about ensuring people have the opportunity to get on court, so ... we have full courts for when the players will come. That\u2019s still absolutely our intention. \u201cThe other thing we think about carefully is the fact that when people buy tickets and come to Wimbledon, they want to experience a day at the Championships. That involves seeing some play on outside courts, perhaps getting something to eat, getting some strawberries and cream, we understand that our guests want that whole day. \u201cAs far as the TV audience is concerned, matches are happening at a time when they\u2019re accessible to people. We\u2019re seeing viewing figures that are beyond our expectations and beyond previous years.\u201d The BBC does not release complete viewing figures until the end of the tournament but the most viewed match so far was Murray\u2019s late-night encounter with Tsitsipas that drew 5 million viewers. This compares with 7.5 million for the men\u2019s final last year, and 3.1 million for the women\u2019s. Statistics also show scheduling is being affected by the fact matches in both draws are taking longer. The average length of a men\u2019s match at the Championships is now 156 minutes, up from 132 a decade ago. In the women\u2019s draw, the average this year is 102min, the first time it has surpassed the 100min mark, and up from 93min in 2013. A further, more traditional, problem is the impact of rain, with more predicted this week. But yesterday on Monday the matches moved swiftly and fans enjoyed the sun, tennis and other entertainments. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that some matches don\u2019t finish on the day,\u201d said Philippa Baker, a ticket holder on Centre Court, \u201cbut that\u2019s probably more the case for the players, because some can cope with the changes better than others. For spectators, it\u2019s the gaps between matches which are the problem. They\u2019re too short to nip out for strawberries and champagne.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fda", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/10/apologies-unforthcoming-as-privileges-committee-special-report-is-debated", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Apologies unforthcoming as privileges committee special report is debated", "lead": "Rishi was missing in action.

(Part \u2026 You tell me). I\u2019ve rather lost count. But we must be well into double figures. Yet again, when the prime minister had the opportunity to demonstrate his own integrity, professionalism and accountability he was missing in action. Here was the chance to turn up to the debate on the special report by the privileges committee on the behaviour of seven of his MPs during the inquiry into Boris Johnson lying to parliament. He didn\u2019t need to make a long speech. Just a couple of sentences to say that he accepted the committee\u2019s findings. Asking his MPs to apologise would have been a bonus. But no. Rishi Sunak was nowhere to be seen anywhere near the Commons. Then he seldom is. Perhaps he\u2019s phobic. In which case, someone please find him a good therapist. I could recommend a few. He even wanted it on record that he couldn\u2019t possibly comment on the report, as he hadn\u2019t read it. Though it\u2019s only a few pages long and you\u2019d have thought he might have an interest in the misdeeds of his own party. And he had managed to ask Zac Goldsmith, who had also been named, to say sorry without apparently knowing what for. Go figure. And he had also made sure his flight to Vilnius for the Nato summit left a few hours early so he could miss the vote. So brave. An inspiration to us all. So it was left to Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the house, to open the debate for the government. Behind her on the Tory benches were six of the accused. Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel, Andrea Jenkyns, Michael Fabricant, Mark Jenkinson and Brendan Clarke-Smith. There was no sign of Nadine Dorries. There never is. She\u2019s even more of a stranger to the Commons than Rish! She keeps threatening to resign as an MP but never does. Just sobs and sighs over the peerage that never was. Can\u2019t think why she was overlooked. Mordaunt got the debate under way with a brief statement. The privileges committee performed an important role in parliament. There was nothing wrong with constructive criticism of the committee but this had gone way beyond that. Its reputation had been impugned with sustained interference. She wanted an end to the whole sorry episode. If Lord Castlereagh and George Canning could be polite to each other after fighting a duel, was it too much to hope today\u2019s MPs could do likewise? She hoped those who had been named would reflect on their actions. Fat chance. Rather they all looked ready to double down. As did many of their supporters in the Commons. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader, had barely started her speech in reply than the interventions began to pile up. Desmond Swayne demanded proof that there had been a coordinated campaign to undermine the committee. He was adamant that it had all been a total coincidence. Just like it was a total coincidence that more than half \u2013 not to mention the Desperate Dorries \u2013 of those accused had ended up on Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. Parliament moves in mysterious ways. You\u2019d have Des down as one of the dimmer MPs. Though that would have been a disservice to Andrea Jenkyns, who would speak later. She can only aspire to mediocrity. Talking of which \u2026 Next up was Lia Nici. Was it fair that the Not-So Secret Seven had been investigated without their knowledge? What should have happened was that they all should have been told they were to be named before they had been given a chance to impugn the committee. They would have been given an opportunity not to say the things they had said. It\u2019s not clear which space-time continuum Nici is on. Safe to say it\u2019s not one that contains other sentient beings. So Craig Mackinlay is probably on it. His telling contribution was to say that Johnson was so last week and it was time for everyone to forget about everything that might have happened. The calibre of MPs speaking out for the right to trash the committee was \u2013 let\u2019s call it niche. With friends like these \u2026 First of the accused to speak was Jacob Rees-Mogg. In his mind, he is an iconoclast. A comedic and intellectual giant. In reality, he\u2019s just delusional. A tired bore. A man stuck in an imagined Oxbridge of his youth. It had all just been a piece of fun. The epitome of free speech. All he had ever done was offer mild criticism. A committee member, Allan Dorans, had to remind him he had accused the committee of being a kangaroo court \u2013 corrupt \u2013 and that he and other members had had to review their security. Rees-Mogg just ploughed on. Getting laughs from the intellectually challenged but disapproval from the rest of the House. He should learn to read the room. He had imagined the clerks would be swooning that he had found fault with Erskine May. They weren\u2019t. They looked totally fed up. Rees-Mogg would have done better to have simply apologised for overstepping the mark. But that would have taken some class. Something Jakey lacks. It was all just a game to him. But he was only the first in line. Jenkinson interrupted Harriet Harman, the committee chair who had been explaining how the committee had reached its conclusions, to say that he had never called the inquiry a witch-hunt. It was pointed out to him he had used those exact words in a tweet. Oh, he said. That tweet. He had been referring to a completely different witch-hunt even though the Twitter thread clearly referenced the privileges committee. So it went on. Fabricant was adamant he hadn\u2019t said the committee was riddled with \u201cmalice and prejudice\u201d. That was a fantasy from a parallel universe. He talks of honour, when he has none. Patel denied all knowledge of impugning the committee. That had only happened on GB News so it also can\u2019t have happened. Or if it did then nobody saw it, which was much the same. The real baddy in all this was the Guardian for reporting the committee\u2019s findings. So it was my fault all along. Then came Andrea. She at least had a legitimate defence. She was too stupid to remember what she had and hadn\u2019t said and so she couldn\u2019t apologise for anything. Several MPs had to talk her down. Too much psilocybin. Or something. It was all too shabby for words. Long before the end, Harman looked to be in tears. Unable to get most Tories even to say sorry. This parliament and this government have gone on plenty long enough."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fdb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2023/jul/10/bbc-investigation-suspended-presenter-police-latest-updates", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Claims against BBC presenter are \u2018rubbish\u2019, says letter from young person\u2019s lawyer, BBC reports \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "\u2018Nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place\u2019, letter from lawyer acting for young person says, according to BBC report", "author": "Tom Ambrose (now); Martin Belam and Kevin Rawlinson (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 19:00:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954463", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/daf85670e9c2f93e37b4fafbc947e9fd2e1539a0/0_55_3304_1982/500.jpg", "body": "That\u2019s all from this liveblog for this evening.

Read the full story here. For a summary of the day\u2019s events, see here. Goodnight. My colleague Jim Waterson, our media editor, has this round-up of the latest developments: The young person at the centre of a scandal over a suspended BBC presenter has issued a statement in which he claimed the main allegations are \u201crubbish\u201d. A prominent male BBC presenter was suspended at the weekend after the young person\u2019s mother went to the Sun newspaper with claims the presenter spent \u00a335,000 over three years buying explicit images from her child, who is now 20. She alleged the presenter first began talking to her child when they were 17. The young person\u2019s lawyer has now issued a statement denying their mother\u2019s claims: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place between our client and the BBC personality and the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish.\u201d The lawyer told BBC News they provided a similar statement to the Sun on Friday via WhatsApp telling the tabloid there was \u201cno truth to it\u201d. The tabloid went ahead and published its story, which threw the BBC into a new crisis. A spokesperson for the Sun said: \u201cWe have reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child. Their complaint was not acted upon by the BBC. We have seen evidence that supports their concerns.

Here is a reminder of the main statements that have been released over the course of this afternoon The BBC claimed it had received a letter from a lawyer representing the young person involved in the story. It read: For the avoidance of doubt, nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place between our client and the BBC personality and the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish. The BBC also reported: \u201cThe young person sent a denial to the Sun on Friday evening saying there was \u2018no truth to it\u2019. However, the \u2018inappropriate article\u2019 was still published, the lawyer said.\u201d The Sun responded to this claim, stating: We have reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child. Their complaint was not acted upon by the BBC. We have seen evidence that supports their concerns. It\u2019s now for the BBC to properly investigate. Earlier the Metropolitan police said: Detectives from the Met\u2019s specialist crime command met with representatives from the BBC on the morning of Monday 10 July. The meeting took place virtually. They are assessing the information discussed at the meeting and further enquiries are taking place to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed. There is no investigation at this time. The BBC report is carrying additional detail about the letter from a lawyer acting for the young person involved in the case. It writes that: The young person sent a denial to the Sun on Friday evening saying there was \u201cno truth to it\u201d. However, the \u201cinappropriate article\u201d was still published, the lawyer said. There is also a comment from the Sun, which appears to have been offered a right to reply by the BBC about the new information. The BBC quotes the Sun spokesperson saying: We have reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child. Their complaint was not acted upon by the BBC. We have seen evidence that supports their concerns. It\u2019s now for the BBC to properly investigate. The BBC has reported that the claims against an unnamed male presenter who has been suspended have been described as \u201crubbish\u201d by a lawyer acting for the young person said to be involved in the case. It quotes the letter saying: For the avoidance of doubt, nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place between our client and the BBC personality, and the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish. The Metropolitan police have said there is no investigation \u201cat this time\u201d into allegations a male BBC presenter spent \u00a335,000 on explicit photographs from a young person. A statement from the police followed a virtual meeting with the BBC, with the Met claiming: \u201cDetectives from the Met\u2019s specialist crime command met with representatives from the BBC on the morning of Monday 10 July. The meeting took place virtually. They are assessing the information discussed at the meeting and further enquiries are taking place to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed. There is no investigation at this time. Media outlets are yet to name the presenter, despite widespread speculation about their identity on social media and messaging apps. There is not believed to be any court order or injunction banning publication of the individual\u2019s name. Instead, the legal risk of linking a prominent person to serious allegations has stopped mainstream news outlets from putting the name in the public domain. The BBC director general, Tim Davie, has said a set of allegations was made in May, followed by further claims \u201cof a different nature\u201d last Thursday. The presenter remained on air until last week, when journalists at the Sun approached the BBC for comment. BBC News reported on Monday that it understood that Davie had not himself been told of the allegations until last Thursday. Alex Chalk urged the broadcaster to \u201cget on with\u201d its part in any investigation. The justice secretary said the public would \u201cexpect allegations of that nature to be dealt with very robustly and promptly\u201d. Nicky Campbell has made a crime report to the police after being falsely accused of being the presenter involved. Campbell said he had had a \u201cdistressing weekend\u201d after being falsely named. Other leading BBC presenters have also felt forced to distance themselves from the story. The claims were first reported by the Sun, which said the presenter paid the young person a total of \u00a335,000 for sexually explicit images over the course of three years \u2013 money that was used to fund their crack cocaine habit. On Monday, the paper reported that the presenter had called the young person after the first press reports appeared. It said the presenter asked: \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d And it was claimed he asked them to call their mother to get her to \u201cstop the investigation\u201d. Craig Oliver, the former director of communications for David Cameron, has appeared on Sky News describing the political side of the row as \u201ca bit of a distraction\u201d, but had some questions about the way the BBC has handled the complaint. He told viewers that he thought the name might not emerge quickly, saying: \u201cI think it is possible it could go on for some time. The BBC doesn\u2019t want to put itself into a position of breaching a duty of care to one of it employees.\u201d He said: \u201cThe sheer speed at which social media operates is clashing with the speed the BBC can operate at.\u201d Suggesting that the corporation \u2013 not just the presenter \u2013 was under intense scrutiny, he said: \u201cThese questions will only come out in the inevitable inquiry that follows. This isn\u2019t a question of bad faith, but whether the BBC\u2019s systems are fit for purpose in a social media world.\u201d Citing the row over Gary Lineker\u2019s tweets, he said \u201cIt is not the first time the BBC has come up against this. Is the old organisation of the BBC capable of coming up against the modern world?\u201d Here is a reminder from my colleague Jim Waterson on why the name of the BBC presenter has so far not been published by any UK-based media outlet: There are two main legal issues for news outlets to weigh up on the story: First, there is the defamation risk of libelling the presenter by reporting false allegations. Any media organisation needs to be confident that it knows the identity of the presenter and also that it has the material to back up the allegations that are being made. Secondly \u2013 and perhaps more importantly in this case \u2013 is the growing shift towards privacy in the English and Welsh legal system. In the past, British newspapers were known globally for their wilful disregard for privacy, happily exposing extramarital affairs and gleefully diving into the private lives of celebrities and members of the public if they felt it would sell more copies. This often went too far, such as in the case of the former Bristol schoolteacher Christopher Jeffries, who was wrongly arrested in relation to the murder of his tenant and vilified in the tabloid press before being released without charge. After a series of rulings over the past decade, judges have made clear they increasingly prioritise the rights of an individual over the media\u2019s right to report intrusive details. One significant change was Cliff Richard\u2019s 2018 legal victory over the BBC. The broadcaster hired a helicopter to provide live coverage of police raiding his home. Richard was never charged with any offences and a judge ruled that the BBC had unfairly invaded his privacy by naming him as an individual who was under investigation by the police. Detectives are assessing information discussed in a virtual meeting with the BBC over allegations a presenter paid a teenager for sexual images but there is no investigation \u201cat this time\u201d, the Metropolitan police have said in a statement. PA Media reports a Met statement said: \u201cDetectives from the Met\u2019s specialist crime command met with representatives from the BBC on the morning of Monday 10 July. The meeting took place virtually. \u201cThey are assessing the information discussed at the meeting and further enquiries are taking place to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed. \u201cThere is no investigation at this time.\u201d Media outlets have not named the male BBC presenter who allegedly spent \u00a335,000 on explicit photographs from a young person, despite widespread speculation about their identity on social media and messaging apps. The BBC says it is carrying out an internal investigation and has contacted the Metropolitan police. The justice secretary, Alex Chalk, urged the broadcaster to \u201cget on with\u201d its part in any investigation. Chalk said the public would \u201cexpect allegations of that nature to be dealt with very robustly and promptly\u201d, telling Sky News that \u201cit may be that, in the fullness of time, there will need to be an investigation about how this allegation was handled\u201d. There is not believed to be any court order or injunction banning publication of the individual\u2019s name. Instead, the legal risk of linking a prominent person to serious allegations has stopped mainstream news outlets from putting the name in the public domain. The BBC director general, Tim Davie, has said a set of allegations was made in May, followed by further claims \u201cof a different nature\u201d last Thursday. The presenter remained on air until last week, when journalists at the Sun approached the BBC for comment. BBC News reported on Monday that it understood that Davie had not himself been told of the allegations until last Thursday. Nicky Campbell has made a crime report to the police after being falsely accused of being the presenter involved. Campbell said he had had a \u201cdistressing weekend\u201d after being falsely named. Other leading BBC presenters have also felt forced to distance themselves from the story. The claims were first reported by the Sun, which said the presenter paid the young person a total of \u00a335,000 for sexually explicit images over the course of three years \u2013 money that was used to fund their crack cocaine habit. On Monday, the paper reported that the presenter had called the young person after the first press reports appeared. It said the presenter asked: \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d And it was claimed he asked them to call their mother to get her to \u201cstop the investigation\u201d. Almost all the known details about the case have come from reports in the Sun newspaper. The tabloid\u2019s reporting is based on anonymous quotes from the mother of the young person involved, making it difficult for other news outlets to independently establish the facts. Persephone Bridgman Baker, a partner at Carter-Ruck, has spoken on Sky News about the legal situation, reminding viewers why the name of the presenter has been kept from the public eye so far. She said: There is a legal right to privacy. That right extends to protect the anonymity of a suspect. That is settled law. And that goes back to the Cliff Richard case. It may be, of course, that it is only a matter of time before their suspension makes it obvious who it is. She also cautioned people on the legal risk of naming people on social media in association with the case, saying: It is of course just speculation, but if someone makes false allegations online, whether as a major publisher or a \u2018citizen journalist\u2019, there may be difficult and costly ramifications down the line. Downing Street also warned social media sites to ensure their platforms were \u201cproperly policed\u201d, following baseless accusations against various BBC personalities after the reports. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: Both the users of social media sites and the sites themselves have responsibility. People \u201cshould understand their responsibilities, and putting baseless accusations online can carry consequences\u201d. The spokesperson added: We have been very clear with the sites themselves about their responsibilities on making sure these things are properly policed. The prime minister Rishi Sunak has full confidence in the BBC\u2019s director general Tim Davie following the allegations made against a male presenter, Downing Street says. The culture secretary Lucy Frazer will keep a \u201cclose watch\u201d on the handling of the claims, No 10 adds. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: Obviously, these allegations are concerning. The secretary of state (Lucy Frazer) spoke to the director general yesterday and was assured that the BBC is investigating this matter swiftly. The Met themselves have said they have received initial contact as well. The culture secretary will keep a close watch on how this develops and ensure she is regularly updated as appropriate. Asked if the prime minister had full confidence in Davie, the spokesman said: \u201cYes.\u201d Nicky Campbell has spoken about his \u201cdistressing weekend\u201d after he was \u201cfalsely named\u201d as the BBC presenter accused of paying a teenager for sexually explicit pictures. He was among several who have felt compelled to clear their names in recent days after the BBC confirmed a presenter had been suspended, but declined to say who. Introducing his BBC Radio 5 Live show on Monday, Campbell said: Obviously, thoughts with the alleged victim and family. So a bit of perspective here, worse things happen at sea as they say, but it was a distressing weekend, I can\u2019t deny it, for me and others falsely named. Today, I am having further conversations with the police in terms of malicious communication and with lawyers in terms of defamation. It comes after he suggested he had contacted police about being falsely mentioned online in connection with the story. He tweeted a screenshot which featured the Metropolitan police logo and the words: \u201cThank you for contacting the Metropolitan police service to report your crime.\u201d He wrote: I think it\u2019s important to take a stand. There\u2019s just too many of these people on social media. Thanks for your support friends. On his BBC radio show, a caller rang to say she was \u201cso angry and cross\u201d that Campbell and others had to come forward and clear their names. Campbell responded: I\u2019m all good, Jeremy (Vine) and also others involved as well, Rylan (Clark) and also Gary (Lineker), yeah it\u2019s uncomfortable but as I said earlier worse things happen at sea. We\u2019re big boys. Lineker, Clark and Vine have all said they are not the presenter in question. The presenter John Kay has also made clear his absence is due to a pre-planned holiday. Chalk also said he would have expected the BBC to have suspended the unnamed presenter as soon as allegations that they paid the teenager for sexually explicit images were made. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Once allegations of this seriousness and concern are raised and the BBC are aware of them, yes, I would expect them to move to suspension. But I don\u2019t know the precise facts and I think it is quite important that we don\u2019t speculate out of fairness to all parties. Pressed on whether he was saying a suspension should have been made at the point the allegations were known about, Chalk said: Yes, other things being equal, yes, I would have expected that. While Braverman was keen to push for a faster resolution, she said nothing should be allowed to unduly affect the investigation. She told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: These are obviously very serious allegations. I think it is right that we allow the process to play out in the proper way. The BBC has announced that they are carrying out an internal investigation to establish the facts. We need to allow that to happen. I wouldn\u2019t want to go behind that or pre-empt any finding. Braverman said the BBC was carrying out a fact-finding investigation and it was \u201cimportant to let that play out before we jump to any conclusion\u201d. We also know that the police have been in touch with the BBC \u2013 there is going to be a meeting today on what next steps should occur. And again, I think if the police are going to carry out an investigation, this is something that should be allowed to happen. These are very serious allegations, we need to treat them with due caution and seriousness. The BBC needs to get its \u201chouse in order\u201d or else there could be \u201ccollateral victims\u201d, Chalk said. He told BBC Breakfast: I\u2019m pleased to hear that such serious and concerning allegations are being discussed with the police today. That is fine, but I think \u2013 in the fullness of time \u2013 there will need to be a careful review about the chronology of this. What happened, when? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions because I don\u2019t have all that information. But time is of the essence because it is not fair on victims, it is not fair on people who could be implicated and it is not fair on the BBC, which does an important job. I\u2019m not here, as it were, to bash the BBC. But I do think that they need to get their house in order and they need to proceed promptly, otherwise you will have plenty of collateral victims of what is a deeply serious and concerning allegation. Asked what he meant about the BBC \u201cneeding to get its house in order\u201d, Chalk added: What it means very simply is this: when serious and concerning allegations are made, they need to be investigated promptly and commensurate with the seriousness of them. If the reports are to be believed, even if they are half as serious as are alleged, then you would expect the BBC to respond promptly. Chalk also said a \u201cfull investigation\u201d is required before deciding whether there\u2019s a public interest in naming the BBC presenter. He told Sky News: This is quite a difficult, nuanced legal issue. I\u2019m not going to criticise them at this stage because it will depend on all sorts of things. So, for example, if an allegation were made against you and it was of an extremely serious nature, then I don\u2019t think it would necessarily be appropriate to name you immediately until there had been a full investigation. And that is why, if I may say so, it is really important that time is of the essence because there is a public interest in this, I accept that. But, equally, there is a public interest in ensuring that people aren\u2019t defamed as well. So it is a matter of fact and degree. Not every single immediate allegation would need to lead to that person being unmasked, so to speak. But the process does need to continue so there is sufficient detail in that investigation to potentially justify that important step. Once the allegation is publicly made and that individual is unmasked, the consequences can be very serious, to say nothing of the potential legal knock-on implications. An investigation into how the BBC handled the allegations might be needed in the future, Chalk has said. He told Sky News: These are very serious and concerning allegations. You ask me as a parent \u2013 I would be extremely concerned about that. I don\u2019t know precisely what was said and at what time, but certainly you would expect allegations of that nature to be dealt with very robustly and promptly. He said it was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d that BBC representatives were due to meet with police on Monday. And it may be that, in the fullness of time, there will need to be an investigation about how this allegation was handled. That is quite possible. But, right now, I think it is important in the interest of that complainant that this is dealt with as quickly and fairly and robustly as possible. Prompt action is \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d in cases of serious allegations, such as those made against the unnamed BBC presenter, the home secretary Suella Braverman has said. Asked on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain if she knew why the process had taken \u201cso long\u201d after a complaint was first raised in May, she said: We don\u2019t know the facts yet, a lot of it is speculative. In a case of serious allegations such as these, prompt action is, of course, absolutely vital for safeguarding purposes, for justice purposes, but also for propriety purposes. That came as the justice secretary Alex Chalk said he wanted the BBC to \u201cget on with it\u201d when asked about the progress of the internal investigation. Braverman was careful to say investigations should be allowed to take their course before people \u201cjump to any conclusion\u201d. These are obviously very serious allegations. I think it is right that we allow the process to play out in the proper way. The BBC has announced that they are carrying out an internal investigation to establish the facts. We need to allow that to happen. I wouldn\u2019t want to go behind that or pre-empt any finding."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fdc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/10/andres-iniesta-goodbye-japan-vissel-kobe", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\u2019s Japan adventure ends with sense of unfulfilled promise", "lead": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta did not help Vissel Kobe reach stated aim of being the biggest club in Asia but there was plenty to enjoy along the way", "author": "John Duerden", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 19:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954481", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/179c7eedcb914c9cdda93fc14a269aaba4388785/0_272_4595_2757/500.jpg", "body": "Just as Saudi Arabia is saying hello to big names from around the world, the kingdom\u2019s rival for the title of having the best league in Asia is saying goodbye to its one megastar. \u201cI came here in 2018 to fulfil the promise of making this club big, I feel I\u2019ve managed to achieve that,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Iniesta as he bade farewell to Vissel Kobe after his final appearance for the Japanese club in front of 27,000 fans at Noevir Stadium, Kobe\u2019s biggest attendance since 2004. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve given my maximum both on and off the pitch.\u201d Few would disagree with the second statement, even if there were diminishing returns, unsurprising given Iniesta is now 39. The first statement is debatable, however. The goal of the Kansai club, flush with Rakuten\u2019s funds, was to not only become a big club in Asia but the club in Asia. That was always going to be tough, even with the presence of a legendary midfielder in their ranks, someone who scored the winning goal in a World Cup final and helped Barcelona secure four Champions League titles. Previously, Kobe had never managed even a top-six finish in the J League and had been, at best, a middling force at home while completely unknown overseas. That certainly changed with Iniesta\u2019s arrival, with many expecting him to head to China instead. Almost 10,000 fans came out to greet him in May 2018 as he talked of leading his new team to domestic and continental championships. Off the pitch, he always did and said what was expected. On it, Iniesta was pretty good. There were some fine goals, assists, passes and all-round performances, such as in the 5-3 win over Nagoya Grampus. He helped sell out stadiums across the country in those early days and the Iniesta effect might have lasted longer had Covid not intervened and Kobe not gone through managers at a rapid rate. Perhaps his greatest and most lasting contribution was helping a number of talented youngsters on their way. Kyogo Furuhashi certainly learned from playing alongside him before leaving for Celtic in 2021. \u201cBefore our season kicked off, Iniesta said to me: \u2018Just be yourself and all will be well \u2013 play with confidence\u2019,\u201d Furuhashi said. \u201cIt really inspired me to let my confident side show on the pitch.\u201d Even with such talent \u2013 there were other Europeans at Kobe, including Lukas Podolski, David Villa and Thomas Vermaelen \u2013 the club could not achieve its ambitions. In Iniesta\u2019s six seasons, there was no title challenge, with a third-place finish the highest. The others were all similar to the mid-table efforts the club managed before 2018. The big triumph was winning the Emperor\u2019s Cup on the first day of 2020 in front of almost 60,000 in Tokyo, a first trophy to take back to Kansai. It also earned a place in the Asian Champions League, when Kobe got to the last four. Those were the highlights, good ones especially if they were staging posts along the journey to become the No 1 club in Asia. But if that is to happen then it will be without the Spaniard. In the first 17 games of the 2023 season, Iniesta managed 38 minutes on the pitch, which is the reason for the mid-season sayonara. Credit to the player whose contract was due to end in December \u2013 he chose to leave early in order to play more. The next destination has yet to be revealed. Without Iniesta, Kobe have been doing well and on 1 July would have gone top had they defeated Consadole Sapporo at home. This was billed as Iniesta\u2019s big goodbye. While fans prepared banners and tifos, the club tried to make as much money as possible, asking almost \u00a350,000 (the equivalent of 8.8m yen, an intentional amount in tribute to Iniesta\u2019s No 8 shirt) for two people to have the full Platinum VVIP package, which included a meet and greet with the man himself. There were no takers, but there were some for the gold package, which cost close to \u00a35,000. Was it because of the sums paid and the buildup that Iniesta made his first start of the season while top-scorer Yuya Osako dropped to the bench? Whatever the answer, it was the wrong move. Iniesta was a peripheral figure in the first half as Sapporo took the lead and was withdrawn after 57 minutes, leaving the pitch to a standing ovation and handshakes from colleagues and coaching staff. Iniesta\u2019s time in Japan didn\u2019t end on the pitch but on the bench as he watched his team fight back for a point. It showed it was time to go. \u201cThe last few months have been a really tough period both for me and those close to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the desire to retire and close my career while playing on the pitch, and I\u2019m taking my next step in accordance with that emotion.\u201d Neither party got quite what they wanted out of the arrangement. Iniesta started well but then faded and Kobe are still far from being Asia\u2019s biggest club, but there was plenty to enjoy along the way."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fdd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/wimbledon-tennis-fines-unsporting-behaviour", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Number of player fines for bad behaviour at Wimbledon down on 2022", "lead": "Offences in first week of tournament only a third of what they were last year, says All England Lawn Tennis Club", "author": "Geneva Abdul", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 18:59:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954498", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8277077206bf960d0bbb1685cf46c30a127444db/0_341_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "There has been a decline in the number of player fines at Wimbledon in 2023 compared with the same period at last year\u2019s tournament, according to the latest figures from the All England Lawn Tennis Club. While the first week of the this year\u2019s championship saw obscenities uttered and the abuse of rackets and equipment, the offences only reached a third of the fines from bad behaviour that punctuated the tournament in the same period in 2022. In the first week there were five fines from male singles players totalling $15,000 (\u00a311,500), including offences of audible obscenity and abuse of rackets and equipment, as of Monday, according to the AELTC. For the same period last year, players committed 16 offences, totalling $66,500. Among them, unsportsmanlike conduct was the most frequent offence, followed by audible obscenity and abuse of rackets and equipment. While attenders at this year\u2019s event said they saw no difference in players\u2019 behaviour, others noted the majority of players were abiding by the rules, which some argued had left the tournament with more \u201csterile\u201d personalities when compared to those of the past. \u201cI\u2019m nearly here every year, I think there\u2019s no difference, I think it\u2019s the same,\u201d said Nicholas Cheung, who lives in London and has been to Wimbledon more than a dozen times. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the game, it just makes the game more interesting,\u201d he added awaiting entry to watch Chris Eubanks take on Stefanos Tsitsipas. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s no big interference it\u2019s just entertainment.\u201d Wimbledon has so far placed itself at odds with studies showing that the abuse of sporting officials is getting worse. Last year, Nick Kyrgios \u2013 absent this year due to injury \u2013 received fines after calling one female umpire the \u201cworst I have ever seen\u201d. He also spat in the direction of a fan, who he said constantly \u201cdisrespected\u201d him, during a first-round match. Rajesh Rai, who was visiting from Tunbridge Wells with his 16-year-old daughter, said the players were role models, and their behaviour on the court would affect the players that followed. \u201cTennis is more of a gentleman\u2019s game actually, it\u2019s not a football game, you don\u2019t see all those behaviours here,\u201d said Rai after watching Mirra Andreeva\u2019s fourth-round loss. The 16-year-old received a point penalty for throwing her racket and then refused to shake the umpire\u2019s hand.

She liked the idea of players showing \u201csome personality \u2013 not being an absolute zombie which feels like some of them are\u201d. From the matches they\u2019ve seen so far, her husband Tony agreed that it\u2019s been a tamer Wimbledon. \u201cBad behaviour\u2019s not great,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s sometimes nice to see people express themselves.\u201d The AELTC declined to comment."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fde", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/elena-rybakina-wimbledon-quarter-finals-ons-jabeur-petra-kvitova", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jabeur sets up \u2018revenge\u2019 mission against Rybakina after cruising past Kvitova ", "lead": "The Tunisian defeated Petra Kvitova 6-0, 6-3 to set up a quarter-final with <br>Elena Rybakina, who had a walkover against an injured Beatriz Haddad Maia", "author": "Hannah Jane Parkinson at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 18:26:28", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954516", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/99dc6031b9fa5a3858d07dbf1d66a5034294cdda/0_20_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "It was a story of surprise and disappointment on Centre Court on the second Monday at SW19, as two of the women\u2019s fourth-round matches ended in both \u2013 for different reasons. In the first match on a sunny but breezy afternoon, the defending champion Elena Rybakina took on Beatriz Haddad Maia, the underdog but nevertheless a two-time previous conquerer of Rybakina and a player who excels on grass. Last year, she won back-to-back grass-court tournaments (Nottingham and Birmingham). But any hope of a blockbuster encounter was thwarted early on when, in the fourth game, Haddad Maia was broken after shunting a forehand into the net, and immediately grimaced and grasped her lower back. She trudged off court for a medical time out, and gamely tried to continue on her return with the score at 1-3. But a 40-0 service game from her Moscow-born Kazakhstani opponent for a 1-4 deficit proved the writing on the wall, with Haddad Maia barely able to move or rotate. In tears, she approached the net and was consoled by a sympathetic Rybakina and loudly applauded by a disappointed crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to finish a match like that,\u201d Rybakina said in her on-court interview, and offered kind words for her stricken opponent. \u201cIt just seemed one moment and it\u2019s just really unlucky for Beatriz. I am just happy to play another round.\u201d Later, Ons Jabeur \u2013 the sixth seed who was defeated in three sets by Rybakina in last year\u2019s final \u2013 took on Petra Kvitova, a Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014. Kvitova, at 33, is still going strong. At the Miami Open in April she won her 30th career title and her ninth Masters (her adversary then? Rybakina). Jabeur, meanwhile, who has a picture of the famous Venus Rosewater dish as her phone background for inspiration, and whose genial personality and fun style of play has made her a fan favourite, had a blip of form early in the year, knocked out in the second round of the Australian Open. But her performances this past week have been sublime. Here she routed Kvitova, including a first-set bagel which lasted a mere 21 minutes, barely long enough to finish one\u2019s Pimm\u2019s. She took the first break with a mixture of her own super-light touch drop shots, and Kvitova\u2019s unforced errors, and was relentless from then on. That Jabeur managed to take the set 6-0 with a first-serve percentage under 40% was testament to her creative play, scurrying court coverage and the extraordinary lack of control coming off her Czech opponent\u2019s racket. Kvitova hit just a single winner and won 11 points in total in the first set. Kvitova was in trouble not long into the second set, digging herself a hole when she lost her serve yet again, to trail 1-3. The crowd, already somewhat downbeat after the opening women\u2019s match was cut short, were quiet. But they perked up when Jabeur volleyed a dead ball after a service fault, in the manner of her football hero Cristiano Ronaldo. With a stunning down-the-line forehand winner, Jabeur went on to earn another break to go 4-1 up, sealed with a fist pump and a look towards her box where her husband (also her trainer) applauded. A double fault in the following service game from Jabeur brought a first break-back point for Kvitova, which she was gifted as Jabeur hit a forehand into the net. But there remained a cushion. Later, she held on with a 40-love hold to lead 5-3, and brought up three break points \u2013 match points \u2013 in the next, with a skip-and-a-jump forehand down-the-line off a Kvitova drop shot. She took the first to win 6-0, 6-3 as a Kvitova lob sailed wide. Now, she will play her quarter-final against Rybakina. \u201cI\u2019m going for my revenge,\u201d Jabeur, who is known as the Minister of Happiness back home in Tunisia, told the adoring crowd. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to play like today and get the win, because she\u2019s an amazing player. She\u2019s like boom boom all the time, no mercy.\u201d An accurate description of the performance she had just put in herself."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fdf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/wimbledon-diary-medvedev-derides-bbc-stats-and-andreeva-is-excused", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon diary: Medvedev derides BBC stats and Andreeva is excused | Paul MacInnes", "lead": "Stefanos Tsitsipas gets salty, Russian No 3 seed is a statistic sceptic and Andy Roddick defends rising star\u2019s outburst", "author": "Paul MacInnes at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 18:14:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954536", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8749a714d8531d35dff398e977206a5ae9cb58f4/152_83_3772_2264/500.jpg", "body": "The Neverending Tsitstory There has been a Tsitsipost.

We\u2019ll leave that to the Tsitsispeculators to work out, but suffice to say the story in question contained a picture of Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa dining at the London restaurant of cursed World Cup toucher Salt Bae. Simply the best punditry The Tsitislayer, Chris Eubanks, has been wowing the Wimbledon crowds with his \u201cgood touch for a big man\u201d play and generally charming demeanour. Before his sharp rise up the rankings this year, however, Eubanks had been pairing play with punditry for the Tennis Channel.

Andreeva excused by A-Rod Some disquiet over the point penalty handed out to the teenage sensation Mirra Andreeva. The new favourite of SW19 had people flocking to her defence after she was punished by the umpire for smashing her racket on the ground, only two points away from defeat (make that one point). But some commentary carries more weight than others. While many social media users were happy to claim that Andreeva hurled the racket by accident, only one was a US Open champion. Andy Roddick\u2019s reply to the Tennis Channel account (yes, them again) on whether the referee was right to punish Andreeva? \u201cI don\u2019t think she does the racket thing if she doesn\u2019t slip.

Michael Dugher, the chief executive of the Betting &amp; Gaming Council (BGC), is to be questioned by MPs on the select committee for culture, media and sport on Tuesday as part of a review of government proposals to improve gambling regulation. On Monday afternoon, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Foster wrote to members of the committee to raise concerns about the BGC\u2019s reliability. In the letter, shared with the Guardian, Foster referred to a BGC press release about a report it had commissioned that pointed to a spike in the use of illegal betting sites between November and December 2022, during the World Cup in Qatar. In the press release, the lobby group said the report showed that punters could be driven into the arms of illegitimate gambling operators if government regulation of the sector went too far. However, the full report, which was written by the gambling analysis firm Yield Sec, was never published. A copy obtained by the Guardian showed the report described the overall penetration of the parallel market as \u201clow\u201d, despite the rise, and that it accounted for as little as 1% of overall UK gambling spend. Speaking after the press release was issued in January, Dugher said the report showed the government should beware of imposing \u201cblanket intrusive affordability checks\u201d, referring to proposed mandatory tests to check gamblers can cope with their losses. The report did not mention affordability checks as a cause of parallel market gambling. The majority of respondents to a survey commissioned by the Racing Post said people would turn to illicit sites if affordability checks were introduced. Foster told MPs on the committee he did not think the BGC had been \u201cfully accurate\u201d in its representation of the report, or the scale of the parallel market. He said: \u201cThe solution to addressing the black market is to introduce proper enforcement to disrupt the operations of these sites [\u2026] rather than abandoning much needed additional regulation of the gambling industry.\u201d Foster also raised concerns about \u201cother instances when the BGC has not been entirely accurate\u201d with regard to its position on regulations. In December 2022, Dugher tweeted that the lobby group had \u201cfully and publicly supported\u201d a ban on gambling with credit cards. However, a Gambling Commission paper published in 2020 said \u201cnone\u201d of the online gambling companies had supported such a measure during the consultation stage. The BGC has also repeatedly said a voluntary industry ban on advertising during sport shown on television TV reduced the volume of gambling adverts seen by children by 97%. In fact, the figure was 70%. The higher number referred only to the limited time period covered by the voluntary ban and only to television, caveats the BGC failed to make clear on several occasions. In April this year, after the government said it was considering a mandatory levy on gambling firms to fund addiction research, education and treatment, the BGC said its members would \u201cwelcome\u201d such a move. However, Dugher had written in May 2022 it would be a \u201cbig step backwards\u201d for tackling gambling-related harm. In a statement, the BGC said it had \u201cintroduced scores of new safer betting and gaming measures, including ensuring our members devote 20% of all TV and radio advertising to safer gambling messaging \u2013 backed by our groundbreaking Take Time to Think campaign. \u201cThe Yield Sec study was commissioned to analyse the scale of the growing, unsafe, unregulated gambling black market online and its findings were accurately reported.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fe1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/10/janet-dale-obituary", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Janet Dale obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Actor whose long career spanned the RSC, popular TV soaps and series, and several films", "author": "Jan Rocha", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 18:06:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954572", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/321c98de26bb12a9db97136c49707af09c4d05e6/480_495_2513_1508/500.jpg", "body": "My friend Janet Dale, who has died aged 79 of a brain tumour, was an incredibly versatile actor, her roles in 50 years of theatre and TV ranging from Shakespeare to Coronation Street, Chekhov to Casualty. In the 1970s, Janet starred in many of Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s plays at the Library theatre in Scarborough. In 1982, she was in the cast of the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s award-winning production of Nicholas Nickleby, a smash hit in both London and Broadway. She was nominated for the actress of the year in a new play Olivier award (1981), for her performance in Peter Whelan\u2019s The Accrington Pals, and for the Olivier award for outstanding performance of the year in a supporting role (1986), for her role in The Merry Wives of Windsor. In 1991, she starred in Alan Bennett\u2019s play The Madness of George III as Queen Charlotte. Janet was equally at home in her many roles in popular TV soaps and series including Coronation Street, Casualty, Holby City, Heartbeat, The Bill, Father Brown, The Buddha of Suburbia (1993) and The Mystery of Edwin Drood (2002). Born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, to Peggy (nee Wilcox), a further education teacher, and Alan Dale, a primary school headteacher, Janet moved to the West Country aged 11, when her father was made headteacher at a Somerset school. Her love of the theatre began with school plays, at Weston-super-Mare grammar school for girls, and continued in student productions at Bristol University, where she studied German and drama. She later joined the Northcott theatre in Exeter. Janet cared deeply about injustice and spent two years of her life, after leaving university, as a volunteer with the United Nations Association, working in Rio shantytowns and among destitute communities in Salvador, in north-east Brazil, which is where I first met her. She retained a lifelong interest in Brazil. When the Catholic leader H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara, branded \u201cthe red archbishop\u201d by the military dictatorship for declaring that poverty is violence, came to speak at the Roundhouse in Camden in 1969, she drove him in her rackety car across London to a church in Kew for a hastily arranged baptism of my baby, who became her godson, Camilo. An enthusiastic animal lover, after moving to the Cotswold village of Blockley she became a volunteer with the Cats Protection League.

Ralph worked first as a coach on a voluntary basis with local amateur clubs until, in the late 1970s, he began in a paid capacity with Manchester City at their Platt Lane training complex, where I met him while I was playing football in 1988. When Manchester Metropolitan University took over Platt Lane in 2014, Ralph stayed on as a coach. He changed the lives of many young people in inner city Manchester with his focus on teaching them to be the best they could be, both in sport and as a person. As a result, many of the children he helped were able to overcome the challenges of their upbringing. Ralph was born on the Caribbean island of Aruba, the youngest of 10 children to William Inniss, a tailor, and his wife, Ruby (nee Edwards). In his teens he moved to the UK with his family, settling in the Moss Side area of Manchester and quickly finding a focus in life through sport. After attending Birley high school he got a job at Dunlop, working in their accounts department before starting as a coach for Manchester City in 1979. The influence Ralph had as a football coach and mentor was immense, with many of his charges going on to play the game at an advanced level, but also finding success in other areas of life. In addition to his work with young people he championed inclusivity in his coaching by arranging football matches with mothers of the young people he coached. This gave many women, particularly those from ethnic minority communities, an opportunity to enjoy a sport they might otherwise have been unlikely to participate in. Ralph remained physically active throughout his life and showed that exercise and sport do not have to end in older age. Over the years he was famed for his encouraging shout of \u201cCan ya?\u201d whenever someone was trying something new or challenging.

Speaking at a joint press conference with the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Naus\u0117da, in Vilnius before the summit, he also said that Sweden had met previously agreed conditions agreed with Turkey, and that it was still possible Ankara\u2019s reticence could be overcome during the summit. Nato allies on Monday reached agreement on regional plans detailing how the alliance would respond to a Russian attack, overcoming a Turkish blockage one day before leaders meet for a summit in Vilnius, three diplomats told Reuters. Nato had for decades seen no need for large-scale defence plans, as it fought smaller wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and felt certain post-Soviet Russia no longer posed an existential threat. Associated Press reports that Putin has met with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, just days after a short-lived rebellion by the mercenary chief and his private army. According to the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, a three-hour meeting took place on 29 June, which also involved commanders from the military company Prigozhin founded. Prigozhin has had a longstanding conflict with Russia\u2019s top military brass which on 24 June culminated in an armed mutiny in which he led his fighters into Russia. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said he wants to work with allies to discuss a pathway for Ukraine to join Nato, but the exact mechanism is up for discussion, his spokesperson said on Monday, following talks with the US president, Joe Biden. The spokesperson said it would not be appropriate for Ukraine to join Nato when the war with Russia was going on, but Sunak believed Ukraine\u2019s \u201crightful place\u201d was within alliance. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has thrown a surprise obstacle in the way of a plan from Joe Biden for Swedish accession to Nato by announcing he wanted Turkey\u2019s stalled application to join the EU to be included in the package. Speaking at the airport before departing for the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Turkish president said: \u201cFirst, let\u2019s pave the way for Turkey in the European Union and then we will pave the way for Sweden just as we did for Finland.\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Turkey\u2019s EU bid is not linked to Sweden\u2019s accession to Nato, after Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan appeared to introduce a new hurdle for Sweden to clear before joining the military alliance. The Turkish president told reporters in Istanbul: \u201cTurkey has been waiting at the door of the EU for over 50 years now, and almost all of the Nato member countries are now members of the EU.\u201d Norway will extend the presence of its Nato forces in Lithuania until 2024, its government said on Monday. Norway has been a part of Nato\u2019s Enhanced Forward Presence in Lithuania since 2014, Reuters reports the government said in a statement, adding that its contribution consists of about 150 people. Reuters reports that Russia will continue to co-operate with Beijing and can count on China\u2019s \u201cfriendly shoulder\u201d, the speaker of Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament said on Monday after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. \u201cWe can count on a firm and reliable friendly shoulder in China,\u201d Valentina Matvienko said. The Australian government will send a surveillance aircraft to Germany to help monitor the flow of military and humanitarian supplies into Ukraine. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the deployment after talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin on Monday, a day before attending a Nato summit in Lithuania where the war in Ukraine will dominate discussions. Ukrainian forces have registered \u201ca definite advance\u201d on the southern flank of the eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar. In a Telegram post Maliar said there was no change in positions on the northern flank. She did not give any further details but attention in recent days has focused on the village of Klishchiivka, lying on heights to the south of Bakhmut. Earlier, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, said they were \u201cmaking progress\u201d around the city. Russian forces captured Bakhmut in May but are thought to be struggling to maintain control of it. A joint investigation by the Russian investigative journalism outfits Meduza and Mediazona released this morning estimates that about 47,000 Russian soldiers and contract fighters have died since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. The figures were calculated based on data from the beginning of the war until 27 May 2023. Russia has not released official figures for those killed in action since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had died in what Moscow calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. The numbers were widely seen as implausibly low. Ukraine\u2019s military has claimed to have killed over 230,000 enemy combatants. Russia is \u201calmost certainly struggling with a crisis of combat medical provision, after suffering an average of about 400 casualties a day for 17 months,\u201d the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Four people died and 11 were injured after Russia\u2019s bombing of a residential area of the frontline town of Orikhiv in Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia region while distribution of humanitarian aid was taking place, the governor of the region said on Monday. Yuriy Malashko said those killed included three woman and a man, all in their 40s. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence has published an image of Valery Gerasimov for the first time since the failed Wagner uprising of 24 June. Gerasimov was one of the military leaders that Yevgeney Prigozhin had been railing against for weeks before ordering his mercenaries to march on Moscow. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba posted to social media to say \u201cfollowing intensive talks, Nato allies have reached consensus on removing MAP from Ukraine\u2019s path to membership. I welcome this long-awaited decision that shortens our path to Nato\u201d. The \u201cmembership action plan\u201d (MAP) is a process by which the alliance enters negotiations with a prospective member about political, economic, defence and security issues. The US president, Joe Biden, has arrived in London for talks with UK prime minister Rishi Sunak. Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said that foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, and US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, discussed the expansion of Nato in a phone call ahead of the alliance\u2019s summit in Lithuania. Turkey and Hungary are yet to ratify Sweden\u2019s accession to the alliance. A substantial announcement on Germany delivering military hardware to Ukraine is expected over the course of this week\u2019s Nato summit, a senior government official said in Berlin on Monday. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has posted his daily operational update to Telegram. He listed a number of settlements in the region which he claims have seen cross-border shelling from Ukrainian forces. He reported no casualties, although he did detail some damage to power lines. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader of occupied Donetsk, has said that presently the Russian authorities in the region are unable to proceed with demining in the Bakhmut area due to shelling by Ukrainian forces.

But with Europe\u2019s bloodiest war since 1945 raging just beyond its borders in Ukraine, it is now warning that it must have all planning in place well before a conflict with a peer adversary such as Moscow might erupt. Turkey had been blocking approval of the plans over the wording on geographical locations such as Cyprus. Nato leaders gather in Vilnius on 11-12 July for a summit that will discuss Sweden\u2019s membership and the alliance\u2019s future relationship with Ukraine.

More on the meeting between Stoltenberg, Erdogan and Kristersson from Reuters: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is meeting with the leaders of Turkey and Sweden in Vilnius as he seeks to break the deadlock over Stockholm\u2019s NATO membership bid. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson are in the Lithuanian capital for a NATO summit that will start on Tuesday. NATO last year invited Sweden to join the alliance, but Turkey has been blocking the ratification of that decision. In an unexpected move, Erdogan said on Monday the European Union should open the way for Ankara\u2019s accession to the bloc before Turkey\u2019s parliament approves Sweden\u2019s NATO bid. Here\u2019s our Russian affairs reporter, Pjotr Sauer\u2019s take on the meeting between Putin and Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. He writes: The Kremlin has said the Wagner group head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, met Vladimir Putin on 29 June, five days after his mercenary fighters marched towards Moscow in an aborted rebellion. The Russian president\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Putin invited 35 senior Wagner commanders including Prigozhin to the Kremlin, adding that the meeting lasted three hours. The Kremlin\u2019s statements reveal Prigozhin has travelled to Russia at least once since the deal brokered by the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, under which the warlord abandoned his military march on Moscow in exchange for safe passage to exile in Belarus. According to Peskov, Prigozhin assured Putin during the meeting that his Wagner troops were loyal to the country and the Russian president. \u201cThe commanders outlined their version of what happened [on 24 June]. They emphasised that they are staunch supporters of the head of state \u2026 and also said that they were ready to continue to fight for their homeland,\u201d Peskov said. Peskov did not comment on Prigozhin\u2019s whereabouts, which remain unclear. Last week, Lukashenko said Prigozhin was in St Petersburg despite Peskov stressing that the deal under which Prigozhin relocated to Belarus \u201cremained relevant\u201d.

Diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has reported on wrangling between Turkey, the US and the EU. He writes: Joe Biden will try to nail down a four-country deal that would lead to Turkey allowing Sweden into Nato in return for the sale of US F-16 jets to Ankara, on the condition they are not used to threaten Greece. But Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan threw a surprise obstacle in the way of Biden\u2019s plan by announcing he wanted Turkey\u2019s stalled application to join the EU to be included in the package. Speaking at the airport before departing for the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Turkish president said: \u201cFirst, let\u2019s pave the way for Turkey in the European Union, and then we will pave the way for Sweden just as we did for Finland.\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s remarks suggest diplomats\u2019 eve-of-summit efforts to lift the year-long Turkish veto on Sweden\u2019s membership of Nato will be even more complex than envisaged. Turkey has been in talks over joining the EU in one form or another since 1987 but there is no enthusiasm for letting such a large country with a questionable human rights record join. The US president held further last-minute talks with Erdo\u011fan on his flight to Europe on Sunday but no breakthrough occurred during their nearly hour-long conversation, according to the White House. Read the full article here: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Turkey\u2019s EU bid is not linked to Sweden\u2019s accession to Nato, after Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan appeared to introduce a new hurdle for Sweden to clear before joining the military alliance. The Turkish president told reporters in Istanbul: \u201cTurkey has been waiting at the door of the EU for over 50 years now, and almost all of the Nato member countries are now members of the EU.\u201d Speaking in Berlin, Scholz responded: \u201cSweden meets all the requirements for Nato membership.\u201d He added: \u201cThe other question is one that is not connected with it, and that is why I do not think it should be seen as a connected issue.\u201d Erdo\u011fan did not make it clear if Ankara\u2019s long-stalled bid to join the EU was genuinely a new condition for Swedish accession to Nato, or if it was simply an issue Turkey wanted to get the ball rolling on again. The White House, like Scholz, sought to downplay any link. Reuters reports a White House national security council spokesperson said the US had always supported Turkey\u2019s EU membership aspirations, and continued to do so, but added that those discussions were a matter between Turkey and the bloc\u2019s members. \u201cOur focus is on Sweden, which is ready to join the Nato alliance,\u201d the US spokesperson continued. Earlier in the day, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, expressed his support for Turkey\u2019s ambition to become an EU member. The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he is \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d that by the end of the week the alliance will have \u201cunity and a strong message\u201d on the future membership of Ukraine. Speaking at a joint press conference with the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Naus\u0117da, in Vilnius before the summit, he also said that Sweden had met previously agreed conditions agreed with Turkey, and that it was still possible Ankara\u2019s reticence could be overcome during the summit. The summit will be dominated by discussions on membership options for Ukraine, resolving the dispute between Turkey and Sweden over the latter\u2019s accession to the alliance, and the question of cluster munitions being supplied to Ukraine. Naus\u0117da said a prospect of membership was extremely important to Ukraine, which had been \u201cheroically fighting the Russian monster for almost one and a half years\u201d, and that \u201cwe must avoid Ukraine membership ... becoming a horizon. The more you walk towards it, the farther it is\u201d. Nato appears to have been clear that the door remains open and that Ukraine is expected to join eventually, but has been hesitant to put a timetable on it. Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had sharp words about the prospect, saying: \u201cYou know the absolutely clear and consistent position of the Russian Federation that Ukraine\u2019s membership in Nato will have very, very negative consequences for the security architecture, the already half-destroyed security architecture in Europe. And it will be an absolute danger, a threat to our country, which will require from us a sufficiently clear and firm reaction.\u201d Norway will extend the presence of its Nato forces in Lithuania until 2024, its government said on Monday. Norway has been a part of Nato\u2019s Enhanced Forward Presence in Lithuania since 2014, Reuters reports the government said in a statement, adding that its contribution consists of about 150 people. Canada pledged on Monday to deploy up to 1,200 more troops in Latvia as part of a Nato plan to reinforce its battalions, deterring Russian aggression in the Baltic region. The Australian government will send a surveillance aircraft to Germany to help monitor the flow of military and humanitarian supplies into Ukraine. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the deployment after talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin on Monday, a day before attending a Nato summit in Lithuania where the war in Ukraine will dominate discussions. Albanese also confirmed previous reports that Australia would join the German-led Climate Club, a new international grouping that is expected to focus on reducing emissions in heavy industry and bringing \u201cgreen steel\u201d and \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d on to the market quickly. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said he wants to work with allies to discuss a pathway for Ukraine to join Nato, but the exact mechanism is up for discussion, his spokesperson said on Monday, following talks with the US president, Joe Biden. The spokesperson said it would not be appropriate for Ukraine to join Nato when the war with Russia was going on, but Sunak believed Ukraine\u2019s \u201crightful place\u201d was within alliance. \u201cWe want to work with the US and our allies on the pathway for Ukraine to join,\u201d the spokesperson told reporters. Colin Kahl, US undersecretary of defence, visiting the UK alongside President Joe Biden, told an audience at the Chatham House thinktank that there was resistance in the White House to any suggestion \u201cthat there\u2019s a degree of automaticity or immediacy\u201d to Nato membership for Ukraine on the eve of the military alliance\u2019s summit. The idea of Ukrainian membership should not be \u201ctemporally bounded, but conditions based\u201d he added, using cautious language in line with previous US comments on the topic. Kahl also emphasised that, from Biden\u2019s point of view, Ukraine had also to engage with \u201ca whole host of domestic and security reform issues,\u201d a reference to clamping down on corruption. Coming this close to the gathering in Vilnius in Tuesday and Wednesday, the comments do not suggest much hope for Ukraine\u2019s aspirations for a clear and short roadmap to joining Nato, although Kahl was speaking when Biden was in Downing St, meeting Rishi Sunak, where the issue of Ukranian membership was expected to be discussed. The under secretary also defended the controversial decision by the US to supply cluster munitions to Ukraine, banned by over 80 countries but not the Washington or Kyiv, although he insisted it was \u201creally hard\u201d and that the US had \u201cwrestled with the moral issues\u201d involved. Kahl the move was necessary because west is not making 155m shells fast enough for Kyiv\u2019s needs at present, and so not supplying cluster weapons in the interim would \u201crun the risk the Ukrainians would stall out\u201d and so be unable to fight effectively against the Russian invaders, which in turn could have worse humanitarian consequences. The issue risks a rift in the alliance of countries supporting Ukraine, although Kahl argued cluster bombs were necessary to building a bridge until US and European arms production ramps up. Supplying them now was a decision of urgency, where a \u201ccombination of existential stakes and emergency conditions\u201d tipped the balance, he said. Ukraine\u2019s largest western allies are still finalising a joint framework that would pave the way for long-term security assurances for Kyiv, and may wait until the end of a Nato summit this week to announce them, according to European diplomats. Reuters reports: The 31-member Nato alliance meets in Lithuania on Tuesday, aiming above all to give Ukraine some kind of path to membership, but still divided over how far to go. Ukraine knows it will not get entry into the alliance while the war with Russia continues, given that Nato\u2019s article 5 \u2013 which says that an attack on one member is an attack on all -could push the alliance into war with Russia. But it wants a firm commitment at the summit that it will be invited to join after the war. In the meantime, it has sought assurances of current and long-term security commitments to help it defend itself now and deter renewed aggression from Moscow once the war ends. Nato has assiduously abstained from giving military assistance to Ukraine as an organisation, to avoid entering a direct conflict with Russia, and is keen to continue leaving that to member states and others. Britain, France, Germany and the United States, known as the Quad, have been negotiating with Kyiv for weeks over a multilateral text that would create a broad framework for member states that want to provide, or keep providing, military aid including advanced weapons, as well as financial assistance. The European Union, which would pursue its financing of weapons support through its Peace Facility, and Group of Seven (G7) powers including Japan, have also been privy to the discussions. The multilateral framework makes it easier for countries to conclude detailed individual arrangements with Ukraine. \u201cThe Americans do not want to mix discussions on Nato prospects with guarantees, so the guarantees may only be agreed after summit,\u201d said one European diplomat. A second Quad diplomat also said it was heading in that direction. A French presidency official told reporters on Friday that the discussions were \u201cvery advanced\u201d. Two other diplomats said the hope was to complete them by the end of the summit. A senior German official told reporters that there would be an agreement at the level of the G7, which comprises the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Canada, Italy and Britain, as well as the European Union. US President Joe Biden, who is en route to Lithuania, told CNN on Sunday that Washington was ready to provide security to Ukraine in the mould of what it provides to Israel: \u201cthe weaponry they need, the capacity to defend themselves\u201d. The US\u2019s military aid for Israel is worth about $3.5bn a year, but the relationship also entails a great deal of political support. \u201cThe possible difference with Ukraine is that the American support is results-driven,\u201d said an Israeli official. \u201cWith Ukraine, the Americans will ask themselves \u2018What did we get for $100 bln\u2019 and whether this is sustainable in the long-term as this conflict may not end, may just stay frozen.\u201d Reuters reports that Russia will continue to co-operate with Beijing and can count on China\u2019s \u201cfriendly shoulder\u201d, the speaker of Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament said on Monday after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. \u201cWe can count on a firm and reliable friendly shoulder in China,\u201d Valentina Matvienko said. Associated Press reports that Putin has met with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, just days after a short-lived rebellion by the mercenary chief and his private army. According to the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, a three-hour meeting took place on 29 June, which also involved commanders from the military company Prigozhin founded. Prigozhin has had a long standing conflict with Russia\u2019s top military brass which on 24 June culminated in an armed mutiny in which he led his fighters into Russia. The Wagner group chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, will move to Belarus under a deal to end the armed mutiny he led against Russia\u2019s military leadership, the Kremlin said on Saturday night. The deal was brokered by the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Lukashenko had offered to mediate, with Vladimir Putin\u2019s agreement, because he had known Prigozhin personally for about 20 years. Peskov said the criminal case that had been opened against Prigozhin for armed mutiny would be dropped, and that the Wagner fighters who had taken part in his \u201cmarch for justice\u201d would not face any action, in recognition of their previous service to Russia. Although Putin had earlier vowed to punish those who participated in the mutiny, Peskov said the agreement had had the \u201chigher goal\u201d of avoiding confrontation and bloodshed. Prigozhin and all of his fighters vacated the military headquarters in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don that they had previously taken over, the RIA news agency reported. According to Reuters, the Kremlin said today that Ukrainian membership of the Nato military alliance would have very negative consequences for Europe\u2019s security architecture and that Russia would consider such a step a threat which demanded a harsh response. This comes as Nato holds a summit on Tuesday and Wednesday in Lithuania, aimed at showing solidarity with Ukraine while not yet accepting Kyiv as a member of the alliance. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Monday that the EU should open the way for Ankara\u2019s accession to the bloc before Turkey\u2019s parliament approves Sweden\u2019s bid to join the Nato military alliance. Speaking ahead of his departure for the Nato summit in Vilnius, Erdo\u011fan said Sweden\u2019s accession hinges on the implementation of a deal reached last summer during the alliance\u2019s summit in Madrid, adding that no one should expect compromises from Ankara. Last week Jen Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, said that as far as he was concerned Sweden had delivered on the deal. Erdo\u011fan also said that an end to the war between Ukraine and Russia would ease Kyiv\u2019s Nato membership process. Turkey was officially recognised as a candidate for full membership of the EU in 1999. Ukrainian forces have registered \u201ca definite advance\u201d on the southern flank of the eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar. In a Telegram post Maliar said there was no change in positions on the northern flank. She did not give any further details but attention in recent days has focused on the village of Klishchiivka, lying on heights to the south of Bakhmut. Earlier, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, said they were \u201cmaking progress\u201d around the city. Russian forces captured Bakhmut in May but are thought to be struggling to maintain control of it. A joint investigation by the Russian investigative journalism outfits Meduza and Mediazona released this morning estimates that about 47,000 Russian soldiers and contract fighters have died since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. The figures were calculated based on data from the beginning of the war until 27 May 2023. Russia has not released official figures for those killed in action since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had died in what Moscow calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. The numbers were widely seen as implausibly low. Ukraine\u2019s military has claimed to have killed over 230,000 enemy combatants. Russia is \u201calmost certainly struggling with a crisis of combat medical provision, after suffering an average of around 400 casualties a day for 17 months,\u201d the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Four people died and 11 were injured after Russia\u2019s bombing of a residential area of the frontline town of Orikhiv in Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia region while distribution of humanitarian aid was taking place, the governor of the region said on Monday. Yuriy Malashko said those killed included three woman and a man, all in their 40s. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence has published an image of Valery Gerasimov for the first time since the failed Wagner uprising of 24 June. Gerasimov was one of the military leaders that Yevgeney Prigozhin had been railing against for weeks before ordering his mercenaries to march on Moscow. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba posted to social media to say \u201cfollowing intensive talks, Nato allies have reached consensus on removing MAP from Ukraine\u2019s path to membership. I welcome this long-awaited decision that shortens our path to Nato\u201d. The \u201cmembership action plan\u201d (MAP) is a process by which the alliance enters negotiations with a prospective member about political, economic, defence and security issues. The US president, Joe Biden, has arrived in London for talks with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said that foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, and US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, discussed the expansion of Nato in a phone call ahead of the alliance\u2019s summit in Lithuania. Turkey and Hungary are yet to ratify Sweden\u2019s accession to the alliance. A substantial announcement on Germany delivering military hardware to Ukraine is expected over the course of this week\u2019s Nato summit, a senior government official said in Berlin on Monday. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has posted his daily operational update to Telegram. He listed a number of settlements in the region which he claims have seen cross-border shelling from Ukrainian forces. He reported no casualties, although he did detail some damage to power lines. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader of occupied Donetsk, has said that presently the Russian authorities in the region are unable to proceed with demining in the Bakhmut area due to shelling by Ukrainian forces. The US president, Joe Biden, has arrived in Downing Street to meet the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Miranda Bryant is following developments there on our UK politics live blog. We will bring you any key lines that emerge relating to Ukraine here as well. We are expecting a lot of positioning ahead of the Nato summit in Vilnius this week, and on Monday morning, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister stated that Nato would forgo the \u201cmembership action plan\u201d element of Ukraine\u2019s application to join. Dmytro Kuleba posted to social media to say: Following intensive talks, Nato allies have reached consensus on removing MAP from Ukraine\u2019s path to membership. I welcome this long-awaited decision that shortens our path to Nato. It is also the best moment to offer clarity on the invitation to Ukraine to become member. MAP is Nato\u2019s \u201cmembership action plan\u201d, a process by which the alliance enters negotiations with a prospective member about political, economic, defence and security issues. The alliance itself describes it as a \u201cprogramme of advice, assistance and practical support tailored to the individual needs of countries wishing to join the alliance. Participation in the MAP does not prejudge any decision by the alliance on future membership\u201d. Nato states that Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently participating in the programme. Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, discussed the expansion of Nato in a phone call ahead of the alliance\u2019s summit in Lithuania, Reuters reports the Turkish foreign ministry as saying on Monday. Turkey and Hungary are yet to ratify Sweden\u2019s accession to the alliance. A joint investigation by the Russian investigative journalism outfits Meduza and Mediazona released this morning estimates that about 47,000 Russian soldiers and contract fighters have died since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. The figures were calculated based on data from the beginning of the war until 27 May 2023, and the investigation claimed to have determined with 95% probability that the true figure was between 40,000 and 55,000. Russia has not released official figures for those killed in action in Ukraine since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had died in what Moscow calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. The numbers were widely seen as implausibly low. Ukraine\u2019s military has claimed to have killed over 230,000 enemy combatants. If the 47,000 figure is correct, it would mean that three times as many Russian soldiers died in Ukraine in 15 months as Soviet soldiers in the war in Afghanistan over a decade. The investigation used two parallel techniques: one using information from Russian inheritance registers and the other conducted by Dmitry Kobak, a professor at Tubingen University in Germany, who conducted work to calculate excess mortality rates in 2022. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. A substantial announcement on a German delivery of military hardware to Ukraine is expected over the course of this week\u2019s Nato summit, a senior government official said in Berlin on Monday. Germany is also working on bilateral security guarantees for Ukraine, Reuters reports the official said, adding that it was not the right time for an invitation for Kyiv to join the defence alliance. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has posted his daily operational update to Telegram. He listed a number of settlements in the region which he claims have seen cross-border shelling from Ukrainian forces. He reported no casualties, although he did detail some damage to power lines. The claims have not been independently verified. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader of occupied Donetsk, has said that presently the Russian authorities in the region are unable to proceed with demining in the Bakhmut area due to shelling by Ukrainian forces. Russian state-owned news agency Tass quotes him saying: \u201cThe enemy is delaying this process as long as possible.\u201d Russia spent months trying to claim the city of Bakhmut, with most sources suggesting they sustained considerable losses in besieging the now-ruined city. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence has published an image of Valery Gerasimov for the first time since the failed Wagner uprising of 24 June. Gerasimov was one of the military leaders that Yevgeney Prigozhin had been railing against for weeks before ordering his mercenaries to march on Moscow. In a video clip posted to the ministry\u2019s official social media channels, Gerasimov is seen receiving reports about claimed attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike targets in Crimea, Rostov and other regions. Four people died and 11 were injured after Russia\u2019s bombing of a residential area of the frontline town of Orikhiv in Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia region while distribution of humanitarian aid was taking place, Reuters reports the governor of the region as saying on Monday. Yuriy Malashko said those killed included three woman and a man, all in their 40s. He added that Russia carried out 36 targeted strikes on 10 settlements of the Zaporizhzhia region. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Russia is \u201calmost certainly struggling with a crisis of combat medical provision, after suffering an average of around 400 casualties a day for 17 months,\u201d the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. It is also likely that civilian medical services have been affected, especially in regions near Ukraine, and that military hospitals are reserving space for officer casualties, it said. It continued: As claimed by the head of the Kalashnikov company\u2019s combat medicine training division, it is likely that up to 50 per cent of Russian combat fatalities could have been prevented with proper first aid. Very slow casualty evacuation, combined with the inappropriate use of the crude in-service Russian combat tourniquet, is reportedly a leading cause of preventable fatalities and amputations. Poland has detained another member of a Russian spy network, bringing the total number of people rounded up in an investigation to 15, Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski has said. Reuters reports: A hub for Western military supplies to Ukraine, Poland says it has become a major target of Russian spies and it accuses Moscow of trying to destabilise it. \u201cThe Internal Security Agency has detained another member of the spy network working for Russian intelligence,\u201d Mariusz Kaminski said in a post on Twitter. \u201cThe suspect kept surveillance of military facilities and seaports. He was systematically paid by the Russians.\u201d The Russian embassy in Warsaw did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In June, Poland detained a Russian professional ice-hockey player on spying charges. In March, Poland said it had broken up a Russian espionage network and detained nine people it said were preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. The following month Poland said it was introducing a 200-metre exclusion zone around its Swinoujscie Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal, citing concerns about Russian espionage. Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision not to dismantle the Wagner mercenary group and prosecute those who took part in last month\u2019s rebellion against Moscow is \u201cplacing himself and his subordinates in an awkward position,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. It writes: Wagner is still reportedly recruiting within Russia while the Russian MoD is reportedly conducting a competing effort to recruit Wagner fighters to sign contracts with the MoD. Putin\u2019s decision to not dispose of the Wagner Group \u2013 previously Russia\u2019s most combat capable force \u2013 is making it difficult for Putin and other Russian power players to know how to interact with the Wagner Group and its leaders and fighters. Joe Biden\u2019s meeting in Downing Street on Monday with Rishi Sunak \u2013 their fifth in the past five months and the sixth since Sunak become prime minister \u2013 probably carries more significance than any other. The two men are not just 37 years apart in age, but increasingly a long way apart on how to handle Ukraine. The disagreements will be kept from the public eye, and the hope is that the meeting can narrow the differences. The US disapproves if the junior partner goes public on any disagreement, or is perceived to be trying to bounce Washington into action. Pushiness, some say, was the undoing of the Nato secretary generalship ambitions of Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, after he tried to force the pace on arms supplies. Similarly, the watchword of Nato, built on consensus, is unity. But it is self-evident that the two countries lean towards different positions on the war in Ukraine, and its aftermath. At issue are the conditions set for the path for Ukraine\u2019s future membership of Nato, and the security guarantees that Volodymyr Zelenskiy should be provided by an ad hoc alliance of states in the interim. And behind that lie questions about escalation and Nato\u2019s future relationship with Russia. At one extreme lies a nervous Germany and at the other, impatient Baltic States and Poland. Read on below: Expected negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdogan remain the only hope to extend the Black Sea grain deal that is set to expire next week, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency has reported. Reuters reports: The Black Sea deal, brokered between Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey in July 2022, aimed to prevent a global food crisis by allowing Ukrainian grain trapped by Russia\u2019s invasion to be safely exported from Black Sea ports. Citing an unnamed source familiar with negotiations, RIA reported \u201cthere is no optimism\u201d for the extension of the deal - a position that Moscow has reiterated frequently in recent weeks. \u201cOur practice shows that it is the negotiations between the two leaders that are able to change the situation, the current difficult period is no exception,\u201d RIA cited the source as saying. \u201cToday, this remains the only hope.\u201d Erdogan said on Saturday he was pressing Russia to extend the grain deal, currently due to expire on July 17, by at least three months and announced a visit by Putin in August. The Kremlin said over the weekend there was no phone call scheduled and that there was no certainty about the two leaders meeting. Ankara angered Moscow with its July 8 decision to release to Kyiv five detained Ukrainian commanders of a unit that for weeks defended a steel works in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, with the Kremlin saying Ankara violated agreements. Ukrainian forces have registered \u201ca definite advance\u201d on the southern flank of the eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar. In a Telegram post Maliar said there was no change in positions on the northern flank. She did not give any further details but attention in recent days has focused on the village of Klishchiivka, lying on heights to the south of Bakhmut.

But we are advancing.\u201d Joe Biden is set to hold talks with Rishi Sunak on Monday, the eve of a two-day Nato summit in Vilnius, with Ukraine set to dominate discussions both in London and in the Lithuanian capital. The US and the UK are among Ukraine\u2019s strongest supporters, but they differ on Ukraine\u2019s wish to join the military alliance, with Washington much more reluctant than London due to concerns it may provoke Russia. While all sides have agreed Ukraine cannot join until the war is over, and thus be covered by its guarantee that an attack on one is an attack on all, the UK has been pushing for Kyiv to receive fast-track membership, without the need for it to fulfil a Nato membership action plan. Meanwhile, the US president on Sunday told CNN that Ukraine was \u201cnot yet ready\u201d and made it clear that membership was conditional on more than the war\u2019s end. \u201cNato is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications \u2013 from democratisation to a whole range of other issues,\u201d he said, adding that Nato needed to \u201clay out a rational path\u201d for membership. He suggested the US could provide military aid similar to the support it has long provided to Israel. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. US president Joe Biden has landed in London and is set to hold talks with British prime minister Rishi Sunak, ahead of a two-day Nato summit in Vilnius. Ukraine is expected to feature high on the agenda, with discussions focusing on a path for Ukraine\u2019s future membership of the military alliance, and security guarantees for Kyiv in the interim. Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Ukrainian forces had registered \u201ca definite advance\u201d on the southern flank of the eastern city of Bakhmut. Maliar did not give any further details but attention in recent days has focused on the village of Klishchiivka, lying on heights to the south of Bakhmut. Earlier Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, said they were \u201cmaking progress\u201d around the city. Russian forces captured Bakhmut in May but are thought to be struggling to maintain control of it. In other key developments: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was hoping for \u201cthe best possible result\u201d from the summit, after talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy has said he does not expect Ukraine to actually join Nato until after the war but that he hopes the summit will give a \u201cclear signal\u201d on the intention to bring Ukraine into the alliance. The US president spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, by phone on Sunday and \u201cconveyed his desire to welcome Sweden into Nato as soon as possible\u201d, the White House said. Washington has been increasing pressure on Ankara to drop its opposition to Sweden\u2019s all-but-cleared Nato membership bid ahead of the Vilnius summit. Erdogan\u2019s office said separately that the Turkish leader had reaffirmed to Biden his longstanding position that Sweden still needed to crack down harder on suspected Kurdish militants to win Turkey\u2019s support. It said the two presidents would meet on the sidelines of the summit. The Nato meeting comes as members of Biden\u2019s own Democratic party, rights groups and the UN raised questions about the US decision to send cluster bombs, which have been banned by more than 100 countries, to Ukraine. US senator Tim Kaine told Fox News he had \u201csome real qualms\u201d about the move because it \u201ccould give a green light to other nations to do something different as well\u201d. Germany\u2019s president has said the country should not \u201cblock\u201d the US from sending cluster bombs to Ukraine, while maintaining its opposition to the use of the weapon. \u201cGermany\u2019s position against the use of cluster munitions is as justified as ever. But we cannot, in the current situation, block the United States,\u201d President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told German broadcaster ZDF on Sunday. Russian air defence systems shot down four missiles on Sunday, Russian officials said, one over the annexed Crimean peninsula and three over Russia\u2019s Rostov and Bryansk regions that border Ukraine. Several buildings were damaged in Rostov and Bryansk but no casualties were reported. No casualties or damage were reported in Crimea. South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said next month\u2019s Brics summit, which Vladimir Putin has been invited to attend, will be held in-person despite an arrest warrant on the Russian leader. \u201cThe Brics summit is going ahead and we are finalising our discussions on the format,\u201d Ramaphosa told South African journalists on Sunday on the sidelines of a conference by the ruling ANC, adding it would be a \u201cphysical\u201d meeting."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fe4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/joan-krakover-hall-obituary", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Joan Krakover Hall obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Linguist and teacher who kept the secret of her husband\u2019s wartime espionage for more than 50 years", "author": "Martha Moss", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:54:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954626", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6690299077d46e89a82fc4a2be5f89092af500f6/0_84_2480_1488/500.jpg", "body": "My grandmother Joan Krakover Hall, who has died aged 94, was a passionate teacher and linguist, who worked for a time at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. She was married for more than 50 years to the atomic physicist Theodore Hall, whom she met as a teenager in Chicago after the second world war. As a young scientist working on the Manhattan Project, Ted had passed secrets of the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union, believing that a US nuclear monopoly would be highly dangerous. Identified as an agent in 1949, he was never prosecuted by the US authorities and his role remained unknown to the public until the mid-1990s. Joan\u2019s unwavering love for Ted is chronicled in the recent Steve James documentary A Compassionate Spy, which includes a dramatisation of their romance and interviews with Joan in her latter years. In the film, Joan recalls that, just after she accepted Ted\u2019s proposal, he confessed to his wartime espionage and the reasons for his actions, in case she wanted to back out. She did not. They married in 1947 and she was to keep his secret for more than 50 years, emigrating to the UK and giving up her own political activities. Born in Chicago, to Evelyn (nee Winetz), an art teacher, and Leo Krakover, who worked in advertising, Joan went to O\u2019Keeffe high school, before being selected for a special programme for gifted school-age students at the University of Chicago. She met Ted at a political meeting \u2013 he made an impression on her when he sprayed her with a water pistol \u201cto liven things up a little bit\u201d. Joan and Ted moved to Connecticut as newlyweds, but Joan was uninspired by the drudgery of domestic life. As McCarthyism took hold, it was no longer safe for the couple to remain in the US. In the early 60s, when Ted was offered a job in Cambridge, they gathered their three young daughters, upped sticks and made a new home for themselves in Britain. There, Joan had more freedom to explore her own politics and she became involved in the women\u2019s rights movement in the 70s. She was fluent in Russian and Italian and worked for a time as a translator. Joan was a talented painter, poet and teacher, providing positive feedback that enabled her pupils to grow. Joan\u2019s childhood, by her accounts, had not been full of love and affection, her brother always being given the bigger helping and the most praise. Joan was determined not to do the same as a parent \u2013 she and Ted loved and cherished their daughters, and enjoyed time together as a family. Life was relatively calm until the death of Deborah, my mother, in 1992. Debby was Joan and Ted\u2019s adored middle child, a talented violinist who had inherited her parents\u2019 sense of social justice and campaigned against South African apartheid and the poll tax. Joan became ever more liberal and progressive as she grew older. She was affectionate, funny, and a talented storyteller. When my sister and I were children, Joan treated us with respect and love (and extra cream on our strawberries), listening to our opinions and encouraging us to pursue our dreams. Ted died in 1999. Joan is survived by her daughters Sara and Ruth, three grandchildren, Rebecca, Alex and me, and six great-grandchildren, Abraham, Ella, Tobias, Margot, Samuel and Jonny."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fe5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/10/jeremy-hunt-to-unveil-pension-fund-reform-plan-to-help-uk-startups", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jeremy Hunt to unveil pension fund reform plan to help UK startups", "lead": "Chancellor will outline proposals to mobilise investment and support homegrown firms in Mansion House speech", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:49:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954644", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f08177570810ee799ee7e01741ce4d546c528cac/0_0_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is poised to announce plans to merge workplace pension schemes and release up to \u00a375bn of retirement funds for fast-growing startups, in a move that could accelerate plans to create the next Silicon Valley. The proposals, aimed at mobilising investment from the UK\u2019s \u00a32.5tn pensions sector, are due to be outlined in a speech to top executives and MPs in central London at the lord mayor\u2019s annual Mansion House dinner on Monday evening. Hunt will say that the government will push for consolidation of the UK\u2019s wide range of pension schemes \u2013 including final salary pensions \u2013 in order to pool their funding and create better returns for future retirees. He will also confirm that the Treasury has struck a deal with nine of the largest pension providers that would result in firms earmarking 5% of retirement funds towards private investments. The government will create new investment vehicles that would give future retirees a stake in homegrown private companies \u2013 including in fast-growing fintech and biotech startups \u2013 that have increasingly snubbed the London Stock Exchange and turned to foreign investors for cash. The reforms are meant to support wider government plans to attract more business investment, and come months after Hunt reiterated his ambitions for the UK to become the next Silicon Valley. The Treasury claimed the Mansion House reforms would not only help burgeoning industries, but could result in higher returns for workers\u2019 retirement funds. While the UK\u2019s auto-enrolment programme \u2013 which has made workplace pension contributions compulsory for most employees \u2013 has helped the UK become the largest pensions market in Europe, leading to savings of \u00a3115bn in 2021 alone, Hunt believes investment opportunities are being missed. The government believes the reforms could translate into a 12% bump in pension returns for the average earner who starts saving at 18 years old. \u201cBritish pensioners should benefit from British business success. By unlocking investment, we will boost retirement income by over \u00a31,000 a year for typical earners over the course of their career,\u201d Hunt is expected to say. \u201cThis also means more investment in our most promising companies, driving growth in the UK.\u201d The Treasury confirmed it had struck an agreement with large pension fund managers, including Aviva, Scottish Widows and Legal &amp; General, that will see 5% of assets in their default pension funds invest in private and high-growth companies. The so-called \u201cMansion House compact\u201d \u2013 which was also been signed by Aegon, Phoenix, Nest, Smart Pensions, M&amp;G and Mercers \u2013 could release \u00a350bn from defined contribution pension funds by 2030 if other pension schemes follow suit. Hunt will ramp up the consolidation of local government pension schemes over the next two years and double their investment in private equity investments to 10%, potentially unlocking another \u00a325bn by 2030. The government will also encourage defined contribution pension schemes \u2013 which do not guarantee a set income at retirement and are the default plan for most UK workers \u2013 to pool their cash, including in a new \u201csuperfund\u201d. While consolidation would be voluntary, any schemes that failed to achieve the \u201cbest possible outcome\u201d for its members would be wound up by the pensions regulator and merged with more successful peers. The Treasury said analysis showed a 46% difference in returns between the best and worst performing pension schemes, meaning that savers with a pot of \u00a310,000 could have missed out on \u00a35,000 over five years. Industry players said they largely welcomed the reforms but warned they were waiting for details. Tom Selby, the head of retirement policy at the broker AJ Bell, cautioned that the fall of star fund manager Neil Woodford, who invested heavily in private companies which were difficult to sell off quickly, showed \u201cthe challenges big investments in illiquid assets can have, and investors will not thank the government if this policy hits the value of their retirements pots\u201d. Speaking at the same event, Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, was expected to signal further interest rate pain was in store for mortgage holders and businesses, as he said Threadneedle Street had to \u201csee the job through\u201d on reducing inflation."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fe6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/10/jonathan-bayer-obituary", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jonathan Bayer obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives</strong>: Photographer and distinguished writer on photography", "author": "Charles Darwent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:44:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954663", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d6fa7719e735a7bc62ee2dbfd6729e1da35caf04/0_1158_3024_1814/500.jpg", "body": "My friend Jonathan Bayer, who has died aged 87, was both a noted photographer and a writer on photography. His work, like him, was droll, watchful and kind. His gelatine silver print Arthur, Arthur (1956), in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, shows a large praying mantis clinging to net curtains. Although it suggests the inevitable triumph of nature over man, the image\u2019s mood is curious rather than fearful. So, too, with Jonathan\u2019s later work \u2013 Trees and Pram in Park (circa 1977, part of the Government Art Collection), and the elegiac Thames landscapes in the book Eye on the Estuary (2000) are meditations on fading worlds. Jonathan\u2019s background shaped his eye. When I met him a decade ago over a board lunch at a London prison, Jonathan asked what I did in (his term) \u201creal life\u201d. I answered that I was writing a book on the Bauhaus, patiently explaining that it had been a German art school. His answer \u2013 \u201cYes, my father was at the Bauhaus\u201d \u2013 took me aback, as did his gentle admission that that father had been Herbert Bayer, head of printing at the school and inventor of its celebrated typefaces. Herbert was, in fact, Jonathan\u2019s stepfather, having married his mother, Joella (nee Haweis), after she divorced Jonathan\u2019s father, Julien Levy. Joella was the daughter of the poet and notorious bohemian Mina Loy; Julien was also of the avant-garde aristocracy. It was his New York gallery that had brought Paris to the US in the 1930s, in the form of Surrealists such as Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Max Ernst, drawn to the French capital. Jonathan spent his infancy dandled on their knees. In 1946 the Bayers moved to Aspen, Colorado, taking the 10-year-old Jonathan with them. There he was sent to the progressive Fountain Valley school, where he studied alongside Matisse\u2019s grandson. After that he went to Harvard, and then to a PhD in international relations at the University of Pennsylvania. Finding life at the Washington office of the European Coal and Steel Community dull, he moved to London in 1972 to pursue a more congenial career as a photographer. In 1987 Jonathan co-founded the cooperative London Independent Photography group. He also began to paint, showing at the Morley Gallery \u2013 sophisticated works with echoes of his stepfather\u2019s Bauhaus friends Josef Albers and Paul Klee. Paintings by these two also hung in his south London flat, where he entertained with the mid-Atlantic courtliness of one of the nicer characters from Henry James. Jonathan was a great laugher, and provoker of laughter; his lamb hotchpotch was memorable. In 2013, he married his longtime partner, Miranda Townsend, who survives him."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fe7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/10/the-guardian-view-on-supplying-cluster-bombs-not-just-a-difficult-decision-but-the-wrong-one", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on supplying cluster bombs: not just a 'difficult' decision, but the wrong one | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The US is to transfer the devastating weapons to Ukraine.

It is half a century since the US stopped bombing Laos, having dropped more than 2m tons of cluster munitions; decades on, people then unborn are still paying the price. On one estimate, it will take another 100 years to fully clear the country. This is the true cost of cluster munitions. They are not only indiscriminate in showering dozens or hundreds of bomblets over a large area, but also have a lethal legacy because so many fail to explode, only to later be trodden on or picked up \u2013 often by curious children. For these reasons, more than 120 countries have signed the convention prohibiting their use, production, transfer and stockpiling. The US, Russia and Ukraine, however, have never been signatories. Russia has used them extensively in Ukraine, including in populated areas where no military personnel or infrastructure were evident. Kyiv has also employed them, more sparingly, but reportedly at the cost of civilian lives in Izium (though it denies they were used there). Now the US will supply more as part of a $800m (\u00a3625m) military aid package, at Kyiv\u2019s request. Thankfully, the UK, which has signed the convention but still holds some of the munitions, has ruled out following suit. Joe Biden has said he made a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d. No doubt. But the president has made the wrong one. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive has failed to gain the traction it needs, and supplies of artillery shells are running low. The argument is that, however significant the risks and long-term costs of using cluster bombs, civilians will pay a far higher price where Russian forces prevail. Cluster munitions are effective in combating dug-in ground troops, like the Russian forces along the vast frontline. But the same, of course, could be said for chemical weapons, and the US rightly finished destroying its remaining stockpile of those on Friday. Efficacy is why bans on such arms are needed in the first place. Russia\u2019s use of them is not a reason to further drag down international norms. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, says it has given written guarantees that it will not use the US-supplied weapons in Russia, nor in urban areas where civilians might be killed or wounded. It will also record their use, to expedite demining when the conflict is over. The US claims its munitions are far safer than those used by Moscow, with dud rates \u201cnot higher than 2.5%\u201d versus Russian devices that reportedly fail 30-40% of the time. Experts say test results don\u2019t reflect real world conditions and that, in any case, the sheer number of submunitions still means a deadly aftermath. Invasion has forced Ukraine to make tough decisions about how to defend itself. The US was nonetheless wrong to meet its request. The decisions of the world\u2019s most powerful country and military are key to determining global norms. Before Donald Trump took office, it had made some recent steps towards controlling cluster munitions. But it should never have deployed them, including in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s. It should not have rejected the convention banning them. And it should not be supplying them to Ukraine. Their use will have terrible long-term consequences for civilians there \u2013 and perhaps, through the example it sets, for civilians elsewhere too."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fe8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/10/the-guardian-view-on-cases-the-government-has-a-long-way-to-go", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on rape cases: the government has a long way to go | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The number of prosecutions has risen, but the overall situation is concerning, with a record-high level of sex offences recorded", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:32:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954710", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb1c5d38a7a8a59e406f2bad984d795b62be05e/0_2061_5464_3277/500.jpg", "body": "Rape and other serious sexual offences devastate the lives of victims, who carry scars with them through their lives. Prosecutions and convictions for these crimes remain too rare. In the year to September 2022, there were 70,633 rapes reported by police in England and Wales; in 2022, there were 459 convictions. Such an enormous gap is nothing new and has led campaigners to argue that the crime of rape has effectively been decriminalised, with only a tiny minority of perpetrators caught and punished. Given this backdrop, any improvement in the way that allegations are dealt with must be welcomed. So must meaningful development in the wider criminal justice policy environment overseen by the government. But Monday\u2019s announcement by the Ministry of Justice about the progress made over the past two years should be treated cautiously. While there are some promising indications that the police and courts have made changes, particularly in their approach to complainants and their evidence, it is too soon for ministers to congratulate themselves that this is a problem they are on the way to solving. The first point to note is that ambitions were never high. The goal ministers set was that the number of rape cases going to court should return to 2016 levels. This was when the first of several trials collapsed due to failures around disclosure (the process whereby evidence uncovered by prosecutors must be shared with defence lawyers). But concerns around barriers to justice for victims of sexual offences long predate this episode, and have been a focus for women\u2019s justice campaigners for decades. Lady Vivien Stern carried out a review of the way that rape complaints were handled for the last Labour government, and mistakes regarding disclosure were one of the topics she addressed then. Nevertheless it is a relief that the most recent decline in referrals from police to the Crown Prosecution Service has been reversed, and that charges have also risen \u2013 although these are still lower than in 2016. In the first three months of this year, 605 adult rape cases reached court, which is double the 2019 quarterly average. More significant than these statistics is the decision to roll out a new, specialist-led and suspect-focused approach to rape complaints, known as Operation Soteria, to all 43 police forces in England and Wales. If correctly implemented, this should lead to more effective investigations, improved cooperation between police and prosecutors, and fewer intrusions into victims\u2019 personal lives. Unfortunately, this is far from guaranteed. Independent oversight from academic experts has been crucial to this scheme, and multi-year funding for this, and for victims\u2019 support services, is needed if changes are to be embedded. Yet ministers have neither committed to this nor appointed a successor to Dame Vera Baird KC, who left her post as victims\u2019 commissioner last year. There were 199,021 sexual offences reported to police in the 12 months to September 2022 \u2013 the highest-ever number. At the same time, faith in the police has been undermined by multiple sexual assaults committed by officers, while the court backlog continues to deter complainants. Many of the actions now being taken, including the reinstatement of specialist officers, are attempts to put right past mistakes. Confidence in the system\u2019s capacity to deliver justice for victims of these offences remains low for good reason. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But those times are not necessarily when it is winning. It\u2019s when the game is finally up, and defeat looks virtually guaranteed, that for some politicians there can be a weird feeling of liberation. The choice is now between hanging around waiting miserably for the inevitable, or grasping a few nettles on the way out \u2013 by which I mean tackling the things previously shoved into a box marked \u201ctoo difficult\u201d. The one cabinet minister in an otherwise paralysed-looking Conservative government who appears to show even a glimmer of this end-of-life spirit is Michael Gove. The secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities is reportedly mulling plans to build a quarter of a million houses by 2040 in and around Cambridge \u2013 a small but beautiful city that\u2019s one of the most expensive places to live in Britain \u2013 under proposals to turn the area\u2019s science and tech cluster into the British equivalent of Silicon Valley. (If I had a pound for every time somewhere in Britain was going to be the new Silicon Valley, I\u2019d be writing this from a Malibu beach house, but that\u2019s another story.) And while the idea of making a prosperous city in the south-east even more prosperous is admittedly not exactly how levelling up the economy was pitched, new housing and regeneration schemes are supposedly also in the pipeline for the likes of Sheffield, Blackpool and Wolverhampton \u2013 identified as locations that could be much more economically successful than they are. The so-called Cambridge 2040 plan is tactfully described as being at \u201cconcept\u201d stage \u2013 code for \u201cmay never happen\u201d. The city council certainly says it has not yet been consulted and perhaps the whole thing will simply be strangled at birth or else drastically watered down, given the likely resistance in Tory-voting rural Cambridgeshire to new housing on an explosive scale. (The South Cambridgeshire MP, Anthony Browne, has already declared that \u201cneedless to say, I will be fighting it\u201d.) But the blueprint would still be there to pick up and tweak if an incoming Labour government felt like taking the heat for it, on the grounds that if all parties say they want to build more houses then they have to mean it and they also have to build where people want or need to live. The alternative may be somewhere like Cambridge becoming Britain\u2019s equivalent of the San Francisco Bay area in the worst of all possible ways: somewhere tech money has driven house prices way beyond ordinary mortals\u2019 reach, with dystopian consequences. This particular plan is obviously not perfect. Gove is said to favour building on brownfield rather than virgin greenfield land, which is less politically toxic but also makes it harder to build properly affordable housing (cleaning up whatever was on the site before adds to the cost for developers, shrinking their margins). Though in private he\u2019s said to be broadly enthusiastic about building more social housing, we have heard little about that in public. But while Rishi Sunak dumped plans for centrally imposed local housing targets last year, fearful of a backlash in the shires, the housing minister, Rachel Maclean, has been adamant that doesn\u2019t mean the overall target to build more homes is dead. If nothing else, this looks like the beginnings of a strategy for resuscitating it from Gove, one of the more activist housing secretaries this government has yet produced \u2013 and the only one who sounds as if he may have a vaguely coherent plan for tying all that together with economic growth outside London. How infuriating, then, that it\u2019s all emerging only at five minutes to midnight after three-and-a-half wasted years, and that it could be a decade before all this starts to bear fruit. A cynic may wonder whether this is just a last-ditch attempt to buy millennial votes or even to reposition Gove in advance of what is likely to be an angry post-election debate within his party about why the Tories didn\u2019t do more for priced-out younger voters. (Though given the enthusiasm with which the Lib Dems are now targeting Gove\u2019s Surrey seat, he can\u2019t count on being around to take part in that one.) But it remains just possible that the ever pragmatic Gove has woken up and smelled the coffee. The country may still not be entirely sure about Labour, which is why Keir Starmer is tiptoeing so cautiously towards the election. But it seemingly knows exactly what it thinks about the Tories and there\u2019s an odd kind of freedom to be found for this government in accepting that if the end is probably nigh anyway, it might as well do whatever it can with the time it has got left. History may not look kindly on this era of Conservatism, to put it mildly. But the ministers most likely to escape with some dignity aren\u2019t those who panic and pander to the worst instincts of their base now; they\u2019re the ones who choose to do something constructive with this final year, rather than leaving scorched earth for their successors. All parties know, deep down, what needs to be done on housing but have been frightened of making themselves unpopular. Having well and truly ticked that box, all that\u2019s left for the Tories is to feel the fear and do it anyway.

He founded the community-based healthcare organisation Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK), which provides affordable, high-quality medical services to millions of people. After studying at Dhaka College, he passed the MBBS with distinction in surgery from Dhaka medical college in 1964. The following year he moved to the UK to continue his medical studies, training as a general and vascular surgeon at the Royal College of Surgeons in London from 1965 to 1971. He passed the primary FRCS exam in 1970, but, weeks before he was due to sit the final exam, he instead decided to return to Bangladesh to set up a field hospital amid the war of liberation against Pakistan in 1971. Zafrullah remained in Bangladesh for the rest of his life. It was in 1972 that Zafrullah and colleagues founded GK, initially focused on providing comprehensive healthcare in rural areas. GK was the first organisation outside China to provide comprehensive training to paramedics who, vitally, in a male-dominated society, were female, riding bicycles into the countryside. The organisation steadily expanded its scope into education, agriculture, employment generation, production of essential medicines and women\u2019s emancipation. Since 1995 it has expanded to urban Bangladesh, particularly Dhaka. Zafrullah was also a leading force behind the development of his country\u2019s 1982 Drugs (Control) Ordinance law, which helped Bangladesh control the cost and supply of essential medications. Zafrullah worked with GK until he died. However, he was not purely focused on making change in his homeland; he was also engaged internationally, including as one of the people behind the creation in 2000 of the People\u2019s Health Movement, a global network that brings together grassroots health activists, civil society organisations and academic institutions. Zafrullah received widespread recognition, including the Ramon Magsaysay award in 1985 and the Right Livelihood award in 1992. In 2009, he was made a doctor of humanitarian services by the World Organization of Natural Medicine. Born in Quepara, a village then in East Bengal that is now part of Raozan upazila in the Chattogram district, Zafrullah was the eldest of 10 children. When his father, Humayan Chowdhury, became the officer in charge of Kotwali police station in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and then Bakshibazar in Dhaka, the family moved with him. His mother, Hashina Begum, was a housewife. Zafrullah passed matriculation from Nabakumar school in Bakshibazar, Dhaka. In 1992, Zafrullah married Shireen Huq, then head of Naripokkho, a leading women\u2019s rights organisation, whom he met through his work. He is survived by Shireen and their son, Bareesh; by a daughter, Bristi, from his first marriage; and by four sisters and four brothers."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5feb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/10/thames-water-funding-price-review", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Thames Water still faces slow drip over funding | Nils Pratley", "lead": "Monday\u2019s announcement is not a \u2018major milestone\u2019 \u2013 choppy waters remain, such as the price review", "author": "Nils Pratley", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:17:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954765", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ceac59c00471f174c4a46dfc26ca7f580598ad01/0_125_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Drip, drip, drip. No, not Thames Water\u2019s leaky pipes on this occasion. Rather, the dripping sound comes from the highly conditional cash injections from the company\u2019s consortium of shareholders. The chair of regulator Ofwat suggested to parliament last week that \u00a31bn was the minimum required from Thames\u2019s owners before 2025 (on top of the \u00a3500m that arrived in March), but the consortium has indicated it is prepared to cough up only \u00a3750m in the period. So there is a \u00a3250m shortfall. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a minor matter of phasing, says Thames, pointing to a further \u00a32.5bn injection from shareholders that is \u201cexpected\u201d in the next regulatory period, which runs from 2025-30. Well, OK, it is possible to believe the company wouldn\u2019t be capable of spending the missing \u00a3250m before March 2025 even if it tried \u2013 supply chains in the construction industry are genuinely stretched (thanks HS2) and Thames reckons it alone accounts for 1% of current national activity. But it\u2019s absurd to call Monday\u2019s funding announcement \u201ca major milestone\u201d, as new chief executives Cathryn Ross and Alastair Cochran did, when the financial pledges came with such heavy conditionality. The \u00a3750m requires \u201ca business plan that underpins a more focused turnaround\u201d and support from \u201cappropriate regulatory arrangements\u201d. Similar wording was applied to \u201cnature and level\u201d of the \u00a32.5bn: \u201cfinalisation\u201d of the business plan will be needed, plus support from the \u201cregulatory framework\u201d during the 2025-30 cycle. Rather than reaching \u201ca milestone\u201d, Thames still seems engaged in a dance around the funding standpipes. The threat of special administration has receded now that the shareholders have proved they are awake, but the outside world \u2013 especially Ofwat \u2013 will surely want to see the cash arrive before declaring that Thames has achieved financial stability. Note that the new business plan will be the third since 2017, which marked the end of the brazen dividend-extraction era of Macquarie\u2019s ownership. This one will be \u201chigh quality, realistic and prioritised\u201d, says Ross, but her two predecessors made similar noises about theirs. If there is a meaningful difference, it lies in the word \u201cprioritisation\u201d, but there\u2019s no hint yet on what Thames wishes to deprioritise, which will presumably be the regulator\u2019s first question. Indeed, the whole tone of this announcement only served to emphasise how much hinges on the next regulatory price review for Thames. Companies make their spending submissions in October and Ofwat makes its draft determination next May or June. Everybody knows bills will rise substantially to fund new infrastructure, but the open question is what costs the regulator allows the companies to recover from customers to repair existing pipes and sewage plants that should have been upgraded already. \u201cThis price review is pivotal for the sector\u2019s long-term future,\u201d said Thames. Well, yes, that\u2019s true. But it is also true that some companies could handle a tough-ish price review better than others. Ofwat is under no obligation to define a fair rate of return as one that suits the most overborrowed and underperforming companies. Thames\u2019s shareholders seem to have decided that that\u2019ll (probably) pony up enough to get to the review \u2013 that\u2019s the \u00a3750m. But they also seem overly anxious not to commit to the \u00a32.5bn until they know how much slack, if any, Ofwat will cut them and until they have greater faith in their own management to spend efficiently. The position is a marginal improvement on the uncertainty of the past fortnight, but the big decisions still lie ahead. The water torture on funding continues."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fec", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/england-take-wickets-200-miles-apart-to-sum-up-knife-edge-joy-of-dual-ashes", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England take wickets 200 miles apart to sum up knife-edge joy of dual Ashes", "lead": "Men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams compete simultaneously in must-win games and create a mirror-image moment to remember", "author": "Emma John", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:10:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954783", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/98780f1aceb912d20583f861e0fdab532677e520/1_0_2559_1536/500.jpg", "body": "There was plenty that was memorable about the Ashes cricket that took place on Saturday evening. But one unique moment was when England took back-to-back wickets, 200 miles apart. It is hard now to remember which appeal came first. Alyssa Healy had just missed a leg glance and Charlie Dean was asking the question, along with much of the 20,000-strong Lord\u2019s crowd. Stuart Broad pinned Todd Murphy back on his pads at Headingley and the umpire\u2019s finger went up. Healy walked. Murphy burned a review. Australia were simultaneously 20 for one and 211 for nine. The joy of a concurrent Ashes series has never felt more acute than it did that night, when the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams went out to play with everything on the line. Urns were at stake in two places at once and if either England side lost their match their remaining games would be dead rubbers. It\u2019s safe to say there has never been a moment like it. The women\u2019s Ashes has existed in its current format for a decade and the sport\u2019s administrators have only recently become confident enough in the product to schedule its fixtures alongside the men\u2019s. Some worried that concurrent series risked overshadowing the female players, who have always been expected to take a backseat to their male counterparts. The record-breaking figures for attendances at their matches suggests we need not be too anxious on that score. Who could possibly have predicted the series mirroring each other so well: two England teams needing to perform the comeback of a lifetime and both making a fight of it. Neither side expected to find themselves in such a situation. They underperformed in their early games, despite heroic efforts from figures such as Ben Stokes and Tammy Beaumont. The finishes in the first two men\u2019s Tests were thrillingly close; so were those in the women\u2019s Twenty20s. And so to Saturday night at Lord\u2019s, where the third and final game of that T20 mini-series was preceded with a 25-year-old anniversary event for the creation of the women\u2019s Ashes. An elegant plaque was unveiled in the Harris Garden, whose close-cut lawns were populated with mostly female invitees \u2013 ex-players and administrators, journalists and sponsors, women who have contributed much to help the women\u2019s game reach the place it currently occupies. The elderflower fizz and canap\u00e9s were a step up from the original, rather DIY ceremony of 1998 when women\u2019s cricket was still an afterthought and the two captains, Karen Smithies and Belinda Clark, had squatted on paving slabs to burn an autograph-bat in a wok they had borrowed from the caterers\u2019 kitchen. This time, Stephen Fry presided over a garden party atmosphere and several key members of the England and Australia teams socialised and posed for pictures 90 minutes before the start of play. It is hard to imagine either of the men\u2019s Ashes sides being available for similar glad-handing in the immediate buildup to a series-deciding match. The pavilion, meanwhile, was a far happier place than it had been the last time an Australian team visited. Some say that burning sage can cleanse a space of its negative energy, but it turned out the best way to purge the Long Room of the bad vibes it had accumulated during the final day of the men\u2019s Test was to fill it with women and children. The tiny legs of little girls skipping up and down the wooden staircases in their summer dresses brought those echoey old walls to life in an entirely new way. By 7pm, Australia were two wickets down \u2013 in London at least. They were all out in Leeds. Some of the crowds watching the women assumed it was now safe to focus all their attention on the action happening in front of them, but they had reasoned without the rain delays. Brows furrowed over mobile devices as livestreams showed Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley walking to the crease. England fans were now required to perform the paradoxical feat of demanding wickets and begging for none to fall at the exact same time. Dani Gibson came on to bowl at Ashleigh Gardner, who was hit in the belly playing an air shot. As if in revenge, Pat Cummins scudded a short delivery into Duckett\u2019s gloved hand. Duckett scored eight runs off his next two balls. Gardner took 10 more off the over. The double jeopardy was thrilling, and it was almost a shame when England\u2019s men were seen returning to the Headingley pavilion. Almost, but not quite. There\u2019s only a certain amount of nervous energy you can expend and we could pour it all, undiluted, into the short-form game. England\u2019s women won, but not without a nerve-jangler of a final over. The following day England\u2019s men followed their lead. Who knows how much their last-stand efforts are influencing each other, but you can only hope it will continue. England\u2019s women play the first of their three ODIs against Australia on Wednesday and it will doubtless be their hardest challenge yet. If they win at Bristol, and keep themselves in with a chance of winning the series for another game, the story of this summer will become more extraordinary. Two more fixtures follow on 16 and 18 July and by the time the men next meet at Old Trafford, one or other nation will have something to avenge. What could be a better way to draw these contests together?"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fed", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/10/madonna-on-road-to-recovery-following-infection-intensive-care", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Madonna \u2018on road to recovery\u2019 following infection that required intensive care", "lead": "Singer intends to continue European tour as planned in October, following bacterial infection that hospitalised her last month", "author": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:06:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954803", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/07bf75f223241e8b0a885e718b57fb40d66e4c38/0_37_1411_847/500.jpg", "body": "Madonna has said she is \u201con the road to recovery\u201d following a serious illness that left her in intensive care last month, and intends to begin touring again in October.

The postal giant has 1,200 customer service points in total where customers can drop off parcels or pick up post that could not be delivered to their homes. Following the changes, about 50% will now be typically operating between 8am to 10am on weekdays, while on Saturday they will open from 8am to 12pm. Some will also open between 4pm-6pm on Thursday. Previously these points were open until 2pm most days of the week. Critics have raised concerns about the move, saying it will affect working people, and that redelivered items do not always arrive on time. They warn it could also affect businesses that rely on these service points to ship orders for next-day delivery. Royal Mail said it made the decision as doorstep services increase. In May this year, it introduced the option to have a parcel redelivered the next working day if the original attempt was missed. Beth Winter, the Labour MP for Cynon Valley in Wales, has written to the chair of Royal Mail, Keith Williams, saying these points were \u201cindispensable\u201d and offer \u201cflexibility\u201d to working people \u201cwho cannot always be at home to accept deliveries\u201d. Others have also highlighted the security offered by collection points at a time when parcel thefts have been rising. The number of claims for missing parcels jumped by 59% in the year to June compared with the previous 12 months, according to figures from the technology firm Metapack. Businesses could also struggle if they use a customer service point to drop off parcels. Harry Gray, 27, who runs a direct to consumer fashion business based in Manchester said: \u201cAs a Click and Drop business customer I rely on Royal Mail customer service points every day. They allow me to drop parcels on my own schedule, compared with the strict collection times they offer \u2013 which don\u2019t work for my business.\u201d Labour MP Justin Madders wrote to Royal Mail at the beginning of July about changes to opening hours at the Ellesmere Port centre. Madders said Royal Mail announced it would be closing service points in January, but there was a \u201cbacklash\u201d. He added: \u201cWe can all see the strategy is to make it so restrictive in terms of opening hours that in six months\u2019 time, they can say \u2018no is using it\u2019 so they can shut it down. It feels cynical to me. It will drive customers away, and we want the Royal Mail to survive.\u201d A Royal Mail spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand the importance that some customers attach to customer service points (CSPs) as one of a number of ways in which they can access our services. \u201cAn increase in doorstep services such as Parcel Collect and Safeplace are helping us to enhance customer convenience and deliver more parcels first time. In May this year, we also introduced automatic redelivery of parcels the next working day across the UK for customers who are not at home when posties attempt to deliver the first time. Over 99% of parcels are now successfully delivered to customers on the first or second delivery attempt. This is reducing the need for customers to collect parcels from CSPs.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fef", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/10/bbc-presenter-allegations-met-police-fresh-inquiries", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Met police to carry out fresh inquiries into BBC presenter allegations", "lead": "Force assessing if there is evidence of criminality over claims the presenter bought explicit photos from teenager", "author": "Vikram Dodd and Jim Waterson", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:03:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954840", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b7a5ebc18bd1d9b2f32f494a9b7be07db65c3304/0_13_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Scotland Yard said it would carry out fresh inquiries into claims a prominent BBC presenter paid \u00a335,000 for explicit images from a teenager as officers consider whether a full criminal investigation should be launched. Detectives from the Metropolitan police\u2019s specialist crime command had a virtual meeting with BBC representatives on Monday morning to discuss the allegations, Scotland Yard said. BBC officials are understood to have passed information to the police, with corporation bosses having suspended the presenter from appearing on screen after claims he spent \u00a335,000 over three years buying explicit images from a young person. The Met does not consider the threshold for a criminal investigation has yet been reached, but in a statement made it clear the force would carry out further work, but falling short of a formal criminal investigation that would give officers powers of arrest and search. A police spokesperson said: \u201cThey are assessing the information discussed at the meeting and further enquiries are taking place to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed. There is no investigation at this time.\u201d The statement suggests the police are still at the \u201cscoping\u201d stage of the inquiry, where they do not commit to a particular course of action, but it leaves open the option of launching a full investigation. Detectives are trying to work out what, if any, criminal offence may have been committed by the suspended presenter. The young person was allegedly 17 years old when they began talking to the BBC employee, later exchanging explicit pictures and video calls. If the young person sent any explicit pictures when they were 17 then this could count as images of child sexual abuse, a serious criminal offence. But if the explicit photos were exchanged only after the young person turned 18 then it is possible that no law was broken. The age at which individuals can share explicit photographs is higher than the age at which they can legally have sex. Police have also been checking whether the family at the centre of the allegations had lodged a complaint with the Met or any other force in Britain. The Guardian understands a detective chief inspector was overseeing the police\u2019s initial involvement at the weekend as the row intensified. The police would want any complainant to cooperate with any investigation and may ask the BBC to put them in contact with the teenager\u2019s mother, who made an initial complaint and later took the story to the Sun newspaper. The police would also ask the corporation to hand over any material that could be evidence of criminal behaviour. It is not clear whether the young person is cooperating with any of the inquiries. Almost everything that has been made public about the case comes from the individual\u2019s mother, who talked anonymously to the Sun. The Met has a special inquiry team handling the case, known as the celebrity squad \u2013 thanks to its experience dealing with high-profile and sensitive investigations. It is the same team who dealt with the Partygate scandal and made the decisions on which prominent politicians should be referred for fines for lockdown breaches while in Downing Street. Specialists in sexual offences could be asked to assist or lead any investigation, if the police decide one is merited, given the nature of the allegations. The BBC\u2019s internal investigation is being led by Jeff Brown, a former police officer employed by the broadcaster to handle internal complaints. His professional profile says he specialises in \u201ccomplex allegations of current and historic sexual assault/serious criminal wrongdoing\u201d. Media outlets have not named the BBC presenter. There is not believed to be any court order or injunction banning publication of the individual\u2019s name. Instead, the legal risk of linking a prominent person to serious allegations has stopped mainstream news outlets from putting the name in the public domain. The justice secretary, Alex Chalk, urged the broadcaster to \u201cget on with\u201d its part in any investigation. He told Sky News the public would \u201cexpect allegations of that nature to be dealt with very robustly and promptly\u201d and \u201cit may be that, in the fullness of time, there will need to be an investigation about how this allegation was handled\u201d. The BBC director general, Tim Davie, has said a set of allegations was made in May, followed by further claims \u201cof a different nature\u201d last Thursday. The presenter remained on air until last week, when journalists at the Sun approached the BBC for comment. On Monday, the paper reported that the presenter had called the young person after the first press reports appeared, asking: \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d The paper claimed he asked them to call their mother to get her to \u201cstop the investigation\u201d."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/chris-eubanks-lands-knockout-blow-on-stefanos-tsitsipas-to-reach-last-eight", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chris Eubanks lands knockout blow on Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach last eight", "lead": "Chris Eubanks beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 3-6, 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 and said \u2018I feel like I\u2019m living a dream right now \u2026 I can\u2019t believe it\u2019", "author": "Kevin Mitchell at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:02:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954858", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cfff80405acb4bf95b3c315c8a70f603d0b4ad04/1343_2_3304_1982/500.jpg", "body": "Americans love a good fairytale, especially when they return for their annual jaunt across the Atlantic, loaded with empty suitcases for a spot of shopping at Harrods and with expectations that one of their young unknowns can conquer the summer grass of Wimbledon. This year they have another gilded memory to take home and their new hero is the big man from nowhere, Chris Eubanks. Four years ago, it was the 15-year-old Coco Gauff who won a million hearts and three matches before Simona Halep stopped her in straight sets. This year, Eubanks, 12 years older than Gauff was then but equally amiable, a boom-crash debutant from Georgia with a game as big as his smile, also delivered for his compatriots three times. Then, to the surprise of everyone from Athens to Atlanta, he went one further on this mild Monday afternoon to reach the quarter-finals of a grand slam tournament for the first time. Eubanks overpowered the hitherto indefatigable Stefanos Tsitsipas over five sets on No 2 Court, winning 3-6, 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, in a tick beyond three hours. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m living a dream right now,\u201d the popular winner said courtside. \u201cThis is absolutely insane. I can\u2019t believe it. The funny thing about tennis is you\u2019re not always going to play your best, you just have to play well at certain times and I think I did that today. I came up when I needed to. \u201cThis has been a dream come true, but it was really tough. The grass and I have had a strenuous relationship over the years but right now it\u2019s my best friend.\u201d It was a victory to stir the emotions, lift the tournament and inspire dreaming among the beaming Americans cheering him on. A tennis player by accident since befriending Donald Young \u2013 who was already a top-100 professional when his parents opened a centre in their Atlanta neighbourhood \u2013 Eubanks has arrived in the big time almost unnoticed, no mean feat for a man standing 6ft 7in with the wingspan of an eagle and a personality that could charm bees from a buttercup. He came to the fourth round with expectations built on a winning streak of eight matches that began in Mallorca last month, where he won at Tour level for the first time, form he sustained in the first week of these championships by overcoming Thiago Monteiro, a fellow outrider, then the 12th seed, Cameron Norrie, and the Australian Chris O\u2019Connell. When the knockout blow arrived, it did so with the attritional weight once delivered in the ring by his near-namesake from Brighton. A tennis crowd may be the easiest audience in sports entertainment, but these combatants deserved each clap and \u201cooh, aah\u201d, Eubanks conducting the ebb and flow of their appreciation with all the arm-waving skill of Simon Rattle. He was Nick Kyrgios without the attitude. Tsitsipas, the Greek enigma who has played on every day of the tournament in either singles or doubles, and had to dig deep to beat Andy Murray over 4hr 40min two days earlier, occasionally reminded Eubanks why there are 38 places between them in the world rankings. But, ultimately, the workload took its toll. Tsitsipas joked beforehand that it was just as well that the injured Paula Badosa withdrew from their mixed doubles campaign. \u201cMixed is not a thing any more,\u201d he said, when asked how he felt being the only player in a very long time to contemplate playing in all three disciplines. \u201cThank God. I prefer to live.\u201d What he endured on Monday was part of his living, certainly, but did not look as enjoyable for Tsitsipas as it did for Eubanks, who swung from the hip as soon as he found a rhythm. Nerves rattled through his serving arm at the start, however, and 14 unforced errors gifted his seasoned foe the first set. The second was meandering along vaguely similar lines until Tsitsipas faltered in the tie\u2011break and Eubanks levelled, holding his nerve and serve against an opponent who was now wondering how much he had left in the tank. They engaged in old-fashioned slugging in the third and it was Tsitsipas who blinked first, Eubanks surging to a peak as he rattled up the aces and winners, with the occasional deft tap to short range. Tsitsipas found his second wind in the fourth and the good money flowed back his way, before Eubanks came again at just the right moment, rounding it out with a well-placed serve at 117mph to level at two sets apiece. It was almost perfect drama: the prize available for the last man standing. Eubanks made the ideal start, breaking in the opening game and holding to 30. Tsitsipas was on the ropes and Eubanks pummelled him to love for 3-1, hurting him with his 53rd unreturned serve, a 129mph ace down the middle, his 11th of the match and 83rd of the tournament. Soon enough, he would pass Alexander Bublik at the top of the table. Visibly tiring, Tsitsipas was finding the net more than the court, off the ground and with ball in hand. He fashioned a timely counter to break only to hand it straight back. Eubanks aced again and Tsitsipas needed to hold to stay in the championships. On leaden legs and thrashing air with rubber arms, he found an ace for 40-30 and hung on. They had been playing barely three hours, but it seemed longer when Eubanks stepped up to serve for the match. He miscued a backhand: 0-15. Tsitsipas failed to reach a 91mph forehand: 15-15. A tapped volley: 30-15; Eubanks made a hash of a smash: 30-all. He swiped a lazy backhand wide: 30-40. Tsitsipas hit long from deep: deuce. Eubanks butchered the easiest of open-court forehands: advantage to Tsitsipas. The Greek netted from the baseline: deuce. Eubanks sent down an ace for the 13th time: match point. And a booming forehand finished the job. What a win. What a fairytale."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/10/lakota-nation-fight-land-mark-ruffalo", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018We\u2019re used to being told no\u2019: the Lakota people\u2019s fight for sacred land", "lead": "In a powerful Mark Ruffalo-produced documentary, a long-running battle for land that was once stolen is brought to light", "author": "Adrian Horton", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:00:49", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954880", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/14b5c3e98dca4d09901f3aba3cc9ccdc425138fa/55_0_1351_812/500.jpg", "body": "The Black Hills, a cluster of primordial rock fingers and forested knolls in western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming, is so called for the dark shade of its ridges. From space, it appears as an evergreen birthmark in the center of North America, a patch of dense texture on the great, golden plains. It is the oldest mountain range in North America, a sacred site for many Indigenous Americans and, as illustrated in the new documentary Lakota Nation vs the United States, the \u201ccradle of civilization\u201d for the Lakota people. The Lakota fought to protect the Black Hills, and won; in April 1868, members of the US government\u2019s Indian Peace Commission agreed to treaty terms at Fort Laramie, in present-day Wyoming, which pledged on the constitution that the Great Sioux reservation \u2013 all of present-day western South Dakota, as well as parts of North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and Nebraska \u2013 would be \u201cset apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians\u201d. It took eight months to gather various Indigenous leaders to translate the terms of the treaty, and collect or coerce 135 signatures. The documentary, directed by Jesse Short Bull and Laura Tomaselli, sharply contrasts the lush beauty of the Black Hills with the stark, impenetrable language and deadening volume of the legal proclamations used by the US to whittle away Indigenous land, autonomy, freedom. \u201cX marks the verbose legal language used to distract or dull the senses,\u201d says the Oglala Lakota poet Layli Long Soldier in the film\u2019s solemn, hard-bitten narration. \u201cX marks the swindling made possible only because of a language they could not read or write.\u201d The Fort Laramie treaty is one of hundreds forged by the US government to both burnish its reputation as a negotiating power and to expand through the forced removal of Indigenous people. It\u2019s one of the hundreds summarily violated. The film clicks through page after page of treaty document referencing and overriding and nullifying former treaty documents \u2013 a \u201cmuddy switchback trail to follow,\u201d says Long Soldier, a cascade of ever-mutable traps. It is also the legal foundation, upheld in US court, for decades of activism to reclaim the Black Hills. \u201cThe mantle of our treaty has always been held, every single generation since the time of warfare,\u201d Short Bull, who is Oglala Lakota, told the Guardian. For the federal government, \u201cit\u2019s been relegated to a dusty old artifact of non-relevance. But to our people, it was something. We always held it in the highest regard, and always had people committed to keeping the United States on its end of the bargain.\u201d Lakota Nation vs United States takes a sweeping look at this injustice. There\u2019s the violation of the Fort Laramie treaty as part of a pattern of land theft, which began shortly after it was ratified, once gold was reported in the Hills. The film punctures the revisionist history glorifying the \u201clast stand\u201d of Gen George Custer, whose entire regiment was wiped out by a band of Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho in the Battle of Little Bighorn, in 1876. Contrary to American textbook narratives of people inevitably cowed by technologically dominant Europeans, the Sioux Nation \u2013 a collection of tribes called O\u010d\u00e9ti \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b, encompassing the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota peoples \u2013 were in a position of strength relative to the US. The narrative of the Battle of Little Bighorn as some sort of American triumph, or hallowed martyrdom of Custer, \u201cis actually being told by the losers of the battle,\u201d said the actor Mark Ruffalo, an executive producer of the film. \u201cIt really was an invading force that was trying to commit genocide. And they were beaten. The reason for these treaties is because of the strength of the Lakota, Dakota, Nakota people, not because of their weakness.\u201d \u201cThis was a way to live in peace between two sovereign nations, and it was as much in control of our Native brothers and sisters as it was the United States government,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it was the United States government who consistently, over and over again, broke those treaty agreements.\u201d The Indigenous victory at Little Bighorn spurred the US to pass a measure, tucked into an appropriations bill, illegally seizing the Black Hills, confining the Sioux to reservations a fraction of the size promised. Americans hunted the buffalo to near extinction, depriving Indigenous people of their main source of food. Their youth were forcibly assimilated via abusive boarding schools. To add insult to injury, the federal government funded a memorial to US presidents, a contested \u201cshrine to democracy\u201d known as Mount Rushmore, carved on to a sacred mountain. The film offers \u201can alternative history to the one that I\u2019d been taught,\u201d said Ruffalo, who has protested the Dakota Access Pipeline alongside Indigenous activists at the Standing Rock reservation northeast of the Black Hills. \u201cThere was a great injustice that\u2019s happened here, probably one of the deepest injustices that America has not only inflicted on its Native brothers and sisters but inflicted on itself. And now this is time for making that right.\u201d The supreme court has recognized the injustice, if not offered suitable restitution. In 1980, the court upheld the sanctity of the treaty and awarded the Sioux $106m \u2013 about $1-$2 an acre \u2013 in compensation. The Sioux have refused the reward, which still sits in a US treasury account accumulating interest and is now worth about $2bn. \u201cThose billions of dollars would mean a lot,\u201d said Ruffalo, referring to the many chronic issues \u2013 addiction, mental illness, poor health, the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women \u2013 plaguing reservations, which were constructed, as the film says, to subdue a people. \u201cBut the nature of the relationship to this land far exceeds any amount of money or gold the United States might want to heap on these people.\u201d The Black Hills claim dovetails with the modern Land Back movement across the US and beyond to restore land to Indigenous people, covered in the film\u2019s final section, which works to defuse white American fear over a retributive land grab. \u201cI think a lot of white Americans sort of in their heads fear the behavior that their ancestors or colonists did toward Indigenous people, that will happen back to them, like that karma will come back around,\u201d said Tomaselli, the film\u2019s co-director. But \u201cat the end of the day, it\u2019s not about property,\u201d said Short Bull. \u201cIt\u2019s not about a barbed wire fence, something that\u2019s \u2018this is mine, this is yours.\u2019 It\u2019s fundamentally looking at land as something that you are a part of and hold a responsibility to look after.\u201d There is precedent for a land return \u2013 several members of the Great Sioux Nation were able to purchase Pe\u2019 Sla, a sacred Black Hills site in 2012, which is now in federal Indian trust status. In 2018, the Northern Cheyenne tribe of Montana and the Arapaho tribe of Oklahoma purchased 1,020 acres (or about 1.59 square miles) of land near Bear Butte, a bluff and state park northeast of the Black Hills, for $2.3m. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying to people, \u2018Yeah, you did this!\u2019 That\u2019s not the approach,\u201d said Ruffalo. \u201cThe approach is, \u2018You know what, there are decisions being made every single day that affect these issues, and there were decisions that were made that made these issues happen. We\u2019re not the people who did it, but we can be the people who right it.\u201d For such a long trail of injustices, the film\u2019s prevailing tone remains resilient and assertive, if chastened. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of tragedy, a lot of heartache, a lot of pain, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of my relatives carry a lot of things on their shoulders,\u201d said Short Bull. \u201cOur people are used to getting dirt kicked in our face by the federal government. We\u2019re used to being told no. We\u2019re used to being negated to something other than human. That\u2019s not a surprise. We know that very well. But we still hold that optimism, and we know that sometimes it takes awhile.\u201d Lakota Nation vs the United States is in US cinemas on 14 July with a UK date to be announced"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/cricket-ashes-england-moeen-ali-harry-brook", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Moeen Ali plans extra net sessions as England consider keeping him at No 3", "lead": "England are considering making Moeen Ali\u2019s switch to No 3 permanent before the fourth Ashes Test begins at Old Trafford next week", "author": "Ali Martin", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:00:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954899", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/32071658dbc6cdd97ee612cda403724563b9a32b/0_222_2976_1785/500.jpg", "body": "Moeen Ali will double down on batting practice before next week\u2019s fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford with England giving consideration to making his switch to No 3 permanent and keeping Harry Brook\u2019s runs flowing lower down. England pegging Australia\u2019s series lead back to 2-1 at Headingley on Sunday involved reshuffling their batting order for the run chase, with Moeen, an all-rounder, moved from No 7 to first drop. This allowed Brook \u2013 initially selected there after Ollie Pope\u2019s summer-ending shoulder injury at Lord\u2019s \u2013 to return to his more familiar role at No 5. While Moeen recorded a single-figure score, Brook\u2019s 93-ball 75 was central to a target of 251 being reached. Ben Stokes said it was specific to the match situation but he and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, are weighing up a repeat, with Moeen understood to have lined up additional net sessions during the break in anticipation. The position appears high for Moeen despite spending much of his county career there, but Brook would likely welcome it. The Yorkshireman ranked his calm and precise innings - one that made him the quickest player to 1,000 Test runs by way of balls faced (1,058) - as his best despite four centuries on the road last winter. \u201cThat\u2019s probably No 1, especially in front of my home crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cAshes cricket is tough but I went out there with a different mindset. The last couple of innings I\u2019ve got out before that, I felt I was a bit tentative, trying to survive. But I was trying to be as positive as possible and put the pressure on the bowler.\u201d With a squad due to be named this week, another talking point is the form of Jonny Bairstow after a torrid time at his home ground. Three catches failed to nestle in the wicketkeeper\u2019s gloves, another was troublingly left for Brook but was held, while Bairstow\u2019s batting has not fired since making 78 on the opening day of the series. But unless Stokes, McCullum and the team director, Rob Key, believe Bairstow needs whipping out of the firing line for his own good \u2013 a tacit acceptance that the dual role as wicketkeeper has overburdened him so soon after recovering from last year\u2019s broken leg \u2013 the external calls for Ben Foakes to return are likely to go unheeded. Chris Woakes and Mark Wood are now inked into the side after stellar returns in Leeds, while Stuart Broad is the leading bowler in the series with 16 wickets. It means the main decision centres on the final bowling berth, with Ollie Robinson a doubt after back spasms once again left him a passenger for the bulk of a Test match. While that absence meant England effectively won with a four-man attack, there are no guarantees Old Trafford\u2019s surface will be as spicy. Dan Lawrence, the spare batter, could come in at No 3, but it would mean leaving out a bowler and Stokes, unable to bowl much due to injuries, appears sold on the variety of having five. This leaves a choice between recalling Jimmy Anderson at his home ground or injecting further pace into the attack alongside Wood in the form of Josh Tongue."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/10/taylor-swift-eras-tour-presale-tickets-viagogo-resale-price-fans-angry", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Taylor Swift fans angry as Eras tour tickets put on Viagogo for vast sums", "lead": "Fans of US singer express frustration at presale tickets being advertised on resale sites for thousands of pounds", "author": "Anna Davidson", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 17:00:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954919", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c319ef4af45ec5b11bc65afb8d8cc0f0f4c28dc5/0_363_6000_3602/500.jpg", "body": "Taylor Swift fans hoping to buy tickets for her upcoming Eras tour have expressed frustration at presale tickets being advertised at hugely inflated prices within minutes of going on sale.

Fans who preordered the US singer\u2019s latest album, Midnights, from Swift\u2019s official store were given early access, with tickets for London and Edinburgh on sale from Monday morning. One fan expressed anger at London tickets being sold for more than \u00a32,300 when \u201cactual fans couldn\u2019t get the tickets\u201d, while another tweeted asked Ticketmaster on Twitter: \u201cCan these people have their tickets cancelled?\u201d in response to finding multiple tickets being sold for more than \u00a3900 within 15 minutes of the release. On the ticket reselling site Viagogo on Monday afternoon, tickets for Swift\u2019s June performances at Wembley Stadium were being offered for sale from \u00a3400 to \u00a33,352, while resales for her Edinburgh tour dates started at \u00a3171 and peaked at \u00a33,531. A since-deleted screenshot from the site showed a ticket being sold for \u00a36,500, to the outrage of fans in the queue. Prices for the Eras tour were already high, with a London general admission standing ticket costing about \u00a3110, and a standing ticket in the front row costing \u00a3172.25. Fans worldwide have already voiced anxiety about the high cost of tickets. Frustration with people reselling tickets for extortionate prices has been felt beyond the UK and Ireland, with Singaporean fans finding VIP tickets being resold for as much as 16,000 Singaporean dollars (\u00a39,250). This follows similar negative experiences in the US, where fans complained that genuine listeners could not get tickets; one tweeted: \u201cI guarantee the scalpers who bought tickets have ZERO minutes of listening time and have never bought a single remix.\u201d Fans with disabilities also spoke of their disappointment with the sale. Some suggested they had experienced problems, with one describing the queue for access tickets as \u201ca shitshow\u201d in response to a tweet from another fan complaining that they had been unable to get through the queue despite joining at 11am. \u201cThe fact disabled people have to go through this much for a concert is ridiculous. Do better,\u201d tweeted one fan. \u201cApparently disabled fans aren\u2019t welcome on #TheErasTour because nobody has managed to even get through to access tickets lines,\u201d added another. Other fans attempting to buy tickets reported technical issues with the website, with many complaining they had been unable to enter the Ticketmaster waiting room.

When clicking \u2018Join Waiting Room\u2019 the page just refreshes and does not let you into the queue.\u201d There were also complaints about website crashes and people being ill-informed about having an obstructed view.

Are you ready to bowl some thunderbolts?\u2019 I said yes, and that was it,\u201d Wood said. His thunderbolts brought him seven wickets and several records; his bowling in the first-innings peaked at 96.5mph and hit an average speed not seen in this country since Brett Lee visited for the 2005 Ashes. Now his focus is on unleashing some more when the action moves to Old Trafford next week. Wood says he is \u201cabsolutely\u201d determined to make sure \u201clightning strikes twice\u201d, a process which starts immediately with him spending the next few days not doing much. Before Headingley Wood had not played any competitive cricket since leaving the Indian Premier League in mid-April. In the first three days in Leeds he bowled 28.4 overs, eight deliveries fewer than he delivered in the first six months of the year. Given his injury record, and his lack of recent match practice, the free week before the fourth Test is well timed. He not only needs to guard against fatigue, he has physical wounds to heal: Wood so regularly falls to the turf as he strains to deliver the ball at maximum speed he all but shredded the skin on his elbows. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the physio, but I imagine I will bowl once or twice, a couple of gym sessions, maybe some running, but it won\u2019t be too drastic,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to let the body recover. It\u2019s my first game in a very, very long time, especially in Test cricket. I\u2019ll get myself in a good space, let the wounds recover and get myself up for the next one.\u201d Almost as remarkable as the pace of Wood\u2019s bowling was the speed at which he scored with the bat, sprinting to 40 off 16 balls in England\u2019s two innings. Since people started counting how many balls each batter faces nobody has come close to scoring so many runs so quickly in a Test. Wood ended with a strike rate of 250; of those who batted in both innings of a Test his closest rival is Stokes, who scored 41 at 195.2 against Pakistan last December, and of those who batted only once it is Jacques Kallis, with 54 at 216 against Zimbabwe in 2005. \u201cIt fills me with great pride to say I can do well against Australia,\u201d Wood said. \u201cLook at facing Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. One, it\u2019s not easy. Two, it\u2019s really intimidating. They\u2019re bowling fast, they get good bounce. More often than not they come out on top. Luckily this time it\u2019s the one out of a hundred I managed to get through.\u201d Wood did not score the winning runs at Headingley \u2013 that honour fell to Chris Woakes \u2013 but the moment he pulled his second ball into the stands to take England to within 12 of their target certainly felt decisive. It was fitting that England were carried to victory by two players who missed all of last summer due to injury, who were making their first appearances in the series, who had made crucial interventions throughout the match and who drove together to the ground every day of last week, talking about the impact they were determined to make. \u201cWe\u2019ve car-shared all week, we\u2019ve got a lucky car [parking] space, we promised that we\u2019d get runs and wickets,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll park in the same place every time we turn up here.\u201d After three matches that have been thrillingly dramatic, with supremacy swerving drunkenly from one side to the other and with the added spice of a few unexpected storylines \u2013 all of Lord\u2019s turning apoplectic as a result of a stumping; Jonny Bairstow carrying a Just Stop Oil protester off the field like a sack of coal; an argument about a haircut \u2013 pre-series comparisons with the unparalleled drama of the 2005 Ashes are starting to seem realistic. Wood, though, thinks it is not there quite yet. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in it I think you don\u2019t appreciate it as much,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, 2005 was the absolute pinnacle. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s been to that magnitude, but it\u2019s great to have that support, which has been amazing everywhere we\u2019ve been. You feel it on the street walking around, people messaging. It\u2019s amazing as a nation that we can carry this weight of support with us.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/10/christine-backer-obituary", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Christine Baker obituary", "lead": "Editor with the Paris-based publisher Gallimard Jeunesse who was determined to give British children\u2019s books a presence in France", "author": "Julia Eccleshare", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 16:54:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954955", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/70ce7d8b17b1c0f97aa0eb94ae679a80f1e694dd/0_224_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "Christine Baker, who has died aged 71 of cancer, did much to give British children\u2019s books a presence in France, making them readily available to families and schools looking for good material to read. For the French publisher Gallimard Jeunesse she learned to spot the best titles to acquire for the French market, promoted cross-Channel collaborations between authors and illustrators, and so became a central figure in children\u2019s publishing in both countries. On graduation in 1973, Christine worked as a bookseller at L\u2019Artisan du Livre, Paris, before moving to London for a short spell of work experience at the Children\u2019s Book Centre in Kensington. Owned and run by Robin Baker, it was a centre of excellence in promoting children\u2019s books as well as selling them, running interesting events that brought authors, illustrators, readers and the wider book community together. Christine\u2019s work experience soon turned into a full-time job, and her temporary visit became permanent when, in 1977, she married Robin. Through her work she met authors and illustrators, as well as publishers, booksellers, critics and book promoters. She was thus well placed to set about acquiring British books for the French market for the venture that Pierre Marchand and Hedwige Pasquet, the publishers at Gallimard, had embarked on in 1972. Appointed as an editor in 1978, Christine went on to be editorial director of children\u2019s books, with the unshakeable belief that if writing and illustration was good it would easily reach across cultural and linguistic boundaries. An early example of her flair for what could succeed was Michael Morpurgo\u2019s War Horse. Now successfully adapted for the stage and the screen, it was then relatively obscure. \u201cWhen my novel War Horse was published in 1982, it was not much of a success,\u201d said Morpurgo. \u201cBut Christine picked up on it, and after our first meeting she bought the French translation rights to it for Gallimard \u2013 my first foreign rights publication.\u201d The ensuing working relationship and friendship helped Morpurgo, like many other British writers, to become a mainstay of French children\u2019s reading experience. Fiction, non-fiction and picture books were published to the highest possible standards of design and production, and went on to include authors from earlier generations such as JRR Tolkien and Beatrix Potter whose rights had become available. Morpurgo noted how \u201cby cleverly minimising cultural and language barriers she took the extraordinary flowering in the children\u2019s literature of the UK at the time to new audiences all over France\u201d. In 1997 JK Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone also got off to a slow start in Britain. Bloomsbury Publishing cautiously printed only 5,650 copies for its initial print run, with the result that several French publishers turned it down. Again Christine bought the first foreign rights and appointed Jean-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard the translator, following his success with The BFG by Roald Dahl. To ease the passage of Harry Potter into French, Christine proposed translating its celebrated proper names into French words that captured the feel of their English counterparts rather than keeping to the originals, as happened with translations into many other languages. So the school named Hogwarts became Poudlard (pou du lard is \u201clouse of bacon\u201d), while the house within it called Slytherine became Serpentard. Christine was equally skilful at spotting promising British illustrators. In 1990 she commissioned Axel Scheffler to illustrate Mina, Mine de Rien by Marie Farr\u00e9, and later published all the picture books he did with Julia Donaldson as well as Donaldson\u2019s other picture books. \u201cChristine really believed that the art mattered,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cAnd, of course, she was a great believer in cultural exchange and a united Europe.\u2019 The Gallimard Jeunesse list came to include other major children\u2019s book creators of the past 40 years, with Philip Pullman, Eoin Colfer and Lian Hearn among the novelists and Quentin Blake, Michael Foreman, Tony Ross and Jan Pie\u0144kowski among the picture book makers. Christine ensured that British children\u2019s writers, often with editors from the publishers at their side, became frequent visitors to French schools and bookshops and at the huge and celebratory salons de livres de jeunesse for children. \u201cWe did not know it at the time,\u201d Morpurgo said, \u201cBut Christine created a quiet revolution, bringing people closer together through children\u2019s literature, that great but much undervalued pathway of knowledge, understanding and empathy.\u201d One week a month Christine worked in Paris. In the other three weeks she was part of the British children\u2019s book world. Always stylishly dressed, she was a delightful source of wise insights on new books and their creators. Among the Gallimard authors whose books she successfully brought to Britain were Timoth\u00e9e de Fombelle and Jean-Claude Mourlevat. Born and brought up in Sens, Burgundy, south-east of Paris, Christine was the daughter of Jacqueline Guillotin and G\u00e9rard Model, a tannery owner providing fine leathers for fashion and furniture. Educated at the local Catholic school, Christine spent much of her school holidays in Deauville, Normandy, where she developed a passion for the 19th-century painters Corot, Boudin and Monet, who painted the region\u2019s seascapes and locations. She studied French literature at the University of Caen, in northern Normandy. In 2005 she was appointed to the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government, and she maintained her connection with Gallimard after retiring in 2020, keeping the younger editorial team informed about literary and cultural developments in Britain and the US. She is survived by Robin, their daughters Henriette and Mathilde, five grandchildren and her brother Philippe. \u2022 Christine Marie Henriette Baker, book editor and publisher, born 5 February 1952; died 20 April 2023"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/church-of-england-votes-to-bring-back-defrocking-as-punishment-for-clergy", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Church of England votes to bring back \u2018defrocking\u2019 as punishment for clergy", "lead": "Priests or deacons guilty of serious misconduct may be stripped of holy orders in measure abolished 20 years ago", "author": "Harriet Sherwood", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 16:45:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954974", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0849e616caa1fc66117f29934210c8c1fe82c59e/173_0_1542_926/500.jpg", "body": "Clergy who are guilty of serious misconduct may be stripped of their holy orders after the Church of England\u2019s ruling body voted to reinstate \u201cdefrocking\u201d. All priests, from newly ordained curates to the archbishop of Canterbury, could be defrocked under new disciplinary measures backed by the General Synod, which is meeting in York. The power to defrock clergy was abolished more than 20 years ago. At present, the harshest punishment available to church authorities is to impose a lifetime ban on a priest being able to officiate. But their status as a priest is retained and they are entitled to use the title of Reverend. The C of E is to re-introduce the \u201cpower for a bishop to depose a priest or deacon from holy orders following a finding of misconduct that does not involve a question of doctrine, ritual or ceremony\u201d. The effect of deposition from holy orders is that \u201cthe person must thereafter live their life as a layperson\u201d, a background paper said. A separate clause in the measure makes \u201cequivalent provision for deposition from holy orders in respect of a bishop or archbishop\u201d. In 2020, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse recommended that the C of E reintroduce defrocking, saying it would have symbolic importance, particularly for survivors of abuse. The word defrocking refers to the ritual removal of vestments worn by priests, bishops, nuns, monks and others in religious vocations. Defrocking is the ultimate sanction of the Roman Catholic church. Theodore McCarrick, a former archbishop and cardinal, became one of the most senior figures to be defrocked in modern times when he was removed from the priesthood in 2019 after the Vatican found him guilty of sexual abuse. The new C of E clergy conduct measure will replace the existing clergy discipline measure (CDM) that was introduced in 2003. The CDM has been criticised by complainants and the subjects of complaints for delays and lack of transparency. The new measure specifies three levels of complaint. Grievances will be dealt with at a local level; allegations of behaviour amounting to \u201cmisconduct\u201d will be investigated by regional assessors; and claims of \u201cserious misconduct\u201d would be referred to an investigations and tribunal team. People bringing vexatious or malicious complaints could be subjected to restraining orders. A rule requiring complaints of serious misconduct to be brought within one year will be abolished. The new measure also requires clergy to disclose to their superiors when they divorce or judicially separate from their spouses. Final approval of the new measure is expected next year."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/10/inflation-bank-of-england-boss-andrew-bailey-speech", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank of England boss vows to \u2018see the job through\u2019 on reducing inflation", "lead": "Andrew Bailey to give speech in City of London signalling further interest rate rises are in store", "author": "Larry Elliott Economics editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 16:39:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.954992", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee451a92d5ea9305a4b10025aecfb49f583a708/0_115_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "The Bank of England governor has signalled further interest rate pain is in store for mortgage holders and businesses as he said Threadneedle Street had to \u201csee the job through\u201d on reducing inflation.

In a speech the governor will say current levels of price and wage increases are inconsistent with reducing inflation \u2013 now at 8.7% \u2013 back to the government\u2019s 2% target. He is expected to say: \u201cOver the last 20 months, we have raised Bank rate by nearly five percentage points. Some of that tightening is still to come through the policy pipeline, and we expect underlying inflationary pressures to recede as headline inflation falls. \u201cBut the monetary policy committee is monitoring developments \u2013 in particular, those in the labour market, in wage growth and in services price inflation \u2013 to assess whether pressures are proving more persistent.\u201d The next set of official wage growth figures will be released on Tuesday and the June cost of living data is due out on 19 July. Both will have a crucial bearing on what happens next to interest rates, which stand at 5%. The financial markets currently think the Bank will need to raise rates above 6% to bring inflation back under control. Bailey will say: \u201cIt is crucial that we see the job through, meet our mandate to return inflation to its 2% target, and provide the environment of price stability in which the UK economy can thrive. This is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the prosperity of the United Kingdom.\u201d In his speech, the governor will say the UK economy has been hit by a series of external inflationary shocks: higher goods prices in global markets owing to supply bottlenecks created by the pandemic, and higher energy and food prices linked to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cLooking ahead, UK headline inflation is set to fall markedly over the remainder of the year. This largely owes to lower energy prices as last year\u2019s substantial increases drop out of the annual calculation. Food prices should fall too as lower commodity prices feed through to prices in the shops,\u201d Bailey will say. Even so, the economy had shown unexpected resilience, with unemployment below 4% and the economy avoiding recession. \u201cNo one wishes to see unemployment higher or growth weaker. But the interaction of above-target headline inflation with labour market tightness and demand pressure in the economy has made underlying developments in goods and services price inflation more sticky than previously expected.

David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the Labour party was adding its voice to a growing list of countries and businesses urging that moves to start mining be halted \u201cuntil and unless\u201d there was clear scientific evidence that it could be done safely and the marine environment would be protected by new regulations. Last week, Ireland and Sweden became the latest developed economies to join scientists, environmental organisations, and multinationals including BMW, Volvo and Samsung, in opposing the rush to mine the deep sea. Britain is among 14 countries sponsoring exploration or research contracts \u2013 the only type allowed so far \u2013 by companies intent on mining the deep sea. The others are China, Russia, South Korea, India, France, Poland, Brazil, Japan, Jamaica, Belgium, Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati. On Monday, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), an autonomous organisation under the United Nations umbrella of 168 member states charged with regulating deep-sea mining, opened a key meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, to resume negotiations over exploitation. It is possible that commercial applications for deep-sea mining could get the green light even before any regulations are approved, because of a deadline that passed on Sunday 9 July. In a speech at the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law in London, Lammy said Labour would restore the UK\u2019s reputation as a country that respected and upheld international law, which he said had been damaged by the Conservatives, and to lead on the challenges of the future, including the climate crisis. \u201cBecause the climate crisis can only be solved at a global level and today, as the International Seabed Authority meets to discuss deep-sea mining, Labour will join France, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Spain, Chile, Ecuador, Vanuatu and Costa Rica, as well as businesses including BMW, Renault, Google, Samsung and Philips, in taking action by calling for a precautionary pause on this practice until and unless there is clear scientific evidence it can be done safely and the marine environment can be effectively protected by new regulation,\u201d he said. Lammy described the climate emergency as \u201cthe greatest challenge we face\u201d and said Labour would take a leading role in proposing new international legal frameworks to face the crisis. He set out how, if the party won the next election, a Labour government would enshrine its commitment to the international rule of law, push for climate action to become a fifth pillar of the UN \u2013 alongside peace, human rights, the rule of law and development \u2013 and work with international partners at the international criminal court to agree a new global law of ecocide. Greenpeace, which has long called for a halt to deep-sea mining, welcomed Labour\u2019s stance as a \u201cwelcome step towards stopping this industry\u201d. Ariana Densham, Greenpeace UK\u2019s head of oceans, said: \u201cLabour\u2019s commitment to a precautionary pause for deep-sea mining is a welcome step towards stopping this industry from ever starting. They join a movement of countries, scientists and businesses which say no, due to the inherent risks the deep-sea mining industry poses to the marine environment. \u201cBy announcing this on the first day of the ISA meeting in Jamaica, Labour\u2019s commitment exposes how the UK government\u2019s position is out of line with science and its own longstanding promise to protect the oceans,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK government should take note and follow Labour\u2019s lead to confirm support for a ban or moratorium within the critical global negotiations over the next fortnight.\u201d The UK has so far only pushed for high environmental standards via the ISA and said it would not support commercial mining \u201cunless and until\u201d there were enforceable regulations and enough scientific evidence to judge the impact on marine ecosystems. A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cWe recognise the growing pressure to extract deep-sea resources and are concerned about the potential impacts of mining activities on the fragile marine environment. \u201cThis is why the UK will maintain its precautionary and conditional position of not sponsoring or supporting the issuing of any exploitation licences for deep-sea mining projects unless and until there is sufficient scientific evidence about the potential impact on deep-sea ecosystems, and strong enforceable environmental regulations, standards and guidelines have been developed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and are in place.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ff9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/10/charlie-watts-book-collection-to-go-on-sale-at-christies-rolling-stones", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Charlie Watts\u2019 book collection to be sold at Christie\u2019s", "lead": "Rare books owned by the Rolling Stones drummer \u2013 including first editions of The Great Gatsby and The Hound of the Baskervilles \u2013 will be auctioned this autumn", "author": "Ella Creamer", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 16:06:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.955065", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ba25865b8655de0bac7d0611885254f4c1e0282c/0_0_4078_2448/500.jpg", "body": "Hundreds of rare books owned by the Rolling Stones drummer and bibliophile Charlie Watts will be put up for sale this autumn, representing the \u201cbest collection of modern first editions\u201d to come to auction in over 20 years.

Anonymous reports of the incident emerged online early last week. On Thursday, activists demonstrated outside company offices, sticking sanitary towels on the gates in protest at the \u201chumiliating\u201d treatment the workers had faced.

Orwoba says companies should implement policies that ensure workers have access to proper menstrual products, facilities and information to manage their periods with hygiene and dignity. Kenyan MP Anne Muratha called for the women subjected to the strip-search to be compensated, amid calls by other representatives for \u201cserious actions\u201d to be taken against the company.

That is it from me for today. Thanks for reading. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said his party is focused on improving children\u2019s confidence, not changing accents. In an interview with BBC Radio Tees, he said Labour\u2019s education reforms on improving children\u2019s speaking skills are about helping children and young people \u201cspeak clearly\u201d. I think it\u2019s the confidence is actually what I\u2019d say. Children and young people being able to speak clearly. Whatever accent they\u2019ve got doesn\u2019t really matter. He denied the Conservatives were ahead of Labour on boosting vocational education but admitted there was some \u201cbrilliant stuff going on\u201d. Penny Mordaunt has said she hopes today\u2019s debate on the privileges committee report that criticised the behaviour of Boris Johnson\u2019s allies will be the \u201cend of this sorry affair\u201d. The Commons leader said the report was an \u201cexceptional situation\u201d and not part of the usual \u201ccut and thrust of politics\u201d. She told MPs today: I hope colleagues who have been named will reflect on their actions. One of the most painful aspects of this whole affair is that it has involved animosities between colleagues and colleagues of the same political hue. But I know of at least one member named in the report who has taken the time to speak with regret to some other members of that committee and I applaud them for doing so. Referring to former PM George Canning, who as foreign secretary fell out with the war minister over troops deployment and was challenged to a duel by Lord Castlereagh in 1809, she added: I hope that some speeches we might hear this afternoon will acknowledge that obligation we have to one another as colleagues. If Castlereagh and Canning could adopt polite civility after fighting a duel, I live in hope that today will be the end of this sorry affair. Buckingham Palace has said the king\u2019s meeting with Joe Biden \u2013 his first with the US president since his coronation \u2013 was \u201cextremely cordial and successful\u201d. A spokesperson for the king said the Windsor Castle visit was \u201can extremely cordial and successful meeting that touched on a wide variety of issues of mutual interest and concern.\u201d They added: You will have seen for yourselves the personal warmth between his majesty and the president. Empty council offices could provide 20,000 new homes, according to a new cross-party inquiry by MPs. The findings, published today, said the conversion of empty commercial and business premises into flats could play a big role in addressing the housing crisis. However, the group warned, standards for \u201cpermitted development rights\u201d need to be improved in order to make sure the new homes would be suitable to be lived in. Bob Blackman, the Conservative MP for Harrow East and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on ending homelessness, said: The report comes against a backdrop of a severe shortage of affordable housing, which is a core driver of homelessness. We have heard from witnesses that there is significant scope to repurpose empty buildings to help ease the housing crisis. Taken together, the recommendations from this inquiry will ensure that conversions are of high quality and contribute to creating places people want to live, rather than making the housing and homelessness crisis worse. John Kerry has said that King Charles was \u201cway ahead of the curve on a lot of this\u201d referring to the climate crisis \u2013 as is Joe Biden with his climate bill. The US special presidential envoy for climate, who made the comments in an interview broadcast by Sky News, took part in Windsor\u2019s \u201clong walk\u201d. He told the BBC that the meeting with the king had gone well and praised his 60 years of campaigning. After an extended runway chat at Stansted with Jane Hartley, the US ambassador to the UK, Biden embarked on Air Force One to set off for tomorrow\u2019s Nato summit in Lithuania. Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak agreed to ensure Sweden\u2019s Nato accession and safely develop AI, as well as support Ukraine and progress UK-US economic partnership, Downing Street has said. Tweeting after their garden meeting in Downing Street this morning, No 10 said: The prime minister also shared a message from Biden written in the Downing Street visitor book that read: \u201cMay our two great nations always [underlined] stay together as we defend our shared values and build a better and better future for the world.\u201d Ministers are offering rebel Conservative MPs concessions on key asylum legislation amid growing concern it could face defeats in the Commons. The government is expected to limit plans to detain children and pregnant women who arrive in the UK by small boats and drop some of the retrospective applications of the illegal migration bill\u2019s measures, the Guardian understands. It remains unclear whether compromises will be offered to protect victims of modern slavery, as demanded by MPs including Theresa May. The bill, which is meant to fulfil Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, will complete its final stage in the House of Lords with a vote on Monday night. The draft legislation returns to the House of Commons on Tuesday for MPs to consider the 20 amendments made to it by peers. The government was expected to offer a concession to Conservative MPs opposed to the bill\u2019s powers to detain unaccompanied children, sources confirmed. Another would also limit the time period for locking up pregnant women who cross the Channel, it is understood. Amendments will be released by the government at 4.30pm on Monday. After MPs vote on the bill on Tuesday, it will be passed back to the Lords to decide whether the upper chamber will once again amend the bill in a process known as \u201cping-pong\u201d. Ministers are seeking to ensure that the illegal migration bill will enable the detention of asylum seekers who arrive via irregular means and their deportation to a third country such as Rwanda. London Underground drivers are to strike in a long-running dispute over pensions and conditions. Aslef said its members would take action on 26 July and 28, coinciding with industrial action by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. It will coincide with members of the RMT union also taking \u201crolling action\u201d between Sunday 23 July and Friday 28 July. The RMT said there would be no strike on Monday 24, with staff in different sections and grades halting work on different shifts on each of the other days. Finn Brennan, Aslef\u2019s full-time organiser on London Underground, said: \u201cWe take action only when needed. Unfortunately, the last few weeks have shown that London Underground management are determined to try to push through detrimental changes, despite trade union opposition.\u201d At the Unite conference in Brighton, delegates debated whether the trade union \u2013 one of Britains\u2019s biggest \u2013 should sever ties with Labour. Any such move would put a serious dent in Labour\u2019s finances and could set the union on a path to donating money to other parties or candidates. Delegates \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d chose to retain Unite\u2019s formal link with Labour, Aubrey Allegretti reports, but the general secretary, Sharon Graham, said Keir Starmer had been put \u201con notice\u201d and she warned that the union\u2019s support should not be taken for granted. \u201cLabour must be Labour and the union must push them into that position,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must make them take different choices. We will not make the same mistakes of the past. There will be no blank cheques for Labour until we see tangible results.\u201d However, she added: \u201cThis is the moment of maximum leverage for the union where we can hold Labour to account. Now cannot be the time to walk away. We would be weakening our own arm. \u201cIt would be the worst time to leave the Labour party when they are in touching distance of power. If we leave we wouldn\u2019t influence that power.\u201d A few more details from this morning\u2019s Downing Street meeting between Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden. Also among the issues discussed (see also 12.46pm) were: The US decision to provide Ukraine with cluster munitions US secretary of state Antony Blinken and British foreign secretary James Cleverly also attended the meeting, which lasted around 40 minutes The UK\u2019s commitments under an international convention not to produce or use cluster munitions and to discourage their use. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said they \u201cdiscussed the requirements the prime minister is under because of this convention, and the UK is upholding that\u201d David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has accused the government of giving Russia and China \u201cammunition\u201d to defend breaking international law. The MP for Tottenham said a future Labour government would commit to restoring the duty for ministers to comply with international law after the obligation was removed by the Conservatives under David Cameron. A Labour-run government would have an \u201cunwavering respect for the rule of law both in domestic law and international law\u201d he said, during a speech to the Bingham Centre of International Law today. As prime minister, Boris Johnson threatened to rewrite Northern Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit trade arrangements without agreement from the EU. The nationality and borders act, meanwhile, has attracted widespread condemnation by lawyers and UN officials. The illegal migration bill has also been heavily criticised. Lammy said: We consistently proclaim the importance of complying with international law to other nations. We tell Iran to comply with the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). We tell China to comply with the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Hong Kong. We are right to do so. Agreements must be kept. Yet our ability to protect and promote international law has been fundamentally undermined by the dangerous attitude of the present government. It has weakened our foreign policy while strengthening that of our rivals. It has provided ammunition to countries such as Russia and China, who use allegations of hypocrisy as a tool in the UN. He added: Labour\u2019s vision for foreign policy is to reconnect Britain for our security and prosperity at home. We believe in Britain but we are frustrated by the Conservative-manufactured decline in our influence. We can restore Britain\u2019s standing and realise our potential by using the international rule of law as the connective tissue which binds us to other nations. Rishi Sunak is not expected to attend a Commons debate today about the privileges committee report that criticised the conduct of Boris Johnson\u2019s allies. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said I am not aware that it has been confirmed that there will be a vote. The PM is due to fly to Vilnius in Lithuania later today ahead of tomorrow\u2019s critical Nato summit. Downing Street has said the number of people crossing the Channel is \u201ctoo large\u201d after more than 1,000 migrants crossed in the last three days. Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said: I think we always knew that, as we move into the summer months, crossings will escalate. We are continuing to stop significant numbers of crossings. I still believe that you are more likely to be stopped and turned back than to make the crossing, and that\u2019s because of the work with our French counterparts and the extra support that we have put in. But clearly the numbers making the journeys are still too large and that\u2019s why we need the other elements of our \u2018stop the boats\u2019 package. The package mentioned includes the Rwanda deal, which is subject to a legal battle headed for the supreme court, and the illegal migration bill, which came under heavy criticism in the House of Lords. The government has said it has handed over \u201call requisite material\u201d to the Covid-19 inquiry after losing a high court bid to block a request for Boris Johnson\u2019s unredacted WhatsApp messages. Last week\u2019s legal defeat came with a new cabinet office deadline to hand over the former prime minister\u2019s messages, notebooks and diaries in full by 4pm today. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cAll requisite material has been handed over.\u201d A few images of Biden\u2019s arrival at Windsor: After Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Downing Street this morning, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson has tried to play down reports that the UK and US are split over Ukraine\u2019s hopes to join Nato. The subject would be a discussion point at this week\u2019s Nato summit in Lithuania. The spokesperson said: Certainly, we do want to support Ukraine on the pathway to joining the alliance, the exact mechanisms for that are for discussion with Nato allies. Rejecting suggestions that the two countries\u2019 positions on the issue differed, the spokesperson said: I have seen that reporting but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s accurate. Biden touches down at Windsor castle to meet the King for first time since coronation. After warmly greeting the king, Biden listened to the US national anthem before inspecting the guard of honour. Followed by the king, he looked the soldiers in the eyes and appeared solemn before the two men disappeared inside for tea and a conversation with philanthropic leaders on climate. Back to Windsor, where the king and Biden shake hands, Biden placing one arm behind the king\u2019s back, before listening to a performance of the US national anthem. During his meeting with Rishi Sunak, Joe Biden said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be meeting with a closer friend and greater ally\u201d. Despite clashes over Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership and cluster munitions, he said the UK-US relationship was \u201crock solid\u201d, reports the BBC. Sunak said it was \u201cgreat for us to carry on our conversation\u201d and that the leaders would think about how to strengthen cooperation and joint economic security Biden has touched down at Windsor castle for his first meeting with king since his coronation. The king has taken his position to welcome the president. When Biden met the late queen in 2021 he said she reminded him of his mother. The presidential helicopters have come into view above Windsor Castle. Once they have landed, Joe Biden will make an entrance by car \u2013 his first meeting with the king since the coronation, which first lady Jill Biden attended without the president. When Joe Biden met the then Prince Charles at Cop26 in Glasgow, the royal made an urgent call for action. Also in 2021, they met at the G7 meeting in Cornwall, where the environment was a central theme. After Downing Street, where he sat down for tea with Rishi Sunak in the garden, the next stop for Joe Biden in his whistlestop UK visit is Windsor Castle. Although it is not a state visit, he will be greeted with a royal salute and a performance of the US national anthem by the Welsh Guards before having more tea \u2013 this time with the king. There they will meet finance and philanthropic leaders who will tell them about the findings of a climate finance mobilisation forum on how to support poorer nations. The US president and Sunak will soon be meeting again, at the long-anticipated two-day Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, which kicks off tomorrow. Moving away from the transatlantic love-in for a moment, a seventh SNP MP has confirmed he will not contest his seat at the next general election. Falkirk MP John McNally has ruled himself out for re-election after eight years at Westminster. The 72-year-old was first elected in the 2015 general election after securing a significant 19,701 vote majority. But the barber by trade has now followed a string of high-profile SNP colleagues by confirming he will not contest his Westminster seat when an election is held next year. The politician revealed to the Falkirk Herald that the decision had been taken to allow him to spend more time with his family. His decision not to seek re-election follows the party\u2019s Westminster deputy leader, Mhairi Black, who announced last week she was stepping down due to the toxic environment. Former Westminster SNP leader Ian Blackford and ex-party deputy leader Stewart Hosie are among the high-profile names also choosing not to contest their seats. His colleagues Peter Grant, Angela Crawley and Douglas Chapman will also not contest their seats. Joe Biden appeared in good spirits as he left No 10 following talks with Rishi Sunak, PA media reports Biden emerged alongside Sunak at 11.17am and briefly paused on the doorstep to look up at the sky. The US president then shared a brief exchange with the prime minister and stopped to smile widely for the cameras, before returning to his car and departing Downing Street. Joe Biden said the UK-US relationship is \u201crock solid\u201d as he visited Downing Street to meet Rishi Sunak ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Nato summit. More pictures from Biden\u2019s arrival at Downing Street \u2013 his first as president. Joe Biden has arrived at Downing Street for his first time as president ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Nato summit in Lithuania. After stepping out of US presidential vehicle \u201cthe Beast\u201d, he shared a warm handshake with Rishi Sunak on the doorstep and smiled to press before disappearing behind the door to Number 10. Also in the presidential convoy was the US ambassador to the UK, Jane Hartley. Joe Biden\u2019s convoy has been filmed leaving Winfield House, the official residence of the US ambassador, and is on its way from Regent\u2019s Park to Downing Street. Labour must do more to dispel the perception of racism within the party, the widow of one of the country\u2019s first black British MPs has said, amid frustrations that no graduate of the party\u2019s sole scheme for developing minority ethnic talent has been selected to stand as an MP. The party has launched the second cohort of its Bernie Grant leadership programme (BGLP), dedicated to developing the next generation of black politicians, in recognition of a lack of diversity across all levels. Sharon Grant criticised the party for not following through with its promise to provide support to graduates, many of whom are councillors, adding the BGLP may not be \u201cworthy of bearing Bernie\u2019s name\u201d unless there is tangible progress on black representation across the party. Larry the cat is cheered by waiting press at Downing Street by stepping on to the red carpet put out for Joe Biden. The White House has said the visit is intended to \u201cfurther strengthen the close relationship between our nations\u201d. Joe Biden\u2019s Westminster arrival appears to be imminent. A red carpet is being prepared outside Downing Street. Suella Braverman has condemned climate activists targeting private weddings as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d after a woman threw orange confetti at former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s wedding on Saturday. She told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: I totally disagree. I don\u2019t care what your cause is, there really is no good reason to try and interrupt another private citizen\u2019s civil liberties, rights, freedoms. And the way in which this person has attempted to ruin someone else\u2019s wedding day... I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t succeed, incidentally, because their efforts will have been in vain. They are only alienating supporters rather than attracting them. It is unacceptable, it is deplorable and, as I have made very clear time and time again, the militant, disruptive, selfish tactics of groups like Just Stop Oil, who are causing misery in many cases to the law-abiding majority through slow walking, through various extreme tactics, is totally unacceptable. Their approach is not working but I\u2019m very pleased with how the police have been responding. She added: We\u2019ve given them extra powers through our new Public Order Act, they have been able to take swift action and actually in recent weeks since the powers came into force, it has averaged on some days less than 10 minutes for the police to intervene and stop Just Stop Oil from causing serious disruption to the law-abiding majority. Just Stop Oil have praised the protest but denied responsibility. After touching down at Stansted last night, Joe Biden will meet Rishi Sunak at Downing Street this morning ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Nato summit in Vilnius. After his meeting with the prime minister \u2013 where topics for discussion are expected to include the war in Ukraine, the country\u2019s Nato membership bid and sending cluster munitions to Ukraine (which the US has faced criticism for) \u2013 he will then have tea with the king in Windsor. Biden is hesitant on Ukraine\u2019s Nato bid, while Sunak supports tracking membership. They are also expected to discuss the Northern Ireland peace process post-Brexit. Last night, John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate envoy, told the BBC it will form a \u201ccritical component\u201d of their discussion. The meeting, which will be their fifth in as many months, comes ahead of a long and highly anticipated crunch two-day Nato summit in Lithuania, which starts tomorrow, as several countries \u2013 including Ukraine and Sweden - are trying to join the alliance. His arrival in Windsor is to be received with a royal salute, a performance of the US national anthem by the Welsh Guards and tea. Biden and the king will meet financial and philanthropic leaders where climate finance will be on the agenda. After Biden\u2019s arrival last night he flew by helicopter to the London residence of the US ambassador. I will be looking after the UK politics blog today.

With Carlos Rodr\u00edguez fourth and Pidcock seventh, Ineos Grenadiers are well placed with two riders in the Tour\u2019s top 10. And Pidcock, who finished 43 seconds behind the defending champion, Vingegaard, in Sunday\u2019s mountain finish on the Puy de D\u00f4me, says he is relishing a new challenge. The 23-year-old Yorkshireman, a stage winner at Alpe d\u2019Huez in last year\u2019s Tour, is gradually transitioning from opportunist to contender while bringing renewed focus to an Ineos team that was suffering from a sense of drift. \u201cI\u2019m kind of enjoying it, especially as I\u2019m getting a bit better,\u201d said Pidcock, winner of this year\u2019s Italian classic, the Strade Bianche. \u201cI\u2019m improving and staying nearer the front. It\u2019s motivating me. Before, if you\u2019d said \u2018[you\u2019re] racing for top 10\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t really be so bothered, but now I\u2019m enjoying the challenge. \u201cThe patience and the focus it requires for three weeks, riding for GC [general classification], is not really in my characteristics. Thinking about it, it\u2019s my first time riding GC with the pros in a proper stage race. So it\u2019s all new.\u201d Pidcock\u2019s Tour got off to an uncertain start, with a loss of time on the opening weekend immediately setting him back. Asked at the start of stage five in Pau, when he thought Pidcock would be ready to assume leadership responsibilities, the Ineos sports director, Steve Cummings, said: \u201cGood question.\u201d \u201cThe first day was not how I\u2019d hoped,\u201d Pidcock said, \u201cbut in general it\u2019s gone pretty well, with each day growing in confidence, exploring my limits.\u201d Pidcock described his performance on the Puy de D\u00f4me as \u201ca great day\u201d, adding: \u201cIf I can replicate that again, that\u2019s fantastic. These next two weeks there are some pretty tough days ahead, back-to-back days as well, with three days in the Alps, so it\u2019s going to be a big test.\u201d The Tour\u2019s final week of climbing and descending will be the acid test of Pidcock\u2019s resilience. Gruelling stage finishes in Morzine, Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc and Courchevel, will create even bigger gaps in the peloton. \u201cWeek three is where cracks start to show and my goal is to be consistent,\u201d Pidcock said. \u201cIn my head, that\u2019s becoming more of a challenge and a target to see where I can go on GC. I can learn a lot about myself if I fully commit to GC.\u201d While Pidcock\u2019s trajectory is steadily upwards, teammate Egan Bernal, winner of the Tour in 2019, is now in 31st place. The Colombian, who suffered life-threatening injuries 18 months ago in a training crash, is now devoting himself to Pidcock\u2019s cause. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly impressive,\u201d Pidcock said. \u201cEgan had a bit of a free role, but now he\u2019s not [involved] in GC and he\u2019s immediately switched to helping me and Carlos. It\u2019s really an honour that a guy like him puts 100% into me and Carlos. He could easily have said: \u2018Fuck this, this is not what I want\u2019.\u201d While Pidcock adjusts to racing for a top-five finish, the Yates twins, Adam and Simon, are also handily placed in fifth and sixth respectively.

Allisen Corpuz prevailed over Charley Hull at the US Women\u2019s Open at Pebble Beach on Sunday and Obama was immediate in his praise towards his fellow Hawaiian. \u201cYou make us all proud,\u201d said the 44th president of the United States on social media. \u201cHe has done a lot in his career,\u201d Corpuz responded with more than a hint of understatement. \u201cThat is really special.\u201d The nature of Corpuz\u2019s triumph was similarly striking. The 25-year-old had been trending in the right direction in majors \u2013 she was tied fourth at the Chevron Championship and shared 15th at the PGA championship \u2013 but missed three cuts in four previous US Open appearances. Corpuz had never won a mainstream tour event before; the weight of expectation at Pebble Beach played a part in her deliberate approach and she was warned she could be penalised for slow play during round four. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a pretty calm demeanour,\u201d she said. \u201cNot so much on the inside, but projecting that outwardly. I\u2019ve always been pretty calm. I was really telling myself I belong out here, I\u2019m good enough to compete. That\u2019s just been what I\u2019ve been telling myself for the past two years. \u201cGetting my tour card, that was just kind of the beginning of the journey and you never really know what\u2019s going to happen after that. I have just really been working really hard the last few years but I have a lot of gratitude just to be out here. Every few holes I looked out and said, \u2018I\u2019m out here at Pebble Beach.\u2019 There\u2019s not many places that are better.\u201d Hull emerged as the key threat on the final day in California but Corpuz won by three, at nine under par, after a closing 69. Her highest 18-hole score at the famous venue was 71. \u201cThis was something I had dreamed of, but at the same time kind of just never really expected it to happen,\u201d Corpuz said. \u201cEspecially just knowing the history. Tiger Woods absolutely annihilated this place [in 2000]. Yeah, it\u2019s really special.\u201d Corpuz had also took regular motivation from Michelle Wie, whom as a school pupil she watched win the US Open in 2014. Wie bid farewell to professional golf, aged 33, at Pebble Beach on Friday. \u201cI never really compared myself to her,\u201d Corpuz said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to make my own name. She has just served as a really big inspiration.\u201d Wie, who also hails from Hawaii, was supposedly destined to add to that major win of nine years ago but never did. Corpuz has moved to third in the US Solheim Cup standings and it now seems inevitable she will make her debut in the clash with Europe in September. Hull, meanwhile, was understandably bullish after her highest major finish since 2016. The Englishwomen closed with a terrific 66, which included a front nine of just 32. Hull\u2019s freewheeling approach was noticeable. \u201cI\u2019m quite an aggressive person when it comes to life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m quite fast and I just feel like I\u2019m quite aggressive on the course. I like to go for pins. At the end of the day it\u2019s just a game and might as well make it fun. If I want something, I\u2019ll go and get it. That\u2019s my mentality. \u201cI was the one chasing it down so it was quite fun. I enjoy chasing someone because you have got to make birdies and make a move up that leaderboard. That was pretty much my mindset.\u201d Hull\u2019s consolation was a cheque for almost $970,000 (\u00a3756,000). Corpuz\u2019s win earned her $2m, which supplied further proof of the increased commitment to women\u2019s golf by the United States Golf Association."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5ffe", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/nato-sweden-pm-to-meet-with-turkeys-erdogan-in-last-ditch-bid-to-seal-membership", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pave way for Turkish EU entry then Sweden can join Nato, says Erdo\u011fan", "lead": "Surprise obstacle thrown in way of Joe Biden plan involving offer of F-16 jets after last-minute talks", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 15:47:42", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.955182", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5c25954f842711bed15c936b7bf8f04f81e7cb67/0_88_5818_3491/500.jpg", "body": "The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has thrown a surprise obstacle in the way of a plan from Joe Biden for Swedish accession to Nato by announcing he wanted Turkey\u2019s stalled application to join the EU to be included in the package. Speaking at the airport before departing for the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Turkish president said: \u201cFirst, let\u2019s pave the way for Turkey in the European Union and then we will pave the way for Sweden just as we did for Finland.\u201d The US president had been working on a four-country deal that would lead to Turkey allowing Sweden into Nato in return for the sale of US F-16 jets to Ankara, on the condition they are not used to threaten Greece. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s remarks suggest diplomats\u2019 eve-of-summit efforts to lift the year-long Turkish veto on Sweden\u2019s membership of Nato will be even more complex than envisaged. Turkey has been in talks over joining the EU in one form or another since 1987 but there is no enthusiasm for letting such a large country with a questionable human rights record join. Biden held further last-minute talks with Erdo\u011fan on his flight to Europe on Sunday but no breakthrough occurred during their nearly hour-long conversation, according to the White House. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, rejected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s attempt to link Turkey\u2019s EU membership aspirations to Sweden\u2019s application to join Nato. \u201cThat\u2019s a question that is not related to the other issue, and therefore I think this should not be seen as a related matter,\u201d Scholz said in Berlin. Erdo\u011fan has voiced repeated frustrations with what he calls Sweden\u2019s failure to keep its promise to deal with suspected Kurdish militants allegedly \u201croaming the streets\u201d of Stockholm. \u201cSweden has taken some steps in the right direction,\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s office quoted the Turkish leader as telling Biden in a call on Sunday. But Sweden\u2019s decision to allow pro-Kurdish groups to \u201chold demonstrations freely praising terrorism nullify those steps\u201d, Erdo\u011fan was reported to have said. Over the weekend, the link between Sweden\u2019s Nato membership and the Turkish demand for the US Congress to permit the sale of F-16 jets to Turkey has become more explicit, as well as the conditions on which Congress would sanction the sale. On Monday, Erdo\u011fan held discussions with the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, at a meeting chaired by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. After two hours of talks in Vilnius with the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, Erdo\u011fan broke off discussions to meet separately with the EU council president, Charles Michel \u2013 a possible indication that EU officialdom is being drawn into his unexpected demand to revive Turkey\u2019s accession talks. He is scheduled to meet Biden on Tuesday and also hold his first meeting with the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, in 15 months. Formally, the Swedish bid to follow Finland into Nato remains linked to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s demand that more is done to clamp down on Kurdish activists in Sweden, including extraditing a group of Kurdish exiles seen as suspected terrorists by Ankara. Some of those on the list for extradition are Swedish citizens, and cannot be extradited. The Swedish foreign minister, Tobias Billstr\u00f6m, said on Monday: \u201cNo one disputes that Sweden has done what we were also expected to do, in accordance with this memorandum, including taking measures that now lead to people who have been active in the PKK (the Kurdish workers party) being punished in Swedish courts.\u201d Last Thursday, a Swedish court convicted a member of the PKK and the country extradited a PKK supporter to Turkey. He said Sweden\u2019s membership of Nato was a settled issue and the only outstanding matter was when the accession would occur. Observers acknowledge that even if given the green light by Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish parliament would not be able to ratify Swedish membership by the end of the summit. Behind the dispute lies a long-running Turkish demand to be allowed to buy the US F-16 jets, something Congress has opposed due to Turkey\u2019s hostility to Greece and its purchase of a Russian air defence system \u2013 a move that is seen by some as incompatible with Turkish membership of Nato. Biden has said he now supports the sale of F-16s to Turkey but it is not in his gift to sanction the sale since Congress has a veto. Greece seeks guarantees that the F-16 jets will not be used against Athens as part of an ongoing maritime waters dispute in the Aegean Sea, with daily overflights above islands questioning Greek sovereignty. Six US lawmakers sent a letter to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, asking for a monitoring mechanism to ensure Turkey does not use the new F-16 fighters to violate Greek sovereignty in the Aegean. They noted that if an agreement to sell F-16s and modernisation kits to Turkey was being considered, \u201cwe strongly urge that any final agreement include mechanisms to stop, delay or withdraw the transfer of such weapons if Turkey engages in actions that threaten or undermine US national security interests and the unity of the Nato alliance\u201d. There are some signs that after his re-election in May, Erdo\u011fan is trying to soften some of Turkey\u2019s many international disputes and a key test is whether he can reach a rapprochement with Greece. Erdogan\u2019s decision to release some former commanders of Ukraine\u2019s garrison in Mariupol in apparent breach of an agreement with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is seen as a goodwill gesture to the west."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb5fff", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/10/bt-philip-jansen-stand-ceo-openreach", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What next for BT as Philip Jansen confirms he will exit as CEO?", "lead": "We look at the big challenges still facing the telecoms group \u2013 and who could take over as chief executive", "author": "Mark Sweney", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 15:42:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.955201", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b82da2c1953fbd19fde5461598859081076d657c/0_0_3929_2358/500..jpg", "body": "Philip Jansen\u2019s belief that he was the right man to revive BT\u2019s fortunes led the outgoing chief executive to spend more than \u00a37m on shares in the telecoms giant during his tenure. Yet his successor will inherit a business that has seen more than \u00a310bn wiped off its market value over the past four years. On Monday, the 56-year-old confirmed that he intends to stand down as chief executive, a role he has held since February 2019, with the chair, Adam Crozier, due to give an update on the hunt for a successor later in the summer. Jansen \u2013 who is nursing a paper loss of about \u00a31.7m on his investment in BT shares according to analysts at Numis \u2013 will be remembered as a wartime general who navigated BT through the pandemic and instituted a sweeping \u00a33bn plan to cut costs and staff while also ploughing \u00a315bn into rolling out next-generation 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband across the UK. \u201cClearly he set BT on the right path, he has been positive that\u2019s for sure, but I think the job is far, far from finished,\u201d says John Karidis, a telecoms analyst at Numis. \u201cBut equally, what is left now is the need to execute really well for another four to five years. And in the meantime the cracks are starting to appear.\u201d BT\u2019s board and the headhunting firm Spencer Stuart are tasked with finding Jansen\u2019s successor. So far the only publicly known contender keen to take over when Jansen stands down at some point over the next 12 months is the company veteran Marc Allera, who runs BT\u2019s consumer division. There are those within BT who would welcome the return of the former EE chief executive Olaf Swantee, who left in 2016 after BT\u2019s \u00a312.5bn takeover of the mobile operator. He was most recently linked with the top role at Vodafone. Other names touted include Dominique Leroy, the former boss of BT\u2019s Belgian counterpart Proximus who holds board positions at companies including BT\u2019s second-biggest shareholder Deutsche Telekom and was named as a contender at the time of Jansen\u2019s appointment. Allison Kirkby, the chief executive of the Swedish telco Telia who is a non-executive director at BT, has also been linked, as has Stephen Carter, the former boss of NTL who was appointed to Vodafone\u2019s board last year. However, he has previously indicated a desire to remain at the helm of London-listed exhibitions firm Informa. Jansen has undertaken an impressive amount of the restructuring at BT \u2013 from resolving a dispute over pay and cuts that resulted in a first national strike in 35 years to offloading the costly pay-TV sport business in a \u00a3633m deal with US group Warner Bros Discovery. However, investors have effectively shrugged \u2013 the company\u2019s market capitalisation has fallen by 47% from \u00a322.8bn to \u00a312.14bn during his tenure. \u201cJansen had been looking on increasingly shaky ground at BT,\u201d says Kester Mann, the director of consumer and connectivity at research firm CCS Insight. However, he is not alone in attempting to revamp a major player in the embattled telecoms market. Vodafone recently announced a UK joint venture with mobile operator Three, alongside exits and sell-offs in other markets and the ousting of its group chief executive, in an effort to revitalise an ailing share price. Three years ago the pay-TV and broadband operator Virgin Media struck a \u00a331bn merger deal with O2 UK, Britain\u2019s biggest mobile operator, to create a new \u201cnational champion\u201d to compete with BT. The BT management shake-up and poor share performance have reignited the prospect of a potential takeover by Deutsche Telekom, which became the company\u2019s second-largest shareholder after gaining a 12% stake as part of the deal to take over EE. \u201cWe think BT\u2019s fundamental problems will prevail no matter who owns the company,\u201d says Karidis. \u201cWe think Deutsche Telekom\u2019s team is top tier and therefore not delusional to think it can do better than BT\u2019s top team.\u201d BT\u2019s largest shareholder, the French telecoms billionaire Patrick Drahi who controls an almost 25% stake, has maintained he is not interested in a takeover and supports the strategic direction the company\u2019s management has taken to date. Jansen has made the fibre rollout a central mission. Industry watchers had expected the broadband subsidiary Openreach to benefit from a potential easing in competition from a number of smaller market players building their own networks, labelled \u201calt nets\u201d, such as CityFibre, amid choppy economics conditions. But one industry executive says: \u201cReports of the demise of the alt nets by BT is greatly exaggerated. They are not dying, some are getting stronger and adding more customers than they were and they will grow to continue to threaten Openreach.\u201d A new chief executive is likely to revisit the ultimate future of Openreach, which in recent years has been the subject of speculation of a part or full sale by BT. Under Jansen, the company has maintained that it is inextricably linked to its future operations and cannot be spun off. One industry source describes Jansen as impatient, a good thing in their view as it has enabled significant progress in restructuring BT during his tenure. However, with a \u00a3100m fortune built on the huge success at his previous employer WorldPay under his belt, Jansen has decided his ultimate goal of recreating the glory days of the former monopoly as a \u201cnational champion\u201d is proving to be a much longer game than he anticipated. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame him for where BT is in terms of market value, he definitely believed his own Kool-Aid which he proved with the level of his personal investment in the business,\u201d says one source. \u201cWhoever takes over needs to be mindful that the fact of BT\u2019s life is that infrastructure-based competition is a very difficult place to create value, and you can\u2019t sort out all the structural headwinds.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb6000", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/novak-djokovic-wraps-up-win-over-hubert-hurkacz-to-keep-title-in-sight-wimbledon-tennis", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Novak Djokovic wraps up win over Hubert Hurkacz to keep title in sight", "lead": "Novak Djokovic beat Hubert Hurkacz 7-6 (6), 7-6 (6), 5-7, 6-4 on their return to Centre Court <br>", "author": "Tumaini Carayol at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 15:26:43", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.955218", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/576c99dead0fcc6c34682fe235ab87388914ee48/0_85_4331_2599/500.jpg", "body": "Novak Djokovic continued his march through the Wimbledon draw having returned to Centre Court on Monday afternoon following the postponement of his fourth-round match with Hubert Hurkacz on Sunday while leading by two sets to love. The match was interrupted on Sunday night by Wimbledon\u2019s 11pm curfew and so yesterday Djokovic finished the job, remaining patient through Hurkacz\u2019s spectacular serving before securing a 7-6 (6), 7-6 (6), 5-7, 6-4 win to reach the quarter-finals. With his victory Dkokovic has now reached 14 Wimbledon quarter-finals, equalling Jimmy Connors in second place on the all-time list. \u201cIt was a very, very close match,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIt could have gone a different way. He had his chances, particularly in the first-set tie-breaker. Yeah, in the important moments, particularly in the fourth, I managed to read his serve, make that break that was the key to success.\u201d Only Roger Federer, an 18-time quarter-finalist here, has reached the last eight on more occasions. Djokovic\u2019s 32-match winning run at Wimbledon also places him third in the all-time list behind Bjorn Borg and Federer, breaking his tie with Pete Sampras. Awaiting Djokovic in the quarter-finals is Andrey Rublev who \u2013 after his 7-5, 6-3, 6-7(6), 6-7(5), 6-4 win against Alexander Bublik \u2013 will be well rested having had a day off. Despite smiling as he departed Centre Court on Sunday night, Hurkacz had much to digest. Although the 17th seed served brilliantly throughout the opening set and generated three set points in the tie-break under the immense pressure of facing Djokovic he crumbled. On his third set point, a brilliant serve from Hurkacz offered him an easy, short forehand to close the point; instead, the 26-year-old dumped the forehand into the net. Two unforced errors later, Djokovic took the set. In the second set, the second seed edged a second tight tie-break before the curfew arrived. They returned on the same court with the same used balls, but everything else was different under an open roof. The two set deficit seemed to relax Hurkacz, who played with freedom. Throughout the third set the Pole again served lights out, attacking behind his serve and constantly moving into the forecourt. This time it was Djokovic who struggled, his frustration growing with his error count. Hurkacz finally made his move at 6-5, thundering a forehand down-the-line winner to elicit two set points at 15-40. This time, he did not blink, nailing a winning crosscourt forehand to close off a set in which an astounding 85% of his serves were in while he relinquished just three points on his serve. \u201cI don\u2019t recall being so helpless on the return games, to be honest,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI knew that he\u2019s a big server and he\u2019s a fantastic player on the grass particularly, but I didn\u2019t expect him to serve this well and this accurate. Credit to him.\u201d Despite the setback, Djokovic remained focused and kept his head. His patience was rewarded in the fourth set as great returning brought him an opportunity at 3-3. On his third break point, Djokovic landed a backhand return deep off a 131mph bomb, gradually forcing himself on to the front foot as he finally took his first break of the match. The champion never looked back."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb6001", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/10/rsv-vaccine-respiratory-syncytial-virus-older-adults-approved-uk-medicines-regulator", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "RSV vaccine for older adults approved by UK medicines regulator ", "lead": "Arexvy could help NHS deal with virus that causes about 8,000 deaths among older people in UK each year", "author": "Linda Geddes Science correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 15:22:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.955237", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/309c92af61a1ddcff98a5c7ab4afed91f4fc2123/0_13_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "The UK\u2019s medicines regulator has approved the first vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in older adults. The virus typically causes cold-like symptoms, but is a leading cause of pneumonia in infants and elderly people, with infections in older adults accounting for about 8,000 deaths, 14,000 hospitalisations and 175,000 GP appointments in the UK each year \u2013 more than influenza during a typical winter season. People with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes and chronic heart or lung disease, are at greatest risk of severe illness. There are no specific treatments for RSV but those with severe infections may be supported with supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, or mechanical ventilation until they get better. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has authorised the vaccine, Arexvy, for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in adults 60 years and older \u2013 the first time an RSV vaccine for older adults has been authorised for use in the UK. A study of 24,966 older adults published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February suggested vaccine efficacy against LRTD was 82.6%, while efficacy against serious disease was 94.1%. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with mild to moderate injection site pain, fatigue, muscle and joint aches or pain and headache the most commonly reported side events. The rate of serious adverse effects was similar between those receiving the vaccine or a placebo jab. The vaccine, produced by GlaxoSmithKline, has already been approved for use in the US and Europe. Further adult RSV vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are expected to be considered in the coming months. On 22 June, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK governments on matters of immunisation, issued a short statement to the Department of Health and Social Care advising that a cost-effective RSV immunisation programme should be developed for infants and older adults. The JCVI cited modelling by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and other academic groups suggesting that a vaccination programme for older adults could be cost-effective. It currently favours a \u201cone-off vaccination campaign targeting several age cohorts and then a routine programme for those turning 75 years old\u201d, the statement said. A final statement to inform a policy decision about potential RSV immunisation programmes is expected later this summer. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, the chair of the JCVI said: \u201cThere is a substantial burden of RSV infection in older adults, which contributes to the seasonal winter pressures for the NHS. \u201cClinical trials of several products have shown that vaccination can boost immunity and reduce the risk of infection and hospitalisation with the potential to improve population health.\u201d The JCVI is closely monitoring the development of products to protect newborns and infants against RSV, which is the leading cause of hospitalisation in infants worldwide. Maternal vaccines, which are designed to be given during pregnancy, are now in late-stage clinical trials, while an antibody-based drug called nirsevimab was licensed by the MHRA in November 2022. It is designed to protect babies during their first RSV season, when they are most vulnerable."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb6002", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/10/how-do-you-find-the-perfect-beach-books-travel-holiday", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How do you find the perfect beach read?

Instead of three days, I went for three weeks; instead of an urban sprawl that might at least have smelled like south London, I went to Noirmoutier, an island so tranquil, so isolated, that you could only entertain an escape fantasy for the 20 minutes a day when the tide was out. I stayed with a minuscule family, all quite self-contained. Some nights, the chattiest thing in the house was whatever crustacea they still had alive in the fridge. Some days, the only words I could understand were the names of meals, which I could have guessed from the time. The loneliness was brutal and the hours immense. Conservatively, I could have read 21 books and just about survived it, but all I had with me was one, which I had picked up from the throw-away pile at the library where I had a Saturday job. Libraries throw away books for one of two reasons: they have been borrowed so often that they are disintegrating; or they have never been borrowed at all. Misalliance, by George Bernard Shaw, was in pretty good condition. The play is as short and about as funny as a cracker joke. I read it so many times that I knew it by heart, but I still couldn\u2019t really tell you what it was about. Between the rudimentary politics, the life\u2011force spiritualism and the self-referential gags about acting, it read like an in-joke he had written in a hurry, having lost a bet. I overcorrected after that. It didn\u2019t matter what I took away to read, so long as it was incredibly long. My subconscious intervened to sabotage the self-improvement, or maybe just lighten the hand luggage. I left Infinite Jest in a duty-free shop on a ferry and dropped Underworld in soup. I ended up, again and again, with nothing to read but hotel rules and the ingredients on sweetener sachets. I started going away with works in many volumes, like a spread bet \u2013 surely I could lose only one? I went on a resort holiday with Henry Roth\u2019s four-part epic Mercy of a Rude Stream, set in Jewish-Irish Harlem at the start of the 20th century. It sounded so promising. Roth had had 45 years of writer\u2019s block, which he had finally overcome in old age through his obsession with cultural depravity. Surely stuff would happen? The guy I was with hadn\u2019t brought anything to read at all, nor any money or sunscreen. It was 1998 and everyone else round the pool was reading Irvine Welsh \u2013 most of them Filth, some going back to Trainspotting. Every two minutes, someone exploded with laughter. People would gather in the bar at night to do impressions of Begbie. It was incredibly bonding \u2013 unless you were packing four gigantic library books with sepia covers, in which case you were a pariah. Every five minutes, my boyfriend said: \u201cYou know what\u2019s good to read on holiday? Something with a neon cover. Something other people are reading. Why haven\u2019t we got any of those good books that people laugh at?\u201d I should have put him in charge of stealing someone else\u2019s Filth. \u201cIf you can just get through the awkward family argument that marks the dramatic highpoint of 1914,\u201d I argued, \u201cby 1915 there is incest.\u201d The Roth was actually quite culturally depraved, but that didn\u2019t speed things up. I want to say I now have a perfect formula for what to take away on holiday, honed over years of mistakes. Unfortunately, that is not true at all; I am still frozen with indecision. But do you want to know what is good? The internet; the sum of human knowledge in your pocket; Kindles. People who lament the end of boredom have forgotten, I think, what boredom actually is. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb6003", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/asia-nato-china-military-expansion-beijing-how-to-engage", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why Asia matters to Nato as it looks to respond to China\u2019s military expansion", "lead": "Beijing is source of \u2018systemic challenges\u2019 but alliance members are divided on how to engage", "author": "Amy Hawkins Senior China correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-10 15:17:50", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:09:18.955273", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/88f6cce80619b0dcc6de1f878105b584423ca1e3/0_249_4006_2404/500.jpg", "body": "Nato leaders and their allies are heading to Vilnius, Lithuania, this week, for two days of meetings starting on Tuesday. Among them is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea\u2019s president, who will give one of the opening speeches. The summit will be dominated by discussions about the alliance\u2019s relationship with Ukraine. But Yoon\u2019s attendance reflects a growing interest among members in stepping up their dialogue with countries in the Asia-Pacific. In an op-ed published on Monday, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, said: \u201cChina, in particular, is watching to see the price Russia pays, or the reward it receives, for its aggression\u201d in Ukraine. Leaders in South Korea and Japan were clearly concerned that what was \u201chappening in Europe today could happen in Asia tomorrow\u201d, he added. Stoltenberg did not mention Taiwan by name. However, it is the possibility of a conflict between China and the island, which Beijing considers to be part of its territory, that is animating Nato\u2019s engagement with the region. Last year, at a summit held months after the Ukraine invasion, Nato said that as well as Russia, China posed a systemic threat to the interests of member states. A strategy published at the summit in Madrid, which also included heads of state from Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand for the first time, said China was the source of \u201csystemic challenges\u201d including threats to supply chains, infrastructure and \u201cmilitary tools to increase its global footprint and project power\u201d. The Chinese foreign ministry said the statement sought to \u201cstoke confrontation and antagonism\u201d and accused Nato of \u201chyping up the so-called \u2018China threat\u2019\u201d. But from Nato\u2019s perspective the threat posed by Beijing is not just a hypothetical. \u201cChina is dramatically expanding its military capabilities in a largely non-transparent way, including in nuclear capability,\u201d said James Mackey, the alliance\u2019s director of security policy and partnerships. \u201cWe see China trying to influence global norms and standards, including through the UN system.\u201d At the summit in Vilnius, leaders from the Asia-Pacific region will be trying to make the case to Nato members that, as Stoltenberg said in June: \u201cWhat happens in Asia matters for Europe and what happens in Europe matters for Asia.\u201d But although many have drawn parallels, either explicitly or implicitly between Ukraine and Taiwan, the alliance is also trying to balance a robust response to Beijing\u2019s actions against accusations of territorial overreach. \u201cWe need to be clear that Ukraine is not Taiwan,\u201d said Mackey. \u201cUkraine is a sovereign state of the UN, and Nato is helping Ukraine to exercise its right to self-defence.\u201d \u201cFrom a Nato perspective, Nato is not involved in Taiwan, it\u2019s not an area that\u2019s in our area of responsibility.\u201d The alliance\u2019s position on Taiwan is that it opposes any unilateral change to the status quo in the East China Sea, which would have \u201cglobal security ramifications\u201d, according to Mackey. But analysts note that China\u2019s footprint inside Nato members\u2019 territory is becoming harder to ignore. The alliance\u2019s increased engagement with partners in the Asia-Pacific is \u201cnot just about Nato looking east\u201d, said Meia Nouwens, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a thinktank. \u201cChina has been operating west as well, militarily,\u201d she said, noting that the Chinese navy has conducted live fire drills in the Mediterranean. Some analysts also argue that any Chinese attack on Guam, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean, could represent an assault on Nato. But questions about territorial mandate and concern about antagonising China, which has accused Nato of \u201ceastward expansion\u201d, mean that dialogue with countries in the Asia-Pacific region will remain charged. Nato members are divided on how to engage with China. In May, Hungary\u2019s foreign minister said cooperation with China presented \u201copportunities rather than risks\u201d. At this week\u2019s summit, members were expected to defer a decision on whether or not Nato should open a liaison office in Tokyo after France made clear it opposes the plans. Expanding the alliance\u2019s footprint in the Indo-Pacific would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d, said a French foreign ministry spokesperson, according to Reuters. Beijing, which called the plans an attempt to \u201cdestroy regional peace and stability\u201d, would probably agree."}, {"_id": "64ad709e51ac33719bfb6004", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/10/behind-the-scenes-on-the-great-elle-fanning-nicholas-hoult", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russian romps and roller discos!

Wandering around a former distillery in east London, it\u2019s hard to tell. \u201cWe had horses in here the other day!\u201d a set worker shouts as we walk through a wood-panelled grand hall. In the next room, study the intricate 18th-century wall murals closely and \u2013 oh! \u2013 titillating depictions from the Kama Sutra are hiding in plain sight. Gold candlesticks and fake flames are everywhere. Women strut past in huge corset dresses, while bored extras dressed as serfs wait in the shadows and scroll on their phones. I\u2019m led to another ornately decorated bedroom, with a huge map of imperial Russia pinned on the wall, and take a seat at the end of a familiar four-poster. It is the bed in which I have seen Catherine the Great romp with her lovers many a time. This is the extraordinary set of Tony McNamara\u2019s racy and radical period comedy-drama, The Great \u2013 a very fictional take on Peter III and Catherine\u2019s rulership of Russia, starring Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult. Now in its third season, filming is well under way when I visit on a sticky summer day, but that doesn\u2019t stop this close-knit cast and crew from having afterwork fun \u2013 tonight it is an 80s-themed roller disco that Hoult has organised. Considering a single scene has just had at least 27 retakes, the energy this giddy group have is admirable. \u201cI know!\u201d says Fanning, 25, still in costume (a surprisingly casual tennis outfit). \u201cWe have a read-through later and then we go. That\u2019s how we roll!\u201d This blindingly sunny disposition doesn\u2019t fade for a single moment during her lunch break. Such good fun with her colleagues is the norm, she says, when they film in London up to six months at a time. McNamara is a \u201chuge foodie\u201d and he introduced Fanning to two of her new favourite restaurants: Brawn and Westerns Laundry. \u201cI love London, I could definitely live here,\u201d she says. When I speak with Hoult, 33, over the phone while he is filming in Los Angeles a few weeks later, he admits that \u201cmixing alcohol and wheels on your feet with people who mostly can\u2019t skate\u201d wasn\u2019t the smartest idea: \u201cThere were, err, not many broken bones \u2026 but it\u2019s nice to get out when everyone is working that hard.\u201d He and Fanning clearly see it as their responsibility to keep spirits high. \u201cIt\u2019s joyous, really,\u201d says Gwilym Lee, who plays Peter\u2019s longsuffering best friend Grigor. \u201cThey set the precedent at the top. They have zero ego and approach everything with a sense of play and fun, and that trickles down.\u201d \u201cNick is so bonkers!\u201d adds Adam Godley (Archie the archbishop with a \u201craging libido\u201d). \u201cThe riffs that Tony gives him, he does so well. It\u2019s all so outrageous!\u201d This cheery atmosphere translates on screen. The Great is a show in which the entire cast are very obviously having a hoot. That said, things were deadly serious when we last saw Catherine and Peter. Catherine had been keeping her husband as a prisoner in the palace as she prepared to give birth to their child. Her feelings were complicated: she started to fall in love with Peter as he proved to be a doting father to baby Paul, yet she needed him dead in order to seize control of the rule of Russia. The final straw was learning that he had had sex with and killed her mother Joanna (gloriously played by Gillian Anderson), and so Catherine stabbed Peter to death. She was instantly remorseful and wailing until \u2026 he stepped out of the shadows after watching his wife kill his double, Pugachev. The final shot of them nervously staring at each other was inspired by The Graduate: what the hell happens now? Season three picks up 24 hours later, with Catherine and Peter in couples therapy after having makeup sex over the breakfast table. The court is in disarray, with Catherine\u2019s prisoners hoping she\u2019ll end the brutal \u201cbullet or the bear\u201d death penalty they\u2019re awaiting. Locking herself in a closet while she makes a decision on her next steps, Catherine is scared that she is starting to see herself in Peter. \u201cThose tyrant ways? She has those as well,\u201d says Fanning. \u201cIt\u2019s an internal battle for her this season: what she thinks she is and who she wants to be. Can she face who she really is?\u201d Peter, meanwhile, continues to be his same old barbaric buffoon self \u2013 although the series attempts to explain why he and his friends are such awful people. \u201cThere are some amazing scenes that show why they have the bond that they do,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThey were terrorised [by their parents]. So now they look out for each other \u2013 they\u2019re like damaged animals taking care of each other.\u201d In keeping with the chaos of the show, the cast only find out what\u2019s next for their characters a few scripts at a time. With McNamara writing as they film, everybody knows that anything goes \u2013 and they have total faith in his unpredictable vision (he did co-write Oscar-winning film The Favourite, after all). \u201cIn the first season, I found out I had a son,\u201d says Belinda Bromilow, who plays Peter\u2019s progressive but strategic aunt Elizabeth. \u201cThen I found out he drowned. Then I found out my sister actually killed him. Then I found out that I\u2019d been sleeping with my brother-in-law and it was his child \u2026 At the start, I didn\u2019t even know I had a kid!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve crossed so many lines that everything is now completely open,\u201d says Godley. \u201cTony\u2019s heart is always in the right place, so we completely trust him.\u201d The show\u2019s nine Emmy nominations and one win (outstanding period costume) prove there is a method to McNamara\u2019s madness. Fanning and Hoult bagged best actor and best actress nominations in 2022, with Hoult receiving the news while he was driving: \u201cI called my partner [the model Bryana Holly] asking why I had so many messages saying \u2018Congrats!\u2019. I\u2019d forgotten the nominations had come out. I called Elle right away \u2013 we both screamed down the phone.\u201d \u201cWe have become some of the best friends,\u201d adds Fanning. \u201cNick and I love to challenge each other \u2013 those scenes with him are my favourite to do. We love each other so much and we like that battle.\u201d Towards the end of the first season, which aired on Channel 4 during the 2020 winter lockdown, a cruelly timed smallpox episode reflected the pandemic. This time, another real-life global terror runs parallel to the story: Putin\u2019s invasion of and ongoing war with Ukraine. Was playing another power-hungry, violent Russian leader ever too close to the bone for Hoult? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to muddy the waters too much by mixing it up with history,\u201d says Hoult. \u201cBut at the same time there are so many moments when you can\u2019t help but feel that history forewarns. History does repeat itself.\u201d Most of us know how Catherine and Peter\u2019s story ended, but there\u2019s no hint about when this retelling of their story will. Originally pitched as a film adaptation of McNamara\u2019s 2008 play of the same name, it is perhaps already stretching its limits with a likely fourth season. While Hoult and Fanning adore the show, there are even bigger projects on the horizon. Already a child actor turned Hollywood movie star, Hoult recently starred opposite Anya Taylor-Joy in The Menu and Nicolas Cage in Renfield. Since this interview, he has also been asked to audition to be the next Superman. Fanning \u2013 also a child actor and younger sister of Dakota \u2013 starred in and executive produced last year\u2019s Hulu series, The Girl from Plainville. But this has been her biggest and longest production so far. \u201cI did the pilot when I was 20,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was four years ago \u2013 I feel emotional because this has been my 20s. I don\u2019t even want to think about what happens when it\u2019s over.\u201d And with that she skips off to wrap things up so she can go and get her roller skates on. The Great series three is on Lionsgate+ from 14 July"}]
