But as one of the architects of spectralism in the 1970s, Grisey\u2019s achievement and influence extended far beyond that achingly beautiful final masterpiece. Beyond his native France though, only a handful of his works are at all familiar: besides the Quatre Chants there are the pieces that make up the six-part cycle Les Espaces Acoustiques, and the late Vortex Temporum, which takes a motif from Ravel\u2019s Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 as its starting point. But the rest of his substantial output remains little explored."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This collection, featuring works from the beginning, middle and end of Grisey\u2019s creative life, offers a good perspective. The earliest piece here, M\u00e9galithes, for 15 brass instruments, was composed while he was a member of Olivier Messiaen\u2019s composition class at the Paris Conservatoire in 1968-69. Made up of nine musical sequences which can be performed in any one of nine orders, its fierce rhetoric seems influenced by Xenakis more than any other composer, and, dedicated to the memory of the Biafran victims of the Nigerian civil war, it has a political dimension too, for the only time in Grisey\u2019s career."}, {"type": "text", "text": "If M\u00e9galithes is stylistically very different from his later works, then the large-scale orchestral D\u00e9rives from 1974 was the piece that Grisey identified as his first using spectral techniques \u2013 though spectralism was a term he later rejected altogether. The music grows directly out of the note A to which the orchestra tunes and from the microtonal variations around that pitch. The slowly shifting textures acquire an almost Ravelian lushness, punctuated by sudden, intense fortissimos, with a final radiant climax. It already has the sensual quality that grows more intense in Grisey\u2019s later music, and which dominates the third piece here, L\u2019Ic\u00f4ne Paradoxal from 1994, a setting for soprano, mezzo and orchestra of texts by Piero della Francesca (from his treatise on perspective). The material for the voices gets steadily faster and more intensely entwined, while the orchestra writing beneath them gradually slows and becomes more harmonically orientated.
