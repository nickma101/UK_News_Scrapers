court costs totalling \u00a3485.Sentencing White, district judge Mark Jabbitt said it was \"hard to imagine a more... offensive reference to the Hillsborough disaster.\"White, whose lawyer had earlier

Mr Seymour told the court that Mr Morgan was \"boastful\" and would \"behave foolishly\" at times.The former political journalist also gave details about a story written about Princess Diana, which included a photo of her crying after a visit to her \"saviour\" friend and therapist as she dealt with her divorce from Prince Charles, now the King.Mr Seymour spoke about the article in court, and said in his witness statement: \"The article clearly suggests to readers, and the public, that Princess Diana was upset because of the problems she faced in her life, and having unburdened herself to her therapist.\"However, Mr Seymour said that a few days after the story was published, he remembers seeing Mr Morgan and others watching a video which had been taken by a paparazzi photographer present at the time, which showed why Diana was really upset - after being \"hounded up and down the street by a baying, cat-calling mob of photographers\" from a number of different press organisations.Mr Seymour said in his statement that \"the truth never emerged\" about how the story was obtained and he was \"upset and ashamed that we had printed something so cruel, intrusive and false\". He said Mr Morgan understood the significance of the video, writing in his statement that the then editor said: \"If this gets out, we're finished.\"'Craig Charles thought I was a Coronation Street mole' \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nMichael Turner, who plays Kevin Webster in Coronation Street and is known professionally as Michael Le Vell, is the fourth claimant to give evidence\n        \n\n\n\nThe bulk of the evidence on Monday came from Coronation Street actor Michael Turner, who plays Kevin Webster in the soap and is known professionally as Michael Le Vell.Asked by MGN's lawyer Mr Munden why he is convinced he was the victim of unlawful information gathering, the actor responded: \"There just seems to be a few coincidences, let's say.\"He continued: \"To be honest, I never really thought about it until someone got in touch with me to point things out.\"The actor's claim concerns 28 articles published between 1991 and 2011, covering a range of stories - including a burglary at his home and the births of his children, as well as his arrest for suspected sexual offences, which he was later cleared of, in 2011.During cross-examination by MGN's lawyer, Mr Turner conceded that some details included in stories he has complained about were available publicly.He told how his Corrie co-stars thought he was a \"mole\" - and said in his witness statement that he said at the time he found this \"more offensive than being called a sex offender\".In court, he said: \"Being a mole or leaking was one of the worst things you could do in our business.\"He went on to say he was \"mortified\" that his former co-star Craig Charles, best known for starring in Red Dwarf, thought he had been leaking information.Asked to clarify whether he genuinely thought this was worse than being accused of sexual offences, he replies: \"It's not, obviously.\" Mr Turner told the court he said this to emphasise the severity of the accusation and how awful he felt about it.Mr Turner was later accused himself of a sexual offence, in 2011, but was cleared.The actor is among more than 100 individuals suing MGN - publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People - for compensation over claims its journalists were linked to phone hacking, so-called \"blagging\" or gaining information by deception and the use of private investigators for unlawful activities.The actor's case is one of four representative claims being heard at the High Court in London, alongside similar claims brought by the Duke of Sussex, Hollyoaks and former Coronation Street actress Nikki Sanderson, and Fiona Wightman - the ex-wife of comedian Paul Whitehouse.MGN denies Mr Turner's claim, arguing there is \"no evidence\" of voicemail interception or unlawful information gathering relating to him.Mr Munden has told the court that Mr Turner's case is \"particularly weak\", with articles in the claim published before phone hacking started, or when it had \"significantly dropped off\".Mr Turner's evidence is due to resume on Tuesday and the case is expected to conclude by the end of the month, with a ruling expected at a later date.\n"}, {"_id": "64909add51ac331525bf5480", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/soldier-helped-by-police-after-fainting-at-kings-first-order-of-the-garter-service-as-monarch-12905545", "primaryCategory": "home", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Soldier faints at King's first Order of the Garter service as monarch", "lead": "Police rushed to help a member of the Household Cavalry who fainted while in position for the King's first service for the Order of the Garter as monarch.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:15:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:13:49.545196", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-order-of-the-garter_6192718.jpg?20230619173715", "body": "\nPolice rushed to help a member of the Household Cavalry who fainted while in position for the King's first service for the Order of the Garter as monarch.Braving the heat for the second time since the weekend, members of the Household Cavalry and Yeoman Warders lined the streets of Windsor as the King led the procession to St George's Chapel.\n\n\n\nThe Order of the Garter, is the most senior order of chivalry in Britain, and on Monday the King welcomed the installation of two new members.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nA member of the Household Cavalry faints during Order of the Garter\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nA member of the Household Cavalry helped by police after fainting\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith temperatures reaching 24C, according to the Met Office, one young soldier had to be helped back on his feet by police officers after passing out before the ceremony began.Read more: King joined by royals for his first Trooping the Colour as monarchAt least three troops faint in military parade inspected by Prince William\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after another soldier fainted during the Trooping the Colour ceremony at Horse Guards Parade on Saturday, and a further three who fainted during the Colonel's Review -

Mr Seymour told the court that Mr Morgan was \"boastful\" and would \"behave foolishly\" at times.The former political journalist also gave details about a story written about Princess Diana, which included a photo of her crying after a visit to her \"saviour\" friend and therapist as she dealt with her divorce from Prince Charles, now the King.Mr Seymour spoke about the article in court, and said in his witness statement: \"The article clearly suggests to readers, and the public, that Princess Diana was upset because of the problems she faced in her life, and having unburdened herself to her therapist.\"However, Mr Seymour said that a few days after the story was published, he remembers seeing Mr Morgan and others watching a video which had been taken by a paparazzi photographer present at the time, which showed why Diana was really upset - after being \"hounded up and down the street by a baying, cat-calling mob of photographers\" from a number of different press organisations.Mr Seymour said in his statement that \"the truth never emerged\" about how the story was obtained and he was \"upset and ashamed that we had printed something so cruel, intrusive and false\". He said Mr Morgan understood the significance of the video, writing in his statement that the then editor said: \"If this gets out, we're finished.\"'Craig Charles thought I was a Coronation Street mole' \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nMichael Turner, who plays Kevin Webster in Coronation Street and is known professionally as Michael Le Vell, is the fourth claimant to give evidence\n        \n\n\n\nThe bulk of the evidence on Monday came from Coronation Street actor Michael Turner, who plays Kevin Webster in the soap and is known professionally as Michael Le Vell.Asked by MGN's lawyer Mr Munden why he is convinced he was the victim of unlawful information gathering, the actor responded: \"There just seems to be a few coincidences, let's say.\"He continued: \"To be honest, I never really thought about it until someone got in touch with me to point things out.\"The actor's claim concerns 28 articles published between 1991 and 2011, covering a range of stories - including a burglary at his home and the births of his children, as well as his arrest for suspected sexual offences, which he was later cleared of, in 2011.During cross-examination by MGN's lawyer, Mr Turner conceded that some details included in stories he has complained about were available publicly.He told how his Corrie co-stars thought he was a \"mole\" - and said in his witness statement that he said at the time he found this \"more offensive than being called a sex offender\".In court, he said: \"Being a mole or leaking was one of the worst things you could do in our business.\"He went on to say he was \"mortified\" that his former co-star Craig Charles, best known for starring in Red Dwarf, thought he had been leaking information.Asked to clarify whether he genuinely thought this was worse than being accused of sexual offences, he replies: \"It's not, obviously.\" Mr Turner told the court he said this to emphasise the severity of the accusation and how awful he felt about it.Mr Turner was later accused himself of a sexual offence, in 2011, but was cleared.The actor is among more than 100 individuals suing MGN - publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People - for compensation over claims its journalists were linked to phone hacking, so-called \"blagging\" or gaining information by deception and the use of private investigators for unlawful activities.The actor's case is one of four representative claims being heard at the High Court in London, alongside similar claims brought by the Duke of Sussex, Hollyoaks and former Coronation Street actress Nikki Sanderson, and Fiona Wightman - the ex-wife of comedian Paul Whitehouse.MGN denies Mr Turner's claim, arguing there is \"no evidence\" of voicemail interception or unlawful information gathering relating to him.Mr Munden has told the court that Mr Turner's case is \"particularly weak\", with articles in the claim published before phone hacking started, or when it had \"significantly dropped off\".Mr Turner's evidence is due to resume on Tuesday and the case is expected to conclude by the end of the month, with a ruling expected at a later date.\n"}, {"_id": "64909adf51ac331525bf548a", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/climate-change-record-breaking-temperatures-observed-in-seas-around-uk-and-ireland-12905504", "primaryCategory": "uk", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Record-breaking temperatures observed in seas around UK and Ireland", "lead": "Record-breaking temperatures have been observed in the seas around the UK and Ireland, according to the Met Office.", "author": "\nSamuel Osborne\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:10:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:13:51.764279", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-channel-islands-underwater_6192313.jpg?20230619130420", "body": "\nRecord-breaking temperatures have been observed in the seas around the UK and Ireland, according to the Met Office.Sea surface temperatures off the northeast coast of England and to the west of Ireland were 3 to 4C above normal, Met Office analysis has found.\n\n\n\n\"The North Atlantic is experiencing record-breaking temperatures at present,\" Professor Stephen Belcher, the Met Office chief scientist, said.\"May 2023 has seen the highest temperatures of any May since 1850.

popular brewers have reduced alcohol content and kept prices the same.Under the new tax system, producers will save between 2p and 3p per bottle or can.Brands which have allegedly already reduced alcohol content include Spitfire, Old Speckled Hen, Foster's and Bishops Finger.\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar move has not been ruled out by big brewers Heineken, Amstel, John Smith's and Newcastle Brown

To do it is a bold plan to borrow \u00a3100bn+ over the course of the next parliament to transition the country away from fossil fuels to green energy.\n\n\n\nBy far Labour's single biggest spending commitment, the party had pledged to borrow \u00a328bn-a-year to fund the flagship green transition programme, but has since scaled back borrowing plans amid growing concerns about taking on debt as the cost of borrowing rises on the back of higher interest rates.Instead, Labour will gradually ramp up borrowing to that level in the \"second half of the parliament\" if it wins the next general election.But the plan is still huge - undoubtedly the single most radical policy of Sir Keir's Labour government should he win the next election. Labour's green subsidies amount to more in relative terms than US President Joe Biden's own green economy plan - the inflation reduction act - which has earmarked $37bn in subsidies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money will be used to launch a state-run company GB Energy to invest in renewables, with \u00a32.5bn in direct subsidies to green energy providers who contract to manufacture in the UK - the 'British jobs bonus' as Sir Keir puts it. He says it will create nearly 500,000 new direct and indirect jobs. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n7:00\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer outlines energy plans \n\n\n\nSunak refuses to say if he will attend Boris Johnson debate - politics latest \n\nMore on Conservatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Shaun Bailey apologises 'unreservedly' for staff-partying video - and says it is 'for others to decide' about his peerage\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Boris Johnson in 'clear breach' of rules after Daily Mail job announced, says MP watchdog\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Rishi Sunak facing potentially acrimonious vote on Boris Johnson partygate report\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nConservativesLabourSir Keir Starmer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe driving purpose of the plan is to drive down energy bills - with Labour claiming that it will take \u00a31,400 off average bills if it can hit the 2030 target.It is also about transforming the economy in order to better fund public services. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSir Keir is clear that this is the sort of \"activist industrial policy\" Britain needs for the longer term, but for voters looking to Labour to commit money to schools, hospitals and transport in the next election, this could prove a hard sell with the amount Labour is willing to borrow to subsidise green technologies dwarfing other commitments for public services.\"We are going to put money into public services,\" explains one senior Labour figure. \"But we have to grow the economy as the first step. Being clear about stable finances and sticking to it is the best way to turnaround the country.\" \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n3:41\n\n\n\n\n\n'We are doubling down not backing off'\n\n\n\nBut while the level of borrowing has raised eyebrows, and afforded the Conservatives a \"borrowing bombshell\" attack line, the plans to block new oil and gas developments in the North Sea as part of the renewables revolution has provoked widespread criticism from industry and union figures fearful of widespread job losses.Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, on Monday said Labour's plans put \"tens of thousands of Scottish jobs a risk\".The criticisms have prompted another policy tweak as Sir Keir promised not to revoke any fossil fuel extraction licenses granted before the next general election, even though it could take years before those new fields begin producing.This allows the Labour leader to insist existing jobs in oil and gas are not at risk, but there's no doubt that as production is gradually wound down, this will be a momentous shift for a sector that supports nearly 200,000 jobs in the UK.There is also the question of whether the Labour leader can actually deliver what he is pledging in this five years. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at Oxford University, who has advised the government on energy policy over many years, said last week the goal was unlikely to succeed on the current trajectory.When I pressed Sir Keir in an interview in Leith on Monday if the \"clean power by 2030\" pledge was a guarantee or a target he demurred, he said it was his \"ambition\" and he believed to be \"doable\". Not an explicit guarantee then, and for good reason.There is also a question about credibility and commitment after the Labour party U-turned on its promise to borrow \u00a328bn-a-year from the beginning of the parliament in order to scale up renewable industry.'Doubling down'The leadership has insisted it is still totally committed to the plan, but has had to scale back commitments in the near-to-medium term as the high cost of borrowing hits against Labour's fiscal rules (no borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and net debt must be falling as a percentage of GDP at end of the rolling five-year period).When I asked Sir Keir on Monday if the U-turn on the financial commitment in the first half of the parliament showed - as with Brexit, tuition fees, and re-nationalisations - that he can't be trusted to keep his promises, he said it showed the opposite, that he was \"doubling down\" on the plan. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:37\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer hits out at 'Tory crap'\n\n\n\n\"It is a matter of trust,\" he told me.\"Rachel [Reeves] - we set out fiscal rules two or more years ago. Inflation is in a completely different place to where it was\u2026 but at the same time as we work through our plans and set out what we want to do in years one, two and three, it is clear we can ramp up to that \u00a328bn and when I say to people in the sector, I want clean power by 2030, they don't say you're backing down, they say that's a real challenge.\"On the timing of this announcement, there is of course a risk that Sir Keir's missions get drowned out by the dramas back in Westminster. There was some discussion about whether to pull the announcement, but in the end Sir Keir decided that he wanted to get on talking about how he might lead Britain than, to quote one ally, get \"bogged down in the psychodrama\" of what's going on in Westminster.\"Doesn't it speak volumes that the Labour Party is today launching a plan for the next generation of jobs, whilst the Tories are squabbling back in Westminster, and the SNP are preaching about promises they've broken?\" observed the Labour leader when I asked him about the current state of his rivals. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more:David Cameron heckled as he leaves COVID inquiryStarmer says Johnson should be banned from parliament after partygate reportSir Keir wants to use these \"mission statements\" to position himself as a leader-in-waiting as the current prime minister Rishi Sunak finds his agenda hijacked by the failings of his predecessor and party infighting once more.But the agenda on Monday is very much about parking Labour's tanks on the SNP's lawns too, given that there is no route to Number 10 for Sir Keir that doesn't go through Scotland. Locating GB Energy in Scotland is designed to firmly park his tanks on the SNP's lawn.A poll out over the weekend suggested Labour was on course to take 26 seats in the next general election - an incredible change in fortunes from the single seat it picked up in 2019 - as the departure of Nicola Sturgeon and her subsequent arrest (she was released without charge) over the police probe into SNP finance leaves the party battered and bruised.\"Nicola Sturgeon not being first minister obviously provides a space and an opportunity that simply wasn't there before,\" acknowledges one senior figure.\"But there's no rule that anybody disillusioned with either the Tories or the SNP necessarily swaps columns to us.

a new, publicly owned company that will generate renewable sources.Sir Keir has already pledged to set it up within a year if his party wins the next general election, and today revealed its headquarters will be based north of the border, calling it a \"down payment for a new Scotland\".British Industry Bonus 'to create jobs in UK'The Labour leader also announced a new \"British Industry Bonus\" - a \u00a3500m a year fund for energy companies that agree to manufacture in Britain's industrial heartlands and coastal communities.The move emulates the thinking behind Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act - a landmark package of subsidies for any companies planning to make green products or invest in green energy in the US.While the Conservatives have expressed scepticism over the measure, Sir Keir claimed the act is \"setting the pace\", adding: \"In seven months they've (the US) created more jobs than we have in seven years, but they're not the only ones and in truth, we've never been on this pitch.\"Speaking later to Sky's political editor Beth Rigby, he said the bonus is intended to \"make sure that the jobs are here in the UK\", claiming that \"whenever I go to a windfarm or any other infrastructure project and ask where were these were made, the answer is always somewhere else\". \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSky's political editor Beth Rigby interviews the Labour leader about his clean energy plan\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour 'doesn't understand climate crisis'Another central pillar of Labour's green plan is to axe the ban on new onshore wind within months of entering government.The details were set out just weeks after shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves faced criticism for watering down the \u00a328bn a year spending commitment to fund the changes, blaming rising interest rates and the \"damage\" the Conservatives have done to the economy.Environment charity Friends of the Earth praised Labour for being \"strong on climate rhetoric\" but said clarity is needed on the pace of the fossil fuel phase out and green investment.The Green Party also questioned the scale of Labour's net zero ambition, after it said it will not roll back any licenses granted by the Conservatives before the next election, including the proposed Rosebank oil and gas field.The Scottish Greens said this shows they \"do not understand the climate crisis\".The party's climate spokesperson, MSP Mark Ruskell, said: \"Unless Labour is willing to state categorically that it will scrap Rosebank then they will have lost all credibility on our climate.\"He said if the Tories lose the next election, \"only Labour are capable of stopping this environmental disaster from going ahead -

One an aspiring nurse, Rose, the other her older brother, Vernon. Apprehensive but tenacious, Rose follows her sibling to England and plans to start work as a nurse in the newly formed NHS.Vernon has been in Britain for several years but, unknown to his sister, has struggled to find and stay in work.

And the figures are reflected on screen - a 2021 diversity study by gaming website Diamond Lobby, of more than 100 of the best-selling titles from the previous five years, found 54% of main characters are white, while just 8% are non-white women.But the celebratory focus of Windrush Tales shifted when, with pre-production barely under way, news broke of a scandal that shook the team's faith to its core. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:40\n\n\n\n\n\n'People traumatised' by Windrush scandal\n\n\n\nThe Windrush scandalBack in 2018, with the 70th anniversary of the Windrush's arrival on the horizon, it emerged that many of those who made the same journey over subsequent decades had been wrongly detained, deported, and denied legal rights by a \"hostile environment policy\" that cracked down on those deemed to have arrived in the UK illegally.Some of those deported later died.Among those worst affected by the government's policy, introduced by the then home secretary Theresa May in 2012, were members of the Windrush generation - who arrived in the UK legally, and with the government's encouragement, between 1948 and 1973. Many, like Rose, took jobs in the NHS - and other sectors impacted by Britain's post-war labour shortage.While indefinite leave to remain was automatically granted upon their arrival in the UK, many weren't issued with any documents confirming their status and were later unable to prove their right to stay when immigration officers came knocking. Jobs and properties were lost, health care and benefits were denied, and in the worst cases, people were deported to countries they barely knew.Read more:Home Office knew policy would hit Windrush generation \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:59\n\n\n\n\n\nI felt like an alien, says Windrush scandal victim\n\n\n\n'A generation were pushed aside'The game's writer Corey Brotherson - who is also a descendant of the Windrush generation - says the scandal shifted the \"entire tone\" of the game, and gave the team extra purpose in their work.\"For a lot of people, Windrush was something that was either not known about much or forgotten,\" he says. \"The contributions of the Windrush generation were pushed aside.

One of his grandfather's first experiences was being ripped off by a taxi driver, and he also struggled for acceptance in the workplace.\"My grandad was a hard worker, but sometimes it was difficult to find work,\" Brotherson says. \"Sometimes if he got a promotion, his white co-workers would be antagonistic towards him.\"It was typical of the racism, bigotry and pushback his generation experienced when they were trying to establish themselves.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nCorey Brotherson, writer of Windrush Tales.

Mr Seymour told the court that Mr Morgan was \"boastful\" and would \"behave foolishly\" at times.The former political journalist also gave details about a story written about Princess Diana, which included a photo of her crying after a visit to her \"saviour\" friend and therapist as she dealt with her divorce from Prince Charles, now the King.Mr Seymour spoke about the article in court, and said in his witness statement: \"The article clearly suggests to readers, and the public, that Princess Diana was upset because of the problems she faced in her life, and having unburdened herself to her therapist.\"However, Mr Seymour said that a few days after the story was published, he remembers seeing Mr Morgan and others watching a video which had been taken by a paparazzi photographer present at the time, which showed why Diana was really upset - after being \"hounded up and down the street by a baying, cat-calling mob of photographers\" from a number of different press organisations.Mr Seymour said in his statement that \"the truth never emerged\" about how the story was obtained and he was \"upset and ashamed that we had printed something so cruel, intrusive and false\".

One an aspiring nurse, Rose, the other her older brother, Vernon. Apprehensive but tenacious, Rose follows her sibling to England and plans to start work as a nurse in the newly formed NHS.Vernon has been in Britain for several years but, unknown to his sister, has struggled to find and stay in work.

And the figures are reflected on screen - a 2021 diversity study by gaming website Diamond Lobby, of more than 100 of the best-selling titles from the previous five years, found 54% of main characters are white, while just 8% are non-white women.But the celebratory focus of Windrush Tales shifted when, with pre-production barely under way, news broke of a scandal that shook the team's faith to its core. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:40\n\n\n\n\n\n'People traumatised' by Windrush scandal\n\n\n\nThe Windrush scandalBack in 2018, with the 70th anniversary of the Windrush's arrival on the horizon, it emerged that many of those who made the same journey over subsequent decades had been wrongly detained, deported, and denied legal rights by a \"hostile environment policy\" that cracked down on those deemed to have arrived in the UK illegally.Some of those deported later died.Among those worst affected by the government's policy, introduced by the then home secretary Theresa May in 2012, were members of the Windrush generation - who arrived in the UK legally, and with the government's encouragement, between 1948 and 1973. Many, like Rose, took jobs in the NHS - and other sectors impacted by Britain's post-war labour shortage.While indefinite leave to remain was automatically granted upon their arrival in the UK, many weren't issued with any documents confirming their status and were later unable to prove their right to stay when immigration officers came knocking. Jobs and properties were lost, health care and benefits were denied, and in the worst cases, people were deported to countries they barely knew.Read more:Home Office knew policy would hit Windrush generation \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:59\n\n\n\n\n\nI felt like an alien, says Windrush scandal victim\n\n\n\n'A generation were pushed aside'The game's writer Corey Brotherson - who is also a descendant of the Windrush generation - says the scandal shifted the \"entire tone\" of the game, and gave the team extra purpose in their work.\"For a lot of people, Windrush was something that was either not known about much or forgotten,\" he says. \"The contributions of the Windrush generation were pushed aside.

One of his grandfather's first experiences was being ripped off by a taxi driver, and he also struggled for acceptance in the workplace.\"My grandad was a hard worker, but sometimes it was difficult to find work,\" Brotherson says. \"Sometimes if he got a promotion, his white co-workers would be antagonistic towards him.\"It was typical of the racism, bigotry and pushback his generation experienced when they were trying to establish themselves.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nCorey Brotherson, writer of Windrush Tales.
