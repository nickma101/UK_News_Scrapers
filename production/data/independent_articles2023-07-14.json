Read our\u00a0privacy noticePlans to fine separating couples who refuse to take part in mediation could enable domestic abusers to \u201ccontrol and coerce\u201d their victims, experts have warned.New proposals would make it compulsory for parents in England and Wales to take part in mediation \u2013 with the government hoping the scheme will ease pressure on family court backlogs.Cases involving child protection concerns or domestic abuse would be exempt but charities told The Independent the plans could endanger victims.A consultation on the policy finished in June and the Ministry of Justice is due to publish its decision on the plans in the autumn.Ruth Davison, chief executive of domestic abuse charity Refuge, said: \u201cWhilst it is important that the government has made the distinction that couples mediation would not be appropriate for survivors of domestic abuse, we know that due to the insidious nature of coercive control and the dynamics of domestic abuse, this may not always work in practice. RecommendedDomestic abusers winning time with children by accusing mothers of parental alienation, study findsDomestic abuse victims \u2018silenced\u2019 by family courts and forced into letting dangerous exes see children, warn campaigners\u201cRefuge are concerned there is a risk that some survivors could fall through the cracks and be forced into mediation which would be a huge miscarriage of justice.\u201dMandip Ghai, of Rights of Women, a women\u2019s rights legal charity, warned \u201cdiscriminatory attitudes embedded in the family justice system\u201d already meant victims felt pressured into taking part in mediation.Ms Ghai, a senior legal officer, warned that the government\u2019s own Risk of Harm to Children and Parents in Private Law Children\u2019s Cases, published in 2020, had exposed cases of domestic abuse survivors being forced into mediation despite the exemptions and protections already in place.She added: \u201cThe proposed amendments are likely to increase expectations and pressure on survivors to mediate. Survivors who mediate experience abuse ranging from coercive and controlling behaviour, intimidation and physical abuse during mediation.\u201d (PA Archive)People who go through the family courts are there as \u201cthey have to be there, not because they want to be there\u201d, Ms Ghai, whose organisation runs a family law advice line, said.\u201cThose who can mediate, do,\u201d she explained. \u201cCompulsory mediation may well reduce pressure on courts but it will be at the cost of adding further trauma to survivors of domestic abuse\u201d.Dr Charlotte Proudman, a prominent barrister who specialises in violence against women and girls, said she had witnessed firsthand how mediation in cases of domestic abuse \u201ccan go horribly wrong\u201d.She cited how in one case, a victim said she felt pressurised by her ex into mediation to agree to child arrangements in a case where there was a civil restraining order in place. \u201cShe had to come face-to-face with her abuser where the same imbalance of power and abuse tactics played out, resulting in what she described as an unsafe arrangement,\u201d Dr Proudman said.RecommendedFamily courts inflict a form of state-sanctioned abuse on adults and children \u2013 the government can no longer claim ignoranceJudge orders woman to directly arrange childcare arrangements with rapist ex-husbandAdrienne Barnett, an academic at Brunel Law School who specialises in the family courts, explained domestic abuse victims can be \u201coverlooked\u201d by the courts.Dr Barnett, who specialised in family law while practising as a barrister for more than 30 years, said: \u201cMediation can provide domestic abusers with another opportunity to control, coerce and intimidate their victims. Research previously found during assessment meetings to work out if mediation was appropriate, a fraction of the time was spent screening for domestic abuse.\u201dRebecca Goshawk, of advice service Solace Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cWe fear that some survivors won\u2019t necessarily want to initially disclose abuse, as they know their experience could be disbelieved or minimised in the family courts, or may not realise that their experience is abuse. \u201cDue to post-separation abuse, other survivors may feel pressured to go through mediation.\u201dA spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said the proposals were \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that where there are concerns of domestic abuse cases should go directly to court.\u201cAll mediators are accredited and required to undertake specialist training to spot the signs of abuse and coercive control and will signpost victims to appropriate support services,\u201d the representative added."}, {"_id": "64b1412651ac3319749488df", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/thornton-home-office-justice-britain-first-high-court-b2375342.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Councils win bid to bring legal challenge over airfields plan for asylum seekers", "lead": "Mrs Justice Thornton said that two out of the 15 grounds could go ahead to a further hearing, including on the use of \u2019emergency\u2019 planning powers.", "author": "Jess Glass", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 12:00:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:50.049550", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T12:00:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/11/8668e23bbfeaff1c14a0186733947707Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NDE3MzA3-2.72973993.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTwo councils opposing plans to house asylum seekers on disused airfields have been given the green light to bring a High Court challenge against the Home Office.Braintree District Council and a nearby resident are bringing legal action to challenge the use of Wethersfield Airfield in Essex to house up to 1,700 men while West Lindsey District Council is challenging similar plans for RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.During a two-day hearing in London this week, the councils and Gabriel Clarke-Holland made a bid to bring a full legal challenge in their claims against the department.In a ruling on Friday, Mrs Justice Thornton ruled in their favour, granting permission to both councils and Mr Clarke-Holland.\n\nWe are grateful to have had another opportunity to put our views and the views of our local community across to the High Court at this initial stageGraham Butland, Braintree District CouncilShe said: \u201cThe decision to accommodate asylum seekers on the sites may give rise to strong local opinion,\u201d adding that there may also be wider discussions about the welfare of the asylum seekers.\u201cThose are not, however, matters for the court,\u201d the judge continued.Mrs Justice Thornton said that two out of the 15 grounds could go ahead to a further hearing, including on the use of \u201cemergency\u201d planning powers.\u201cBoth of these grounds were advanced by all three claimants,\u201d the judge continued.The decision comes after the first 46 asylum seekers arrived at Wethersfield Airfield, around eight miles from Braintree, on Wednesday.Alex Goodman KC, for Mr Clarke-Holland \u2013 who lives approximately 80ft from a gate on to the airfield \u2013 said members of the right-wing group Britain First were protesting near his home on the morning of the arrivals.Following the ruling, Graham Butland, leader of Braintree District Council, said: \u201cWe are grateful to have had another opportunity to put our views and the views of our local community across to the High Court at this initial stage, as we still believe Wethersfield Airfield is not a suitable site for these plans.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work closely with the Home Office and multi-agency partners to ensure there is minimal impact on all those involved residents that live nearby and local services, as well as raising our concerns with the Home Office so it can put in place mitigating action, whilst supporting asylum seekers coming to our district.\u201cWe will also continue to push for regular, open and transparent engagement with the wider community, which to date we feel has been lacking and creating frustrations quite rightly for our residents and businesses who have been left with a void of information.\u201dLeader of West Lindsey District Council Trevor Young said: \u201cI welcome today\u2019s judgment, which I hope the community will take as a positive in that it clearly shows we have a case.\u201cHowever, as we have seen at other large sites across the country and in particular at Wethersfield, the Home Office is continuing to press ahead with its plans to use larger sites for asylum accommodation.\u201cTherefore, our challenge is to continue to balance our legal process with our duty of care as a local authority, to hold the Home Office to account on their proposals, as we have been doing since March.\u201dDuring the two-day hearing, lawyers for Braintree District Council told the court that the Home Office failed to take several issues into account, including access to healthcare at Wethersfield Airfield and \u201cserious issues\u201d with the \u201cageing\u201d wastewater provision on site.However, Home Office lawyers said the three linked claims should not be allowed to have a full hearing.Paul Brown KC, for the department, said in written submissions: \u201cThere is significant overlap in the grounds in all three claims and the misapprehensions which underpin them.\u201cNone of the three claims raises any genuinely arguable point.\u201dThe High Court previously heard the planning law which would allow the airfields to be used covers the change of use of some Government land to prevent or mitigate an emergency which \u201cthreatens serious damage to human welfare\u201d.The two councils and Mr Clarke-Holland have challenged the use of these planning powers, while the Home Office has said their use is justified.Both councils previously lost bids for injunctions preventing the use of the large sites by the Home Office."}, {"_id":

Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAt least 87 people, including children, have been found buried in a mass grave in Sudan, the UN has said, as calls grow for the UK to act over the violence that has plagued the country for months. Those on the ground and from across the political spectrum believe the situation is comparable to the killings in Darfur that sparked international outcry in 2003.Ethnically motivated bloodshed has escalated in recent weeks, in step with the fighting between rival military factions that erupted in April, and has brought the country to the brink of civil war. Thousands have died and millions have been forced from their homes by the broader conflict between Sudan\u2019s army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by al-Burhan\u2019s former deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is known as \u201cHemedti\u201d.The UN Human Rights Office said that the people in the mass grave \u2013 some of them from the ethnic African Masalit tribe \u2013 were killed by the RSF and an affiliated Arab militia. \u201cAccording to credible information gathered by the Office, those buried in the mass grave were killed by RSF and their allied militia around 13-21 June,\u201d a UN statement said.But the RSF has denied being involved in any fighting in West Darfur and says it has \u201cno connection\u201d to events there.The discovery of the mass grave is the latest incident to be reported from West Darfur\u2019s capital, El Geneina, where The Independent has heard from witnesses who claim that teenagers are being rounded up and shot, and women and girls are being raped. People are said to have been told that this is being done in order to \u201cdestroy and change the DNA of the area\u201d. One of those who made it out of the city said they were \u201crunning from hell\u201d.\u201cWhat is happening in El Geneina is a genocide \u2013 we want this said out loud,\u201d says Ibrahim*, who is sheltering in the neighbouring country of Chad, where his family have sought refuge after fleeing the city. He does not want his real name to be published, as this could jeopardise the safety of members of his extended family who are still stranded. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on systematically.\u201dRecommendedUN Security Council calls for halt to fighting in Sudan and protection of civiliansSudan conflict shows how peace could unravel in South Sudan if world doesn't watch, UN envoy saysFighting resumes after Sudan cease-fire as number of people displaced passes 2.5 millionUrging the UK and the wider international community to take action, David Alton, a crossbench peer who is a member of parliament\u2019s human rights committee, tells The Independent: \u201cThere is an unfolding genocide happening in Darfur and the international community is doing nothing. \u201cMass graves are synonymous with 20 years ago. It is an appalling indictment of the abysmal failure of the international community that two decades later a commitment of \u2018never again\u2019 has been allowed to happen all over again. There is no end to the suffering which the people of Darfur have had to endure. We should hang our heads in shame.\u201cWhat started then has been a slow-burn genocide that never ended. The perpetrators were never held to account... and surprise, surprise, it is now happening again on a shocking scale.\u201dLord Alton says the UK government\u2019s response has so far been \u201clamentable\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken personally to ministers about this, and there is plenty of sympathy, but that is not matched by appropriate action.\u201dEl Geneina, in West Darfur, pictured at the end of April after the conflict began  (AFP via Getty)Following the discovery of the mass grave, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, called for \u201ca prompt, thorough and independent investigation into the killings\u201d with those responsible being held to account.The International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating events in Darfur, noting the reports of killings, rapes, and crimes affecting children, an ICC prosecutor told the United Nations on Thursday. \u201cThe office can confirm that it has commenced investigations in relation to incidents occurring in the context of the present hostilities,\u201d Karim Khan\u2019s office said in a report to the UN Security Council.ICC prosecutors are \u201cclosely tracking reports of extrajudicial killings, burning of homes and markets, and looting in El Geneina, as well as the killing and displacement of civilians in North Darfur and other locations across Darfur\u201d, the report said. The court is also examining \u201callegations of sexual and gender-based crimes, including mass rapes and alleged reports of violence against and affecting children\u201d, it said.El Geneina, which has a population of around 250,000, has been under siege for more than two months, shortly after the conflict between the military factions broke out. In June, the West Darfur governor was killed soon after accusing the RSF of carrying out a genocide against the Masalit people.Newly arrived refugees from Sudan at a camp in Chad (Supplied)\u201cThe RSF suffocated El Geneina,\u201d says Ibrahim. Describing destroyed water pumps, looted banks, burnt food markets and ravaged medical supplies, he tells of how his 86-year-old diabetic mother has gone for six weeks without medicine.His family of almost 20, with the youngest being just a few months old, say they have been sheltering in their homes, afraid to step outside for fear of snipers. \u201cFor us, we see that death is moving closer every day,\u201d says one of his brothers, who tells of streets littered with bodies, the stench of decomposing flesh hanging heavy over the city.It was only when Ibrahim\u2019s uncle was killed on 21 June that the family say they made the life-or-death decision to try to escape via the perilous 28km road to Adre, a town very close to Chad\u2019s eastern border with Sudan, where tens of thousands of refugees are currently living in makeshift camps, seeking humanitarian aid. The family say they drove through at least 10 checkpoints on the 12-hour journey. \u201cEvery moment, every single second we feel we are going to be killed,\u201d says Ibrahim\u2019s brother. They say they were insulted, pushed around, and robbed of their only remaining money in a \u201cterrifying ordeal\u201d \u2013 but they survived.Ibrahim, who had been working in Khartoum, finally made contact with his family when they got across the border. Weeks without hearing from them was a \u201cfeeling that is killing\u201d and led to his being forced to take time off work, he says. He had been about to travel to his family in El Geneina for the holidays when war broke out, and he was evacuated in a UN convoy days later.A camp in Adre, Chad, where people have sought refuge after fleeing Sudan  (Supplied)Now, he is in a city 100km inland from Chad\u2019s border, desperately trying to find homes for his family amid rocketing rents and low availability due to the high demand created by Sudanese people seeking refuge, he says. About 2.2 million people have fled their homes in Sudan, while 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, according to Vicky Ford MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Sudan and South Sudan. She says the death toll in El Geneina alone now exceeds 5,000, and the number of injured has surpassed 8,000.Ibrahim says the lack of support from the international community has caused him to lose hope. Like many others, he is calling for leaders to establish a safe passage along that 28km road to make it safe to evacuate civilians, or at a minimum the thousands who have been wounded. Lord Alton travelled to Darfur in 2004 with Rebecca Tinsley, who founded her organisation Waging Peace in response to the horrors she witnessed there, and both took testimonies from survivors. Describing bodies there currently \u201cbeing used as road bumps\u201d, Ms Tinsley says: \u201cThe situation in Darfur now is possibly as bad as it was during the genocide, if not worse.\u201dThe perilous 28km road to the camps in Adre, Chad, involves at least 10 checkpoints for those escaping El Geneina (Supplied)Ms Ford describes \u201ccivilians facing horror\u201d as they are murdered, disappeared and raped in Khartoum and parts of Darfur, with lawyers, doctors and community leaders being targeted. \u201cAgain, atrocities are happening at all levels,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in El Geneina has also got an ethnic element \u2013 there are systemic ethnic attacks and cleansing of non-Arabs.\u201dA man who has a leadership role in the El Geneina community tells of being \u201ctargeted from the moment the war started\u201d. He says he had to make the difficult decision to leave his wife and children at home and go into hiding, where he was stuck for weeks.He says he finally managed to flee the city and ended up walking all the way from there to Adre, without any water or food, and constantly thinking, \u201cThey\u2019re going to catch me, they\u2019re going to get me now.\u201dEventually, he says, he made it to the temporary camps across the border in Chad. Miraculously, he was reunited with his family there, and they all held each other and wept.Finding somewhere to live in Chad is difficult amid rocketing rents and low availability due to the high demand created by Sudanese people seeking refuge (Supplied)Without an urgent response, Ms Ford fears the violence against civilians will spread into other parts of Sudan or neighbouring countries, because of Sudan\u2019s importance, size, and location \u201cat the crossroads in Africa\u201d. She adds: \u201cThere are risks that instability in Africa leads to more migration, then more instability in Western Europe \u2013 this is important domestically in the UK, too.\u201dThe MP for Chelmsford says the British government is aware of Sudan\u2019s importance to the UK, and has been having discussions with many of its international partners. She says that the international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, \u201cabsolutely understands the critical nature of this situation and the risk of it spreading\u201d. Although, she adds, \u201cThere are more questions about other potential steps the UK government could take, and I hope they ... take them as soon as possible.\u201dMs Ford says the all-party group will be calling for measures including asset freezes, an arms embargo and a peacekeeping force. These are in addition to sanctions.Mr Mitchell said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s immediate objective in Sudan is to stop the violence and atrocities being committed, ensure civilians are protected, and push for immediate, safe and unfettered access for humanitarian organisations.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA campaign group which complained about a Government \u201cfailure\u201d to implement Grenfell Tower Inquiry recommendations relating to disabled people living in high-rise flats has lost a High Court fight.Claddag, which campaigns on fire safety issues facing disabled residents, raised concerns relating to recommendations that owners of high-rise residential buildings should prepare \u201cpersonal emergency evacuation plans\u201d for people with disabilities.The group took legal action against Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who has responsibility for national fire safety legislation and guidance, and asked\u00a0a judge\u00a0to quash a decision \u201cnot to implement\u201d recommendations.Mrs\u00a0Justice\u00a0Stacey, who had considered arguments at a High Court hearing in London in December, has dismissed the group\u2019s claim.She heard that Claddag had been set up by Sarah Rennie, from Birmingham, and Georgie Hulme, from Manchester, who had physical disabilities and had also taken legal action.The judge said Ms Rennie and Ms Hulme, and many others, must have been \u201cdesperately\u201d disappointed that the recommendations had not been implemented.But she said the decision was \u201cessentially a political decision\u201d and \u201cnot unlawful\u201d.Mrs Justice Stacey said a personal emergency evacuation plan was a \u201cspecifically designed evacuation plan\u201d, tailored to meet the \u201cspecific needs of a person with reduced mobility\u201d.The judge said the aim was for residents and people responsible for the management of fire safety in a building to have \u201cthought through the available options in advance of any emergency\u201d.She said a consultation had led ministers to conclude that introducing personal emergency evacuation plans would not be proportionate because of \u201cpractical difficulties and concerns\u201d raised by a number of \u201cresponsible persons\u201d and building owners.\n\nThis was essentially a political decision for the defendant to take and was not in breach of the requirements of public law and procedural fairnessMrs Justice Stacey\u201cThe reasoning could have been fuller and engaged more closely with the detailed and thoughtful findings and conclusions in the (inquiry) report and careful advice of the experts appointed to assist the inquiry, but there has been a sufficient grappling with the \u2026 rationale in all the circumstances sufficient to meet the legal threshold,\u201d said the judge.\u201cThis was essentially a political decision for the defendant to take and was not in breach of the requirements of public law and procedural fairness.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt must have been desperately disappointing for the claimants and many others that the carefully considered personal emergency evacuation plan recommendations contained in the \u2026 report have not been implanted, but it was not an unlawful decision.\u201dBarrister Raj Desai, who represented the claimants, had told the judge 72 people had died following the outbreak of the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14 2017.He said those who died were \u201cdisproportionately persons with disabilities\u201d whose \u201cability to self-evacuate was compromised\u201d.Alan Payne KC, who led a government legal team, had told the hearing that a consultation was ongoing and indicated that ministers were looking at ways to implement recommendations in a \u201cproportionate and safe manner\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b1412651ac3319749488e2", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/measles-epidemic-symptoms-warning-signs-b2075063.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Five measles symptoms to watch out for as experts warn of \u2018epidemic\u2019 in children", "lead": "<p>The rate of under-twos that have had both MMR vaccine doses has fallen to 85 per cent </p>", "author": "Lamiat Sabin", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:41:42", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:50.589548", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T11:41:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/05/03/09/a6ae44bedddb7e55c4de7c09e143974cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjUxNjUyMjY4-2.16366311.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for our free Health Check email to receive exclusive analysis on the week in healthGet our free Health Check email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But to be honest, right now, if that works to get somebody in school, it\u2019s worth it.\u201dThe matter has become a particular concern in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw schools close and students left learning from home for significant spells.Last month, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that children missing school was a \u201ctragedy\u201d and \u201cincredibly damaging for educational outcomes\u201d.But school leaders described the comments as \u201cunhelpful\u201d.James Bowen, assistant general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cThese comments are unhelpful and demonstrate a worrying lack of understanding of how schools operate.\n\nWhile schools clearly have an important role to play in supporting good attendance, we should not lose sight of the basic reality that bringing children to school on time is the role of parentsJames Bowen, National Association of Head Teachers\u201cSchool leaders quite obviously need to be in school leading their schools \u2013 asking them to drive around the local area collecting children is not practical, nor would it be a good use of their time.\u201cFor many years schools had local authority teams employed to do exactly this job, but we have seen them largely disappear after a decade of cuts.\u201cWhile schools clearly have an important role to play in supporting good attendance, we should not lose sight of the basic reality that bringing children to school on time is the role of parents.\u201dRecommendedHundreds gather for funeral of Nottingham attack victimModel car collection worth \u00a320,000 to be sold at auctionHeavy wind and rain expected as Europe heatwave pushes low-pressure system to UKDowning Street said \u201cdifferent schools will take different approaches\u201d to the issue.\u201cIt is right that of course headteachers are proactive in tackling this and indeed the vast majority do an excellent job in ensuring all children are regularly attending school,\u201d the Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said."}, {"_id": "64b1412751ac3319749488e6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bromley-double-murder-women-missing-b2375284.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man charged with murder of two women including one who vanished from shop last month", "lead": "<p>Fiona Holme has not been seen since vising an off licence in Bromley on June 20  </p>", "author": "Holly Evans", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:58:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:51.231950", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T10:58:36+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/11/newFile-42028229.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A post-mortem examination gave her cause of death as a stab wound. A second woman, Fiona Holm, 48, was last seen leaving a shop in Bromley on 20 June this year, and has not been heard from since. She was reported missing on 29 June with her disappearance was initially treated as a missing person\u2019s investigation. Due to the out-of-character nature of her disappearance and the amount of time since she was last seen alive in Verdant Lane, the Metropolitan Police are now treating it as a murder investigation. Carol Cooper, 65, was initially arrested on 18 February 2022 on suspicion of Ms Hunte\u2019s murder and was bailed pending further inquiries before being released under investigation.RecommendedTeenagers jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old boy in \u2018cowardly\u2019 attack\u2018I woke up in house I didn\u2019t recognise after drink spiking\u2019: Victim backs legal action over \u2018failure\u2019 to tackle crimeInquiry calls over failures linked to sixth Stephen Lawrence murder suspectHe was not on bail when he was re-arrested on 11 July on suspicion of Holm\u2019s murder and has since been charged with the murders of both women. Police said Cooper was known to both women and searches are ongoing to find Holm\u2019s body at addresses and open areas in southeast London. Following Ms Hunte\u2019s death at her home in Congleton Grove, a neighbour told The Standard she\u2019d heard a scream coming from her flat.Firefighters later used axes to break down the door, with residents told by police that her body could have lay in the flat for several days before being discovered.Last April, the charity Crimestoppers offered a \u00a320,000 reward for information that may help catch her killer. Speaking at the time, Naomi\u2019s mother, Lorna, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been over a year since Naomi died and we, as a family, need to understand what happened to her.\u201cNaomi was a vibrant, kind and loving person and her death has caused our family great suffering.\u201dThe families of both women have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA breakthrough may have been in the saga surrounding Boris Johnson\u2019s old mobile phone, after an ally claimed Rishi Sunak\u2019s government has recovered the passcode to unlock it.The Covid inquiry had demanded the crucial device \u2013 known as \u201cPhone 1\u201d in Whitehall \u2013 by Monday 4pm but the deadline was missing due to complications in gaining access.Mr Johnson had forgotten the code used to unlock the iPhone \u2013 abandoned in May 2021 after it emerged his mobile number had been online for 15 years, according to The Times.Allies suggested it was not correct to say the former PM could not recall his own digits, but instead that he was just not entirely sure of them.The device likely contains key messages relating to the ordering of Covid lockdowns in 2020 and other important decisions leading up until April 2021.An ally of Mr Johnson: \u201cIt is not true that\u00a0Boris\u00a0does not remember his PIN number, it is just that he does not have 100 per cent confidence he remembers it.

Mr Johnson\u2019s spokesman has been approached about the claim.But security experts have cast doubt on claims the messages cannot be accessed because of a memory lapse on Mr Johnson\u2019s part \u2013 saying the data could likely be retrieved simply by taking out the sim card and putting it in another phone.Andrew Whaley, senior technical director at Norwegian cybersecurity company Promon, said: \u201cThis is a pretty lame excuse.\u201dHe added: \u201cProvided\u00a0Boris\u2019s WhatsApp is backed up, accessing the data would take minutes.

The hourly rate was worked out by the amount earned against the number of hours declared.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTeachers are poised to end months of strikes after Rishi Sunak announced pay rises of up to 7 per cent for millions of public sector workers \u2013 but doctors show no sign of calling off their action.Teachers have been offered a 6.5 per cent rise and junior doctors 6 per cent, plus an additional \u00a31,250.But the British Medical Association (BMA) said the below-inflation offer was \u201cexactly why so many doctors (feel) they have no option but to take industrial action\u201d.As the longest walkout in NHS history got underway, the prime minister told all unions his offer was final and implored doctors to \u201cdo the right thing and know when to say yes\u201d.Downing Street said it would not borrow more money or increase taxes to fund the more than \u00a32bn needed this year to fund the pay rises.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersMr Sunak said more than \u00a31bn would be found by \u201csignificantly\u201d raising fees for migrants\u2019 visa applications and access to the NHS. But roughly the same amount will be found through \u201creprioritisation\u201d \u2013 raising the prospect of cuts. However, it is understood this will be cross-government, removing pressure on individual departments, like education, to find the money for pay rises for teachers. For her part, education secretary Gillian Keegan promised there would be no cuts to frontline education services. Ben Zaranko, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned that wage increases would eventually require cuts to public budgets; that prompted the BMA to accuse the government of making \u201cordinary people sicker and poorer\u201d.Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham said the pay offer would place staff under new pressure and predicted: \u201cI think we\u2019ll be seeing a new wave of industrial action.\u201dSpeaking at a press conference, Mr Sunak said he would accept the recommendations of all the government\u2019s independent pay review bodies; other rises include 7 per cent for police and prison officers, 6 per cent for dentists and NHS consultants, and 5 per cent for members of the armed forces.He admitted that his announcement would \u201ccost all of you as taxpayers more than we had budgeted for\u201d.He added: \u201cThat\u2019s why the decision has been difficult, and why it has taken time to decide the right course of action. I can confirm today that we are accepting the headline recommendations of the pay review bodies in full, but we will not fund them by borrowing more or increasing your taxes.\u201dMinisters are struggling to fight persistent high inflation at the same time as bringing to an end to industrial action by groups including doctors.RecommendedJunior doctors mount picket lines as five-day strike beginsSunak and Hunt meeting to finalise public sector pay dealsAll the UK strike dates confirmed for July 2023But BMA chair of council Professor Phil Banfield said the government \u201cmissed a huge opportunity to put a credible proposal on the table to end strikes\u201d.He said consultants \u201cremain willing to talk\u201d but the offer means \u201cthey are likely to continue to take industrial action\u201d.Treasury minister John Glen told the Commons the pay award for teachers \u201cwill be fully funded\u201d. As part of reprioritising budgets, the Ministry of Defence will recruit fewer civil servants. But unions said the decision to fund some of the rises by drawing on departmental budgets was the wrong approach.Mike Clancy, general secretary of civil service union Prospect, said: \u201cFor a prime minister and chancellor who came into office promising economic stability, the chaotic handling of this process will inspire little confidence in workers worried about their futures during the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\u201cThe fact that they are taking a knife to public services to pay for these pay rises signals that they have learned nothing from the austerity years.\u201dExperts warned the education and health budgets could still face cuts worth billions of pounds, even with frontline services protected.Mr Zaranko said: \u201cAt this point, we can\u2019t say with any certainty where the funding for higher pay rises will come from, although Rishi Sunak has made clear that it will not come from increased borrowing or higher taxes. In the short-term, some could come from under-spends in other parts of the budget, but that\u2019s not a permanent solution.\u201dHe said extra revenue through higher charges for visa applications and for non-British nationals using the NHS would be \u201cunlikely to cover all of the additional cost\u201d. Without rises in borrowing or tax the move will \u201ceventually require either a smaller public sector workforce, or cuts to some other aspect of public service budgets\u201d. Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, said that raising \u201calready eye-wateringly high\u201d visa fees risks seeing people fall \u201cdeeper into poverty and insecurity\u201d. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz, policy and public affairs manager, said migrants in the UK pay some of the highest costs in Europe. Mr Sunak has promised to halve inflation \u2013 to 5 per cent \u2013 this year. But the CPI inflation is running at 8.7 per cent, amid fears pay increases are fuelling a wage-price spiral. Official figures released just hours before the announcement also showed the UK economy contracted in May. Ministers hope the decision not to borrow to fund the pay rises will minimise the impact of the decision on inflation.

I can pull my way out of it,\u201d he told Mr Campbell.

As such, the Met has advised the BBC it can continue with its internal investigation.\u201dThe statement added: \u201cWe are aware of media reporting of further allegations against the same individual.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn a shock announcement, Huw Edwards has been named as the BBC presenter at the centre of a sex scandal that has rocked the nation\u2019s broadcaster.His wife Vicky Flind named him as the suspended TV star and said that her husband was \u201csuffering from serious mental health issues\u201d and was receiving treatment in hospital, where he would remain \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d.Huw Edwards and his wife Vicky in 2018 (Noble/Draper)Describing the last few days as \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for her family, she requested privacy for all involved, including the couple\u2019s five children.Below we take a look at who his wife Vicky Flind is, as well as the presenter\u2019s own well-documented history.RecommendedHuw Edwards \u2013 latest: BBC news presenter is hospitalised as wife names him as star in sex scandalHuw Edwards in hospital after being named as BBC presenter facing allegationsTimeline: Allegations against BBC newsreader Huw EdwardsWho is Vicky Flind?Vicky Flind is a television producer who has worked on several acclaimed shows such as ITV\u2019s Peston and BBC One\u2019s This Week. Ms Flind was reportedly 28 when she met Mr Edwards who was 30 and working as a BBC correspondent at Westminster at the time. They didn\u2019t start dating until much later, when Mr Edwards invited his future wife on a skiing trip after one of his friends backed out. When their flight was delayed for 14 hours, Mr Edwards told the Daily Mail: \u201cWe started talking and haven\u2019t ever really stopped.\u201dThe couple were engaged in 1993 and now live in Dulwich, south London. They share five children \u2013 three sons and two daughters \u2013 together. Despite her marriage to the well-known broadcaster, not much is known about Ms Flind \u2013 with one source telling the tabloid she made a conscious decision to keep her personal life private.During an interview with The Times, Mr Edwards credited his wife for helping him with his fitness after she pointed out he had gained weight following the death of his father in 2010. After Ms Flind released her statement on Wednesday, her current and former colleagues praised her as a talented, hard-working, and \u201cthoroughly decent and good person\u201d. Robert Peston called Ms Flind the\u201dkindest, most decent woman \u201c in a statement during Wednesday\u2019s episode of his programme Peston.\u201cWhat few of you will know is that Vicky Flind is the editor of this show, and the person who created it with me \u2013 though she hasn\u2019t been involved tonight or at all this week,\u201d Mr Preston said. \u201cThe Labour MP Jess Phillips tonight described Vicky as the nicest, kindest and most decent woman.\u201cI and everyone who works with me here would agree. It has been difficult to feel what she and her family have been going through - and to read her statement that Huw has been hospitalised with acute depression.\u201dOne of Ms Flind\u2019s ex-colleagues at the BBC described her as \u201cvery creative, but she\u2019s also impish with a well-crafted and quirky sense of humour,\u201d in a statement to the Daily Mail. TV producer Rob Burley, who was formerly the editor of the BBC\u2019s live political programmes, tweeted: \u201cThe only person I know who\u2019s involved in the Huw Edwards story is his wife, Vicky Flind, who I worked with at the BBC. \u201cShe\u2019s a hugely talented and a thoroughly decent and good person. I hope she\u2019s left alone now too.\u201dWhat has his wife said? In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mrs Flind said: \u201cIn light of the recent reporting regarding the \u2018BBC Presenter\u2019 I am making this statement on behalf of my husband Huw Edwards, after what have been five extremely difficult days for our family. I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children.Mr Edwards is being treated in hospital  (PA Archive)\u201cHuw is suffering from serious mental health issues.

We hope this statement will bring that to an end.\u201dThe BBC star is one of the most recognisable faces on British television  (PA)In a special S4C program on the occasion of his 60th birthday last year, Mr Edwards said his depression began in 2002 and that he \u201cwent down fairly quickly\u201d.\u201cI couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I didn\u2019t want to go to work,\u201d he explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to speak to anybody. Maybe it was partly due to the fact that I wasn\u2019t happy in work. I couldn\u2019t describe how overwhelming it was. I had a bit of a scare and I had never experienced that before.\u201d In a 2022 interview with his former spokesperson Alistair Campbell for Men\u2019s Health, Mr Edwards detailed his decades-long battle with depression, explaining his mental health has been \u201cvery bad a few times\u201d ove the last 20 years. \u201cI\u2019m pretty clear that I have suffered \u2013 and do suffer \u2013 from depression. It\u2019s not anxiety, although it includes anxiety, but it tends to hit me in a strong wave and then go away,\u201d adding he had taken up boxing to help him cope with the mental disorder.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I can do when I feel myself on the slide. I can pull my way out of it,\u201d he told Mr Campbell. Mr Edwards also confirmed he had sought therapy and taken anti-depressants in the past, adding \u201cI\u2019d happily take them again if I needed to\u201d. Who is Huw Edwards?

That time is over. Good.\u201cObviously I\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s the last time the tabloids will ever do this.

have been accused of profiteering from \u201crip off\u201d fuel prices on the forecourt, resulting in drivers being made to pay nearly \u00a31bn over the odds for petrol and diesel over the last year,

items like bread, butter, milk, pasta and meat fell at his supermarket during the second quarter of the year in response to more favourable trading conditions.That said, the news that supermarkets have been accused of profiteering from \u201crip off\u201d fuel prices on the forecourt, resulting in drivers being made to pay nearly \u00a31bn over the odds for petrol and diesel over the last year, is likely to further demoralise a beleaguered public weary of struggling against the economy.Below, we look at what support is available to households this August.RecommendedJuly dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensionsFood bank use is a choice, suggests Veterans Minister Johnny MercerMotorists forced to pay 6p a litre too much as supermarkets accused of using customers as \u2018cash cows\u2019Extra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments as part of a programme that began this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Second cost of living payment \u2013 during autumn 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Pensioner payment \u2013 during winter 2023/4\u00a3299 \u2013 Third cost of living payment \u2013 during spring 2024Bank holiday brings payment schedule changeThe usual state support in the shape of benefits and pensions payments will also be going out in August, although the arrival of the Summer Bank Holiday on Monday 28 means that anyone expecting to receive their money on that date can typically expect it to be paid into their bank accounts one working day earlier (Friday 25, for instance).That applies to anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP in August:Universal creditState pensionPension creditDisability living allowancePersonal independence paymentAttendance allowanceCarer\u2019s allowanceEmployment support allowanceIncome supportJobseeker\u2019s allowanceFor more information on how and when state benefits are paid, please

records began in 1884 \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, which Ofgem set at \u00a32,074 for the third quarter beginning 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013 and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."},

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHollywood actors will join writers on the picket line, sparking an industry-wide shutdown in a row about pay and the impact of artificial intelligence.The strike, which starts at 8am UK time on Friday, comes after the union which represents around 160,000 members of the industry and Hollywood studios failed to reach an agreement on a fairer split of profits and increased safeguarding around AI rights.Shortly before the action was announced on Thursday evening, the stars of upcoming historical epic Oppenheimer staged a walkout from the film\u2019s London premiere in solidarity with other union members.Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were among the actors who left the event to \u201cwrite their picket signs\u201d, director Christopher Nolan told audiences.Members of the Screen Actors Guild \u2013 American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) \u2013 previously voted overwhelmingly to authorise a strike if a new contract with major studios, streamers and production companies could not be reached.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveNearly 98% (97.91%) of the 65,000 members who cast votes were in favour, Sag-Aftra said.It comes amid the ongoing strike by more than 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), who began industrial action on May 2.It is the first time in more than 60 years that both unions have been on strike simultaneously.Speaking on stage at the Oppenheimer premiere ahead of the official strike announcement, filmmaker Nolan said: \u201cI have to acknowledge the work of our incredible cast, led by Cillian Murphy.\u201cThe list is enormous \u2014 Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and so many more. You\u2019ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet.\u201cUnfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.\u201dSpeaking on the red carpet earlier, Sir Kenneth Branagh told the PA news agency: \u201cIf it happens I stand in solidarity with our Sag members.\u201dMurphy told PA: \u201cI stand by my colleagues, that\u2019s all I can say to you.\u201dMeanwhile, British actress Pugh said that the cast felt lucky to have got to the Oppenheimer premiere before the strike was announced but also lucky to be standing in solidarity with their acting peers.The Sag-Aftra strike will pile yet more pressure on the industry which has seen multiple projects and award ceremonies delayed or cancelled since the start of the writers\u2019 strike in May.Upcoming award shows, premieres, events and film festivals around the world, including the Toronto and Venice film festivals, and the 75th Emmys are likely to go ahead without participation from major talent, if at all.Among the productions in the UK that could be affected by the strike action is Deadpool 3, starring Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who were both recently pictured suited up for filming.The third instalment of the popular antihero franchise is scheduled for release in May 2024 but the strike action could significantly affect production.\n\nWe know it is a critical time at this point in the industry and the issues need to be addressed, difficult conversations, I know everybody is trying to get a fair deal, that is what\u2019s required so we\u2019ll support that.Sir Kenneth BranaghA number of TV series being filmed in the UK might also be affected, including spy thriller The Day Of The Jackal starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne and period boxing drama A Thousand Blows with Stephen Graham.House Of The Dragon series two with Matt Smith and Emma D\u2019Arcy could also be affected, alongside the second series of The Sandman with Tom Sturridge and the fourth series of Slow Horses with Academy Award winner Gary Oldman.Announcing the strike at a Los Angeles press conference on Thursday, the union\u2019s president Fran Drescher said: \u201cThe gravity of this move is not lost on me\u2026 it\u2019s a very serious thing that impacts thousands if not millions of people.\u201cThis is a moment of history that is a moment of truth. If we don\u2019t stand tall now we are all going to be in trouble.\u201dAsked how long the strike would last, Ms Drescher said: \u201cThat\u2019s up to them, we are open to talking to them tonight.\u201cAll of this is because of their behaviour, it\u2019s up to them if they want to talk in a normal way.\u201dMeanwhile, British actors\u2019 union Equity said it stands \u201cfull square behind our sister union\u201d, stating it has also been experiencing \u201cbullish engagers attempting to undermine its collectively bargained agreements\u201d.A statement from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that the union had decided to \u201cwalk away from negotiations\u201d.RecommendedNo further concessions on Illegal Migration Bill, Jenrick signalsScarecrow festival born in lockdown \u2018has brought village community together\u2019Robots-led surgeries could boost efficiency and free up beds, say surgeons\u201cThis is the union\u2019s choice, not ours,\u201d the statement read.\u201cRather than continuing to negotiate, Sag-Aftra has put us on a course that will deepen the financial hardship for thousands who depend on the industry for their livelihoods.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1412c51ac331974948902", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-michael-gove-pin-number-cabinet-office-downing-street-b2375030.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Johnson ally says Government has found a \u2018version of PIN\u2019 for old phone", "lead": "The former prime minister has reportedly struggled to access messages from a device he stopped using in 2021 due to security concerns.", "author": "Patrick Daly", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 06:51:50", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:56.548835", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T06:51:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/22/f383e7a24062aa6b7effa06215f6f93dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzY5Mzkw-2.6295779.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA breakthrough may have been in the saga surrounding Boris Johnson\u2019s old mobile phone, after an ally claimed Rishi Sunak\u2019s government has recovered the passcode to unlock it.The Covid inquiry had demanded the crucial device \u2013 known as \u201cPhone 1\u201d in Whitehall \u2013 by Monday 4pm but the deadline was missing due to complications in gaining access.Mr Johnson had forgotten the code used to unlock the iPhone \u2013 abandoned in May 2021 after it emerged his mobile number had been online for 15 years, according to The Times.Allies suggested it was not correct to say the former PM could not recall his own digits, but instead that he was just not entirely sure of them.The device likely contains key messages relating to the ordering of Covid lockdowns in 2020 and other important decisions leading up until April 2021.An ally of Mr Johnson: \u201cIt is not true that\u00a0Boris\u00a0does not remember his PIN number, it is just that he does not have 100 per cent confidence he remembers it.

and RCS England\u2019s council lead for the future of surgery, robotics and digital surgery, said: \u201cThis\u00a0timely\u00a0new guidance will\u00a0support the safe and structured\u00a0introduction of robotic assisted surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and the fruitful collaboration between\u00a0hospitals, surgeons and industry.\u201cIt\u2019s important for the surgical profession, led by RCS England, in collaboration with the surgical speciality associations, to take charge of all processes, accredit training centres and pathways and facilitate equity in access and training.\u201dMiss Yassin also called for the \u201cproper planning\u201d of investment in robotics for its introduction into the health service \u201cwith a focus on training, quality assurance and efficiency\u201d.\u201cThis\u00a0also needs to acknowledge\u00a0the variable learning curve which can be long for some surgeons and theatre teams before these efficiencies can be observed at a large scale,\u201d she added.Professor Neil Mortensen, outgoing president of the RCS England, said: \u201cThe 21st century has brought an increasing variety of less invasive ways to treat disease and to carry out surgery.\u201cIt is possible that robotic surgery will eventually reach an era where a robot could perform pre-programmed tasks, complementing human performance.\u201cThis is likely a long way in the future and it comes with significant additional ethical and systemic considerations.\u201cIt is also important to establish the right relationship with industry, being clear and transparent around what constitutes conflict of interest and creating an effective dialogue that will benefit both patients and surgical education.\u201dRecommendedJunior doctors refuse to call off strikes despite Sunak\u2019s 6% \u2018final\u2019 pay offerAspartame is \u2018possibly carcinogenic\u2019 as WHO advice remains unchangedTeenagers among five arrested over violent disorder outside hotelRobots could also be helpful in training surgeons, Prof Mortensen said.\u201cAt a time when there is less exposure of trainee surgeons to theatre time, robotic-assisted surgery simulation could be an opportunity to safely expose them to the spectrum of case complexity and expand the capacity of the surgical workforce.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1412d51ac331974948907", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/teeth-nhs-dental-crisis-dentist-b2374906.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "People forced to pull out their own teeth amid NHS dental crisis, report finds", "lead": "<p>The Health and Social Care Committee\u2019s examination of NHS dentistry calls for \u2018urgent and fundamental reform\u2019 </p>", "author": "Storm Newton", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 02:42:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:57.547299", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T02:42:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/18/SEI162528129.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Failure to act will condemn this service to oblivion.\u201dLouise Ansari, chief executive at Healthwatch England welcomed the report.She said: \u201cUltimately, only a fundamental and fully resourced dental contract reform can tackle these deep-seated problems, and we call on the Government to publish its dental recovery plan urgently.\u201cNHS dentistry is the second most common problem that the public report to Healthwatch, with more than 400 local reports from across England in the past three years exposing experiences of people suffering in pain, performing DIY dentistry and struggling to pay the costs of treatment.\u201dAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cWhile the number of dental appointments available for NHS patients is steadily increasing and the GP Patient Survey found seven out of 10 patients had a good overall experience of dental services, the NHS has already started to address some of these recommendations through initial contract changes last year.\u201cThese significant reforms will continue to further support dental teams to carry out even more treatments and address the inevitable backlogs that built up during the pandemic, while record numbers of dentists, dental therapists and hygienists will be trained as part of the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1412d51ac331974948908", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/teenagers-merseyside-police-merseyside-b2375104.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teenagers among five arrested over violent disorder outside hotel", "lead": "They have been bailed and will appear at Liverpool Magistrates\u2019 Court on Thursday July 27.", "author": "Rob Freeman", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 02:08:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:57.718593", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T02:08:23+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/03/14584c63f33ad7c17c3606126b448211Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5Mzg2NjQ0-2.70988388.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Good educational opportunities open to my kids? That\u2019s all the kind of soft infrastructure, which creates the stickiness that we are after.\u201cAll of that implies a degree of collaboration between universities, between universities in the finance sector and between the Scottish government.\u201dOn the formation of a new Scottish Industrial Strategy Council, formed, led and accountable to the First Minister, Sir Martin said: \u201cGetting one of the key decision makers and experts in one room, in an executive council, which is going to meet every three months, not just in Edinburgh, but around Scotland, gives you the opportunity to make sure that everyone is on the same page.\u201cAnd that decisions can be taken rapidly on the basis of the best information and that people know what else is happening. And just putting that together, giving a stable framework is very powerful for harnessing success.\u201dSir Martin is a former permanent secretary at the department for international trade and the current president of commercial aircraft manufacturer Boeing Europe.Asked about how his report ties in with Scottish independence, Mr Blackford said: \u201cThis report is an independent report.\u201cIt is about how we get the economy in Scotland moving. We have talked in the report about some of the things we could do under the devolution settlement but we do highlight some of the things we could do if Scotland was independent.\n\nI think what the SNP will do is ensure that we have the answers in terms of growing the economy in a sustainable way.

It is a testament to our region\u2019s strengths, and the expertise of the University of Sheffield\u2019s AMRC, that our long-standing partner Boeing has chosen South Yorkshire for this globally significant research and development project.\u201dBusiness and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said: \u201cBoeing and its partners\u2019 investment in the new Investment Zone is a major vote of confidence in our world-leading aerospace sector and adds to the nearly \u00a3400 million of government-backed funding for aerospace projects we\u2019ve announced in 2023 alone.RecommendedWorkers \u2018left out of pocket\u2019 by 12-year freeze in mileage rates \u2013 reportKeegan hails degree-level apprenticeship for students seeking space sector jobsUsing robots in operations could boost efficiency and free up beds, say surgeons\u201cOur forthcoming plan for Advanced Manufacturing will build on this success and help ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of the industries of the future, creating high-quality jobs and economic growth right across the country.\u201dMayor of South Yorkshire Oliver Coppard, said: \u201cThis groundbreaking research partnership is yet another huge vote of confidence from Boeing in South Yorkshire\u2019s future.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1412e51ac33197494890f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mps-government-parliament-greg-clark-cornwall-b2375067.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Time running out for Government to realise UK\u2019s space launch ambitions, say MPs", "lead": "The Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee said the Government\u2019s \u2018disjointed approach\u2019 is hampering launch potential.", "author": "Nilima Marshall", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:58.961837", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/00/f81cedff891e2e296c22a0f632b26cd5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzQ1MDk4-2.70502989.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTime is running out for the Government to turn the UK\u2019s ambitions for space launches from home soil into reality, MPs have said.In a new report published by the Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, a cross-party group of MPs has criticised the \u201cdisjointed approach\u201d to Britain\u2019s space policy which, they said, is hampering launch potential.It said that the UK is on the cusp of establishing Europe\u2019s first small satellite orbital launch capability \u2013 but its first attempt did not succeed.Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Orbit\u2019s rocket, which blasted off from Cornwall on January 9, did not reach orbit and its payload of small satellites was lost.The MPs said a UK satellite launch sector can help strengthen the country\u2019s position in the design and manufacture of small satellites, but the Government needs to act fast.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe report stated: \u201cTime is running out in this Parliament for the Government to translate high-level ambitions into practical plans.\u201cThere is now not a moment to lose if the UK is to realise the full potential of this extraordinary sector, which is booming worldwide, and in which we have a world class capability and reputation.\u201dLast year, the UK\u2019s space sector added \u00a37 billion in value to the UK economy, while turnover from space organisations reached \u00a317.5 billion.The global space economy market is valued at \u00a3355 billion, and could grow to \u00a3760 billion by 2030.The report also expressed concern about the licensing delays that led to the Virgin Orbit launch being postponed.Virgin Orbit and some of its satellite customers were critical of the UK regulatory process, which was led by the Civil Aviation Authority.But the committee concluded there was no evidence that the regulatory system contributed to the failure of the Virgin Orbit.\n\nThe UK must act urgently to apply the lessons of the Cornwall disappointment to the regulatory system for satellite launchGreg ClarkThe report did state, however, that there is \u201cinsufficient co-ordination between the large number of regulatory bodies involved in licensing launches, and this continues to place unnecessary burdens of complexity and administration on companies\u201d.The MPs are calling on the Government to take steps to improve the licensing system of UK satellite launch.They also want an investigation to see whether regulations in the Space Industry Act 2018 \u2013 which was passed by Parliament in anticipation of the launch \u2013 needed to be amended.Greg Clark MP, chairman of the Science, Innovation & Technology Committee, said: \u201cThe UK has huge opportunities in the burgeoning space and satellite industry.\u201cBut the sector is global and fast-paced, and to maintain our position the UK must act urgently to apply the lessons of the Cornwall disappointment to the regulatory system for satellite launch.\u201dTim Johnson, director of space regulation at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: \u201cThe UK is on the cusp of home grown space launches and this report is both timely and welcome.\u201cThe next 12 months will be a very exciting time for the UK space sector and the Civil Aviation Authority is playing a central and vital role making space activity safe.\u201cWe welcome the recommendations to further streamline and simplify the space licensing process and have made significant improvements already, with many more to come.\u201dThe MPs also said the UK needs to publish its Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities \u2013 global navigation services needed for critical national infrastructure and defence purposes.The report said: \u201cThe Government continues to delay key decisions that need to be made about the UK\u2019s critical Position, Navigation and Timing capabilities.\u201cIt has long promised to update its PNT strategy but work on this topic has been passed between departments and teams and is yet to amount to any meaningful plan.\u201cThis demonstrates how the disjointed approach to leadership of the UK\u2019s space and satellite sector is hampering progress on important matters.\u201cThe Government should not delay the publication of its Position, Navigation and Timing Strategy any further.\u201dThe report also said that the National Space Council, which was abolished and then re-announced as an inter-ministerial group, is yet to meet for the first time and its responsibilities remain unclear.A Government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK space sector is thriving, employing almost 49,000 people.\u201cThe latest data shows it generated an income of \u00a317.5 billion in 2021 \u2013 a \u00a31 billion increase on the previous year.\u201cThe Government remains committed to supporting the

Read our\u00a0privacy noticePeople who drive their car for work are being short-changed because the Government has not updated mileage rates for more than a decade, according to a report.Analysis by motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found employees should be entitled to around 63p per mile tax-free when driving their own cars during work.The rate, which is set by the Treasury, has been frozen at 45p per mile since 2011 despite large increases in motoring bills and inflation since then.Someone covering 5,000 miles a year in their own car working for an employer that uses the tax-free rate only receives \u00a32,250.\n\nThese aren\u2019t board members and well-paid executives in new saloonsSteve Gooding, RAC FoundationRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThey would get an additional \u00a3900 under a rate of 63p per mile.The study was conducted for a report by Unison into the impact of the rate freeze on frontline public service workers such as NHS, social care, police and local government employees.The trade union said one in five workers in that category are required to drive for their job.It found that some staff are using up annual leave or calling in sick because they have run out of fuel and cannot afford to fill up their vehicles.Some social care employees have been forced to sell their cars to cover other payments, meaning they make fewer visits as using public transport increases travel times, according to the report.The RAC Foundation analysis was based on Office for National Statistics figures showing the cost of motoring was 41% higher in April compared with the same month in 2011.Cost rises affecting drivers over that period include tax and insurance (up 183%), maintenance (up 48%), vehicle prices (up 16%) and fuel (up 12%).RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said: \u201cWe know that some of our most important workers \u2013 those employed in health and social services, and in supporting roles \u2013 are being left out of pocket by the failure of ministers to sanction an uplift in the amount per mile they can receive tax-free for getting around to do their job.\u201cThese aren\u2019t board members and well-paid executives in new saloons, but key workers in five to 10-year-old cars who can ill afford to be subsidising the rest of us for the cost of carrying out their critical roles.\u201cTax cuts might be off the Prime Minister\u2019s agenda for the time being but, surely, fair tax treatment for these key workers should be a significant concern for the Chancellor in the face of a recognised cost-of-living squeeze.\u201cWe think the Treasury should commit to an urgent review of the mileage rate and not leave it another decade before revisiting it again.\u201dUnison general secretary Christina McAnea said: \u201cMileage rates are woefully out of date. No-one should pay a penalty effectively for doing their job, least of all those providing vital services.\u201cPetrol prices have skyrocketed. Care workers, nurses and other frontline employees can barely make their incomes stretch to cover the basics, let alone the costs of using their vehicles for work.\u201cThe Government must tackle low pay now, not threaten to hold public sector wages down. Essential staff shouldn\u2019t be out of pocket for going to work.\u201cA failure to act now risks worsening the already dire staffing crisis.\u201dEmployers can pay their staff whatever they want when reimbursing them for driving for work in their own cars, but many use the 45p per mile rate to avoid tax implications.RecommendedKeegan hails degree-level apprenticeship for students seeking space sector jobsUsing robots in operations could boost efficiency and free up beds, say surgeonsChildren\u2019s charity urges scrapping of benefit cap on \u2018unhappy\u2019 10th anniversaryA Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWhilst employers can reimburse at a higher level, the Approved Mileage Allowance Payments aim to reflect the average costs of running a vehicle, which in turn helps keep the administrative burden low and reimbursing simple.\u201cAs we work to bring down inflation, we have also taken decisive action worth \u00a394 billion to support drivers with the cost of living, which is worth \u00a33,300 on average per household over this year and last and includes a two year 5p fuel duty cut worth \u00a3200 for drivers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1412f51ac331974948911", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nhs-people-steve-brine-yougov-government-b2375063.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "People forced to pull out their own teeth amid NHS dental crisis, report finds", "lead": "The Health and Social Care Committee has published a report into NHS dental services, calling for drastic reforms.", "author": "Storm Newton", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:35:59.356830", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/00/5e1d2d57d065b6af23ae3fe44600f0b7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzQ4OTUw-2.72563908.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe \u201cdeeply harmful\u201d benefit cap must be scrapped, a children\u2019s charity has urged a decade after the measure was brought in.Some of the worst-affected families have less than \u00a350 to live on each week after paying their rent, the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) said in its analysis.The cap was introduced on April 15 2013, under the then-Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government which hailed it as a way of \u201crestoring fairness to the welfare state\u201d.\n\nThere is no rhyme or reason to the benefit cap and it is deeply harmful to children. All political leaders must commit to scrapping it before it pulls more children into its netAlison Garnham, CPAGIt sees the amount of benefits a household receives reduced to ensure claimants do not receive more than the cap limit.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveSir Iain Duncan Smith, who was work and pensions secretary at the time, said\u00a0the cap was a key part to ending the days of \u201cblank cheque benefits\u201d.But in its report, the CPAG brands Saturday an \u201cunhappy anniversary\u201d, saying \u201cchildren and families are being pushed into deep poverty\u201d.The charity stated: \u201cThe Government claims that the benefit cap is needed as a work incentive.\u201cHowever, the Government\u2019s own evaluation of the policy found that the vast majority of capped households do not move into work.\u201dA Government-commissioned evaluation, published in April, found that while the introduction of the cap saw some people move into paid work, move home or onto a benefit that exempted them, the vast majority, about 90%, of those affected did not and therefore just experienced a reduction in income.The introduction of the cap saw claimants spending less on their children and essentials such as heating and food, the report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said.The CPAG said its analysis suggested that in some areas of London, despite the cap being higher, a lone parent with three children has to cover all non-housing costs on \u00a344 per week.The group said that while \u201cnowhere fares as badly as London, it is clear that capped families all across the country can be left with very little after paying their housing costs\u201d, with its research showing a lone parent with three children was left with \u00a3106 after housing costs in Guildford, \u00a3147 in Brighton and Hove, and \u00a3170 in Oxford.The CPAG described the Government\u2019s rationale for the benefit cap as \u201cflawed\u201d and called on the Government to remove it, insisting this would \u201csubstantially reduce the depth of poverty for the 250,000 children currently living in households affected by the cap without harming work incentives\u201d.It added: \u201cRemoving the cap would only cost \u00a3300 million, 0.1% of the total amount spent on social security.\u201dAlison Garnham, CPAG chief executive, said: \u201cThe Government is at its most illogical with its benefit cap, the Department of Work and Pensions assesses families\u2019 needs, determines their entitlement, then slaps a flat-rate cap on that entitlement, denying families what the department itself says they need.\u201cSo needs don\u2019t get met, entitlements aren\u2019t paid and 250,000 children are trapped by the cap in deep poverty.\u201cNo family should have to live on \u00a344 a week.\u201cThere is no rhyme or reason to the benefit cap and it is deeply harmful to children.\u201cAll political leaders must commit to scrapping it before it pulls more children into its net.\u201dThe latest Government figures, published in June, showed that some 97,000 households across much of the UK that had their benefits capped included children.The total number of capped households increased by 3% in the latest quarter, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) statistics.This means there were 2,900 more households subject to the benefit cap across England, Scotland and Wales as of February 2023 compared with November 2022.Around 114,000 households had their benefits capped as of February 2023 and 86% of these included children.Some 70% of households that had their benefits capped are single-parent families, the DWP said.RecommendedWorkers \u2018left out of pocket\u2019 by 12-year freeze in mileage rates \u2013 reportKeegan hails degree-level apprenticeship for students seeking space sector jobsUsing robots

You\u2019ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet.\u201cUnfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.\u201dThe strike news comes after the US union and Hollywood studios failed to reach an agreement after more than four weeks of negotiations, with actors wanting better pay and increased safeguarding around AI rights among their demands.Last month Sag-Aftra members voted overwhelmingly to authorise a strike if a new contract with major studios, streamers and production companies could not be reached.Nearly 98% (97.91%) of the 65,000 members who cast votes were in favour, Sag-Aftra said.Among the productions in the UK that could be affected by the strike action is Deadpool 3, starring Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman who were both recently pictured suited up for filming.The third instalment of the popular antihero franchise is scheduled for release in May 2024 but the strike action could significantly impact production.Similarly, new film Wicked starring US singer Ariana Grande, actress Cynthia Erivo, Bridgerton star Jonathan Bailey and Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh, which is being shot in a village in Buckinghamshire could also be impacted, as the release date is currently set for November next year.Other UK productions include Beetlejuice 2 starring Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder and Jenna Ortega, vampire thriller The Radleys with Damian Lewis, and psychological thriller Speak No Evil with James McAvoy.Upcoming romantic comedy The Gorge with Anya Taylor-Joy, Miles Teller and Sigourney Weaver could also be affected, as well as action film Heads Of State with Idris Elba, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and John Cena.A number of TV series being filmed in the UK might also be impacted, including spy thriller The Day Of The Jackal starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne and period boxing drama A Thousand Blows with Stephen Graham.House Of The Dragon series two with Matt Smith and Emma D\u2019Arcy could also be affected, alongside the second series of The Sandman with Tom Sturridge and the fourth series of Slow Horses with Academy Award winner Gary Oldman.Announcing the strike at a press conference on Thursday, Sag-Aftra president Fran Drescher gave an impassioned speech in which she said it was a \u201cvery seminal hour\u201d for the union.\u201cThe gravity of this move is not lost on me \u2026 it\u2019s a very serious thing that impacts thousands if not millions of people.\u201cThis is a moment of history that is a moment of truth.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn imprisoned \u201cpredatory paedophile\u201d kickboxing coach has been sentenced to an extra four years behind bars.David Prosser, who was prosecuted for sexual offences against children in 1997, 2009 and 2019, was on Thursday sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court in London for sexually abusing five young boys under 16 between 1989 and 1996, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.The 64-year-old is already serving a 24-and-a-half year prison term for child sexual offences.Prosser was a kickboxing coach in the 1980s and 1990s and the five victims from the fresh case were students at his club.Melissa Garner, senior Crown prosecutor within the RASSO Unit in CPS London North, said: \u201cThis case demonstrates the CPS do not hesitate to prosecute perpetrators of sexual abuse where there is sufficient evidence regardless of how long ago the crimes were committed.\u201cIt takes a lot of courage to come forward as an adult to report what happened to you as child.\u201cThe victims have shown a great deal of strength and bravery in reporting these crimes and supporting the prosecution and I would like to thank them for their resilience.\u201cI sincerely hope that this sentence will now provide a sense that Prosser has been brought to justice for his crimes against them.\u201dIn September 2009, he was jailed for 21 years at the same court.At that time, he was known to have preyed on 20 boys and a girl aged nine to 13 during a 20-year reign of terror.Most were targeted after attending one of his makeshift clubs in pubs, community centres and schools.He would then single out a would-be victim, praise their skills, and then offer them one-to-one tuition at his home.Once he had them \u201caway from prying eyes\u201d he bribed them with alcohol, cash, cigarettes, drugs and gifts before abusing them.The latest sentencing comes after police said in 2009 that there were \u201ccertainly a lot of other victims out there\u201d, probably too traumatised to come forward.At that time, Prosser, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, admitted nine sexual offences and was found guilty at Isleworth Crown Court of a further 42.Apart from four rapes and two attempted rapes, there were 41 indecent assaults, three of indecency with a child, and one other serious sexual offence.All were committed between 1980 and 2000 in his home town and in London, the court heard.At the 2009 sentencing, Judge Jonathan Lowen told the father-of-two and former bouncer: \u201cYou were in fact a predatory paedophile who abused the trust placed in you at every opportunity.\u201cThis court has heard shocking accounts of lives spoilt, some even broken by illness by what you did for your own sexual gratification.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1413051ac331974948917", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/huw-edwards-bbc-presenter-lords-b2374971.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "BBC boss faces grilling in parliament over Huw Edwards claims", "lead": "<p>Tim Davie to face MPs next week over governance arrangements </p>", "author": "Jane Dalton", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 21:11:50", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:00.441765", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T21:11:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/05/15/hue-edwards.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Vicky Flind said her husband was in hospital suffering from serious mental-health issues.Father of five Mr Edwards, 61, who was suspended five days ago, is facing a string of claims, including contacting a 17-year-old and sending \u201cinappropriate messages\u201d to two BBC colleagues and a former member of staff.The former employee said they had never met the presenter but received messages from him on social media, \u201csome late at night and signed off with kisses\u201d, which they said they believed was an \u201cabuse of power\u201d.A current staffer said Mr Edwards sent them a private message on social media, commenting on their physical appearance, which gave them a \u201ccold shudder\u201d.The other BBC employee said: \u201cThere is a power dynamic that made them inappropriate.\u201dTwo of the three said there was \u201ca reluctance among junior staff to complain to managers about the conduct of high-profile colleagues in case it adversely affected their careers\u201d, Newsnight reported.Mr Edwards\u2019s long-time colleague Jon Sopel said the star newsreader was \u201cvery angry\u201d about the coverage the story has been given. Nor was he \u201coverly impressed\u201d with the broadcaster\u2019s own coverage, he said.Mr Sopel, who worked with Mr Edwards for decades before leaving the corporation last year, told ITV\u2019s\u00a0Good Morning Britain\u00a0that he was in touch with his ex-colleague before he went to hospital and that he was very angry.\u201cI think [he] felt very let down by what happened in\u00a0The Sun, furious with their coverage, [and] not overly impressed with the BBC\u2019s coverage, either.\u201dMr Sopel said coverage of the allegations \u201cgot ugly\u201d, adding: \u201cI think it became a feeding frenzy. I think it was a competition to see who could go further the fastest.\u201dThe Metropolitan Police has said no criminal offence has been committed by Mr Edwards and no further police action will be taken \u201cat this time\u201d, allowing the internal\u00a0BBC\u00a0investigation to resume.Other BBC colleagues have also expressed sympathy for the newsreader, who has been open about his history of depression.World affairs editor John Simpson tweeted: \u201cI feel so sorry for everyone involved in this: for the Edwards family, for the complainants, and for Huw himself.\u201cNo criminal offences were committed, so it\u2019s a purely personal tragedy for everyone involved.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UK has accused Russia of \u201ccynical brinkmanship\u201d over threats to collapse a deal that allows Ukraine grain to be exported to countries at risk of famine.The Black Sea Grain Initiative is a deal negotiated with Kyiv and Moscow by Turkey and the United Nations in July 2022 to ease a global food crisis, allowing agricultural produce from the wartorn nation\u2019s southern ports to be shipped out without fear of attack.It came with a separate agreement with Russia to facilitate shipments of its food and fertiliser, which have been exempted from Western sanctions regimes applied since the invasion started more than 500 days ago.The agreement has helped to lower global prices of food commodities such as wheat after they surged to record highs following Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s attack last year, with grain prices spiking from 750 US dollars (\u00a3570) per bushel pre-invasion to 1,350 (\u00a31,027) in March 2022.\n\nThe Russians are masters of this sort of brinkmanship and they absolutely don\u2019t care whether they are playing with human life or notWestern sourcesRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe deal has been extended every three months but Moscow has signalled that it does not intend to continue the accord when it comes up for renewal for a fourth time next week.Dame Barbara Woodward, the UK\u2019s permanent representative to the UN in New York, told reporters: \u201cThis is a particularly tough moment because we have seen at every renewal point, including this one, that the Russian approach is simply cynical brinkmanship.\u201cIn Istanbul, they slow roll the inspections of the grain ships, bringing down the amount of grain that goes out. Then, by signalling that they are considering refusing to renew the deal, they are also affecting global grain prices.\u201cRussia has claimed that they are withdrawing because their side of the deal on food and fertiliser export problems is not being upheld. That is patently untrue.\u201cThey are actually getting more grain and fertiliser out of Novorossiysk into export markets than they were before Putin launched his war against Ukraine.\u201dThe ambassador said that, should the deal collapse, cargo ships carrying grain out of Ukraine could be under threat of attack by the Russians.Speaking on Thursday, she said the initiative had led to 33 million tonnes of grain and food exports leaving Ukraine, with the majority going to areas of the globe struggling with nutrition supplies.\u201cAbout 61% of that has gone to low and middle income countries, or 65% if you look at wheat alone,\u201d Dame Barbara said.\u201cSo almost two-thirds is going to key markets where famine is a threat or food insecurity is a threat.\u201dSome of the grain released from Black Sea ports has been purchased by the World Food Programme and shipped into places such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan \u2014 countries that Dame Barbara described as being on UN \u201cfamine watch\u201d.Russia insists the agreement has not worked for its own exports, blaming Western sanctions for hindering financing and insurance.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cAt the moment, unfortunately, we don\u2019t see any particular grounds for extending this deal.\u201dAndrew Clark, head of the Foreign Office\u2019s Grain Cell unit, said negotiations with Moscow over previous renewals had often \u201cgone down to the wire\u201d.\u201cNonetheless, we are increasingly pessimistic about the progress of negotiations for this renewal,\u201d he said at a briefing.Western sources told the PA news agency that the Kremlin was acting \u201cmore recklessly\u201d ahead of\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s renewal deadline.\u201cEvery 120 days we go through this and the Russians are masters of this sort of brinkmanship and they absolutely don\u2019t care whether they are playing with human life or not,\u201d said a source.\u201cI think the mood music around this is different and darker this time than it was on the previous three renewals. Russia is playing much more recklessly in terms of brinkmanship.\u201dOne of the conditions the Kremlin has placed on signing up again is for a pipeline carrying ammonia, a key ingredient in fertiliser, between Tolyatti and Odesa to be repaired.But Dame Barbara said the pipeline damage means it \u201cwould be impossible to bring it on-stream\u201d and that the final stretch \u201cruns through territory which is now part of the front line\u201d.There are also understood to be concerns in the West that Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan might not have the same influence over Russia\u2019s leader as he exerted last summer during the brokering of the grain deal.Mr Putin reportedly was angered by Turkey after it freed commanders of the Ukrainian Azov Regiment that were being held under a prisoner swap deal.RecommendedCast of Oppenheimer walk out of UK premiere ahead of actors\u2019 strike announcementMichael Stone\u2019s murder convictions will not be referred to Court of AppealQueen confesses to keeping flask of tea in her official carAnkara had originally said the defenders of Mariupol would be kept in Turkey until the end of the war but a video released last week showed them being welcomed back to Ukraine by the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Alternatives to shipping grain out of Ukraine involve using rail routes and canals but both modes are more expensive and can handle less cargo volume than sea vessels."}, {"_id": "64b1413051ac331974948919", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cps-inner-london-crown-court-crown-prosecution-service-b2375000.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Former verger jailed for historic sexual assaults on teenage boys", "lead": "The two victims in question came forward in 2019 and 2020 respectively.", "author": "Harry Stedman", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 20:24:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:00.832390", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T20:24:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/21/13194758-c928f91d-c77d-4c76-a967-61e36830b145.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSuccessive governments have failed to grasp the scale of the threat posed by China, a report by an influential group of MPs has warned, stating that Chinese intelligence is \u201cprolifically and aggressively\u201d targeting the UK and its interests. In a wide-ranging report the Commons intelligence and security committee (ISC) is scathing about the government\u2019s \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d response to the threat of China, saying it had \u201cno strategy\u201d to tackle the problem.It sparked an immediate row with Rishi Sunak, who insisted that his government was not \u201ccomplacent\u201d about China. But MPs on the committee branded his response \u201cweak\u201d and accused him of trying to \u201cundermine the committee\u201d.The damning report raises concerns about China\u2019s \u201ccoercive\u201d influence in UK universities and Beijing\u2019s intention to become a \u201cpermanent and significant player\u201d in the civil nuclear energy industry.The ISC also warned that Beijing had been \u201cbuying up\u201d control and influence in Britain \u2013 condemning successive governments for accepting Chinese money with \u201cfew questions asked\u201d.The dossier, published on Thursday, also said the UK is of \u201csignificant interest to\u00a0China\u00a0when it comes to espionage and interference\u201d \u2013 placing Britain \u201cjust below\u00a0China\u2019s top priority targets\u201d around the world.RecommendedNadine Dorries reported for \u2018WhatsApping top civil servant to get on Truss honours list\u2019Ben Wallace accused of \u2018scolding\u2019 Ukraine over demands for weapons: \u2018We\u2019re not Amazon\u2019Fury over austerity threat as Hunt rules out extra money for public sector pay risesIt stated: \u201cChina\u2019s state intelligence apparatus \u2013 almost certainly the largest in the world with hundreds of thousands of civil intelligence officers ... targets the UK and its interests prolifically and aggressively, and presents a challenge for our agencies to cover.\u201dThe committee, chaired by Tory MP Sir Julian Lewis to scrutinise the work of the UK\u2019s intelligence agencies including MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, said China has the \u201cpotential to pose an existential threat to the liberal democratic system\u201d.The report said the government\u2019s approach for dealing with the threat posed by China is \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d \u2013 with the nation \u201cseverely handicapped\u201d by too much focus on short-term economics rather than long-term risks.The former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 sanctioned by Beijing \u2013 told The Independent that the report was \u201cabsolutely damning\u201d and described government policy as a \u201cshambolic mess\u201d.Rishi Sunak is under pressure to toughen stance on China  (PA Wire)\u201cIt is one of the most damning reports of government security failings that I have read in the 30 years I have been here,\u201d Sir Iain said. \u201cThe government has got to pay attention, because they are in a mess. Their China policy is a complete and shambolic mess.\u201d Senior Tory MP Bob Seely, a leading China hawk, told The Independent: \u201cIt basically substantiates everything China-sceptics have been saying. There is a battle of values in the 21st century, between open societies like our own and closed societies like China.\u201dResponding to the report, Mr Sunak insisted that his government was \u201cnot complacent\u201d and would \u201ccontinue adapting ... to meet the challenge that China presents\u201d.In a written statement the PM also said: \u201cWe are not complacent and we are keenly aware that there is more to do. Wherever\u00a0China\u2019s actions or intent threaten the national interest, we will continue to take swift action.\u201dCabinet minister Grant Shapps said China is \u201ca reality\u201d that Britain cannot \u201cwish away\u201d \u2013 saying Beijing was acting like the old British Empire.The energy secretary told reporters: \u201cThey do want to change the world, to operate under their world order. That is no surprise \u2013 we did that when we had an empire \u2026 I don\u2019t agree with a policy that says let\u2019s just pretend they are not there and exclude them.\u201dBut Mr Shapps also told Tory China hawks that \u201cwe do have to accept that this is the world as it is\u201d, adding that the UK should welcome investment from China but not let the country become \u201cpart of our critical national infrastructure\u201d. Sir Iain Duncan Smith says government policy is a \u2018shambolic mess\u2019  (PA Archive)Security minister Tom Tugendhat said: \u201cWe have woken up in time to make the right decisions to protect the British people and that is exactly what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d he said.Mr Sunak also claimed that the bulk of the committee\u2019s evidence was gathered before the government\u2019s integrated review of 2021 and \u201crefresh\u201d of defence and security policy this year.But Sir Julian insisted that the group of MPs had been \u201ccontinually in dialogue\u201d with various agencies and had received quarterly reports.Committee member Kevan Jones, a senior Labour MP, called Mr Sunak\u2019s response \u201cweak\u201d, and said the claim it was partly out of date showed \u201cthe depth to which the government is trying to again undermine the committee\u201d.The report raises particular concerns about Chinese influence in UK universities \u2013 saying the government has shown \u201cvery little interest\u201d in warnings from academics, despite being \u201crich feeding ground\u201d for Beijing.It warned that China exerts influence over institutions \u201cby leveraging fees and funding, over individual UK academics through inducements and intimidation, over Chinese students by monitoring and controlling, and over think thanks through coercion\u201d.The report also said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the government to be considering any Chinese involvement in the UK\u2019s civil nuclear industry. China General Nuclear last year exited the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project in Suffolk. But MPs said serious questions remain about future projects. \u201cThe government would be naive to assume that allowing Chinese companies to exert influence over the UK\u2019s civil nuclear and energy sectors is not ceding control to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d the report said.\u201cChina has been buying up and seeking to control or influence the UK\u2019s industry and energy sector and \u2013 until the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 Chinese money was readily accepted by HMG with few questions asked.\u201dThe report also warned that the West is \u201con a trajectory for the nightmare scenario where China steals blueprints, sets standards and builds products, exerting political and economic influence at every step\u201d.A senior Whitehall official told The Independent: \u201cThe serious problem we faced is that it took a long time for successive UK governments to accept what was going on. \u201cThere was, frankly, complacency \u2013 an unwillingness to face up to what was developing. We were falling out of step with our American allies, that became very clear. At the end there was serious alarm at what happened.\u201d In evidence to MPs, MI5 director general Ken McCallum said the challenge posed by China was \u201cthe central intelligence challenge for us across the next decade\u201d.Liz Truss has warned the Cold War with China has already begun  (PA)The Sunak government has characterised the growing influence of China as an \u201cepoch-defining challenge\u201d but some backbench China hawks \u2013 including former PM Liz Truss \u2013 have pushed for a much stronger stance to counter Beijing\u2019s influence.Mr Seely called for the government to publish an annual statement on our trade dependency on Beijing. \u201cChina is not going to go away. We need to not only understand the nature of the threat but also to act on it,\u201d he said.Sir Iain said: \u201cWe are becoming far too dependent on China economically, and therefore worried about upsetting them, such that the economics of the government trumps any security concerns. That is very dangerous.\u201dIt comes as Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it was \u201cvery concerning\u201d to hear reports that\u00a0China\u00a0sent a \u201cspy\u201d to infiltrate a Commons event involving Hong Kong campaigners.RecommendedRishi Sunak\u2019s \u00a332 Toby jug mocked for looking nothing like prime ministerBoris Johnson plans swimming pool at \u00a33.8m country manorMs Trevelyan said she could not comment on security matters of individuals, adding: \u201cThe security of the parliamentary estate is a matter for parliament and I wouldn\u2019t wish to try and answer that one on behalf of Mr Speaker.\u201dThe minister also said the government will formally protest to the Chinese ambassador over attempts by Hong Kong officials to \u201cintimidate and silence\u201d pro-democracy activists.Ms Trevelyan expressed concerns over the arrests of five individuals in the former British territory. \u201cAny attempt by any foreign power to intimidate, harass or harm individuals or communities in the UK will not be tolerated,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "64b1413151ac33197494891b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/levi-bellfield-michael-stone-dna-megan-kent-b2374948.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Michael Stone\u2019s murder convictions will not be referred to Court of Appeal", "lead": "The Criminal Cases Review Commission decided there are no grounds to refer Stone\u2019s convictions despite Levi Bellfield allegedly confessing.", "author": "Lucas Cumiskey", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:43:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:01.196418", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T18:43:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/19/62668425d70e4ebee27e52ef4cc2d7ceY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzU3OTE2-2.66847235.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

This is staggering, given that Levi Bellfield has confessed to the crime.\u201cThe CCRC have refused to interview any witnesses we\u2019ve put forward that corroborate Bellfield\u2019s confession \u2013 again, staggering.\u201cThe CCRC have effectively put the burden upon Michael Stone to prove that Bellfield has committed the crime. How on Earth could he ever do that?\u201cI\u2019ve got about five statements from Bellfield saying \u2018I murdered the Russells\u2019.\u201cI paraphrase, obviously, but these are signed statements by him saying that he is responsible for the murder, he even told the police in interview under caution that he murdered the Russells, and still they won\u2019t refer this matter to the Court of Appeal.\u201cSo what more can Bellfield do, what more can he possibly do to say he is responsible?\u201dHe said that the CCRC \u201cdon\u2019t believe\u201d Bellfield because \u201cin the past he has confessed to other crimes and the police don\u2019t believe him\u201d.The CCRC, which investigates cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said it had examined a \u201csubstantial number of documents relating to Mr Stone\u2019s case, including reports of alternative events and suspects, court transcripts and judgments, files from police forces and the Forensic Science Service\u201d.It added that \u201cinterviews took place with officers from several police forces, and forensic tests were carried out\u201d as part of the review.Bellfield was given a whole-life term for murdering Marsha McDonnell, 19, in 2003, murdering Amelie Delagrange, 22, and trying to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004.RecommendedQueen confesses to keeping flask of tea in her official carTanaiste dismisses idea of Irish stop-off for US cluster bombs for UkraineWimbledon set for more rain before blustery weekendHe was already serving his sentence when he went on trial for killing schoolgirl Milly, who was snatched from the street walking home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002.Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and killing the 13-year-old following a trial at the Old Bailey in 2011."}, {"_id": "64b1413151ac33197494891c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-public-sector-pay-strike-b2374620.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teachers poised to end strikes as Rishi Sunak unveils public sector pay rise \u2013 but doctors dig in", "lead": "<p>\u2018New wave of industrial action\u2019 predicted by unions over pay deal that means public cuts </p>", "author": "Kate Devlin and Jon Stone", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:40:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:01.366527", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T18:40:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/10/47605931813f2e62fa49e1b3661b54a7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzIzODIz-2.72973505.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTeachers are poised to end months of strikes after Rishi Sunak announced pay rises of up to 7 per cent for millions of public sector workers \u2013 but doctors show no sign of calling off their action.Teachers have been offered a 6.5 per cent rise and junior doctors 6 per cent, plus an additional \u00a31,250.But the British Medical Association (BMA) said the below-inflation offer was \u201cexactly why so many doctors (feel) they have no option but to take industrial action\u201d.As the longest walkout in NHS history got underway, the prime minister told all unions his offer was final and implored doctors to \u201cdo the right thing and know when to say yes\u201d.Downing Street said it would not borrow more money or increase taxes to fund the more than \u00a32bn needed this year to fund the pay rises.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersMr Sunak said more than \u00a31bn would be found by \u201csignificantly\u201d raising fees for migrants\u2019 visa applications and access to the NHS. But roughly the same amount will be found through \u201creprioritisation\u201d \u2013 raising the prospect of cuts. However, it is understood this will be cross-government, removing pressure on individual departments, like education, to find the money for pay rises for teachers. For her part, education secretary Gillian Keegan promised there would be no cuts to frontline education services. Ben Zaranko, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned that wage increases would eventually require cuts to public budgets; that prompted the BMA to accuse the government of making \u201cordinary people sicker and poorer\u201d.Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham said the pay offer would place staff under new pressure and predicted: \u201cI think we\u2019ll be seeing a new wave of industrial action.\u201dSpeaking at a press conference, Mr Sunak said he would accept the recommendations of all the government\u2019s independent pay review bodies; other rises include 7 per cent for police and prison officers, 6 per cent for dentists and NHS consultants, and 5 per cent for members of the armed forces.He admitted that his announcement would \u201ccost all of you as taxpayers more than we had budgeted for\u201d.He added: \u201cThat\u2019s why the decision has been difficult, and why it has taken time to decide the right course of action. I can confirm today that we are accepting the headline recommendations of the pay review bodies in full, but we will not fund them by borrowing more or increasing your taxes.\u201dMinisters are struggling to fight persistent high inflation at the same time as bringing to an end to industrial action by groups including doctors.RecommendedJunior doctors mount picket lines as five-day strike beginsSunak and Hunt meeting to finalise public sector pay dealsAll the UK strike dates confirmed for July 2023But BMA chair of council Professor Phil Banfield said the government \u201cmissed a huge opportunity to put a credible proposal on the table to end strikes\u201d.He said consultants \u201cremain willing to talk\u201d but the offer means \u201cthey are likely to continue to take industrial action\u201d.Treasury minister John Glen told the Commons the pay award for teachers \u201cwill be fully funded\u201d. As part of reprioritising budgets, the Ministry of Defence will recruit fewer civil servants. But unions said the decision to fund some of the rises by drawing on departmental budgets was the wrong approach.Mike Clancy, general secretary of civil service union Prospect, said: \u201cFor a prime minister and chancellor who came into office promising economic stability, the chaotic handling of this process will inspire little confidence in workers worried about their futures during the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\u201cThe fact that they are taking a knife to public services to pay for these pay rises signals that they have learned nothing from the austerity years.\u201dExperts warned the education and health budgets could still face cuts worth billions of pounds, even with frontline services protected.Mr Zaranko said: \u201cAt this point, we can\u2019t say with any certainty where the funding for higher pay rises will come from, although Rishi Sunak has made clear that it will not come from increased borrowing or higher taxes. In the short-term, some could come from under-spends in other parts of the budget, but that\u2019s not a permanent solution.\u201dHe said extra revenue through higher charges for visa applications and for non-British nationals using the NHS would be \u201cunlikely to cover all of the additional cost\u201d. Without rises in borrowing or tax the move will \u201ceventually require either a smaller public sector workforce, or cuts to some other aspect of public service budgets\u201d. Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, said that raising \u201calready eye-wateringly high\u201d visa fees risks seeing people fall \u201cdeeper into poverty and insecurity\u201d. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz, policy and public affairs manager, said migrants in the UK pay some of the highest costs in Europe. Mr Sunak has promised to halve inflation \u2013 to 5 per cent \u2013 this year. But the CPI inflation is running at 8.7 per cent, amid fears pay increases are fuelling a wage-price spiral. Official figures released just hours before the announcement also showed the UK economy contracted in May. Ministers hope the decision not to borrow to fund the pay rises will minimise the impact of the decision on inflation.

Jeremy Hunt is under pressure from Tory MPs to bring in tax cuts  (PA)In response, chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cThis highlights why it is important to deliver on the prime minister\u2019s priority to get debt falling and to control borrowing to avoid adding inflationary pressures and risk prolonging higher inflation.\u201cThat means taking difficult but responsible decisions on the public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary.\u201dShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \u201cThis report shows just how far we are falling behind our peers, how exposed our economy is, and again highlights that the government is failing to take action in areas like energy security to help get bills down.\u201cIt tells you all you need to know that the cost of government borrowing has risen faster in the UK than elsewhere in the G7 and faster than at any time in the last 40 years.\u201dThe\u00a0OBR\u00a0also said that long-term sickness will cost the state a further \u00a36.8bn this year as the number of Britons unable to work due to illness has surged after the pandemic.The forecaster said there was a 440,000 increase in those unable to work and a 490,000 rise in workers with ill health but in work claiming health-related benefits.The\u00a0OBR\u00a0added: \u201cWhile the disruption to and difficulties in accessing NHS services may have played a role in the worsening physical and mental health of the working-age population during this period, tackling the NHS waiting list alone is likely to make only a modest difference in the number of people out of work.\u201dRecommendedBoris Johnson says he can\u2019t remember his iPhone passcode.

In response, the Bank raised interest rates for a 13th consecutive time to 5 per cent, the highest level since 2008 - pilling further misery on mortgage holders across the country already living with the cost of living squeeze.A further base rate rise is expected when the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meets again on 3 August.Earlier this week mortgage costs surpassed the peak seen in the wake of Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-Budget last autumn, with the Bank warning homeowners to prepare for a \u201chuge\u201d fall in disposable income.The average homeowner is facing an increase in monthly mortgage payments of around \u00a3220 when renewing their fixed-rate deals, while another half a million households could see payments climb by \u00a3750 a month or more, the Bank said.Rising interest rates could cost one million borrowers an extra \u00a3500 a month by 2026.Responding to Thursday\u2019s GDP figures Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe Tories seem determined to march us down a path of low growth and economic insecurity.\u201cLabour will build a stronger economy so that working people get the future they deserve.\u201dJeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said inflation continues to act as a drag on the economy and insisted that the government\u2019s plan \u201cwill work\u201d.RecommendedAugust dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top upsJuly dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top upsWhy are wages rising and what does it mean for the economy?\u201cWhile an extra bank holiday had an impact on growth in May, high inflation remains a drag anchor on economic growth,\u201d he said.\"The best way to get growth going again and ease the pressure on families is to bring inflation down as quickly as possible.

It might be repossessions, it might be people selling up, it might be people having to work longer, but there\u2019s a real-life impact from the Tory mortgage bombshell,\u201d said Ms Reeves.Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves  (PA)Mr Hunt last month agreed a plan with Britain\u2019s big lenders to offer more flexibility over interest-only mortgage holidays and a 12-month repossession grace period.But Labour has urged the government to make support mandatory for all lenders rather than voluntary, warning that some homeowners were \u201cslipping through the net\u201d.Asked if Labour would back direct financial support for homeowners if the crisis gets worse, Ms Reeves ruled out the idea of government payments \u2013 warning that such moves could be inflationary.\u201cI\u2019m more keen on the targeted [cost of living] support and doing it through the banks. I think you\u2019re more likely to reach the people who need it most,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso we are in an inflation crisis, and this isn\u2019t the time to be having big spending exercises.\u201dJeremy Hunt has agreed forbearance deal with big banks  (PA)As well as the impact of rising mortgage rates, the opposition also hit out at Mr Sunak\u2019s government over the failure to set mandatory targets on housebuilding, warning that could lead to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people unable to afford a property.Labour pointed to analysis by consultants Lichfields which suggested that abandoning mandatory targets for housebuilding would lead to an increase in 580,000\u00a0people forced to \u201csofa surf\u201d by living with friends and family.Speaking to The Independent, Ms Nandy said mortgage rates meant that some renters were seeing their dream of home ownership \u201cgoing up in smoke\u201d.The shadow housing minister said: \u201cPeople aren\u2019t moving because there\u2019s nowhere to move to.

Government after a recommendation from the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body, is supported by the four teacher unions, the ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU.It is hoped that it will be enough to end the dispute over pay, with the unions balloting members with a recommendation to accept the pay offer.Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Mrs Keegan said: \u201cMy words to teachers is thank you for

amazing job and I have always known that and I\u2019ve always wanted to come to a fair settlement.\u201cObviously it\u2019s very difficult in the economic circumstances that we have with spikes in inflation, it\u2019s been quite difficult to do that, but we have worked with the unions and we have relied on the independent pay review bodies to look at all of these things in the round to make recommendations.\u201cI\u2019m really delighted that we\u2019re able to accept those recommendations.\u201cOne of the things that is key to teachers and to headteachers is to make sure it\u2019s funded so that they don\u2019t have to fund it out of their own budgets because they don\u2019t have enough spare things in their budget, so it would mean they\u2019d have to make very difficult decisions.\u201cThe most important thing which I understand I had to do was to make sure it was fully funded within school budgets, and I\u2019m delighted to say we\u2019ve managed to do that.\u201dSpeaking earlier on Thursday, the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said the pay offer to teachers and several other public sector professions was final and \u201cno amount of strikes will change our decision\u201d.But he also said that much of the money needed to pay the higher wages would have to come from government departments reprioritising their budgets.There will also be increases across a range of immigration and nationality routes, including visa fees, and the immigrant health surcharge, which it is hoped will raise around \u00a31 billion, but Mr Sunak ruled out borrowing as the Government attempts to cut inflation.But Mrs Keegan said that there would be no cuts to frontline education services, made possible by an agreement with the Treasury over unspent budgets.As well as \u00a3525 million of additional funding for schools in 2023-24 and a further \u00a3900 million in 2024-25, a hardship fund of up to \u00a340 million to support schools facing the greatest financial challenges will also be created.Explaining how that would be funded, Mrs Keegan said: \u201cWhat we have done is gone through pretty much everything we are doing in the department, and we have looked for where we anticipate we won\u2019t spend fully the budget.\u201cWhat usually happens is that would all go back to the Treasury, and we have an agreement, which is great, that the Treasury has allowed us to be more flexible, to be able to use that to shift that to teacher\u2019s pay.\n\nSo, no frontline implicationsGillian Keegan\u201cSo, no frontline implications.\u201cWe have also made sure we have protected the Special Educational Needs, building safety, all the things you would expect, (and) childcare (and) the new things we are rolling out.\u201dThe news comes a day after members of the NASUWT voted in favour of industrial action, which, if the new deal is rejected, would see teachers stage continuous action short of strike action starting in September.\n\nWhilst

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRTE\u2019s director-general is taking legal advice over his decision not to pay the most recent invoice for Ryan Tubridy\u2019s services to the organisation.The Irish national broadcaster has been embroiled in controversy for weeks after it announced that it had under-reported Tubridy\u2019s salary and failed to declare hundreds of thousands of euros in additional payments to him.Tubridy normally hosts a radio programme every weekday but has not been on air since the scandal emerged.The contractual position of the presenter is in dispute after he stepped down from his television duties earlier this year.\n\nThe legal advice is we need to find a proper negotiated way of paying himKevin BakhurstRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveRTE said it had suspended renegotiation of the contract down to radio-only services which were under way when the hidden payments were revealed.Kevin Bakhurst, who took up the position of director-general on Monday, told the Public Accounts Committee that Tubridy had not yet been paid for his most recent invoice for services.Asked what salary Tubridy is being paid, Mr Bakhurst said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to continue discussions with Mr Tubridy\u2019s agent about that because clearly he\u2019s not doing his TV programme any more.\u201cHe should be available for radio so we have not settled on exactly what he should be being paid at the moment but we\u2019ll be paying the appropriate amount once we\u2019ve confirmed.\u201dAsked if any salary was currently being paid to Tubridy, Mr Bakhurst said: \u201cAs of this week, no. Because we need to agree what the level of that is.\u201cAs I understand it, the latest invoice came in this week and my advice is we need to decide exactly what we\u2019re paying him because he\u2019s not doing his past duties any more, so that\u2019s currently a process going on.\u201dRTE has not announced whether Tubridy will return to the airwaves.The director-general said there will be a \u201cfair process\u201d around a decision on Ryan Tubridy\u2019s future at the broadcaster and this would happen \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d.Mr Bakhurst said he wants to speak to key members of radio staff and the interim leadership team before he makes the decision.He said he wants \u201cto be fair to Ryan\u201d but had acknowledged he had not spoken to the presenter.After the committee, he was asked by reporters if he was concerned that his decision not to pay the invoice would result in legal action.\u201cI\u2019m taking proper legal advice on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe legal advice is we need to find a proper negotiated way of paying him.\u201dEarlier at the committee, Mr Bakhurst was also asked about an offer from Tubridy to pay back two payments at the centre of the scandal.Tubridy, RTE and Renault entered into a tripartite agreement which involved the star presenter receiving payment for attending three events for the car manufacturer.However, in addition, RTE had verbally agreed to underwrite the deal in the event a commercial sponsor could not be found for subsequent years.The national broadcaster said Renault was not involved in the deal after year one.RTE executives previously explained that Renault paid Tubridy the first 75,000 euro payment, while two other 75,000 euro payments were from RTE, as it had underwritten the amounts due \u2013 in what TDs were previously told was a verbal-only agreement made on a Microsoft Teams meeting in May 2020.On Thursday, acting deputy director-general Adrian Lynch said it was RTE\u2019s position that the agreement was \u201ccentral\u201d to negotiations around Tubridy\u2019s wider contract with the broadcaster.Mr Lynch also challenged a claim from Tubridy\u2019s agent Noel Kelly that he did not know Renault had not renewed years two and three of the commercial deal.\u201cIn relation to some of the commentary made here on Tuesday last, RTE must clarify the proposal to underwrite these payments was central to the contractual negotiations between RTE and Mr Tubridy,\u201d he said.\u201cWe believe that the substantive contract would not have been signed without the additional commercial agreements or the underwriting.\u201cMoreover, we contend that the payments of 75,000 per year for year two and three of the commercial contract were pursued by NK Management (Mr Kelly\u2019s company) despite it knowing that the Renault contract was no longer in place.\u201dMr Kelly had also told parliamentary committees on Tuesday that six events were still owed to a commercial partner under the second and third year of the arrangement, while Tubridy said: \u201cIf that work is not called upon to be done, of course the money goes back.\u201dOn Thursday, Fianna Fail TD Paul McAuliffe asked RTE\u2019s leadership if it was credible that Mr Kelly believed Renault was making all the payments rather than the broadcaster.Mr Lynch said: \u201cThe commercial director was not asking Renault to deliver another six events. On that basis, I\u2019m not quite sure what he was thinking.\u201dMr Bakhurst said he would welcome a repayment of the two 75,000 euro payments from Tubridy and his agent, but added there is probably no legal obligation for them to do so.RecommendedRail operator pledges \u2018robust contingency plans\u2019 in event of strikeShapps says \u2018difficult decisions\u2019 to be made on pace of net zero commitmentsDJ Tim Westwood interviewed under police caution for third timeAsked by Alan Dillon TD if RTE would look to recoup the money, Mr Bakhurst said: \u201cYes.\u201dAdditionally, Mr Bakhurst and Mr Lynch said no legal papers have been served on the national broadcaster on behalf of Tubridy amid the payments scandal."}, {"_id": "64b1413351ac33197494892a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-rwanda-government-court-of-appeal-b2374723.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Government can appeal against Rwanda decision at Supreme Court", "lead": "The Home Office has been given the go-ahead to challenge a ruling that the policy is unlawful at the UK\u2019s highest court.", "author": "Jess Glass", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:30:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:03.785944", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T16:30:52+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/14/edf0af6c57f3edb9cca14dd21a28737cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzM5MTk1-2.72797757.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

We need innovative solutions, like our Migration Partnership, to stop the boats, break the business model of the people-smuggling gangs and prevent further loss of life in the Channel.\u201cI absolutely believe this policy is lawful and both the High Court and Court of Appeal have been unanimously clear that relocating asylum seekers to a safe third country can be done in line with the Refugee Convention.\u201cThe assurances we have had from Rwanda regarding asylum protections are also robust \u2013 and both the High Court and Lord Chief Justice found that the arrangements provided sufficient safeguards.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1413351ac33197494892b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/braverman-rwanda-illegal-migration-bill-appeal-b2374718.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Suella Braverman given permission to challenge Rwanda ruling at Supreme Court", "lead": "<p>Court of Appeal judges found Rwanda was not safe to receive asylum seekers from the UK </p>", "author": "Lizzie Dearden", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:17:25", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:03.963814", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T16:17:25+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/29/10/Migration_Britain_Rwanda_69737.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

clear evidence\u201d for the assertion.The Court of Appeal\u2019s 161-page ruling said Rwanda was not safe for the purpose of receiving asylum seekers, and that ministers were wrong to rely on unevidenced assurances that \u201cseriously deficient\u201d processes would be improved.A judge said the Home Office had ignored \u201cthe past and the present situation\u201d, and failed to probe the disappearance and death of migrants sent to Rwanda under a previous deal with Israel.The court said the government had responded to damning evidence from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) with \u201cnot very satisfactory\u201d statements that were \u201cdependent on information supplied by the government of Rwanda\u201d itself.The Lord Chief Justice concluded: \u201cUnless and until the deficiencies in its asylum processes are corrected, removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda will be unlawful.\u201dHe said the decision implied \u201cno view whatever about the political merits or otherwise of the Rwanda policy\u201d, which has already seen Kigali paid \u00a3140m and the government spend more than \u00a31m on legal costs.No flights can take off unless the government wins the case, sparking

I was not on a suicide mission.\u201dAsked how he felt after the alleged victim made allegations against him, the defendant said: \u201cI was crushed.\u201cI never thought that the (man) I know would (so many) years later stab me in the back.\u201dMr Gibbs then asked Spacey about the man he allegedly met in a theatre.Questioned on why he believed the allegations to be \u201cmadness\u201d, the actor said: \u201cIt never happened.\u201dAsked to respond to the man\u2019s allegations of \u201cvile comments\u201d, the Hollywood actor said: \u201cI never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn\u2019t and never have to anyone in my life.\u201dHe told the jury that he did not recognise the complainant \u201cat all\u201d when showed a photograph of him.Asked what he remembered of that day, Spacey said: \u201cNot a great deal.\u201dDetailing his account of what happened with the aspiring actor in the late 2000s, the Hollywood star told the jury that he \u201churriedly left\u201d after the pair shared an \u201cintimate moment\u201d.Spacey leaves Southwark Crown Court by car following court proceedings  (Getty)Spacey said: \u201cWe had had a sexual encounter after which I had gone to the bathroom and I came back from the bathroom and it was like\u2026 something had changed.\u201cThe person that I had this intimate moment with was suddenly awkward and fumbling\u2026 and I don\u2019t want to say ran out\u2026 but hurriedly left.

So, winning the peace is as vital and we need to be planning for that now.\u201cAnd they did that during the Second World War.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTwo teenagers who stabbed a 16-year-old to death in the street in a case of mistaken identity as he walked home from a friend\u2019s house have been jailed for life.Prabjeet Veadhesa and Sukhman Shergill, both 17, who can today be named for the first time after an application to lift reporting restrictions was granted by a judge, were involved in a brutal attack on Ronan Kanda as he walked back home from a friend\u2019s house where he had gone to buy a PlayStation controller in Wolverhampton last year.Ronan, who was not the intended victim of the attack but knew Veadhesa, of Cairn Drive in Walsall, and Shergill, of Bewley Road in Willenhall, was yards away from the home he shared with his parents and sister when he was set upon on Mount Road on the evening of June 29 2022.In what judge Mr Justice Choudhury called a \u201ctragic coincidence\u201d, Veadhesa and Shergill had seen Ronan leaving the house where their intended victim lived and assumed he was the boy they were looking for.The court heard Ronan was followed and stabbed twice with a \u201cvicious\u201d Ninja knife that Veadhesa had bought online, leaving him with a 20cm deep wound in his back and hip area and a 17cm deep wound in his chest.He was left to die in the street from the injuries inflicted by Veadhesa, who, along with Shergill, fled the scene after realising they had stabbed the wrong person and disposed of the weapons and the clothing they had been wearing.The court heard Veadhesa had previously given the intended victim some money but he had not paid it back, and the defendants had gone to find him and \u201cscare\u201d him into returning the cash.Earlier in the day on June 29 last year, Veadhesa had picked up the Ninja sword set and a large machete, which he had purchased online using a fake name, from a local Post Office.Although Shergill did not inflict any blows on Ronan, he was found to have acted in the joint enterprise of his murder and the pair were both found guilty by a jury after a five-week trial.At Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday, judge Mr Justice Choudhury branded it a \u201ccowardly attack\u201d as he jailed Veadhesa for a minimum of 18 years and Shergill for a minimum of 16 years.He said: The devastation caused by that cowardly attack, by stabbing him from behind, is hard to comprehend for his family.\u201cTheir loss is incalculable. Nothing I do or say today can relieve their pain.\u201dRonan\u2019s family and friends were in the courtroom wearing black \u2018Justice for Ronan\u2019 t-shirts to watch the sentencing.They sobbed as tributes were read out to the teenager from his father, sister and mother.Veadhesa and Shergill, both wearing black suits and ties, sat next to each other in the dock and listened to proceedings.They both looked at the floor as Pooja Kanda, Ronan\u2019s mother, gave a tearful tribute to her son. She said she has \u201cno desire to live anymore\u201d since her son was taken from her.She told the court: \u201cI\u2019m proud of the man my son was in the short life he lived.\u201cMy relationship with my son was so pure. He had so much love and respect. He was my strength, my world, he was the son every mother needs.\u201dAddressing her son\u2019s killers, Mrs Kanda said: \u201cThis mother will never forgive you. If there is a God, they will show you the real justice my son deserves.\u201dBefore their sentences were handed down prosecutor David Mason KC said there was a \u201csignificant degree\u201d of planning and premeditation. He said: \u201cThe weapons were ordered in advance.\u201cThey wore dark clothing to disguise their identities and both disposed of the weapons and the clothing after the killing.\u201cRonan was not the intended victim, which makes this case even more tragic. He was minding his own business, walking home from the house of his friend.\u201cIt was a brutal killing in broad daylight in front of members of the public.\u201cThere is no real evidence of any true remorse for what they did that night.\u201dDefending Veadhesa, Adam Morgan said his client had no previous convictions and was of good character.He said: \u201cHe is genuinely remorseful. It is something he will have to bear for the rest of his life.\u201dTimothy Hannam KC, defending Shergill, said his client should be treated more leniently than his accomplice.He said: \u201cThis was a joint enterprise offence but a distinction can be drawn between the two defendants.\u201cMr Veadhesa was the one who actually killed Ronan.

Mr Edwards was identifed by his wife on Wednesday night as the presenter facing allegations over payments for sexually explicit images, first reported in The Sun last week. After the Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police both said on Wednesday no criminal offence has been committed, the newspaper said it \u201chad no plans to publish further allegations\u201d and argued it was now a matter of the BBC to investigate. But the newspaper faces criticism for its handling of the scandal, including from one former senior member of staff. David Yelland, who edited The Sun from 1998 to 2003, tweeted on Wednesday evening: \u201cI wish @thehuwedwards well. The Sun inflicted terror on Huw despite no evidence of any criminal offence. This is no longer a BBC crisis, it is a crisis for the paper. Huw\u2019s privacy must now be respected.

Temperatures in parts of Mediterranean Europe were forecast to reach as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 F) starting Friday. The high-pressure system affecting the region, which crossed the Mediterranean from north Africa, has been named Cerberus after the three-headed dog in ancient Greek mythology who guarded the gates to the underworld. Officials in several countries were preparing emergency measures, cellphone alerts and adjustments to staffing levels. In Athens and other Greek cities, working hours were changed for the public sector and many businesses to avoid the midday heat, while air-conditioned areas were opened to the public. Cerberus is being tracked by the European Space Agency, which warned that the heat wave will also be felt in parts of northern Europe. \u201cItaly, Spain, France, Germany and Poland are all facing a major heat wave, with temperatures expected to climb to 48 degrees Celsius on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia - potentially the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Europe\u201d the agency said Thursday.People cool off from a water spray device amid high temperatures in Athen (EPA)Maryam Zakir-Hussain14 July 2023 09:081689319647UK weather: Met Office issues two yellow warnings as Britons brace for \u2018unusual\u2019 windsParts of the UK are under yellow weather warnings as \u201cunseasonal\u201d heavy gusts of winds are expected to bring disruptive weather over the weekend after days of heavy showers.The Met Office has issued two yellow warnings.The first is for heavy winds bringing \u201cpotential disruption\u201d to South Wales and southwest England, which starts on Friday morning and will last till evening 7pm.

But an update from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) on Thursday said that it will almost certainly strengthen throughout the year, with an 81 per cent chance it will peak with a \u201cmoderate to strong intensity\u201d between November and January. There is a one in five chance that this event will be of \u201chistoric\u201d strength, rivalling the major one experienced in 1997, Noaa said.Such an event would only increase the chances of more extreme heat as seen in Italy, Spain, Greece and parts of the US this week. The European Space Agency (ESA), whose satellites monitor land and sea temperatures, said July will be a torrid month, with the heatwave in the region \u2013 named Cerberus \u2013 pushing temperatures up towards 48C (118F).\"Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Poland are all facing a major heatwave with temperatures expected to climb to 48 Celsius on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, potentially the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Europe,\" it said.Tourists have been warned to take care in the extreme heat, with Cerberus has taken hold across many popular British family holiday hotspots in the Mediterranean. An Abta spokesman said: \"High temperatures around our favourite holiday hotspots are not uncommon at this time of year and it is always important that you take sensible precautions, particularly making sure that you and your family drink plenty of bottled water as it is extremely easy to become dehydrated, and always use plenty of high factor sun cream.RecommendedFlorida coral reefs risk \u2018nasty bleaching\u2019 as temperatures reach 90FHottest week on record \u2018worrying news for planet\u2019, say scientistsEarth sets its hottest day record for third time in a weekA runner jogs in Tempe, Arizona at sunrise (AP)\"Follow the example of local people and leave the beach at midday and early afternoon when the sun is at its most powerful, to have a long, leisurely alfresco lunch in the shade.\"Holidaymakers have the option of cooling off in the pool or sea and don't forget to put on the air conditioning or turn on the fan at night to ensure you have a cool, restful sleep.\"Rebekah Sherwin, an expert meteorologist from the Met Office's global forecasting team, said the \"heatwave conditions already occurring across much of southern Europe, northwest Africa and the Middle East are expected to continue through the coming week\".She added: \"Peak temperatures, which are around 10 to 15C higher than average, could reach the mid-40s degrees Celsius in parts of southern Europe and up to 50C in parts of North Africa.Ms Sherwin said that \"unusually high\" sea surface temperatures are also occurring across the region, with many parts of the Mediterranean seeing surface temperatures as high as 25 to 28C.Holidaymakers on Alimos beach, near Athens (Louiza Vradi/Reuters)Weather alerts were in place across Spain's Canary Islands, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, with the Greek authorities expecting temperatures to reach as high as 43C or 44C on Friday or Saturday.In Greece, the government has ordered the suspension of work between 12pm and 5pm local time in areas where the risk from heat is very high, and also requested remote work for private sector employees with health conditions.In the Balkans, beachgoers in the Croatian town of Nin smeared themselves in its medicinal local mud to protect themselves from the sun while 56 firefighters with 20 vehicles and three aircraft struggled to contain a brush fire near the Adriatic town of Sibenik.In Southwest US, searing conditions will build into Friday and throughout the weekend in the central and southern parts of California, where many residents should prepare for the hottest weather of the year, the US National Weather Service warned.Midday highs were mostly expected to be above 38C, and desert areas could reach nearly 49C, forecasters said.

Mr Rotta Loria then modeled how the ground and materials, like clay and limestone, deform when responding to heat\u201cChicago clay can contract when heated, like many other fine-grained soils,\u201d Mr Rotta Loria said. \u201cAs a result of temperature increases underground, many foundations downtown are undergoing unwanted settlement, slowly but continuously.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UK is one of the countries that will have to adapt the most radically to cool down buildings as climate change drives up the global average temperature, according to a new study.Like other countries in Northern Europe, such as Ireland, Switzerland and those in Scandinavia, homes were built to retain heat during cold winters.But rising temperatures because of climate change means more unwanted heat during the summer, which can be fatal for older and more vulnerable people.A new study, published in Nature Sustainability, has measured the increase in the number of \u201ccooling degree days\u201d (CDDs) for countries around the world if and when the Earth\u2019s average temperature increases from 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels.CDDs refer to how frequently and how far above a baseline of 18C (averaged over day and night) the temperature rises in a particular area, though this does not account for heatwaves or the effect of urban heat islands, where cities are hotter than their surroundings.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\n\nThese increases in relative change are going to mean that we need deployment of cooling adaptation measures at a fast speed and at a large scaleDr Nicole Miranda, University of OxfordThey are essentially a measure of how many times a country will need to implement cooling measures \u2013 in whatever form that takes \u2013 in order to return the indoor environment to a comfortable level.In the UK, the current mean average of CDDs is 36 and this is expected to rise to 69 if the global average temperature reaches 1.5C.If the global temperature rises still further to 2C, the number of average CDDs will be 89 \u2013 a rise of just under 30% from 1.5C, the study found.Only Ireland and Switzerland showed a higher relative increase.The researchers, from the University of Oxford, found that countries bordering the southern limit of the Sahara desert would see the greatest absolute number of CDDs, with the Central African Republic seeing an increase of more than 266 between a 1.5C and 2C global temperature rise.These countries will be more exposed to heat than any other which could stunt their socioeconomic growth, placing an unfair burden on people living there because they have contributed the least to global warming via greenhouse gas emissions, Dr Radhika Khosla said.She also said that \u201cno country is shielded from these impacts\u201d and that northern countries will also have to radically adapt.Dr Nicole Miranda, lead author of the study, said: \u201cIn the northern hemisphere in Europe, the buildings are made to keep heat in.\u201cAnd so we are at risk in the summertime, when heatwaves come or when higher temperatures in general come that we overheat our buildings.\u201cEven a small increase in the temperatures are actually showing a high relative change which can be very impactful and make these countries more vulnerable to needing more cooling.\u201cAnd of course, these increases in relative change are going to mean that we need deployment of cooling adaptation measures at a fast speed and at a large scale.\u201dThe scientists warned of a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d developing whereby people burn more fossil fuels to provide energy for cooling which then heats the climate still further, requiring more energy.It is predicted that the amount of energy needed just for cooling by 2050 will be equivalent to the combined 2016 electricity use of Japan, the United States and the European Union.Dr Miranda warned against not preparing for the rising heat and then later taking the easier option of installing air conditioning, which would be inefficient and only exacerbate the problem.Some of the solutions proposed for retrofitting buildings were to introduce ventilation measures that could also be closed off to keep in heat during winter and extendable shading covers such as awnings or more trees next to buildings to reflect the suns rays.The researchers also suggested having personal fans that cool only the space occupied by people and not entire rooms that are empty, or for buildings where air condition is necessary, installing a heat pump that can cool in summer and warm in winter.Philip Dunne MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, said: \u201cThe alarming findings of this important research from the University of Oxford should give us all pause for thought.RecommendedMPs and peers urge Prime

follow liveChile, France, Germany, Spain, New Zealand, Switzerland and Canada have already called for either a ban, moratorium or precautionary pause on deep sea mining, as have hundreds of scientists, and the Environment APPG wants the UK to join them.Businesses such as Google, BMW, Samsung, Volkswagen and Volvo have committed to excluding deep sea minerals from their supply chains.Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, who is chairman of the Environment APPG, said: \u201cDisturbing our ocean floor with intensive mining could destroy ecosystems and marine life that has yet to have even been discovered.\u201cIf we want the transition to net zero to be sustainable, we need to ensure that our sourcing of minerals and metals is done in a responsible and sustainable way.\u201cWe are only just learning about the importance of the ocean both as a carbon sink and maintaining life on earth.\u201dA Natural History Museum study recently found 200 unique species living in an area of particular interest to ocean miners in the Pacific, known as the Clarion-Clipperton zone.Researchers said around 90% of the species there are still unknown and they predict there could be as many as 6,000-8,000 yet to be described.The letter\u2019s signatories, which include Lord Randall of Uxbridge, Lord Teverson, Caroline Lucas and Rebecca Long-Bailey, said the mining industry is pushing hard to begin operations and that a legal loophole known as the \u201ctwo-year rule\u201d could see it get the go-ahead this year.The two-year rule refers to a treaty provision triggered by the Pacific island nation of Nauru, which obliged the International Seabed Authority, the regulator, to finalise and adopt regulations on deep sea mining within 24 months, which expired earlier this week.The UK, along with almost every other country on Earth, agreed to a new UN high seas treaty in March which aims to extend the amount of protected areas in the oceans to shield it from over-exploitation by activities such as mining, fishing and shipping.MPs and peers said a moratorium would follow the UK\u2019s precautionary approach to environmental harm, part of the Environment Act, which should be considered when a particular policy such as deep sea mining \u201ccould cause serious or irreversible damage to the environment\u201d.Mr Skidmore said: \u201cWe are at a moment \u2013 a fork in the road \u2013 where if we progress with deep sea mining, we will never be able to return.Recommended\u2018Unimpressive progress\u2019 made by fashion brands in climate crisis \u2013 reportScotland\u2019s \u2018biggest protest camp in a decade\u2019 sets up near oil refineryBreed cattle that emit less methane to reduce environmental impact \u2013 minister\u201cOur reserves of minerals and metals do not depend on harvesting the ocean floor.\u201cSo soon after signing an international treaty on protecting the oceans, deep sea mining would be a step backwards and undermine the progress that has been made.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1413a51ac33197494894e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/fashion-revolution-reporting-gucci-fenty-italian-b2374673.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Unimpressive progress\u2019 made by fashion brands in climate crisis \u2013 report", "lead": "The Fashion Transparency Index reveals the industry has a \u2018long way to go\u2019 on climate change and global inequality issues.", "author": "Katie Wright", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 12:36:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:10.629054", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T12:36:08+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/13/11163639-eb2e6678-1d26-48d8-8b4b-d3319c04c73d.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

With each passing game the left-handed Vondrousova made herself increasingly awkward to face, putting comical spin on her backhand slice, picking obscure angles and covering the court so nimbly that there was no safe space for Svitolina to find, no easy way out.The looping top-spin on Vondrousova\u2019s forehand refused to slot into Svitolina\u2019s hitting arc. Drop shots would appear unannounced. It made the Ukrainian wonder: do I stand on my heels to receive a deep, bouncing groundstroke, or stay on my toes to anticipate the drop?

For such a sound would be a fitting soundtrack to the presence and progression of the seven-time champion at this tournament.And while it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the looming threats to Djokovic\u2019s throne at Wimbledon this year, the reigning champion saw off another threat, another contender, another pretender to his crown on Tuesday, as the air of inevitability around the Serb intensified.With this 4-6 6-1 6-4 6-3 victory over seventh seed Andrey Rublev, Djokovic\u2019s 33rd straight win at Wimbledon, he set up a semi-final clash with eighth seed Jannik Sinner, and for all the youthful exuberance and precocious skill that the 21-year-old possesses, it is difficult not to see the Italian falling the same way as Rublev. Any one of Holger Rune, Daniil Medvedev, underdog Christopher Eubanks or world No 1 Carlos Alcaraz may then await, but their attributes risk disappearing under an asterisk \u2013 one stamped in the record books, above the section on Djokovic\u2019s prospective 24th major title.Report from Djokovic\u2019s win over Rublev: Djokovic, Rublev, and the moment a match became theatreThe seven-time champion fought from behind to win in four sets and reach the semi-finals Alex Pattle14 July 2023 12:371689334000Wimbledon 2023: Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s clinical brilliance sends warning to rivalsAfter more than an hour of Carlos Alcaraz and Holger Rune serving up a classic opening set of futuristic tennis, the door suddenly closed.

The stunning attacking play on both sides, creating fun points and absorbing rallies, seemed set to last until it reached the fading evening light on Centre Court.There was a shine to it, a gleaming freshness, until Alcaraz put his foot down. Staggeringly, after edging ahead by taking the first-set tiebreak, Alcaraz didn\u2019t make a single unforced error in the second set and only one in the third.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJannik Sinner is through to his first grand slam semi-final as he takes on Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon.The 21-year-old Italian is one of the game\u2019s rising stars and his first appearance in the last four of a slam is expected to be the first of many.Sinner led Djokovic by two sets in last year\u2019s Wimbledon quarter-final in what was an early example of his prodigious talent, despite the 23-time grand slam champion coming back to win the match in five.Followed everywhere he goes by the \u2018Carota Boys\u2019, Sinner is already one of the top players in the world and is set to form the sport\u2019s next great rivalry along with the 20-year-olds Carlos Alcaraz and Holger Rune.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic battles Jannik Sinner before Carlos Alcaraz returns to actionCarlos Alcaraz: Wimbledon 2023 semi-finalist in profileWimbledon order of play and Friday\u2019s scheduleWho is Jannik Sinner?A 21-year-old from Italy, Jannik Sinner\u2019s talent has always been obvious. He broke into the world\u2019s top 100 when he was just 18 years old and had reached the top-10 by the age of 20. Sinner has recorded strong results on all three surfaces, and by 2022 had already reached the quarter-finals of each of the four grand slams.Away from the tennis court, Sinner is a keen skier and could have turned professional had he not decided to focus on tennis. Sinner spent lots of his childhood on the slopes of the Italian Alps and was one of the best skiers in the country by the age of 12, before deciding to concentrate on tennis at the age of 13. Novak Djokovic was also a talented skier in his youth, while Sinner has also struck up a friendship with Lyndsey Vonn, the American Olympic gold medalist and one of the greatest downhill racers of all time.Sinner made his tennis breakthrough by reaching the Miami Open final in 2021, but in 2022 he emerged as one of the top players in the game. He led Djokovic by two sets in the Wimbledon quarter-finals and struck up a brilliant rivalry with Carlos Alcaraz, who became the youngest world No 1 in tennis history at the end of that year. Sinner and Alcaraz have already played each other six times, with the rivalry evenly matched at three wins each. Their US Open quarter-final last September, which Alcaraz won in five sets after five hours and 15 minutes, and after Sinner held match point, was one of the matches of the season.Sinner, though, has proved one of the few players in the world who can match Alcaraz\u2019s power from the baseline. Deceptively tall at 6\u20194\u201d and with a lanky frame, the Italian has one of the hardest forehands in the game and has been praised for the wonderful timing of his groundstrokes. Jannik Sinner plays Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon semi-finals  (Getty Images)Djokovic is an admirer and the pair regularly practice together. \u201cHe likes to play on quick surfaces because he likes to be aggressive and take control of the point,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cFrom both forehand and backhand, he\u2019s smashing the ball really, really hard, trying to be the one that is going to dictate the point from early on. I know his game well.\u201dSinner\u2019s development has been helped by the coach Darren Cahill, who joined the Italian\u2019s team in 2022. Cahill was Simona Halep\u2019s coach as she reached No 1 in the world and won two grand slam titles at the French Open and Wimbledon.The Italian is often supported by the \u2018Carota Boys\u2019 - a group of fans who turn up to his matches dressed as carrots. The group have their own Instagram page and were at Wimbledon to support the 21-year-old, although they have since left London.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf someone other than Marketa Vondrousova is to win Wimbledon on Saturday, they will first have to figure out how to win a tennis match while putting themselves through the mental and physical misery of playing Marketa Vondrousova.Each time Elina Svitolina returned to her seat she looked a little more perplexed, more drained. With each passing game the left-handed Vondrousova made herself increasingly awkward to face, putting comical spin on her backhand slice, picking obscure angles and covering the court so nimbly that there was no safe space for Svitolina to find, no easy way out.The looping top-spin on Vondrousova\u2019s forehand refused to slot into Svitolina\u2019s hitting arc. Drop shots would appear unannounced. It made the Ukrainian wonder: do I stand on my heels to receive a deep, bouncing groundstroke, or stay on my toes to anticipate the drop? It was a question she could never fully answer.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Vondrousova said after winning this semi-final 6-3 6-3, her first ever match on Centre Court. \u201cIt was so tough, she\u2019s such a fighter and such a great person. I was crazy nervous, the whole match. I was leading and she came back, so I needed to stay focused and try to fight for every game.\u201dIt is the culmination of a journey for the 24-year-old, back in a grand slam final for the first time since reaching the 2019 French Open final as a barely known teenager, where she lost to the then world No 1 Ashleigh Barty in straight sets. A string of injuries followed and progress stalled, and she watched last year\u2019s Wimbledon on TV wearing a cast. \u201cI never knew whether I could get to this level again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful to be healthy.\u201dRecommendedWho is in the Wimbledon final?Wimbledon 2023 finalist Marketa Vondrousova in profileOns Jabeur and a Centre Court love affair Marketa Vondrousova deploys some slice  (Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)Unseeded and inexperienced here \u2013 she had won only one match at Wimbledon before this tournament \u2013 she battled through back-to-back three set matches and won this one against the will of a demanding crowd. As a Czech, she represented a country that has supported Ukraine in its plight, but from the moment Svitolina first made the walk to the baseline under the Royal Box to serve, it was made abundantly clear that Centre Court would be behind every swing.The noise echoed against a closed roof. The environment here is different when the stadium transforms from amphitheatre to greenhouse: it traps humid air which slows down the ball and this suited Vondrousova, a player who grew up on slower clay courts. She raised her game dramatically once the Court One roof closed over her quarter-final match to knock out Jessica Pegula, and her performance here was better still.The match started evenly enough. Vondrousova broke to go up 3-2 and then saved a break point with one of her customary drop shots. But a moment later she missed a down-the-line winner with the court gaping and Svitolina broke back. Centre Court let out an urgent howl. Yet that was the beginning of the end. Vondrousova lifted every aspect of herself and rattled off the next seven games, clinching the first set 6-3 and taking charge of the second 4-0.Along the way she produced touches of magic, like a loose-wristed slap on the run that won a point late in the first set which the partisan crowd were already celebrating. Winners were retrieved from remote corners; delicate spinning lobs made Svitolina turn and watch as they dropped inside the baseline; deep shots followed by drop shots followed by point-killing winners made Svitolina yo-yo back and forth. \u201cShe played amazing, great tennis,\u201d Svitolina later said.RecommendedToday\u2019s Wimbledon\u2019s schedule as Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz in semi-finalsThe old me would have lost \u2013 Ons Jabeur ready to take the next step at WimbledonWimbledon day 11: Ons Jabeur and Marketa Vondrousova deny Ukraine-Belarus finalAnd so the loudest cheer of the afternoon was a moment of stubborn resistance, with the match all but done at 4-0 in the second set, when Svitolina scrapped and fought her way into the ascendancy on deuce before crushing a forehand winner with feeling. She went on to break Vondrousova\u2019s serve a moment later, and her streak of lost games was finally over.Two more followed and it was as if Svitolina had finally found a solution. But too much damage had already been done on the scoreboard, too much of a toll on her legs and her head. At 6-3 5-3, a long backhand confirmed her fate. The crowd rose once more as Svitolina picked up her bag, spun and waved, and then she was gone. Her run is over, but the riddle of Vondrousova goes on to the final unsolved."}, {"_id": "64b1413d51ac331974948954", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/tour-de-france-live-stage-13-today-b2375313.html", "primaryCategory": "Cycling", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France LIVE: Stage 13 updates and route tracker as Pogacar and Vingegaard duel", "lead": "<p>The fight for the yellow jersey is set for a crucial day as Tadej Pogacar prepares to attack Jonas Vingegaard on the Grand Colombier</p>", "author": "Lawrence Ostlere", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 12:14:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:13.376595", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T12:14:12+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/11/13/10739161.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseWho will win the Tour de France?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJamahal Hill has vacated the UFC light-heavyweight title after suffering an injury, which reportedly occurred during a basketball game between fighters.Hill, 32, won the vacant gold in January, outpointing Glover Teixeira in the veteran\u2019s native Brazil, but the American has decided to relinquish the belt without having made a single title defence. \u201cI have unfortunately suffered an injury,\u201d Hill said on his YouTube channel on Thursday (13 July). \u201cI\u2019ve ruptured my Achilles\u2019 [tendon]. It\u2019s just one of those things that happens. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough injury. It\u2019s one that will require surgery and will require time and rehab and things for me to be out for a while.\u201dPer MMA Fighting, Hill suffered the injury while playing a basketball game with fellow fighters before UFC 290 in Las Vegas last week. RecommendedWhy Fury vs Ngannou may tarnish the Gypsy King\u2019s legacy foreverMark Zuckerberg trains with UFC champions amid rumours of Elon Musk fightUFC\u2019s Josiah Harrell reacts as pre-fight test reveals brain diseaseExplaining his decision to vacate the title rather than allow the UFC to proceed with crowning an interim champion, Hill referenced his own route to the belt. In 2022, an injured Jiri Prochazka relinquished the title within several months of winning it. Jan Blachowicz and Magomed Ankalaev fought to a draw while competing for the vacant belt in December, and another title fight was organised just one month later \u2013 with Hill beating former champion Teixeira.\u201cI was given an opportunity,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI was given a blessing that came at the misfortune of someone else. Jiri Prochazka was the champion, he suffered an injury, as these things happen. He gave up the belt and allowed for others to not hold [up] the division \u2013 to keep the division moving forward, to keep entertaining, to make sure the people had a champion. I\u2019ll do the same.\u201cRight now, the biggest thing is focusing on my recovery, focusing on getting back to 100 per cent. I need to take some time to focus on my health and make sure that I\u2019m 100 per cent and I\u2019m the fighter that everybody knows who I am, and who I\u2019ve been since I\u2019ve stepped into this. In order to do that, I need to focus on healing and getting ready and rehabbing.\u201dFormer champion Blachowicz is scheduled to fight ex-middleweight title holder Alex Pereira on 29 July, with some fans suspecting that the bout will now become a contest for the vacant light-heavyweight strap. However, many have called for Prochazka to face Ankalaev for the vacant title.

There is no Roglic this year and so instead there is only a mouthwatering head-to-head fight between the two outstanding riders in the world right now, Vingegaard and Pogacar. While they fight it out for yellow, the peloton\u2019s sprinters will contest the points classification for the green jersey, with big points available at the end of flat stages as well as intermiedate markers during the stages. Wout van Aert is the reigning champion in this classification but Vingegaard\u2019s Jumbo-Visma teammate may need to focus his attention on helping the Dane secure the big prize.The famous polka dot jersey is worn by the King of the Mountains and there are KoM points to be won at the top of every categorised climb, with the biggest rewards saved for the hardest ascents. Vingegaard himself won this category last year, topping the polka dot standings by default after dominating in the high Alps and Pyrenees. The white jersey is reserved for the best young rider. Given the cut-off age is 26, and Pogacar is only 24, it would not be surprising if the man who has won the past three won the next two too.RecommendedTour de France TV channel, start time and how to watch todayTour de France highlights: Watch the best action from stage 12Tour de France LIVE: Stage 13 updates as Vingegaard and Pogacar duelSelect the \u2018stopwatch\u2019 tab to see the current standings in this year\u2019s Tour de France:"}, {"_id": "64b1413e51ac33197494895c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/tour-de-france-tv-channel-watch-today-b2375368.html", "primaryCategory": "Cycling", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France TV channel, start time and how to watch today", "lead": "<p>The 2023 Tour de France sees two-time champion Tadej Pogacar duel with reigning champion Jonas Vingegaard </p>", "author": "Lawrence Ostlere", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:30:56", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:14.812455", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T11:30:56+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/11/13/10739240.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

With only one more round of games following this weekend\u2019s action, the winner here is odds-on to lift the trophy.There is also the prospect of a potential quarter-final clash between the sides at the World Cup in France this autumn hanging over the contest and both teams will be keen to lay down a marker. The All Blacks are perhaps marginal favourites due to home advantage, especially with South Africa not having won in Auckland since 1937, but the Springboks have claimed victory in two of the last three fixtures between the sides, while their previous two visits to New Zealand ended in a win and a draw.Eben Etzebeth sadly lost his father, Harry, to cancer this week but the hulking second-rower has decided to play in the match and captains the Springboks, undoubtedly keen to do his late dad proud.Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the match at the Go Media Stadium in Auckland:RecommendedWhen is the Rugby Championship?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAmid a backdrop of mutiny and exile, it is a testament to the talent of this Spain team that La Roja remain one of the favourites for the World Cup despite a chaotic year under the management of Jorge Vilda. Spain looked on the brink of implosion in September when 15 players made themselves unavailable for selection, saying that the environment of the national team was having a negative impact on their mental health and emotional wellbeing. Nine months later, Vilda will still be able to name a formidable side at the World Cup.It comes after the star of the Spain team, the two-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Alexia Putellas, returned from a year-long injury absence and three members of the protesting 15, Aitana Bonmati, Mariona Caldentey and Ona Batlle, ended their exile and made themselves available for selection. Whether the returning players have secured the changes they called for off the pitch remains unclear, but the fact the other 12 remain out, including key members of the team in Sandra Panos, Mapi Leon and Patri Guijarro, suggests there is still a long way to go.Throughout the turmoil, Vilda maintained the backing of the Spanish Football Federation but there will be significant pressure on his shoulders if Spain underperform again after their last-eight exit at the Euros. Since the last World Cup, Spain has become home to the new dominant force in women\u2019s club football thanks to Barcelona and, with Putellas and Bonmati back, are leading the world in their development of technical players. They will certainly be expected to top a group that includes Japan, World Cup winners in 2011 and runners-up in 2015, and Costa Rica.Alexia Putellas returns for Spain after missing the Euros last summer  (Getty Images)Zambia, who will be making their first appearance at a World Cup, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, are an intriguing side to watch and have been mentioned as possible dark horses. An eye-catching warm-up win against Germany showed everyone how dangerous they could be, with forwards Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji tearing Germany apart on the counter-attack. Japan, who come into the World Cup in transition, could be vulnerable in Group C.RecommendedWho are the threats to the Lionesses at the Women\u2019s World Cup?The inspiration behind Australia\u2019s shot at home World Cup gloryWomen\u2019s World Cup history hangs over co-hosts New ZealandSpainGroup fixtures (all times BST)Friday 21 July: Spain vs Costa Rica (08:30, Wellington Regional Stadium)Wednesday 26 July: Spain vs Zambia (08:30, Eden Park)Monday 31 July: Japan vs Spain (08:00, Wellington Regional Stadium)Confirmed squadGoalkeepers: Cata Coll (Barcelona), Misa Rodriguez (Real Madrid), Enith Salon (Valencia)Defenders: Ivana Andres (Real Madrid), Ona Batlle (Manchester United), Olga Carmona (Real Madrid), Laia Codina (Barcelona), Rocio Galvez (Real Madrid), Oihane Hernandez (Athletic Club), Irene Paredes (Barcelona)Midfielders: Teresa Abelleira (Real Madrid), Aitana Bonmati (Barceona), Irene Guerrero (Levante), Jennifer Hermoso (Pachuca), Maria Perez (Barcelona), Alexia Putellas (Barcelona), Claudia Zornoza (Real Madrid)Forwards: Mariona Caldentey (Barcelona), Athenea del Castillo (Real Madrid), Esther Gonzalez (Real Madrid), Eva Navarro (Atletico Madrid), Salma Paralluelo (Barcelona), Alba Redondo (Levante)Key playerAitana Bonmati. When an ACL injury robbed two-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Alexia Putellas of the chance to play at the Euros last summer and then took away almost all of the following season, it handed her international and club team-mate Bonmati the opportunity to play further forward for Barcelona. How she took it. Arguably the best player in the world over the past year, the midfielder is technically flawless and has unlocked the ability to contribute even more goals and assists. Although Putellas is now back and will likely grab the attention, Bonmati deserves her own recognition.Bonmati has shined for Barcelona this season  (Getty Images)The coachJorge Vilda is perhaps the most divisive head coach at the World Cup, and that\u2019s not just among Spain\u2019s pool of players. Vilda faced criticism for his team selections last summer as Spain finished runner-up to Germany in the group stages of the Euros and were then knocked out by England in the quarter-finals. He survived with his job, and did so again as players walked out on the team. He is theoretically under pressure again with Spain\u2019s golden generation expected to compete for the title, but he also has the backing of the federation.World Cup historySpain are appearing in their third consecutive World Cup having only made their debut in 2015. Considered to be favourites before the Euros last summer, their last-16 exit to England was a disappointment and they also fell at the first hurdle in the knockout stages when they lost to eventual champions the USA four years ago. There is pressure on Spain to deliver this time.JapanGroup fixtures (all times BST)Saturday 22 July: Zambia vs Japan (08:00, Waikato Stadium)Wednesday 26 July: Japan vs Costa Rica (06:00 local time, Dunedin Stadium)Monday 31 July: Japan vs Spain (08:00, Wellington Regional Stadium)One to watchYui Hasegawa. Signed by Manchester City last summer to replace England\u2019s Keira Walsh, the 26-year-old impressed with her class and composure on the ball and tenacity in midfield, finishing the season as one of the top performers in the Women\u2019s Super League. Japan will rely on Hasegawa to set their tempo from the middle of the pitch.Yui Hasegawa leads the next generation of Japan talent  (Getty Images)The coachFutoshi Ikeda took charge of Japan following the 2021 Olympics having guided the country to victory in the Under-20 World Cup in 2018. With Japan coming into the World Cup in translation and with one of the youngest squads at the tournament - with just one player over 30 - Ikeda is still trying to find the right balance in his team.What are their chances?Champions in 2011 and runners-up in 2015, recent history dictates that Japan will be expected to be contenders once again in Australia and New Zealand. But if the Nadeshiko underperformed in 2019, exiting in the last-16, that rather represents where Japan could reasonably expect to finish in 2023, as well. A four-game losing run between November and February to England, Spain, Brazil and the United States suggests they are much still a work in progress.ZambiaGroup fixtures (all times BST)Saturday 22 July: Zambia vs Japan (08:00, Waikato Stadium)Wednesday 26 July: Spain vs Zambia (08:30, Eden Park)Monday 31 July: Costa Rica vs Zambia (08:00 local time, Waikato Stadium)One to watchBarbra Banda made history at the 2021 Olympics when she became the first player to score back-to-back hat-tricks at the Games, but the Zambia striker was prevented from appearing in the Africa Cup of Nations the following year after her country said she had failed a gender eligibility test. The Zambian FA said four players, including Banda, had natural testosterone levels that exceeded tournament regulations. The 23-year-old returned to the national team last September, however, and Fifa has since confirmed that she is eligible for the World Cup. Banda is captain of the Zambia side and is key to their chances of making it out of the group, as her stunning two-goal display against Germany showed.Zambia celebrate after their 3-2 win at Germany  (Getty Images)The coachUnder Bruce Mwape, Zambia were involved in a 10-3 defeat to the Netherlands, 4-4 draw with China and 1-0 loss to Brazil, so goals at both ends of the pitch could certainly be expected with the Copper Queens, but the manager remains extremely confident. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s others thinking we\u2019ll go there as underdogs,\u201d he told Fifa. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we are going to compete.\u201dWhat are their chances?This will be the first time Zambia have played at the World Cup, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, and harnessing their considerable attacking firepower will be key if they are to shock either Spain or Japan and reach the knockout stages. With their leader on the pitch Barbra Banda joined by Racheal Kundananji, who scored 25 goals in Spain\u2019s top flight last season, they certainly have a chance, but the concern is whether they have what it takes defensively.Costa RicaGroup fixtures (all times BST)Friday 21 July: Spain vs Costa Rica (08:30, Wellington Regional Stadium)Wednesday 26 July: Japan vs Costa Rica (06:00 local time, Dunedin Stadium)Monday 31 July: Costa Rica vs Zambia (08:00 local time, Waikato Stadium)Confirmed squadGoalkeepers: Priscila Tapia (Saprissa FF), Daniela Solera (Sporting FC), Genesis Perez (University of Central Florida)Defenders: Mariana Benavides (Saprissa FF), Maria Paula Elizondo (Saprissa FF), Valeria del Campo (Monterrey), Fabiola Villalobos (Alajuelense), Maria Paula Coto (Alajuelense), Gabriela Guillen (Alajuelense), Carol Sanchez (Sporting FC)Midfielders: Katherine Alvarado (Saprissa FF), Mariela Campos (Saprissa FF), Gloriana Villalobos (Saprissa FF), Emilie Valenciano (Libre), Melissa Herrera (Bordeaux), Cristin Granados (Sporting FC), Alexandra Pinell (Alajuelense), Raquel Rodriguez (Portland Thorns), Emilie Valenciano (LDA)Forwards: Catalina Estrada (Saprissa FF), Priscila Chinchilla (Libre), Carolina Venegas (Libre), Sofia Varela (Libre), Maria Paula Salas (Monterrey)Key playerRaquel Rodriguez is Costa Rica\u2019s record scorer with 55 goals, including the country\u2019s first at a World Cup on their only previous appearance in 2015.

Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. If he can increase his activity, Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if a long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford comes to pass and Spence can win...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight.

He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori, before suffering a shock TKO loss to Dricus Du Plessis in July.9. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim UFC lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally. He will fight Justin Gaethje, whom he stopped in 2018, in a rematch in July as the pair vie for the \u2018BMF\u2019 belt.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but all have come against former world champions, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around. An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Islam Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (26-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski has defended and retained the featherweight title five times  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro losses have come against a welterweight champion and a lightweight champion. All of the Australian\u2019s recent fights have pitted him against top names. In 2022, Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that status \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as victories over Chad Mendes, Brian Ortega, and Yair Rodriguez.RecommendedFrancis Ngannou to earn more in Tyson Fury fight than entire UFC career, says repUFC may help Conor McGregor by changing Ultimate Fighter format amid losing streakAnthony Joshua offers \u2018three\u2019 reactions to Fury vs Ngannou fight Volkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage. He then returned to featherweight to stop interim champion Rodriguez in July.Volkanovski also keeps the returning Jon Jones at bay, for now..."}, {"_id": "64b1413f51ac331974948962", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/womens-world-cup-group-d-fixtures-squads-b2375083.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who are the threats to the Lionesses at the Women\u2019s World Cup?", "lead": "<p><strong>Group D preview: </strong>Sarina Wiegman\u2019s side will face Denmark, China and Haiti as they go in search of World Cup glory </p>", "author": "Jamie Braidwood", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:13:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:15.884520", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T11:13:45+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/12/GettyImages-1514579982.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter bringing football home, England head \u2018Down Under\u2019 looking to add the Women\u2019s World Cup to last summer\u2019s Euros glory. The Lionesses won their first major prize with their game-changing victory on home soil but Sarina Wiegman\u2019s side are focused on a new goal as they head to Australia as one of the favourites for the tournament.England will face a completely different challenge to what they experienced at the Euros. Not only are they away from home and on the other side of the world, but Wiegman\u2019s team has gone through significant change in the last 12 months, much of it enforced. Injuries have been the hot topic ahead of the World Cup with Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby all ruled out, but those who remain have the experience of winning a major tournament and that should still give England confidence ahead of what is still a wide-open World Cup.Some key questions remain, however, particularly when it comes to depth. England look strong in some areas but appear to be lacking in others, particularly in defence with Williamson a key absentee. There is real talent among the wide forwards and significant competition for the starting striker role, but it does also give the sense that Wiegman is yet to land upon her starting eleven for the World Cup. That was crucial at the Euros, where Wiegman named the same starting line-up for England\u2019s six matches. (The FA via Getty Images)Denmark, China and Haiti complete Group D and will look to cause an upset, with some serious threats looming ahead of the knockout stages. Although the Lionesses backed up their Euros win with a win against the United States in September and victory in the inaugural women\u2019s Finalissima against Brazil, Australia ended England\u2019s 30-game unbeaten run in April and could be their opponents in the last-16.RecommendedLionesses bonus row could drag on until after World CupWomen\u2019s World Cup history hangs over co-hosts New ZealandThe inspiration behind Australia\u2019s shot at home World Cup gloryEnglandGroup fixtures (all times BST)Saturday 22 July 2023: England vs Haiti (10:30, Brisbane Stadium)Friday 28 July 2023: England vs Denmark (09:30, Sydney Football Stadium)Tuesday 1 August: China vs England (12:00, Adelaide)Confirmed squadGoalkeepers: Mary Earps (Manchester United), Hannah Hampton (Aston Villa), Ellie Roebuck (Manchester City)Defenders: Millie Bright (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Jess Carter (Chelsea), Niamh Charles (Chelsea), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Esme Morgan (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal)Midfielders: Laura Coombs (Manchester City), Jordan Nobbs (Aston Villa), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Ella Toone (Manchester United), Keira Walsh (Barcelona), Katie Zelem (Manchester United)Forwards: Rachel Daly (Aston Villa), Bethany England (Tottenham Hotspur), Lauren Hemp, (Manchester City), Lauren James (Chelsea), Chloe Kelly (Manchester City), Katie Robinson (Brighton & Hove Albion), Alessia Russo (Manchester United)Key playerKeira Walsh was the player of the match in the Euros final and remains England\u2019s most important player with her ability to set the team\u2019s pace and tempo in midfield.

After winning the Euros in 2017 and reaching the World Cup final in 2019 with her native Netherlands, and then winning the Euros again with England in 2022, Sarina Wiegman has every right to make that claim. The World Cup in 2023 could be her greatest challenge but Wiegman, with her supreme communication, tactical observation, and player management skills, can rise to it.What are their chances?The Lionesses were declared favourites for the World Cup after winning the Euros and beating the world champions United States in September. There is less overt optimism now, due to England\u2019s injuries and the quality of the other main contenders, but the Lionesses still remain of the strongest teams at the tournament and have been building towards this moment where they can arrive at a World Cup and act like one of the favourites.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAnthony Joshua against Dillian Whyte is a fight with tremendous risk, great rewards and the type of rivalry that creates history. In 2009, above a pub, Whyte beat Joshua when the pair were raw amateurs. In 2015, Joshua got revenge with a brutal stoppage in Round 7. It was a great event, a genuine and rare fight to determine who moved on and moved on fast. They were both unbeaten and it was a big risk for both. After the fight, Whyte was angry and Joshua won the heavyweight world title in his next fight. It is a harsh and unforgiving world at the top of the heavyweights; Whyte had to wait seven years for his chance at the gold, ultimately losing to Tyson Fury. In that time, Joshua has had 12 heavyweight title fights.In many ways, this third fight between the Britons has been inevitable since the finish that night at the O2. Joshua has dominated British boxing since then, Whyte has been in his great rival\u2019s shadow. It\u2019s harsh, but true. \u201cI still have never had the respect I deserve,\u201d said Whyte on Monday, at the press conference to officially announce the fight. It will be on 12 August, back at the O2 and \u2013 like the first fight \u2013 it has sold out. RecommendedAnthony Joshua vs Dillian Whyte rematch made official \u2013\u00a0eight years after last clashTyson Fury reacts to footage of Anthony Joshua using mattress as heavy bagAnthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder\u2019s teams meet in London for talks over Saudi Arabia fight\u201cWe could have gone outside, no problem,\u201d confirmed Eddie Hearn, the promoter both then and now, referencing the potential to stage the bout in a stadium. \u201cThis is the decider. It has everything, and all talk of world title fights and massive fights for big money mean nothing. They both have to win.\u201d Joshua does have a big fight scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia against former champion Deontay Wilder. It is meant to be worth close to $100million, and it would be in jeopardy if he lost. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about anything other than Dillian,\u201d said Joshua, who flew to London for less than 28 hours from his training base in Dallas. \u201cI just have to do what I do. It\u2019s just another fight. Dillian is a real fighter, he took the fight; others have just been talking.\u201dWhyte also flew in from America for just a day and is going straight back to Florida. The pair refused to be baited at the oddly good-natured press conference, but that calm is deceptive. \u201cThis is a must-win fight for both,\u201d Hearn stressed.The heavyweight division with its factions, its millions and its endless riddles is seldom easy to solve. However, every now and again a fight with spite, meaning and relevance is made. Whyte\u2019s chance at redemption against Joshua is one of those fun fights: Joshua\u2019s chance at losing so much is also a very real possibility. It makes for a very good fight.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf you\u2019ve been a distant observer of Tyson Fury\u2019s efforts to secure a fight before the end of the year, you can be forgiven for any excitement over his promoter\u2019s claim last week that a \u2018game-changer\u2019 of a bout was incoming. You can even be forgiven for taking the word \u2018efforts\u2019 at face value. If you\u2019ve been following the saga closely, however, you\u2019ll have felt the plummet of your stomach, knowing full well what was coming: Fury vs Ngannou.This \u2018game-changer\u2019, promised by Frank Warren, may yet mean \u2018game over\u2019 for Fury\u2019s legacy. The WBC heavyweight champion will travel to Saudi Arabia in October, not to take on his counterpart Oleksandr Usyk \u2013 who is unbeaten like the Briton and holds the unified belts \u2013 but rather to box a mixed martial artist. It is a vacuous fight in a vacuous space. Fury, 34, will not bid to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion of the world in two decades, but rather will box an MMA star who is 36 years old, has not fought in 18 months, and who has struggled with a significant injury in recent times. They will tell you that the former UFC heavyweight champion is the greatest power-puncher that his sport has ever seen, and they will be right. They will use that to sell you on the prospect of the Cameroonian somehow stunning Fury, but even if that were to happen \u2013 and there is plenty of evidence against that scenario by this point \u2013 it is to intentionally skirt the point altogether.RecommendedTyson Fury to box ex-UFC champion Francis Ngannou in seismic crossover fight\u2018Nonsense\u2019: Anthony Joshua reacts to Fury vs Ngannou fight announcementMark Zuckerberg trains with UFC champions amid rumours of Elon Musk fightFury is acknowledged as the best heavyweight of his generation, and in a sense he is lucky that this appraisal has endured despite his recent track record. While his trilogy with Deontay Wilder will rightfully go down in history, and his subsequent title defence against mandatory challenger Dillian Whyte was a more serious task than Fury made it look (and full credit to him for that), his December clash with Derek Chisora would be deemed a farce if such a noun didn\u2019t leave us without a word to describe his \u2018contest\u2019 with Ngannou.It is a match-up that validates scepticism around Fury and the legitimacy of his claims that he was let down by Usyk and Joshua, two boxers who accepted Fury\u2019s well-publicised demands \u2013 including a 75-25 purse split with the Ukrainian. And while it validates scepticism around Fury, it does at least contradict criticism of Ngannou. Ngannou during his 20-second knockout win against Jairzinho Rozenstruik  (Getty)The \u201cPredator\u201d has a remarkable backstory. It begins with Ngannou working in a sand quarry in Cameroon at the age of 12, and it takes in a year-long episode in which Moroccan authorities thwarted his attempts to reach Spain on six occasions. When he ultimately reached Europe, Ngannou was briefly jailed \u2013 not for the first time in his endeavour. The heavyweight eventually became the judge, jury and executioner of life\u2019s injustices against him, building a stunning MMA career that led to the UFC heavyweight title (but not without Ngannou coming up short in his first bid to win the gold). As of today, his professional record stands at 17-3, with 12 of his wins having come via knockout. Of those KO victories, eight took place in Round 1 \u2013 with three having been achieved inside the first minute.Ngannou was accused of \u2018fumbling the bag\u2019 in January, when he turned down a UFC contract renewal that would have seen him become the highest-paid heavyweight in the promotion\u2019s history. That does not mean what you may think, given the company\u2019s track record of underpaying their fighters, but even Ngannou\u2019s lucrative PFL deal did not deter his critics. Now, however, those critics have little to say; Ngannou\u2019s decision to back himself and leave the biggest MMA promotion in the world has paid off. Emphasis on paid. He has freedom with the PFL, and he will have finances from fighting Fury that will last a lifetime. Ngannou, therefore, deserves credit, and he is perhaps the only character in this combat-sports comedy who does. His injuries, age and inactivity warrant criticism of Fury for taking him as an opponent, but they warrant praise of Ngannou, who has made the unimaginable best of a difficult situation.Warren, naturally, has defended this pairing. \u201cThese are two guys who are the best in their relative sports,\u201d he told Talksport, in what became an animated debate. \u201cFury has been offered a serious lot of money to get involved in a unique opportunity. And it is not an exhibition; it is a fight, it is going to be a shootout.\u201d No fighter will ever be criticised in these pages for getting paid their worth, but Fury did not need to fight Ngannou to do that. Saudi Arabia has been desperate to pair the \u201cGypsy King\u201d with Joshua or Usyk, and either contest would have secured Fury an even greater payday than this one, while also serving as a more legitimate bout. Frank Warren (right) promotes Fury and has defended the Ngannou fight  (Getty Images)Joshua, for his part, told iFL TV, \u201cOne: I shouldn\u2019t give a f***, it\u2019s none of my business. Two: Why? [Fury] should\u2019ve been fighting for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world. Straight up, that\u2019s nonsense, his fault. Three: If we\u2019re acknowledging his business, good luck to the man. Do your thing.\u201d In his second and third points, the former champion is essentially aligned with this column.Joshua, for any criticism of his ability, has never avoided a challenge \u2013 no matter what Fury may claim. Despite losses in recent years, Joshua was willing to box Fury within a matter of weeks of his second straight defeat by Usyk. \u201cAJ\u201d\u2019s legacy will go down as a complex one, given the way he has been sold and the way he has performed, but his eagerness to challenge himself should not be forgotten.RecommendedAnthony Joshua offers \u2018three\u2019 reactions to Fury vs Ngannou fight Anthony Joshua not \u2018wasting time\u2019 waiting for Tyson Fury or Deontay WilderAnthony Joshua to face Dillian Whyte in rematch at The O2 on August 12And on the topic of legacies, it is worth noting that Muhammad Ali and Floyd Mayweather\u2019s were not significantly diminished by the former\u2019s exhibition bouts with martial artist Antonio Inoki, NFL player Lyle Alzado, and NHL player Dave Semenko, or the latter\u2019s clash with UFC icon Conor McGregor. All of those fights took place towards the end of both men\u2019s careers, however, while Fury is much closer to his prime. He may, in fact, still be in it.And the above strand of boxing history reiterates this: Fury vs Ngannou is not changing the game; even if it were, it would be changing the game for the worse."}, {"_id": "64b1414151ac331974948969", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/usyk-dubois-press-conference-b2374728.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Oleksandr Usyk recites poem and rap as Daniel Dubois vows to \u2018unleash hell\u2019 on champion", "lead": "<p>The unbeaten Ukrainian and his mandatory challenger faced off at a press conference in London </p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 13:58:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:17.120709", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T13:58:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/14/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Dubois, 25, is not the Briton that fans wanted to see take on Uysk, 36, but talks between the unbeaten Ukrainian and Tyson Fury fell through this spring. As a result, this match-up came about, as did Fury vs Francis Ngannou \u2013 which was announced on Tuesday. In any case, Dubois backed himself at Thursday\u2019s press conference, saying: \u201cOne hundred per cent I\u2019m ready, we\u2019re ready to rumble.

I\u2019m gonna be on him, ready to take them belts away.\u201dMeanwhile, Uysk recited a poem, which his promoter Alex Krassyuk said would take too long to translate, though Krassyuk did reveal that the passage was \u201cabout enemies who are going to be destroyed\u201d.Yet Uysk (20-0, 13 knockouts) also paid respect to Dubois, saying: \u201cI think really highly of my opponent. He\u2019s a nice man, a nice guy, a nice athlete. He came to the position of mandatory, so he deserves it, but let\u2019s stop talking; let\u2019s see each other on 26 August.\u201dWhen asked if he had a message for Dubois, Usyk simply said, \u201cI am the message myself,\u201d before launching into a rap after their face-off.The Ukrainian, an Olympic gold medalist, previously reigned as the only undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era. After moving up to heavyweight, he beat Anthony Joshua to win the unified titles, which he retained against \u201cAJ\u201d in their rematch last summer \u2013 again defeating the Briton on points.Meanwhile, Dubois last fought in December, stopping Kevin Lerena after recovering from three knockdowns, two of which were caused by a knee injury. Dubois (19-1, 18 KOs) has since had surgery to resolve the issue.Egis Klimas, Usyk\u2019s manager, said: \u201cWe were introduced to Daniel Dubois as a killer. All that speed, all that power, he\u2019s gonna come to knock Oleksandr Usyk out, as I understand it. First of all, to knock someone out, you need to touch them.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCarlos Alcaraz will take on Daniil Medvedev in the Wimbledon semi-finals on Friday, as each man bids for his first final at the grass-court grand slam.Like Medvedev, World No 1 Alcaraz is a former US Open champion, having won in New York last year to claim his first major title at the age of just 19. That victory over Casper Ruud came only 18 months after the Spaniard made his tour debut, and it made him the youngest ever men\u2019s world No 1.FOLLOW LIVE: Wimbledon semi-finals \u2013 latest updates from SW19Alcaraz is still only 20, and he had never reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon until he overcame former runner-up Matteo Berrettini this week, setting up a last-eight clash with Holger Rune, which Alcaraz won in straight sets.Alcaraz, who grew up in El Parmar in Murcia, is a Spanish rarity as a right-handed player, and he has won a total of 11 tour-level titles, including his US Open crown and four Masters successes. His Miami (2022) and Madrid Masters (2023) titles mark him out as the youngest champion at both tournaments.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz return to action in men\u2019s semi-finalsDaniil Medvedev: Wimbledon 2023 semi-finalist in profileWhere to watch Wimbledon 2023: TV channel guide and scheduleThe Spaniard\u2019s game is characterised by aggressive baseline play, and he has quickly become known for his athleticism and his daring and inventive shot-making. In his four-set win against Berrettini his week, for example, Alcaraz pulled off a stunning winner around the net post. He also possesses one of the most effective drop shots in the sport.Alcaraz has also been compared to a young Rafael Nadal, and the 22-time slam champion said of his compatriot after a clash in 2022: \u201cWhen his adrenaline goes up, he\u2019s practically unstoppable.\u201d Alcaraz may appear to be a right-handed reincarnation of Nadal, who was his idol growing up in Murcia, but he says his game is more like Roger Federer\u2019s.The youngster is also driven by the words of his grandfather and the three Cs: cabeza, coraz\u00f3n, cojones\u2013 head, heart and balls \u2013 and he had \u201cCCC\u201d tattooed on his arm after winning the US Open in September.Earlier this week, Alcaraz was forced to respond to reports that his father Carlos, a regular member of his entourage, recorded Novak Djokovic \u2013 who he is seeded to meet in the final \u2013 while the seven-time champion was training at Wimbledon\u2019s Aorangi Park. \u201cOh, probably it is true,\u201d said the world No 1. \u201cMy father is a huge fan of tennis. He doesn\u2019t only watch my matches. I think he gets into the club at 11am, gets out at 10pm, watching matches, watching practice from everyone. Being able to watch Djokovic in real life, yeah, probably it is true he\u2019s filmed the sessions. I don\u2019t think [it will give me an advantage]. I mean, I have a lot of videos from Djokovic on every platform. I think it\u2019s not an advantage for me.\u201dTo set up a potential final with Djokovic, however, Alcaraz must beat Medvedev \u2013 who won in straight sets in their only previous Wimbledon meeting, in 2021 \u2013 and Djokovic must overcome Jannik Sinner. The men\u2019s Wimbledon semi-finals will be must-watch tennis."}, {"_id": "64b1414151ac33197494896c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/daniil-medvedev-alcaraz-wimbledon-semifinals-b2375317.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Daniil Medvedev: Wimbledon 2023 semi-finalist in profile", "lead": "<p>The former world No 1 is the last Russian left in the main singles draws this year </p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:49:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:17.693228", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T10:49:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/13/Britain_Wimbledon_Tennis_30944.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDaniil Medvedev will square off with Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon semi-finals today, with each player aiming to reach their first final at the All England Club.Like world No 1 Alcaraz, Medvedev is a former US Open champion, having lifted the trophy in New York in 2021. That title, secured with a victory over Novak Djokovic, marks the Russian\u2019s only major triumph.FOLLOW LIVE: Wimbledon semi-finals \u2013\u00a0latest updates from SW19However, the world No 3 (formerly ranked No 1) also finished as runner-up at the US Open in 2019 \u2013 losing to Rafael Nadal \u2013 and the Australian Open in 2021 and 2022 \u2013 losing to Djokovic then Nadal. He is currently enjoying his best ever Wimbledon run, as is his opponent Alcaraz. In the quarter-finals, Medvedev overcame underdog Christopher Eubanks, ultimately seeing off the American in five sets.Medvedev, 27, grew up in Moscow and has proved a divisive figure since bursting into the spotlight. His relatively frequent outbursts on court and arguments with umpires have led some fans to dislike the Russian, who often enjoys engaging with crowds anyway.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz return to action in men\u2019s semi-finalsCarlos Alcaraz: Wimbledon 2023 semi-finalist in profileWhere to watch Wimbledon 2023: TV channel guide and scheduleMedvedev, who missed Wimbledon in 2022 due to a ban on Russian and Belarusian players \u2013 imposed due to the invasion of Ukraine \u2013 has won 20 tour-level titles, including the ATP Finals in 2020 and six Masters trophies at six different tournaments. At 6ft 6in, the former world No 1 possesses a powerful serve, though he is also known for his consistent groundstrokes. Djokovic has previously described Medvedev as a \u201cvery complete\u201d player, while Stefanos Tsitsipas once labelled the Russian \u201cvery boring\u201d but \u201cextremely smart\u201d.Meanwhile, Alcaraz this week echoed a past comment by Andrey Rublev, calling Medvedev an \u201coctopus\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s playing great here on grass,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cHe has had a great, great year as well. He\u2019s a really complete player; I think Rublev said a few times, he\u2019s an octopus. He\u2019s an amazing athlete. I lost the first match we played here on grass, so I have to learn [from] it.\u201d Alcaraz was referring to a second-round clash between himself and Medvedev at Wimbledon two years ago, with the latter winning in straight sets.In his victory over Eubanks this week, Medvedev struck an impressive 28 aces, and he joked after the near-three-hour match: \u201cAfter the first set, for sure I didn\u2019t want to go five; when I lost the third, I wanted to go five! There was a moment in the match where I completely lost the game itself, and he played well. I started to sink, I started to do a lot of mistakes, not serving well enough. But starting from the tiebreak, I managed to play amazing and I\u2019m really happy about it.\u201dMedvedev will now aim for his fifth slam final, having been allowed back at the All England Club alongside his compatriots and Belarusian players. Wimbledon was the only one of the four grand slams to ban players from Russia and Belarus in 2022, but it was criticised by the men\u2019s and women\u2019s professional tours for doing so. In response, Wimbledon was stripped of its ranking points and the Lawn Tennis Association was hit by a fine after the ban on Russian and Belarusian players was extended to the summer\u2019s other grass-court events in Britain. But in March this year, the All England Club announced it had reversed its decision ahead of this year\u2019s Wimbledon to allow Russian and Belarusian players to compete, as long as they agreed to several strict conditions."}, {"_id": "64b1414151ac33197494896d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/ons-jabeur-centre-court-wimbledon-semi-finals-b2375168.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ons Jabeur and a Centre Court love affair after thrilling Wimbledon semi-final comeback", "lead": "<p>The Tunisian, a year on from losing in the final, was on the brink again before the crowd spurred her into life </p>", "author": "Kieran Jackson", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:14:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:17.889483", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T05:14:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/18/GettyImages-1540415953.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOh, how a tennis match can swing. So silent earlier in the day as Elina Svitolina\u2019s hopes collapsed in front of their eyes, the Centre Court crowd came alive as they looked to revive Ons Jabeur\u2019s Wimbledon dream. And ultimately, all it took was one customary cackle. The Tunisian, who once more has become the story of the SW19 fortnight, needed a spark out of nothing. Down \u2013 but not out \u2013 against world No 2 Aryna Sabalenka, last year\u2019s finalist was the wrong side of a set and a break and staring down the barrel once more. But at deuce, Sabalenka serving at 4-3 up in the second set, Jabeur received her goblet of liquid luck.Sabalenka, nonchalantly bouncing the ball between serves, lost control. The ball boy sprinted up to the side of the baseline and picked the ball up. Offered it to her. Threw it to her. The crowd chuckled, disrupting the Belarusian\u2019s rhythm and throwing her ever so slightly off guard. A double fault followed, triggering a break point.Then, a Sabalenka forehand slammed into the net, providing Jabeur with the route back into the match she so desperately craved. From then, she reeled off two more games on the trot to level the contest. Finger-raised, Marcus Rashford style, at her temple after a backhand return winner sealed the second set, there would be no stopping her path to consecutive finals at the All England Club, where she will once again go in as favourite against unseeded Czech player Marketa Vondrousova.From the brink, scrapping in desperation, the woman with a continent on her shoulders found a way to haul herself over the line, beating Sabalenka 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-3. RecommendedHow do you solve a problem like Marketa? Vondrousova is a riddle in the Wimbledon finalNovak Djokovic spying allegations are on brand for tennis\u2019s weirdest superstarHenry Searle stays on course in bid to emulate Stanley Matthews at WimbledonBut the 15,000-capacity crowd played their part; Jabeur said as much straight afterwards. \u201cThank you to the crowd which kept me in the match really,\u201d she said on-court, the conductor to her choir. \u201cThank you guys for cheering for me and believing in me. Maybe I\u2019d have lost the match today but I\u2019m glad I kept digging very deep and finding the strength.\u201dInto the final on Saturday once again. Quite how she got there was extraordinary. Early proceedings saw both players save a break point, with Sabalenka\u2019s crushing backhand the standout stroke on show early on. In fact, it was a winner on that side which saw her eventually escape a tricky situation at 2-2, saving two break points and holding after four deuces.While in Wednesday\u2019s quarter-final against defending champion Elena Rybakina the focus was on Jabeur keeping her emotions in check, this time the spotlight was on Sabalenka. The world No 2, returning to Wimbledon after missing last year due to the ban on Russians and Belarusians, cannot resist an instinctive reaction when a point hasn\u2019t gone her way. A shake of the head; a puff of the cheeks; a startled stare and roll of the eyes to her player box.While there may not be a more powerful, obstructive force in women\u2019s tennis at the moment \u2013 the firm reason she was, in many eyes, the clear favourite this Wimbledon fortnight \u2013 Sabalenka too often finds herself in battle with her own temperament, instead of the player on the opposite side of the net. Cajoling oneself to be more determined can sharply swing to a mindset of disbelief, much to her own disadvantage.Aryna Sabalenka kept her cool to win the first set  (Getty Images)But here, Sabalenka was staying just above the pressure bubble. Enough, despite a few slippery moments on serve, to stay fully in tune in the moment. A tiebreak was a formality when it arrived after 12 holds of serve.What was not so inevitable was the course of events when they first swapped ends, Jabeur leading 4-2, as Sabalenka rapidly reeled off four straight points. Just when it mattered most, the Tunisian\u2019s coolness at the mightiest of moments was deserting her, signified by a slap on the thigh as a Hawk-Eye challenge narrowly went against her.Inches in the call on the baseline. And so there were inches in the first set, as Sabalenka took the tiebreak 7-5 with her second set point.In the first semi-final earlier in the day, with Vondrousova defeating Svitolina, there were nine breaks of serve in the contest lasting one hour and 15 minutes. Here, it took that duration for just one break, as Jabeur \u2013 in a befuddling lapse of concentration \u2013 was broken to love, with Sabalenka fully in the groove now.Ons Jabeur celebrates after sealing the second set  (Getty Images)But at 4-3, a twist. The twist. An extraordinary game, with a few extraordinary points. That double fault from Sabalenka, a netted forehand and from the depths of despair, a glimpse of hope for Jabeur.An open door grasped? You bet. The Tunisian saved a break point in her next service game, letting out a roar of defiance as she fought with every last breath to keep her tournament alive.To 30-30, with Sabalenka suddenly serving to stay in the set. A loose backhand wide from Sabalenka and a fierce backhand return down the line from Jabeur. A gigantic roar. Remarkably, we were all-square under the roof.The momentum fully with Jabeur now, Sabalenka did her best to hang on in there. But she could only stave off her buoyed opponent \u2013 and crowd \u2013 for so long. A backhand sent long from the Belarusian, after a gruelling slice exchange at break point, 3-2 down, and Jabeur had the final set initiative.Jabeur remarkably came through to reach her second Wimbledon final  (Getty Images)By the end, Sabalenka looked incapable of contemplating what had unfolded. She saved one match point with an ace; a second with an unreturnable serve. She even held, forcing Jabeur to serve it out. But after letting 40-0 slip to 40-30, an ace out wide secured another shot at Wimbledon glory. Arms aloft, Jabeur will play for the Venus Rosewater Dish once again, 12 months on from her pain of pains.Her revenge journey \u2013 beating Petra Kvitova, Rybakina and Sabalenka, all of whom she\u2019d lost to previously at Wimbledon \u2013 now gives her a final shot at redemption. An elusive Grand Slam. And there are no prizes for guessing which way the crowd will be chanting come Saturday afternoon.In the other women\u2019s semi-final, Elina Svitolina\u2019s remarkable run was ended by Marketa Vondrousova in straight-sets, 6-3 6-3.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 semi-finalist Daniil Medvedev in profileWimbledon 2023 semi-finalist Carlos Alcaraz in profileFrom skiing prodigy to Wimbledon semi-finalist: Jannik Sinner in profileSvitolina, the Ukrainian wild card who only returned to the tour three months ago after giving birth last year, had beaten World No 1 Iga Swiatek in the quarter-finals but ran out of steam under the roof on Centre Court, with her wily, left-handed Czech opponent deserving of her spot in the final on Saturday, where like Jabeur she will also be targeting a first Grand Slam title.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNovak Djokovic might be as well-known for his off-court controversies as his tennis brilliance. The case of his detention and deportation from Australia drew worldwide attention and sparked anger in his homeland, Serbia. His father, Srdjan, remained adamant that Djokovic was \u201cthe Spartacus of the new world\u201d and that \u201che is like water and water paves its own path\u201d.His father\u2019s reaction may be indicative, but Djokovic\u2019s unorthodox world view and scepticism of societal norms have been advertised, and self-promoted, for several years. After all, it was in his own book, Serve to Win, that he detailed the moment his transformative gluten-free diet began in 2010, when he self-diagnosed a celiac allergy by pressing a slice of bread against his abdomen.The true depth of Djokovic\u2019s belief in alternative treatments was epitomised by his vehement opposition to undergoing surgery in 2017. Despite struggling with a near-intolerable pain in his elbow, which led to Djokovic failing to reach a grand slam semi-final in a calendar year for the first time in over a decade, he was insistent that a cure could be found through holistic medicine. When he eventually succumbed in February 2018, Djokovic claimed he cried for three days after waking up from the operation. \u201cEvery time I thought about what I did, I felt like I had failed myself,\u201d he said. He has won eight of the 14 grand slams that have been played since.Those credences help put into context why Djokovic is so resistant to taking the vaccine. He is not so much an anti-vaxxer in the sense of indulging wild conspiracy theories relating specifically to the jab but ideologically opposed to such methods of scientific treatment across the board. \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\u201d he said in April 2020.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz return to action in men\u2019s semi-finalsWimbledon order of play and Friday\u2019s scheduleWhy are Russian and Belarusian players allowed back at Wimbledon?Djokovic is a genius of his field, and certainly no jester. He is, by most measures, wildly intelligent, a deep thinker, and commands the respect of his fellow players. Perhaps, then, the point is what proportion are genuine, obstinate beliefs, and what are actually potentially contrived \u2013 an innate suspicion of convention that has been moulded into a competitive edge; the us-against-them mentality that\u2019s enabled him to best harness his talent and become one of the greatest sportsmen in modern history.Novak Djokovic won his 23rd grand slam title at the French Open  (Getty Images)In the past, Djokovic has often spoken about coping mechanisms and the value of \u201cmental strength\u201d to comprehend his childhood in the war-torn former Yugoslavia. The 11-year-old boy and his family sheltered in the basement of his grandfather\u2019s flat during Nato\u2019s bombing raids on Belgrade in 1999. He still practised his tennis, but had to move to a different site each day. He was eventually spotted in the mountain resort of Kopaonik, where his parents owned a pizzeria, by Jelena Gencic, who ran tennis camps there \u2013 and invited to play.\u201cAfter three days I met his parents,\u201d Gencic \u2013 who died in 2013 \u2013 recalled later to The Independent\u2019s Paul Newman. \u201cI said to them: \u2018You have a golden child.\u2019\u201d Djokovic\u2019s \u201ctennis mother\u201d would also encourage his interest in classical music and languages.He needed mental strength to handle the burden of being a child prodigy and the extremes of junior tennis and into his senior career. He won his first grand slam title, at the Australian Open, at 20, but his physical abilities were sometimes questioned over the next few years \u2013 that previously mentioned change in his diet was one factor in 2010 that Djokovic said had pushed him on. Another you could mark was was Serbia\u2019s 2010 victory in the Davis Cup, the national competition. Serbia won the trophy for the first time, with now-Monaco resident Djokovic always being proud of being a sporting ambassador for his country. Djokovic would go on to have a title-laden 2011 and spring forward from there.\n\nHe is the Robin Hood of tennisGoran IvanisevicDuring that time, he\u2019s formed his own perspectives and built his own walls to the outside world in pursuit of a singular objective. Take the surgery saga of 2017, when Djokovic insisted a persistent elbow injury should be treated by holistic methods. After eventually resigning himself to surgery, he claimed he \u201ccried for three days straight\u201d. In his eyes, by letting the will of the outside world triumph over his own, he\u2019d \u201cfailed\u201d.It\u2019s easy to see how those traits have transferred into Djokovic\u2019s tennis, too, particularly when he is backed into a corner. In the third round at Wimbledon 2018, for example, when he was jeered by Centre Court after receiving a time violation against home favourite Kyle Edmund. He became consumed by a visceral anger, blowing kisses to the crowd, and barely let down his guard until he clinched a fourth title eight days later. As the irrepressible third wheel to Roger Federer and Nadal, he has perennially been cast as the villain. Djokovic \u2013 who has a son and a daughter with his wife Jelena \u2013 has given millions to charity, but his public image is not the same as Federer and Nadal. It was not helped by the exhibition Adria Tour in Serbia and Croatia in the summer of 2020 when the ATP Tour had shut down. Several players contacted Covid during the Djokovic-fronted event and arrangements faced criticism from a number of quarters.More recently he has become embroiled in issues of politics, defending his father by insisting he did not intend to pose for pictures with supporters of Vladimir Putin at the Australian Open. Srdjan was filmed standing next to a Russian flag with Putin\u2019s face on it, and a man who wore the \u2018Z\u2019 logo that indicates support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Novak Djokovic\u2019s father Srdjan, centre, appeared at a pro-Russian demonstration (Anthony Devlin/PA) (PA Archive)Then at this year\u2019s French Open, Djokovic wrote on a camera lens: \u201cKosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop the violence.\u201d Kosovo declared independence in 2008 but Serbia has never recognised that and violence recently broke out in the north of the country. Serbia has troops stationed near the border and there are fears of a return to the violent conflict of 1998-99.Speaking to Serbian journalists in comments reported by the country\u2019s media, Djokovic said: \u201cI am not a politician, nor do I intend to enter into debates. As a Serb, it hurts me what is happening in Kosovo. Our people have been expelled from the municipalities. This is the least I could do. As a public figure, I feel an obligation to show support for our people and all of Serbia.\u201cI hear there was a lot of criticism on social media. I don\u2019t know if someone will punish me or something like that, but I would do it again. I am against wars and conflicts of any kind.\u201dOne of Djokovic\u2019s coaches, the former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, believes the player is misunderstood. \u201cSometimes people only pick out the bad things he does,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cThey don\u2019t see the good he does in helping others. He is the person who is not afraid to speak out, the only tennis player who stands up for the other players. He is the Robin Hood of tennis.\u201dIvanisevic believes the tennis world \u2013 and others \u2013 will miss Djokovic when he retires from the sport.For Djokovic, you feel the situation in Australia was just the next step in the contradiction that has underlined his career. There has always been precious little to differentiate the man from the athlete. His stubborn single-mindedness \u2013 or selfishness \u2013 has been integral in him becoming such a remarkable player.RecommendedWho is in the Wimbledon final?Wimbledon 2023 semi-finalist Jannik Sinner in profileWho is Djokovic\u2019s wife and how many children does he have?It has led to his extraordinary dominance at Wimbledon later in his career. On Sunday, Djokovic could join Federer by becoming the most successful men\u2019s player ever at the All England Club with a record-equalling eighth men\u2019s singles title. His record at the Championships often intimidates his opponents: the 36-year-old has not lost at Wimbledon since 2017 and has not lost on Centre Court in over 10 years. The frightening truth about the Serbian is he also seems to be getting better with age.

She will take on Tunisia\u2019s Ons Jabeur on Saturday, as both women aim to win their first Wimbledon title. Who is Marketa Vondrousova?Vondrousova is a 24-year-old from Czech Republic who grew up in the west of the country in a sporting family: her maternal grandfather was a national pentathlon champion and her mother was a professional volleyball player.After a successful junior career reaching world No1, Vondrousova made a quick impact on the senior tour, and reached the French Open final aged 19, where she lost to Australia\u2019s Ashleigh Barty in straight sets. A string of injuries then disrupted her progress, and this Wimbledon semi-final is the closest she has got to reaching her second career grand-slam final. \u201cI\u2018ve been through it,\u201d she said after her semi-final win over Svitolina. \u201cOnce I was very young, so I think it was just too much for me back then.\u201dRecommendedHow do you solve a problem like Marketa? Vondrousova is a riddle waiting in Wimbledon finalThe left hander is a tricky opponent, with an uncanny ability to reach even the most precise serve on either flank, and an unpredictable game of baseline prowess mixed with cheeky drop shots. Beating Vondrousova requires a lot of mental and physical energy.She is conspicuous by the unusual tatoos on her arms. \u201cI actually go the first one when I was about 16,\u201d she told the BBC this week. \u201cI got it for my birthday. Then I just started feeling like I wanted more. It\u2019s also art for me, and I appreciate people who do that. I have three or four [tattoo artists] that I\u2019m visiting often.\u201dAnd her coach might need to book himself in too. \u201cI have a bet with [Jan Mertl]...

Vondrousova is a talented player who has been as high as No 14 in the world (currently No 42), but she specialises in clay and grass is her most unfamiliar surface. She had previously won only one match at Wimbledon before this tournament.Clearly there deep run at Wimbledon wasn\u2019t in the diary, and her husband is now scrambling out to be in her box for the final. \u201cHe\u2019s coming tomorrow with my sister,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cWe texted the cat sitter to come to our home.\u201dHow has she done it?With style at first, beating her first three opponents in straight sets. Then came a tight match against Czech No 1 Marie Bouzkova, before another battling quarter-final win over the American Jessica Pegula. Her victory over Svitolina was dominant, and full of style.Wimbledon is a place which tends to favour big servers who can use the fast surface to kill points quickly and hold serve game after game. However, Vondrousova has served consistently well through the rounds and her returning talents have forced opponents into rallying for points they might have won cheaply against other players.RecommendedHow do you solve a problem like Marketa?

On Wednesday, they hosted an open session and invited local Irish fans to watch the team in action.Those kids in the crowd sporting tiny green kit \u2013 whether in Queensland or Cork \u2013 are what motivate O\u2019Sullivan to keep going.She said: \u201cIn that field where I was that night with my family and everyone, that\u2019s where I grew up playing football. That\u2019s where I played street football with my brothers and all the boys. That night, I was there signing autographs for kids sitting in that same field, so just to look forward and look how far I\u2019ve come and what I\u2019m doing now.\u201cLook, I have a platform to inspire people and I think that\u2019s what this team is doing.

He\u2019s so consistent not only in T20s but in all formats.\u201cAny time he\u2019s at the crease, it relaxes the changing room and the opposition knows he\u2019s the big wicket to get.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEverton appear to have accidentally revealed the identity of their next signing in a training clip posted to their official social media accounts.The video shows James Tarkowski and Dwight McNeil competing in a head-to-head duel but it is the off-camera voices that can be heard that have attracted attention.While McNeil and Tarkowski jostle in a game of tag, a coach is in conversation with his colleague and appears to say \u201cwe\u2019ve got Jonny Evans coming in\u201d. Evans is a 35-year-old centre-back who captained relegated Leicester last season but his contract expired at the end of June. If he is on his way to Goodison Park, he would appear to fit the experienced profile of player that Toffees boss Sean Dyche is targeting, after signing 38-year-old Ashley Young from Aston Villa earlier this week.The video was initially posted on Everton\u2019s Instagram and Facebook pages and although it was swiftly taken down from Instagram, Twitter user @ITalkEverton brilliantly spotted the revelation and downloaded the clip before reposting on his own page with the message \u201cListen closely... does anyone else hear \u201cWe\u2019ve got Jonny Evans coming in\u201d ??\u201d RecommendedFive powerful revelations from Dele Alli\u2019s emotional interviewAddicted players urged to contact PFA after Dele Alli\u2019s \u2018scary\u2019 pill revelation\u2018Powerful and brave\u2019: Dele Alli praised for interview about abuse and addictionAs of writing, the video is still live on Everton\u2019s Facebook reels.Some users were sceptical that the comment had been added as a voiceover but @ITalkEverton was adamant they hadn\u2019t doctored the clip. Others applauded the detective work and Specsavers tweeted: \u201cOk you don\u2019t need to come in for a hearing test for at least six months\u201d.The clip has since been viewed on Twitter more than 2.7m times and the proof will be seen in the coming days if 102-cap Northern Ireland international Evans does indeed join Dyche\u2019s Everton revolution.The Toffees narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League as they finished 17th, just one place and two points above the drop, while Evans\u2019 Leicester side came 18th to drop into the Championship just seven years after they stunningly won the Premier League title in one of the greatest sporting shocks of all time."}, {"_id": "64b1414351ac331974948975", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/elina-svitolina-wimbledon-2023-ukraine-b2375244.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It gets too much\u2019: Elina Svitolina breaks down in intense Wimbledon spotlight", "lead": "<p>Constant questions about her emotions and her status as a symbol of Ukrainian defiance took a toll on the Wimbledon semi-finalist </p>", "author": "Lawrence Ostlere", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 08:47:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:19.433076", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T08:47:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/19/1540057801.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDuring an intense two weeks, the tennis court became Elina Svitolina\u2019s sanctuary from outside noise. Her simple stand of refusing to shake hands with Russian and Belarussian players took on heightened scrutiny at Wimbledon, a place where etiquette is sacred. The spotlight brought with it relentless questions, and an insatiable lust for her emotions.Soldiers are dying on the front line, what\u2019s your message for them? The UK is supporting Ukraine, what\u2019s your message for us? Harry Styles has offered you tickets to his concert, what\u2019s your message for him?Here on Thursday, after a bruising semi-final defeat by Marketa Vondrousova, who pulled her all over the court with a tormenting array of spinning slices, deep groundstrokes and disguised drop shots, Svitolina broke down.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of responsibility, a lot of tension,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI tried to balance as much as I can, but sometimes it gets too much.\u201dShe was turned into a totem: a symbol of what a new mother can achieve, and the embodiment of a defiant nation\u2019s spirit. More weirdly, amid the stream of searching questions, she was often prompted to give thanks and be grateful, as if satisfying a certain sort of Western saviour complex.RecommendedHow do you solve a problem like Marketa?

On the one hand, she had never cared less about tennis. Her priorities were her young daughter and family, her ravaged country and its people, before her sport. Her city, Odessa, has been at the bloody heart of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. And yet with each match and interview and press conference and new handshake-gate, the weight of others\u2019 hopes grew heavier.\u201cI\u2019m really upset that I couldn\u2019t go further,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed with the performance that I showed today. I need a couple of days to reflect on everything.\u201dShe joked through the tears that it had at least been a better performance than her last Wimbledon semi-final. Then, in 2019, Svitolina crumbled against eventual champion Simona Halep.This time she was different in so many ways: after her break to give birth to baby Skai, she changed her coaching team, her racket and even the type of strings she used. She plays more boldly and aggressively than ever. The beaten world No 1 Iga Swiatek said their quarter-final was like facing a whole new player.Life is different now too. \u201cWar has changed me,\u201d Svitolina said this week. \u201cEvery moment that I\u2019m not on the court I\u2019m checking how my family is doing, how the situation is in Ukraine, monitoring all the time what is happening \u2026 this is pretty much the life that I have now.\u201dAnd so the court offered some respite from the questions she asked, and the questions being asked. Each time she walked off she would Facetime her husband, the French player Gael Monfils, and their daughter, who was usually more interested in eating ice cream than the result of her match.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWomen\u2019s football is continuing to set the standard for inclusivity in the sport as the men\u2019s game lags far behind, according to a player from the London Unity League.While several of the big-name players preparing for the Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand are openly gay or bisexual, the lack of LGBTQ+ representation in the men\u2019s game is in stark contrast.Joshua Day, a 30-year-old striker for London Titans in the LUL \u2013 a league set up to give members of the LGBTQ+ community a safe environment to play competitive football \u2013 had previously been in a professional club\u2019s academy.He quit, largely due to casual homophobia within the dressing room, and has since come out as gay and found his home in the LUL.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveA Chelsea fan, who has previously left matches when homophobic chants have been heard, Day believes the men\u2019s game has a long way to go to catch up with the inclusive nature of their female counterparts.On Thursday, a Fulham supporter was fined and banned from football for three years after admitting a public order offence relating to homophobic chanting during a match at Stamford Bridge \u2013 the latest in a string of similar incidents.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that the men\u2019s game can learn from the women\u2019s game at the minute in terms of inclusivity,\u201d Day told the PA news agency.\u201cFans can learn a lot more from fans in the women\u2019s game, too. There is a better vibe, more inclusivity, more acceptance and that is something we need in men\u2019s football.\u201cWomen\u2019s football has players at the very top of the game who are open about their sexuality but that shouldn\u2019t be the catalyst for change in men\u2019s football.\u201cFor me, personally, I\u2019m not even sure that (a top-level men\u2019s player coming out) would change things.\u201cIf you look at the trans movement at the minute, trans people are under so much scrutiny by being more visible and fighting for their rights much more out in the open \u2013 that has brought more trans hate than a decade ago.\u201cFootball and sport fits into society and, until we get to a point in society where LGBT people in sport is being much more normalised \u2013 and I think that\u2019s why the LUL is really important \u2013 I\u2019m not 100 per cent convinced that would mean fans chanting or tweeting homophobic abuse would stop.\u201dDay was part of a Nike advertisement campaign ahead of the Women\u2019s Euros won by England last summer \u2013 it was the first time the company had included a gay kiss in an advert, with the online backlash against Day and Nike leading to the comments section being disabled on the post.Rather than having players come out, Day feels having more visible allies for potential LGBTQ+ professionals is key.\n\nFor me, personally, I'm not even sure that (a top-level men's player coming out) would change thingsJoshua Day\u201cPlayers could do more in the men\u2019s game,\u201d added Day.\u201cYou see the odd interview saying \u2018we\u2019d have no issue with players coming out\u2019 but they are few and far between.\u201cI think if we had more players come out in support of LGBT players, even in lower leagues, the fans are behind players and if players are visibly on board, that\u2019s what I think might help fans change the way that they look at LGBT people in sport.RecommendedFootball rumours: Barcelona looking to reunite with Thiago AlcantaraDenise O\u2019Sullivan not shying away from Republic\u2019s momentous World Cup debutRory McIlroy returns to Hoylake looking to end nine-year major drought at Open\u201cI remember my first Chelsea game when I was 13 \u2013 at that age, I knew that I was gay, I was just not out and I can remember hearing the chant, and just feeling so withdrawn in myself, and I felt so uncomfortable.\u201cI never, ever wanted to feel like that again.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA few weeks after one misguided individual etched his name into Roman history in a rather too literal sense, Formula E\u2019s finest will be hoping to do the same in a more appropriate way.Having started season nine with three victories and five podiums from the first five races, fans could be forgiven for thinking that Porsche had wrapped the championships up early: well clear in the team standings and Pascal Wehrlein flying at the top of the drivers\u2019.Heading to Italy for the double-header in rounds 13 and 14, it hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way. Wehrlein is now third, while Porsche do remain top of the teams - but their lead has been whittled away and now stands at just six points, with four races to go.After a thrilling first third of the season, the watchword heading into Sao Paulo was \u201cconsistency\u201d; the team wanted to make small improvements to ensure they moved from boom-and-bust between one driver and the other, to regularly ensuring both could fight for positions and points hauls. Again, that hasn\u2019t all gone entirely to plan. From round seven in Berlin through to last time out in Portland, both Wehrlein and Antonio Felix Da Costa only managed one top-five finish apiece - though in five of the last seven races, both drivers have snared some points at the very least.A mix, then, of improvements in some regards and not quite maximising the chances available to them. But heading into the home stretch of 2023, TAG Heuer Porsche\u2019s team boss has outlined exactly why that isn\u2019t a surprise in the slightest, and also why there\u2019s still so much reason for optimism given how far the team has come this year.RecommendedFormula E announce first-ever Tokyo race in expanded 2024 calendarIconic track will attract new fans to Formula E - record-breaking speed will keep themCarlton Cole on West Ham\u2019s final, a coaching career and his surprise \u2018love\u2019 of the world\u2019s most sustainable sport\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight title race! We had the lead, then retook it. Pascal likewise in the drivers\u2019 championship. Our target from the beginning was to have a good operation in the team and a competitive car,\u201d director of motorsport Florian Modlinger told the Independent ahead of the Rome E-Prix this weekend.\u201cWhen you look where we\u2019re coming from, seventh and eighth in the last three seasons to fighting for the championship, it\u2019s very satisfying.\u201cThat means everything is working according to plan. In the last races you never know what will happen. I don\u2019t want to set any preference [between the titles], we\u2019re in the championship fight for both. The target and the attitude is \u2018we want both\u2019.\u201dBack in the early months of the year, Porsche\u2019s self-built powertrain was cited as one of the key reasons for their exceptional start.Avalanche Andretti also use the same hardware as a customer team and it is they who kept pace with Porsche early on, particularly through British driver Jake Dennis\u2019 efforts. Later, the Jaguar powertrain proved itself every bit as effective and reliable - but rather than fundamental changes to the equipment, Modlinger believes this was simply an extension of life in sports: sometimes matters go your way, sometimes not.\u201cWe collected the points quick out of the garage, where others had incidents, retiring, other trouble. We had our issues during midseason when we didn\u2019t collect the points we could have.\u201cThis means we\u2019re still fighting with Jaguar overall and their powertrain. We made different steps to them but we\u2019re on the same level and have different strengths and characteristics. If one had made a bigger step by a tenth, or one and a half tenths, the car would dominate. We cannot see this at the moment so it\u2019s level - and the pure season statistics we have to be happy with. No other team have four wins after 12 races.\u201dOne extra win could end up proving vital. (Getty Images)The gap at the top is just six points now in the team championship, while as Modlinger notes, combining the points between Porsche-powered and Jaguar-powered cars on the grid leaves a difference of just a single point, an incredibly level playing field for the front-runners to fight from.But in the driver standings, Wehrlein\u2019s lead disappeared again two rounds ago after his most recent win came three back in Jakarta. Dennis clocking three straight second-place finishes has propelled him top, just one point ahead of Nick Cassidy who won in Portland. He, in turn, is only 15 points clear of Porsche\u2019s own big hope, while Jaguar\u2019s Mitch Evans - a further 16 back - can\u2019t be ruled out either.To claim victory in Rome, and later in the season finale in London, qualifying will become all the more important on tracks which may not see as much overtaking. The search for pre-race pace is one which has blighted Porsche at times this year, and Modlinger knows they have to get it right now if they want to be celebrating on multiple fronts. Indeed, he set a minimum target for both Wehrlein and Da Costa. (Jaguar Racing via Getty Images)\u201cWe had to improve and look for the last bits and pieces, how to race in races without as much overtaking.\u201cOn some racetracks like Monaco, Berlin, Portland, there are qualifying sessions which we cannot be satisfied and happy with. In Portland, starting position was not key but in the last races it will be very important. In Rome and London, both drivers must be in the top ten on the grid.\u201cThe key will be the driver getting the best out of the car in qualifying: tyre understanding and performance, set-up, balance. These are the factors we need to bring together and fully optimise. Qualifying will have a significant impact on the race result.\u201dA season of progress is undeniable for Porsche. But the line between progress and success is a fine one; a perfectly executed plan is needed if contemporary history is to be written in the Eternal City.Season nine calendar, 2023RecommendedJake Dennis and Nick Cassidy neck and neck ahead of Formula E double header in RomeCassidy wins Portland E-Prix as runner-up Dennis moves top of championshipIconic track will attract new fans - record speeds will keep themRound 13, Rome - 15 July, 2:03pm BSTRound 14, Rome - 16 July, 2:03pm BSTRound 15, London - 29 July, 17:03pm BSTRound 16, London - 30 July, 17:03pm BST::Watch Formula E coverage live on Channel 4 and the Formula E YouTube channel"}, {"_id": "64b1414451ac331974948979", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/novak-djokovic-wife-jelena-kids-wimbledon-b2372464.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who is Wimbledon star Novak Djokovic\u2019s wife Jelena and how many children does he have?", "lead": "<p>The seven-time champion is bidding to retain his title yet again, with his wife supporting him at SW19</p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 07:14:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:20.125257", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T07:14:29+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/10/12/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMajor challenges do not daunt Kevin Sinfield, which is a good job given the task at hand turning England\u2019s tanker around. Having followed Steve Borthwick from Leicester Tigers to take on duties as defence coach in the national set-up last December, the former rugby league star would have recognised a side in need of transformation, but the Six Nations only served to underline how much must be done. Three defeats, two on their home patch, one by a record margin \u2013 as Borthwick and his first lieutenant slumped in their seats while France danced to a record dismantling, England\u2019s sunken state was perfectly clear.\u201cWe knew there was a job to be done,\u201d Sinfield reflects in Verona as he, Borthwick and the rest of the staff set about navigating England to the World Cup. \u201cThe Six Nations was a challenge for us because we were thrown together pretty quickly and we came up against some pretty good teams who had been preparing for a long time and it meant we were trying to play catch up.\u201cThere were a lot of learnings that came out of the Six Nations but in a positive way. Nobody likes having 50 [points] put on their chin and that was certainly a reminder for me of how that feels. It doesn\u2019t feel any different when you are a player and you get it stuck on your chin or now as an assistant coach. The pain and the hurt is exactly the same.\u201dThere would appear not to be time for sweeping changes, with England hoping subtle tweaks, hard graft and nailing the basics can generate momentum into the World Cup. Borthwick has returned to Leicester to fill out the rest of his staff, adding Aled Walters, Tom Harrison and Richard Wigglesworth ahead of this summer swing.RecommendedArise Sir Kev... It\u2019s time to give Kevin Sinfield a knighthoodEngland players face trial by fire in last camp before Rugby World CupJoe Marler reveals \u2018weird encounter\u2019 with Steve Borthwick over England hopesThe coaching cohort has played down any similarities between the situation they confronted at Welford Road, insisting that while the band may be back together, they must strike a different tune in the international arena. The staff\u2019s familiarity should at least put an end to the coaching upheaval that has at times encumbered England in recent years, and their existing relationships are useful as England seek to forge cohesion and connections ahead of the tournament.\u201cThe more time you spend with people, the more understanding you get and the easier it is to work with them,\u201d Sinfield outlines. \u201cThat\u2019s why this time in camp has been crucial for us. When you are trying to put together a high-performance team and trust is at the heart of it, then it\u2019s time together that really counts.\u201dWhile his wider profile extends far beyond his role, Sinfield\u2019s day-to-day brief is of paramount importance to his side. While plenty, most notably Shaun Edwards, have crossed codes to forge reputations as the best defensive schemers in union, Sinfield is young in his coaching journey and light on experience in the 15-man code.Kevin Sinfield is part of an England coaching staff that previously worked together at Leicester  (Getty Images)Where Edwards has had time to fortify his French defensive structures during the four years since the 2019 World Cup, England\u2019s ramparts must be erected in haste. There can be no doubting Sinfield\u2019s qualities as a motivator, but his structures will be tested to the limit with the long lead-in to the World Cup providing time for attacking innovation.World Cup triumph eluded the 42-year-old in his playing days, England\u2019s rugby league side were never able to overcome Australia\u2019s might. Sinfield is swift to insist that there is no sense of having missed out but he recognises how these quadrennial tournaments can inspire and unify, particularly after a difficult year for English rugby.\u201cI\u2019d love to have won it as a player but I\u2019ve closed that chapter and moved on. I\u2019m really enjoying my time as a coach, really enjoying working for England, working with the players we\u2019ve got. I have missed representing my country and to get the opportunity to do it again, now, in a World Cup is so special,\u201d he explained.RecommendedMarcus Stewart hopes Ipswich kit gesture raises motor neurone disease awarenessEngland players face trial by fire in last camp before Rugby World CupStuart Hogg retires from rugby ahead of World Cup\u201cI watched that 2003 team do what they did and the legacy they left, the influence and the inspiration they gave to so many people across England. \u201cI thought it was incredible when you look at what our women\u2019s team has been able to do.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe 2023 Tour de France has all the ingredients of a classic: two leading protagonists ready to tear lumps out of each other in reigning champion Jonas Vingegaard and the deposed Tadej Pogacar; entertaining multi-talented stage hunters Wout van Aert, Mathieu van der Poel, Julian Alaphilippe and Tom Pidcock; the great Mark Cavendish chasing a historic 35th stage win; all facing a brutal route with 56,000m of climbing and four summit finish.The Tour began in the Spanish Basque country on Saturday 1 July, where Adam Yates edged twin brother Simon to win the opening stage, and these hilly routes will throw open the yellow jersey to a wide range of contenders. The race crosses the French border for some flat stages and an early jaunt into the high Pyrenees, where the Col du Tourmalet awaits. The peloton takes on the Puy de Dome volcano on its journey across France towards the Jura Mountains and the Alps, and it is in the mountains that this Tour will ultimately be decided. It all ends on the Champs-Elysees in Paris on Sunday 23 July. Here is a stage-by-stage guide to how the race will unfold.Stage 1: Bilbao to Bilbao, 182kmThe 2023 Tour de France starts outside Bilbao\u2019s iconic Guggenheim Museum, and winds north to the Bay of Biscay coastline before returning to the city where the stage winner will take the yellow jersey. This 182km opening stage is a hilly route with 3,000m of climbing featuring five categorised ascents, of which the final two are sharp and testing: they are tough enough to shake off the dedicated sprinters and open up early glory for the best puncheurs \u2013 those riders with the legs to get over short climbs and the power to surge away on the other side.RecommendedTour de France stage 13 preview: GC showdown on the Grand Colombier\u2018Very emotional\u2019 Ion Izagirre thrilled to follow compatriot with Tour stage winMark Cavendish expects recovery to be \u2018number of weeks\u2019 after collarbone surgeryThe profile of this stage is a great choice by organisers as it could suit just about anyone, from the speed of Wout van Aert to the climbing strength Tom Pidcock or Simon Yates \u2013 even two-time champion Tadej Pogacar.Jumbo\u2019s Death Star and Pidcock\u2019s dog: Inside the Tour de France\u2019s Grand DepartStage 1 profile (letour)Stage 1 map (letour)Stage 2: Vitoria Gastiez to Saint Sebastian, 209kmThe peloton will head east from Bilbao, touching more picturesque Basque coastline before arriving at the finish in San Sebastian. At more than 200km this is the longest stage of the 2023 Tour and, with the sizeable Jaizkibel climb (8.1km, 5.3% average gradient) shortly before the finish, this is even more tough on the legs than the first day. Another puncheur with the climbing strength to get over the steeper hills can capitalise, like two-time world champion Julian Alaphilippe.\u2018Coup du kilometre\u2019: How to win a Tour de France stage hiding in plain sightStage 2 profile (letour)Stage 2 map (letour)Stage 3: Amorebieta to Bayonne, 187kmStage three starts in Spain and ends in France, and the finale in Bayonne is ripe for a bunch sprint. Mark Cavendish will get his first shot of this race at trying to win a historic 35th Tour de France stage, but he will be up against a stacked field including former QuickStep teammate Fabio Jakobsen and the awesome speed of Wout van Aert. It will be fascinating to get a first glimpse of how the power riders stack up.\u2018Jasper the Disaster\u2019 rebuts Netflix nickname with controversial winStage 3 profile (letour)Stage 3 map (letour)Stage 4: Dax to Nogaro, 182kmAnother flat day and an even faster finish in store on the Circuit Paul Armagnac, a race track in Nogaro. The 800m home straight will almost certainly tee up a showdown between the Tour\u2019s serious fast men.Cavendish falls short as Philipsen wins crash-laden sprintStage 4 profile (letour)Stage 4 map (letour)Stage 5: Pau to Laruns, 163kmThe first major mountains of the Tour come a little earlier than usual, as the peloton heads up into the high Pyrenees on day five. The Col de Soudet (15km, 7.2%) is one of the toughest climbs of the race and rears up halfway through this 163km route from Pau to Laruns. The category one Col de Marie Blanque (7.7km, 8.6%) guards the finish 20km out, and holds bonus seconds for those first over the top to incentivise the major contenders to come to the fore and fight it out.Hindley grabs the yellow jersey as Vingegaard punishes PogacarStage 5 profile (letour)Stage 5 map (letour)Stage 6: Tarbes to Cauterets, 145kmThis has the potential to be a thrilling day: the 145km route takes on the double trouble of the category one Col d\u2019Aspin (12km, 6.5%) followed by the monstrous hors categorie Tourmalet (17.1km, 7.3%), before a fast ascent and a final climb to the summit finish at Cauterets (16km, 5.4%).It is a day with several possible outcomes. The general classification contenders could fight it out in a showdown to the summit. Then again, a breakaway could be allowed to escape which would open up victory \u2013 and perhaps the yellow jersey \u2013 to an outsider. The last time the Tour finished in Cauterets in 2015, breakaway specialist Rafal Majka surged clear of his fellow escapers to win. Keep an eye on Ineos\u2019s Tom Pidcock, who could use the long, fast descent from the Tourmalet summit to speed to the front, as he did before winning atop Alpe d\u2019Huez last year.Pogacar responds to send message to VingegaardStage 6 profile (letour)Stage 6 map (letour)Stage 7: Mont de Marsan to Bordeaux, 170kmThe first week of racing finishes in the Tour\u2019s second most visited city, Bordeaux, and it\u2019s a third flat day for the sprinters to contest. Much will depend on who has best preserved their legs through the high mountains when they come to this tight, technical finish on the banks of the Garonne river in the city centre. Philipsen pips Cavendish in thrilling finish to deny Brit all-time recordStage 7 profile (letour)Stage 7 map (letour)Stage 8: Libourne to Limoges, 201kmA long, hilly day will see the peloton head 201km east from Libourne outside Bordeaux to Limoges. The lumpy stage should suit a puncheur but it is not a particularly taxing set of climbs \u2013 only three are categorised and the toughest of those is just 2.8km at 5.2%. So could a determined team carry their sprinter to the finish and the stage win? Look out for Wout van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel, superstars with the all-round talent to conquer the climbs and still finish fast.Cavendish crashes out to end Tour de France record hopes Stage 8 profile (letour)Stage 8 map (letour)Stage 9: Saint-Leonard-de-Noblat to Puy de Dome, 184kmThe final stage before the relief of the first rest day is relatively flat and gentle \u2013 until a brutal finish atop the iconic Puy de Dome volcano, a 13.3km drag at a gruelling 7.7% average gradient that last appeared in the Tour in 1988. The summit finish will require a serious climber\u2019s legs to clinch the stage win, and the general classification contenders may well let a breakaway get ahead and fight for that prize.Woods takes win as Pogacar hits back at VingegaardStage 9 profile (letour)Stage 9 map (letour)Rest day: Clermont-Ferrand, Monday 10 July.Stage 10: Parc Vulcania to Issoire, 167kmThe race resumes in the centre of France from Vulcania \u2013 a volcano-themed amusement park \u2013 where riders will embark on a hilly 167km route through the Volcans d\u2019Auvergne regional park, finishing down in the small town of Issiore. With five categorised climbs, including the sizeable Col de Guery (7.8km at 5%) and the Croix Saint-Robert (6km at 6.3%), it will be a draining ride with virtually no sustained flat sections, and a long descent to the finish town. It looks like a good day to plot something in the breakaway, as the big GC contenders save their legs for bigger challenges to come.Bilbao dedicates emotional stage win to late Gino MaderStage 10 profile (letour)Stage 10 map (letour)Stage 11: Clermont Ferrand to Moulins, 180kmThe final flat stage before the hard Alpine climbs will present an opportunity for those fast men who managed to haul themselves through the Pyrenees to get here \u2013 although there is still some climbing to be done including three category-four leg-sappers along the 180km route. The day begins in the university city of Clermont-Ferrand before the riders wind north and then east to Moulins, a small town on the Allier river. Any breakaway is likely to be reeled by those teams with dedicated sprinters eyeing their only opportunity for a stage win between the two rest days.Philipsen continues flat-stage dominance even without van der PoelStage 11 profile (letour)Stage 11 map (letour)Stage 12: Roanne to Belleville-en-Beaujolais, 169kmThe race caravan will shift east to start stage 12 in Roanne in the Loire region, before taking a 169km route to Belleville, situated on the Saone river north of Lyon. This has been categorised as a hilly or medium mountain stage, but it might feel harder than that by the time the peloton reaches the foot of the fifth categorised climb of the day, the Col de la Croix Rosier (5.3km at 7.6%). That should be enough to put off the best puncheurs like Van der Poel and Van Aert, because the stage winner will need strong climbing legs. The GC riders will want to conserve energy, so expect a breakaway to stay clear and fight amongst themselves.Izagirre solos to victoryStage 12 profile (letour)Stage 12 map (letour)Stage 13: Chatillon-Sur-Chalaronne to Grand Colombier, 138kmThe first of three brutal stages that could decide the destiny of this year\u2019s yellow jersey is only relatively short \u2013 138km \u2013 but will provide a stern enough test to reveal any weaknesses in the major contenders. The peloton will enjoy a relatively flat and gentle first 75km from Chatillon-sur-Chalaronne before entering the Jura Mountains. A short climb and fast descent precedes the big climax: all 17.4km (7.1%) of the Grand Colombier providing an epic summit finish. This could be another day for a breakaway away to get free, but the overall contenders like Pogacar and Vingegaard will also fancy stage glory and the chance to stamp their authority on the race.Stage 13 profile (letour)Stage 13 map (letour)Stage 14: Annemasse to Morzine, 152kmPart two of this triple header of mountain stages sees the peloton ride into the Alps with a 152km route from Annemasse to Morzine ski resort. Three tough category one climbs line the road to the hors categorie Col de Joux Plane (11.6km at 8.5%), a brutally steep grind where bonus seconds await the first few over the top \u2013 and stage victory is the prize at the bottom. This is another potential spot for yellow jersey fireworks.Stage 14 profile (letour)Stage 14 map (letour)Stage 15: Les Gets to Saint Gervais, 180kmThe last ride before the final rest day will take the peloton further east into the Alps, towards the French border with Italy. The 179km day is almost constantly up and down, with a fast descent before the final two climbs, and the summit finish atop Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc will require strong climbing legs once more.Stage 15 profile (letour)Stage 15 map (letour)Rest day: Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc, Monday 17 July.Stage 16: Individual time trial from Passy to Combloux, 22kmThis year\u2019s home stretch begins with the only time trial of the race: a short, relatively flat 22km from Passy to Combloux in the shadow of Mont Blanc. The route includes one categorised climb, the steep but short Cote de Domancy (2.5km at 9.4%). This stage is unlikely to decide the yellow jersey or podium spots, but there is an opportunity here to make up crucial seconds for those that need them.Stage 16 profile (letour)Stage 16 map (letour)Stage 17: Saint Gervais to Courchevel, 166kmPut Wednesday 19 July in the diary: this will surely be the most brutal day of the entire Tour de France and it could be decisive. The 166km route features four big climbs, the last of which offers up this year\u2019s Souvenir Henri Desgrange for the first rider over the highest point of the race. To get there the riders must endure a 28.1km slog averaging 6% gradient to the top of the Col de la Loze, towering in the clouds 2,304m above sea level. There are bonus points seconds up here too, before a short descent down to the finish at Courchevel.A breakaway will probably form, but can they last the distance? Whatever happens up the road, the fight for the yellow jersey will be fierce \u2013 only the strongest handful of riders will be able to stand the pace and this will likely be the day that the 2023 winner is effectively crowned.Stage 17 profile (letour)Stage 17 map (letour)Stage 18: Moutiers to Bourg en Bresse, 186kmAfter a potentially explosive stage 17, stage 18 is classified as \u201chilly\u201d but is really a relatively sedate 185km which the sprinters are likely to contest if their teams can haul in the inevitable breakaway. The big question is whether there will be many sprinters left in the peloton after such a demanding set of stages in the Alps. For those fast men still in the race, the descent into Bourg-en-Bresse precedes a technical finish, with roundabouts and a sharp corner before a swinging right-hand turn on to the home straight where the stage will be won and lost.Stage 18 profile (letour)Stage 18 map (letour)Stage 19: Moirans-en-Montagne to Poligny, 173kmAnother flat day gives a further opportunity for those sprinters left in the field, as the peloton travels 173km from Moirans, near Grenoble, north to Poligny. The general classification contenders will be happy to rest their legs before one final push to Paris.Stage 19 profile (letour)Stage 19 map (letour)Stage 20: Belfort to Le Markstein, 133kmThe final competitive stage of the Tour is a 133km ride from Belfort to Le Markstein ski resort in the Vosges mountains, and it offers just enough for one final attack to steal the yellow jersey, should the overall win still be on the line. The last two climbs of the day are both steep category one ascents: first the Petit Ballon (9.3km, 8.1%) followed by the Col du Platzerwasel (7.1km at 8.4%). Whoever is wearing yellow just needs to hang on to the wheel of their fiercest rival here, and that should be enough to see them home. Stage 20 profile (letour)Stage 20 map (letour)Stage 21: Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to Paris Champs-Elysees, 115km As is tradition, the peloton will transfer to Paris and ride a truce to the Champs-Elysees. The stage will start at France\u2019s national velodrome, home of cycling for the 2024 Paris Olympics. It will finish with one final sprint: Cavendish has won four times in Paris and it would be a fitting way to end the race that has defined his career if he were to repeat the feat one last time. And once the race is done, the winner of the 2023 Tour de France will be crowned.RecommendedIon Izagirre soloed to victory in explosive Tour de France 12th stage Jasper Philipsen cements sprint dominance with another Tour de France winTour de France LIVE: Latest updates from Stage 11Stage 21 profile (letour)Stage 21 map (letour)"}, {"_id": "64b1414551ac33197494897e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/tour-de-france-2023-stage-guide-route-b2370428.html", "primaryCategory": "Cycling", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France 2023 stage-by-stage guide: Route maps and profiles for all 21 days", "lead": "<p>A closer look at every day of the race from Bilbao to Paris </p>", "author": "Lawrence Ostlere", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 06:47:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:21.049168", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T06:47:23+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/26/22/Stage%201%20map.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The race crosses the French border for some flat stages and an early jaunt into the high Pyrenees, where the Col du Tourmalet awaits. The peloton takes on the Puy de Dome volcano on its journey across France towards the Jura Mountains and the Alps, and it is in the mountains that this Tour will ultimately be decided. It all ends on the Champs-Elysees in Paris on Sunday 23 July.

This 182km opening stage is a hilly route with 3,000m of climbing featuring five categorised ascents, of which the final two are sharp and testing: they are tough enough to shake off the dedicated sprinters and open up early glory for the best puncheurs \u2013 those riders with the legs to get over short climbs and the power to surge away on the other side.The profile of this stage is a great choice by organisers as it could suit just about anyone, from the speed of Wout van Aert to the climbing strength Tom Pidcock or Simon Yates \u2013 even two-time champion Tadej Pogacar.Jumbo\u2019s Death Star and Pidcock\u2019s dog: Inside the Tour de France\u2019s Grand DepartStage 1 profile (letour)Stage 1 map (letour)Stage 2: Vitoria Gastiez to Saint Sebastian, 209kmThe peloton will head east from Bilbao, touching more picturesque Basque coastline before arriving at the finish in San Sebastian. At more than 200km this is the longest stage of the 2023 Tour and, with the sizeable Jaizkibel climb (8.1km, 5.3% average gradient) shortly before the finish, this is even more tough on the legs than the first day. Another puncheur with the climbing strength to get over the steeper hills can capitalise, like two-time world champion Julian Alaphilippe.\u2018Coup du kilometre\u2019: How to win a Tour de France stage hiding in plain sightStage 2 profile (letour)Stage 2 map (letour)Stage 3: Amorebieta to Bayonne, 187kmStage three starts in Spain and ends in France, and the finale in Bayonne is ripe for a bunch sprint.

The Col de Soudet (15km, 7.2%) is one of the toughest climbs of the race and rears up halfway through this 163km route from Pau to Laruns. The category one Col de Marie Blanque (7.7km, 8.6%) guards the finish 20km out, and holds bonus seconds for those first over the top to incentivise the major contenders to come to the fore and fight it out.Hindley grabs the yellow jersey as Vingegaard punishes PogacarStage 5 profile (letour)Stage 5 map (letour)Stage 6: Tarbes to Cauterets, 145kmThis has the potential to be a thrilling day: the 145km route takes on the double trouble of the category one Col d\u2019Aspin (12km, 6.5%) followed by the monstrous hors categorie Tourmalet (17.1km, 7.3%), before a fast ascent and a final climb to the summit finish at Cauterets (16km, 5.4%).It is a day with several possible outcomes. The general classification contenders could fight it out in a showdown to the summit. Then again, a breakaway could be allowed to escape which would open up victory \u2013 and perhaps the yellow jersey \u2013 to an outsider. The last time the Tour finished in Cauterets in 2015, breakaway specialist Rafal Majka surged clear of his fellow escapers to win. Keep an eye on Ineos\u2019s Tom Pidcock, who could use the long, fast descent from the Tourmalet summit to speed to the front, as he did before winning atop Alpe d\u2019Huez last year.Pogacar hits back in fight for yellow jerseyStage 6 profile (letour)Stage 6 map (letour)Stage 7: Mont de Marsan to Bordeaux, 170kmThe first week of racing finishes in the Tour\u2019s second most visited city, Bordeaux, and it\u2019s a third flat day for the sprinters to contest.

The lumpy stage should suit a puncheur but it is not a particularly taxing set of climbs \u2013 only three are categorised and the toughest of those is just 2.8km at 5.2%. So could a determined team carry their sprinter to the finish and the stage win? Look out for Wout van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel, superstars with the all-round talent to conquer the climbs and still finish fast.Pedersen claims stage eight win after Cavendish crashes outStage 8 profile (letour)Stage 8 map (letour)Stage 9: Saint-Leonard-de-Noblat to Puy de Dome, 184kmThe final stage before the relief of the first rest day is relatively flat and gentle \u2013 until a brutal finish atop the iconic Puy de Dome volcano, a 13.3km drag at a gruelling 7.7% average gradient that last appeared in the Tour in 1988. The summit finish will require a serious climber\u2019s legs to clinch the stage win, and the general classification contenders may well let a breakaway get ahead and fight for that prize.Woods wins first Tour stage as Pogacar trims Vingegaard leadStage 9 profile (letour)Stage 9 map (letour)Rest day: Clermont-Ferrand, Monday 10 July.Stage 10: Parc Vulcania to Issoire, 167kmThe race resumes in the centre of France from Vulcania \u2013 a volcano-themed amusement park \u2013 where riders will embark on a hilly 167km route through the Volcans d\u2019Auvergne regional park, finishing down in the small town of Issoire. With five categorised climbs, including the sizeable Col de Guery (7.8km at 5%) and the Croix Saint-Robert (6km at 6.3%), it will be a draining ride with virtually no sustained flat sections, and a long descent to the finish town. It looks like a good day to plot something in the breakaway, as the big GC contenders save their legs for bigger challenges to come.Pello Bilbao races clear to clinch stage 10Stage 10 profile (letour)Stage 10 map (letour)Stage 11: Clermont Ferrand to Moulins, 180kmThe final flat stage before the hard Alpine climbs will present an opportunity for those fast men who managed to haul themselves through the Pyrenees to get here \u2013 although there is still some climbing to be done including three category-four leg-sappers along the 180km route. The day begins in the university city of Clermont-Ferrand before the riders wind north and then east to Moulins, a small town on the Allier river. Any breakaway is likely to be reeled by those teams with dedicated sprinters eyeing their only opportunity for a stage win between the two rest days.Phenomenal Philipsen makes it four from fourStage 11 profile (letour)Stage 11 map (letour)Stage 12: Roanne to Belleville-en-Beaujolais, 169kmThe race caravan will shift east to start stage 12 in Roanne in the Loire region, before taking a 169km route to Belleville, situated on the Saone river north of Lyon. This has been categorised as a hilly or medium mountain stage, but it might feel harder than that by the time the peloton reaches the foot of the fifth categorised climb of the day, the Col de la Croix Rosier (5.3km at 7.6%). That should be enough to put off the best puncheurs like Van der Poel and Van Aert (famous last words) because the stage winner will need strong climbing legs. The GC riders will want to conserve energy, so expect a breakaway to stay clear and fight amongst themselves.Ion Izagirre solos to victory in explosive 12th stageStage 12 profile (letour)Stage 12 map (letour)Stage 13: Chatillon-Sur-Chalaronne to Grand Colombier, 138kmThe first of three brutal stages that could decide the destiny of this year\u2019s yellow jersey is only relatively short \u2013 138km \u2013 but will provide a stern enough test to reveal any weaknesses in the major contenders. The peloton will enjoy a relatively flat and gentle first 75km from Chatillon-sur-Chalaronne before entering the Jura Mountains. A short climb and fast descent precedes the big climax: all 17.4km (7.1%) of the Grand Colombier providing an epic summit finish. This could be another day for a breakaway away to get free, but the overall contenders like Pogacar and Vingegaard will also fancy stage glory and the chance to stamp their authority on the race.Stage 13 profile (letour)Stage 13 map (letour)Stage 14: Annemasse to Morzine, 152kmPart two of this triple header of mountain stages sees the peloton ride into the Alps with a 152km route from Annemasse to Morzine ski resort.

With five categorised climbs, including the sizeable Col de Guery (7.8km at 5%) and the Croix Saint-Robert (6km at 6.3%), it will be a draining ride with virtually no sustained flat sections, and a long descent to the finish town. It looks like a good day to plot something in the breakaway, as the big GC contenders save their legs for bigger challenges to come.Bilbao dedicates emotional stage win to late Gino MaderStage 10 profile (letour)Stage 10 map (letour)Stage 11: Clermont Ferrand to Moulins, 180kmThe final flat stage before the hard Alpine climbs will present an opportunity for those fast men who managed to haul themselves through the Pyrenees to get here \u2013 although there is still some climbing to be done including three category-four leg-sappers along the 180km route. The day begins in the university city of Clermont-Ferrand before the riders wind north and then east to Moulins, a small town on the Allier river. Any breakaway is likely to be reeled by those teams with dedicated sprinters eyeing their only opportunity for a stage win between the two rest days.Philipsen continues flat-stage dominance even without van der PoelStage 11 profile (letour)Stage 11 map (letour)Stage 12: Roanne to Belleville-en-Beaujolais, 169kmThe race caravan will shift east to start stage 12 in Roanne in the Loire region, before taking a 169km route to Belleville, situated on the Saone river north of Lyon. This has been categorised as a hilly or medium mountain stage, but it might feel harder than that by the time the peloton reaches the foot of the fifth categorised climb of the day, the Col de la Croix Rosier (5.3km at 7.6%). That should be enough to put off the best puncheurs like Van der Poel and Van Aert, because the stage winner will need strong climbing legs. The GC riders will want to conserve energy, so expect a breakaway to stay clear and fight amongst themselves.Izagirre solos to victoryStage 12 profile (letour)Stage 12 map (letour)Stage 13: Chatillon-Sur-Chalaronne to Grand Colombier, 138kmThe first of three brutal stages that could decide the destiny of this year\u2019s yellow jersey is only relatively short \u2013 138km \u2013 but will provide a stern enough test to reveal any weaknesses in the major contenders. The peloton will enjoy a relatively flat and gentle first 75km from Chatillon-sur-Chalaronne before entering the Jura Mountains. A short climb and fast descent precedes the big climax: all 17.4km (7.1%) of the Grand Colombier providing an epic summit finish. This could be another day for a breakaway away to get free, but the overall contenders like Pogacar and Vingegaard will also fancy stage glory and the chance to stamp their authority on the race.Stage 13 profile (letour)Stage 13 map (letour)Stage 14: Annemasse to Morzine, 152kmPart two of this triple header of mountain stages sees the peloton ride into the Alps with a 152km route from Annemasse to Morzine ski resort. Three tough category one climbs line the road to the hors categorie Col de Joux Plane (11.6km at 8.5%), a brutally steep grind where bonus seconds await the first few over the top \u2013 and stage victory is the prize at the bottom. This is another potential spot for yellow jersey fireworks.Stage 14 profile (letour)Stage 14 map (letour)Stage 15: Les Gets to Saint Gervais, 180kmThe last ride before the final rest day will take the peloton further east into the Alps, towards the French border with Italy. The 179km day is almost constantly up and down, with a fast descent before the final two climbs, and the summit finish atop Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc will require strong climbing legs once more.Stage 15 profile (letour)Stage 15 map (letour)Rest day: Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc, Monday 17 July.Stage 16: Individual time trial from Passy to Combloux, 22kmThis year\u2019s home stretch begins with the only time trial of the race: a short, relatively flat 22km from Passy to Combloux in the shadow of Mont Blanc. The route includes one categorised climb, the steep but short Cote de Domancy (2.5km at 9.4%). This stage is unlikely to decide the yellow jersey or podium spots, but there is an opportunity here to make up crucial seconds for those that need them.Stage 16 profile (letour)Stage 16 map (letour)Stage 17: Saint Gervais to Courchevel, 166kmPut Wednesday 19 July in the diary: this will surely be the most brutal day of the entire Tour de France and it could be decisive. The 166km route features four big climbs, the last of which offers up this year\u2019s Souvenir Henri Desgrange for the first rider over the highest point of the race. To get there the riders must endure a 28.1km slog averaging 6% gradient to the top of the Col de la Loze, towering in the clouds 2,304m above sea level. There are bonus points seconds up here too, before a short descent down to the finish at Courchevel.A breakaway will probably form, but can they last the distance? Whatever happens up the road, the fight for the yellow jersey will be fierce \u2013 only the strongest handful of riders will be able to stand the pace and this will likely be the day that the 2023 winner is effectively crowned.Stage 17 profile (letour)Stage 17 map (letour)Stage 18: Moutiers to Bourg en Bresse, 186kmAfter a potentially explosive stage 17, stage 18 is classified as \u201chilly\u201d but is really a relatively sedate 185km which the sprinters are likely to contest if their teams can haul in the inevitable breakaway. The big question is whether there will be many sprinters left in the peloton after such a demanding set of stages in the Alps. For those fast men still in the race, the descent into Bourg-en-Bresse precedes a technical finish, with roundabouts and a sharp corner before a swinging right-hand turn on to the home straight where the stage will be won and lost.Stage 18 profile (letour)Stage 18 map (letour)Stage 19: Moirans-en-Montagne to Poligny, 173kmAnother flat day gives a further opportunity for those sprinters left in the field, as the peloton travels 173km from Moirans, near Grenoble, north to Poligny. The general classification contenders will be happy to rest their legs before one final push to Paris.Stage 19 profile (letour)Stage 19 map (letour)Stage 20: Belfort to Le Markstein, 133kmThe final competitive stage of the Tour is a 133km ride from Belfort to Le Markstein ski resort in the Vosges mountains, and it offers just enough for one final attack to steal the yellow jersey, should the overall win still be on the line. The last two climbs of the day are both steep category one ascents: first the Petit Ballon (9.3km, 8.1%) followed by the Col du Platzerwasel (7.1km at 8.4%). Whoever is wearing yellow just needs to hang on to the wheel of their fiercest rival here, and that should be enough to see them home. Stage 20 profile (letour)Stage 20 map (letour)Stage 21: Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to Paris Champs-Elysees, 115km As is tradition, the peloton will transfer to Paris and ride a truce to the Champs-Elysees. The stage will start at France\u2019s national velodrome, home of cycling for the 2024 Paris Olympics. It will finish with one final sprint: Cavendish has won four times in Paris and it would be a fitting way to end the race that has defined his career if he were to repeat the feat one last time. And once the race is done, the winner of the 2023 Tour de France will be crowned.RecommendedIon Izagirre soloed to victory in explosive Tour de France 12th stage Jasper Philipsen cements sprint dominance with another Tour de France winTour de France LIVE: Latest updates from Stage 11Stage 21 profile (letour)Stage 21 map (letour)"}, {"_id": "64b1414551ac331974948980", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/tour-de-france-stage-13-route-map-preview-b2375028.html", "primaryCategory": "Cycling", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France 2023 stage 13 preview: Route map and profile of 138km to summit finish on Grand Colombier", "lead": "<p>Jasper Philipsen is the strong favourite to win once again but Wout van Aert is desperate to end his run of near misses at this Tour de France </p>", "author": "Lawrence Ostlere", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 06:37:44", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:21.473044", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T06:37:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/28/10/stage%2013%20map.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe 2023 Tour de France is reaching its most crucial phase and everything is set up for a showdown in the Alps between Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard. Put simply, the next three days will almost certainly decide the destiny of the yellow jersey.Yesterday saw an impressive win for Ion Izagirre and a stressful day Vingegaard, who was forced to give chase with little help from his teammates amid a high early pace. He retained the maillot jaune but will have been frustrated to have put so much effort into a stage preceeding such a decisive point in the race.The first of three back-to-back brutal routes is this stage 13 ride from Chatillon-sur-Chalaronne to the summit of the Grand Colombier. At 138km it is not a long trek, nor is it especially hilly for much of the day: the road is relatively flat for 75km, before an uphill drag to the day\u2019s intermediate sprint point. But then comes a fast descent to the foot of the big climb to the finish, where we can expect fireworks from the main contenders. The Grand Colombier is a monstrous ascent: 17.4km of almost unrelenting gradient averaging 7.1%. It immediately kicks up steeply and reaches 12% in sections, including a brief stint at the very top where legs will be burning as the leading riders set eyes on the finish line. A breakaway should form and get ahead early on a stage like this one, but the short nature of the route means there isn\u2019t a huge amount of time to build an advantage. That in turn could mean that the break is caught halfway up the Colombier, where the big general classification contenders could come to the fore \u2013 if they can physically get around the race leaders on a mountain road that will be packed full of well-lubricated fans.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDuring an intense two weeks, the tennis court became Elina Svitolina\u2019s sanctuary from outside noise. Her simple stand of refusing to shake hands with Russian and Belarussian players took on heightened scrutiny at Wimbledon, a place where etiquette is sacred. The spotlight brought with it relentless questions, and an insatiable lust for her emotions.Soldiers are dying on the front line, what\u2019s your message for them? The UK is supporting Ukraine, what\u2019s your message for us? Harry Styles has offered you tickets to his concert, what\u2019s your message for him?Here on Thursday, after a bruising semi-final defeat by Marketa Vondrousova, who pulled her all over the court with a tormenting array of spinning slices, deep groundstrokes and disguised drop shots, Svitolina broke down.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of responsibility, a lot of tension,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI tried to balance as much as I can, but sometimes it gets too much.\u201dShe was turned into a totem: a symbol of what a new mother can achieve, and the embodiment of a defiant nation\u2019s spirit. More weirdly, amid the stream of searching questions, she was often prompted to give thanks and be grateful, as if satisfying a certain sort of Western saviour complex.RecommendedHow do you solve a problem like Marketa?

On the one hand, she had never cared less about tennis. Her priorities were her young daughter and family, her ravaged country and its people, before her sport. Her city, Odessa, has been at the bloody heart of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. And yet with each match and interview and press conference and new handshake-gate, the weight of others\u2019 hopes grew heavier.\u201cI\u2019m really upset that I couldn\u2019t go further,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed with the performance that I showed today. I need a couple of days to reflect on everything.\u201dShe joked through the tears that it had at least been a better performance than her last Wimbledon semi-final. Then, in 2019, Svitolina crumbled against eventual champion Simona Halep.This time she was different in so many ways: after her break to give birth to baby Skai, she changed her coaching team, her racket and even the type of strings she used. She plays more boldly and aggressively than ever. The beaten world No 1 Iga Swiatek said their quarter-final was like facing a whole new player.Life is different now too. \u201cWar has changed me,\u201d Svitolina said this week. \u201cEvery moment that I\u2019m not on the court I\u2019m checking how my family is doing, how the situation is in Ukraine, monitoring all the time what is happening \u2026 this is pretty much the life that I have now.\u201dAnd so the court offered some respite from the questions she asked, and the questions being asked. Each time she walked off she would Facetime her husband, the French player Gael Monfils, and their daughter, who was usually more interested in eating ice cream than the result of her match.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOh, how a tennis match can swing. So silent earlier in the day as Elina Svitolina\u2019s hopes collapsed in front of their eyes, the Centre Court crowd came alive as they looked to revive Ons Jabeur\u2019s Wimbledon dream. And ultimately, all it took was one customary cackle. The Tunisian, who once more has become the story of the SW19 fortnight, needed a spark out of nothing. Down \u2013 but not out \u2013 against world No 2 Aryna Sabalenka, last year\u2019s finalist was the wrong side of a set and a break and staring down the barrel once more. But at deuce, Sabalenka serving at 4-3 up in the second set, Jabeur received her goblet of liquid luck.Sabalenka, nonchalantly bouncing the ball between serves, lost control. The ball boy sprinted up to the side of the baseline and picked the ball up. Offered it to her. Threw it to her. The crowd chuckled, disrupting the Belarusian\u2019s rhythm and throwing her ever so slightly off guard. A double fault followed, triggering a break point.Then, a Sabalenka forehand slammed into the net, providing Jabeur with the route back into the match she so desperately craved. From then, she reeled off two more games on the trot to level the contest. Finger-raised, Marcus Rashford style, at her temple after a backhand return winner sealed the second set, there would be no stopping her path to consecutive finals at the All England Club, where she will once again go in as favourite against unseeded Czech player Marketa Vondrousova.From the brink, scrapping in desperation, the woman with a continent on her shoulders found a way to haul herself over the line, beating Sabalenka 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-3. RecommendedHow do you solve a problem like Marketa? Vondrousova is a riddle in the Wimbledon finalNovak Djokovic spying allegations are on brand for tennis\u2019s weirdest superstarHenry Searle stays on course in bid to emulate Stanley Matthews at WimbledonBut the 15,000-capacity crowd played their part; Jabeur said as much straight afterwards. \u201cThank you to the crowd which kept me in the match really,\u201d she said on-court, the conductor to her choir. \u201cThank you guys for cheering for me and believing in me. Maybe I\u2019d have lost the match today but I\u2019m glad I kept digging very deep and finding the strength.\u201dInto the final on Saturday once again. Quite how she got there was extraordinary. Early proceedings saw both players save a break point, with Sabalenka\u2019s crushing backhand the standout stroke on show early on. In fact, it was a winner on that side which saw her eventually escape a tricky situation at 2-2, saving two break points and holding after four deuces.While in Wednesday\u2019s quarter-final against defending champion Elena Rybakina the focus was on Jabeur keeping her emotions in check, this time the spotlight was on Sabalenka. The world No 2, returning to Wimbledon after missing last year due to the ban on Russians and Belarusians, cannot resist an instinctive reaction when a point hasn\u2019t gone her way. A shake of the head; a puff of the cheeks; a startled stare and roll of the eyes to her player box.While there may not be a more powerful, obstructive force in women\u2019s tennis at the moment \u2013 the firm reason she was, in many eyes, the clear favourite this Wimbledon fortnight \u2013 Sabalenka too often finds herself in battle with her own temperament, instead of the player on the opposite side of the net. Cajoling oneself to be more determined can sharply swing to a mindset of disbelief, much to her own disadvantage.Aryna Sabalenka kept her cool to win the first set  (Getty Images)But here, Sabalenka was staying just above the pressure bubble. Enough, despite a few slippery moments on serve, to stay fully in tune in the moment. A tiebreak was a formality when it arrived after 12 holds of serve.What was not so inevitable was the course of events when they first swapped ends, Jabeur leading 4-2, as Sabalenka rapidly reeled off four straight points. Just when it mattered most, the Tunisian\u2019s coolness at the mightiest of moments was deserting her, signified by a slap on the thigh as a Hawk-Eye challenge narrowly went against her.Inches in the call on the baseline. And so there were inches in the first set, as Sabalenka took the tiebreak 7-5 with her second set point.In the first semi-final earlier in the day, with Vondrousova defeating Svitolina, there were nine breaks of serve in the contest lasting one hour and 15 minutes. Here, it took that duration for just one break, as Jabeur \u2013 in a befuddling lapse of concentration \u2013 was broken to love, with Sabalenka fully in the groove now.Ons Jabeur celebrates after sealing the second set  (Getty Images)But at 4-3, a twist. The twist. An extraordinary game, with a few extraordinary points. That double fault from Sabalenka, a netted forehand and from the depths of despair, a glimpse of hope for Jabeur.An open door grasped? You bet. The Tunisian saved a break point in her next service game, letting out a roar of defiance as she fought with every last breath to keep her tournament alive.To 30-30, with Sabalenka suddenly serving to stay in the set. A loose backhand wide from Sabalenka and a fierce backhand return down the line from Jabeur. A gigantic roar. Remarkably, we were all-square under the roof.The momentum fully with Jabeur now, Sabalenka did her best to hang on in there. But she could only stave off her buoyed opponent \u2013 and crowd \u2013 for so long. A backhand sent long from the Belarusian, after a gruelling slice exchange at break point, 3-2 down, and Jabeur had the final set initiative.Jabeur remarkably came through to reach her second Wimbledon final  (Getty Images)By the end, Sabalenka looked incapable of contemplating what had unfolded. She saved one match point with an ace; a second with an unreturnable serve. She even held, forcing Jabeur to serve it out. But after letting 40-0 slip to 40-30, an ace out wide secured another shot at Wimbledon glory.

The rules state that a match is not permitted to go beyond 11pm (6pm ET). Matches that have been paused include Novak Djokovic against Rafael Nadal in their 2018 semi-final after the third set, having started at 8pm.Nick Kyrgios and Ugo Humbert had their match suspended when tied at 3-3 in the fifth set too.Is there any exception to the curfew?

Massy led the qualifiers from day one and benefited from a day off before the Championship got under way. Rounds of 76 and 81 on Thursday gave the Frenchman a one-shot lead and after falling behind JH Taylor due to a 78 on Friday morning, Massy carded a closing 77 to win by two and become the first overseas winner. He later named his daughter Margot Hoylake Massy.1930 \u2013 Bobby Jones remains on course for historic featJones had already won the Open in 1926 and 1927, but his 1930 victory at Hoylake was part of an unmatched clean sweep of the era\u2019s biggest four championships. After winning the Amateur Championship at St Andrews at the end of May, Jones lifted the Claret Jug for a third time three weeks later as a closing 75 proved enough for a two-shot victory. He returned home to win the US Open in July and the US Amateur in September, completing what became known as the \u2018Impregnable Quadrilateral\u2019, before retiring from competitive golf at the age of 28.1956 \u2013 Peter Thomson completes hat-trickAfter finishing sixth on his debut at Royal Portrush in 1951, Thomson went on to produce an incredible run of results in the Open and lifted the Claret Jug a total of five times.

The rules state that a match is not permitted to go beyond 11pm (6pm ET).

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe phrase \u2018bigger and better\u2019 has become a bit of a cliche, but it is still perhaps the most authentic way of describing the ninth edition of the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup at a moment of reckoning in women\u2019s football.Australia and New Zealand are co-hosting the 2023 edition, which for the first time will feature 32 nations, 20 more than the inaugural 12-team tournament held in China in 1991.Eight teams \u2013 the Republic of Ireland, Vietnam, Zambia, Haiti, Morocco, Panama, the Philippines and Portugal \u2013 are making their debuts in a World Cup organisers are hoping will attract a record two billion viewers.The overall performance-based fund for the finals has skyrocketed to 110 million US dollars (\u00a384.2m), more than three times what was on offer at the 2019 World Cup in France, with the players sharing more than 44 per cent of that between them.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow livePreviously, there was no requirement for national associations to distribute a minimum amount of World Cup prize money to participating players.Also, for the first time, FIFA will be directly paying all athletes for their participation in the tournament, with amounts increasing the deeper teams get, ranging from USD 30,000 (\u00a322,964) per player for the group stage to USD 270,000 (\u00a3206,678) allotted to each champion.It is a significant sum at a time when the average salary in the women\u2019s game worldwide is USD 14,000 (\u00a311,000), according to last year\u2019s FIFA benchmarking report, although the improved pot still remains well short of the USD 440m (\u00a3337m) distributed after the 2022 men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar.FIFA has outlined ambitions for parity by the respective 2026 and 2027 tournaments.The increased fund did not emerge out of thin air. A group of 150 players from 25 national teams, including England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland, wrote to FIFA in October last year calling for equal conditions and for a guarantee that at least 30 per cent of prize money would be allocated to players.Indeed, this World Cup arrives during what feels like the dawn of a paradigm shift in the women\u2019s game. For much of its existence, players have often felt obligated to express gratitude for anything they were given, from meagre mentions in the media to ill-fitting equipment not designed for women\u2019s unique needs.They are beginning to demand more. In February, Olympic champions Canada played the SheBelieves Cup under protest as part of an ongoing dispute with their national federation over pay and working conditions, while other nations, including England, wore purple wristbands in a show of collective solidarity and desire for progress.That same month, France captain Wendie Renard and two team-mates announced they were pausing their international careers over \u201cconditions\u201d in camp, part of a so-called \u2018revolt\u2019 that led to the sacking of head coach Corinne Diacre just four months before the World Cup. Renard and others have since returned to the French fold after former Saudi Arabia men\u2019s boss Herve Renard took over the team.Players from numerous other countries, including Spain and Jamaica \u2013 and even Nigeria\u2019s head coach \u2013 have taken action or called out their federations over issues such as pay, resources and personnel, while the Lionesses\u2019 open letter to the then-Conservative leadership candidates following their Euro 2022 triumph led to the announcement of a \u00a3600m Government package to improve the PE provision in schools and grant girls equal access to school sports.There have also been calls from all corners of the globe for more funding and research into women\u2019s health.The World Cup will be deprived of top talents like England\u2019s Beth Mead and Leah Williamson, the Netherlands\u2019 Vivianne Miedema, Canada\u2019s Janine Beckie, the USA\u2019s Catarina Macario and Christen Press, New Zealand\u2019s Katie Rood and Zambia goalkeeper Hazel Nali, all of whom are on an exhaustive list of players whose dreams of representing their countries were dashed by anterior cruciate ligament injuries, for which women are at a three-to-six times higher risk than men.RecommendedRory McIlroy returns to Hoylake looking to end nine-year major drought at OpenFrom Lauren James to Sam Kerr \u2013 Players set to light up Women\u2019s World Cup5 talking points ahead of the Women\u2019s World CupAs England\u2019s Lucy Bronze told Sky Sports during an open training session in Queensland: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that women in sport in general have to (fight for change), but I think it\u2019s a role that many athletes, many women, take on in society and in sport.\u201dNevertheless, they will persist long after the trophy is lifted in Sydney."}, {"_id": "64b1414851ac33197494898f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/leah-williamson-beth-mead-fran-kirby-fifa-lionesses-b2375163.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "5 talking points ahead of the Women\u2019s World Cup", "lead": "USA are the bookmakers\u2019 favourites to lift the trophy.", "author": "Rachel Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:00:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:24.099312", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T05:00:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/06/0456db688308acdebe434613f9d4e407Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzIxMDAz-2.72688620.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

They believe the unique geographic position of the host countries has paved the way for strategic match scheduling that will allow fans, no matter where they live, to catch their side in action.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveYet one of the big issues ahead of the tournament was the lack of confirmed broadcast deals in a number of major markets \u2013 including the UK, Spain, France, Italy and Germany \u2013 just months out from the opening match, with FIFA president Gianni Infantino on several occasions accusing bidding broadcasters of lowballing offers and even threatening that his organisation could be \u201cforced not to broadcast\u201d the tournament if they did not step up.Some in women\u2019s football hit back, arguing the timings still would still prove challenging in engaging non-diehard audiences. England\u2019s three group-stage kick-offs all begin between 9:30am and 12pm in the UK, with ITV and the BBC splitting broadcast duties across the tournament.England\u2019s injury woesThe Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2022 triumph placed them squarely in conversations predicting World Cup favourites. Sarina Wiegman\u2019s squad and unchanged starting XI benefited from generally excellent health throughout that unbeaten run, but this time the England manager is not so fortunate.Beth Mead, who won the Golden Boot last summer, is still recovering from the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture she sustained in November, while her Arsenal team-mate and England captain Leah Williamson was ruled out when she suffered the same injury in April.And while defenders Lucy Bronze and acting skipper Millie Bright have both recovered from their own respective issues in time to board the plane, Chelsea midfielder Fran Kirby announced she would not be joining them after doctors determined she would require knee surgery, leading to questions about how Wiegman will cope without three of her top talents alongside the absence of the retired Ellen White and Jill Scott.Denying the \u2018three-peat\u2019For anyone not sporting the stars and stripes, it feels the world has grown weary of American dominance and would welcome a new world champion with open arms, particularly after USA\u2019s back-to-back victories in 2019 and 2015 and competition-leading four titles since claiming the inaugural trophy in 1991.While USA remain the bookmakers\u2019 favourites to lift the trophy, more than half of head coach Vlatko Andonovski\u2019s 23-player roster will be competing in their first World Cup, with just nine returnees from their victory four years ago \u2013 potentially opening the door for other hopefuls including England, Germany, France and Spain to deny the United States a \u201cthree-peat\u201d.The great armband debateThe rainbow \u2018One Love\u2019 armband ban was a hot topic during the 2022 men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar and sparked questions about what would be permitted in Australia and New Zealand, particularly as the women\u2019s game has historically featured many out members of the LGBTQ+ community, including a record number bound for the World Cup.While the One Love armband itself will not feature, FIFA announced late last month that they had reached an agreement to give players a selection of approved options highlighting issues from gender equality to indigenous people, peace and ending hunger, while another celebrates the sport of football itself. None, however, explicitly advocates for LGBTQ+ inclusion.Antipodean legacyAustralia\u2019s World Cup opener will take place with Test four of the Ashes already under way. The National Rugby League (NRL) season is also in full swing as is Aussie Rules\u2019 AFL, so there is plenty on to entertain sports fans in a country where other games dominate the headlines.RecommendedRory McIlroy returns to Hoylake looking to end nine-year major drought at OpenFrom Lauren James to Sam Kerr \u2013 Players set to light up Women\u2019s World CupPlayers\u2019 fight for fairness means Women\u2019s World Cup arrives at critical momentStill, the 2023 Australian Sports Commission\u2019s official AusPlay revealed football was once again the country\u2019s most popular sport to play. So while World Cup posters featuring Australia and Chelsea striker Sam Kerr seem ubiquitous Down Under and local governments are pointing to figures in the tens of millions for their visitor economies, the true test of this tournament lies in how much headway the sport can make in the two host countries \u2013 and what women\u2019s football will look like here a generation down the line."}, {"_id": "64b1414851ac331974948990", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/sam-kerr-lauren-james-reece-james-manchester-city-australia-b2375164.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "From Lauren James to Sam Kerr \u2013 Players set to light up Women\u2019s World Cup", "lead": "The Chelsea club-mates will be out to shine on the international stage this summer.", "author": "Rachel Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:24.344886", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T05:00:39+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/06/13080120-0053ebc6-dc32-479a-acb3-ffb0459797e0.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe world\u2019s finest in women\u2019s football have descended upon Australia and New Zealand for the ninth edition of the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.Here, the PA news agency picks out five players who could shine at the global showpiece.Lauren James (England)The 21-year-old forward has both England fans and pundits alike buzzing after a stellar season with Chelsea, where she scored seven goals and provided two assists in 26 matches played across the Women\u2019s Super League and Champions League.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWhile the World Cup will be James\u2019 first major international tournament, she has plenty of experience in high-stakes situations with Emma Hayes\u2019 WSL and FA Cup-winning Blues.The one-time PFA Young Player of the Year nominee is aggressive and opportunistic with the ball while also displaying what often feels like effortless control, and says she is keen to carve out an identity separate to that of her older brother, Chelsea and England defender Reece James. This opportunity could well accelerate that mission.Trinity Rodman (USA)Rodman can no doubt relate to James \u2013 she is also a 21-year-old forward who is often mentioned in the same breath as her own famous relative, ex-NBA player dad Dennis Rodman.But the 2021 National Women\u2019s Soccer League Rookie of the Year and 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or nominee has more than earned her solo spotlight since she became, at age 18, the youngest player drafted into the NWSL. And last February she extended her stay at Washington Spirit with what was widely reported to be a league record-breaking USD1.1 million, four-year deal.Rodman seems to be in fine form ahead of the USA\u2019s tournament opener against Vietnam after bagging a second-half brace in the Americans\u2019 2-0 win over Wales in a friendly earlier this month.Khadija Shaw (Jamaica)\u2018Bunny\u2019 Shaw will be a familiar face to many from her time with the WSL\u2019s Manchester City, particularly after a 2022/23 season in which she finished second only to England and Aston Villa forward Rachel Daly for the most goals scored in the English top flight.The 26-year-old Reggae Girlz captain, who recently extended her stay at City until 2026, concluded her second season with 31 goals in 30 games and in the process became the highest-scoring women\u2019s player across a single campaign in the club\u2019s history.Shaw is the first Caribbean player to win the CONCACAF Women\u2019s Player of the Year award, and Jamaica will rely on the skipper\u2019s leadership when they embark on just their second World Cup finals in a difficult Group F that includes heavy-hitters Brazil and France alongside Panama.Sam Kerr (Australia)Prolific striker Sam Kerr is precisely the sort of player you want on your side in those dig-deep, do-or-die situations when the pressure is at its most intense.Fortunately for tournament co-hosts Australia, the 29-year-old back-flipping forward is one of their very own and could well be the weapon that ultimately deals the tournament-ending blow to two of World Cup debutants Republic of Ireland, Olympic champions Canada and Nigeria to send the Matildas into the knockout stage.Chelsea boss Hayes has heaped praise on the \u2018FIFA 23\u2019 cover woman for her steely focus until the final whistle, often paying off in result-deciding goals like the one that won the Blues this year\u2019s FA Cup. Kerr also scored in England\u2019s only loss under head coach Sarina Wiegman, a 2-0 upset for the Lionesses against Australia in their April friendly.Lena Oberdorf (Germany)Germany\u2019s young midfield star will be looking for retribution after narrowly missing out Euro 2022 glory last summer, when her side lost 2-1 to England in their dramatic Wembley final, although she did walk away with Young Player of the Tournament honours.RecommendedRory McIlroy returns to Hoylake looking to end nine-year major drought at Open5 talking points ahead of the Women\u2019s World CupPlayers\u2019 fight for fairness means Women\u2019s World Cup arrives at critical momentThough also just 21, the Wolfsburg talent will be making her second World Cup appearance, having made her debut in the 2019 French edition aged 17, where she sat school exams during the tournament.Known for taking initiative, winning back possession and her well-timed challenges, Oberdorf will be a key cog in a strong German side\u2019s title hopes as one of the tournament favourites kick off their campaign with group H matches against Morocco, Colombia and South Korea."}, {"_id": "64b1414851ac331974948991", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/rory-mcilroy-patrick-reed-st-andrews-american-dustin-johnson-b2375165.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rory McIlroy returns to Hoylake looking to end nine-year major drought at Open", "lead": "The 34-year-old\u2019s last major title was the 2014 US PGA Championship.", "author": "Phil Casey", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:00:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:24.581491", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T05:00:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/06/c7749cd4575e19b36ebf6fb1e93559bfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzQ4MDkw-2.20445984.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEight years and 11 months. 3,266 days. 78,384 hours.Whichever way you look at it, by the time the 151st Open Championship gets under way the length of time since Rory McIlroy\u2019s last major victory is truly remarkable.Since McIlroy followed his Open triumph at Royal Liverpool in 2014 by winning the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA Championship in his next two starts, 34 majors have been staged and the 34-year-old Northern Irishman has won none of them.Brooks Koepka has racked up all five of his victories in that spell, Jordan Spieth three, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, Collin Morikawa and Dustin Johnson two each, while 18 different players have tasted victory once, including a 50-year-old Phil Mickelson and an injury-ravaged Tiger Woods.McIlroy has had to settle for commendable consistency, recording 19 top-10s and finishing no worse than eighth in all four majors in 2022, yet genuine chances to win on the back nine on Sunday have been relatively scarce.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveIn the 2018 Masters \u2013 the only major he has not won \u2013 McIlroy began the day three behind leader Patrick Reed but had a short eagle putt on the par-five second to draw level with the American. He missed, bogeyed the third to Reed\u2019s birdie and that was effectively that.At the 2022 US PGA, McIlroy roared into contention with four straight birdies early in the final round and was one shot off the eventual score required for a play-off, only to fade to eighth.It was a different story two months later as McIlroy shared the lead with Viktor Hovland heading into the final round of the Open at St Andrews, four shots clear of Cameron Smith and Cameron Young.Two ahead at the turn, McIlroy made his second birdie of the day on the 10th but was overhauled by a surging Smith, the Australian making five birdies in a row to start the back nine and another on the last to complete a stunning 64.Last month\u2019s US Open offered McIlroy another great chance to end his drought as he moved into a share of the lead with a birdie on the first hole of the final round at Los Angeles Country Club.However, that proved to be his only one of a frustrating day and it was no surprise that he was overheard muttering \u201cSt Andrews all over again\u201d to his manager after a level-par 70 which left him one shot behind winner Wyndham Clark.Of course \u201cHoylake all over again\u201d would be a very welcome sense of deja vu for McIlroy following his 2014 triumph, when he led from start to finish and held off a charging Sergio Garcia on the final day to lift the Claret Jug.It made McIlroy the first European player to win three different majors since the Masters was founded in 1934 and gave him the third leg of a career grand slam completed by just five players in the history of the game.When another major title followed a month later it was almost inconceivable that McIlroy would be stuck on the same tally nine years later, but there are precedents for ending even lengthier droughts.Julius Boros and Hale Irwin both won the US Open 11 years apart, while Ben Crenshaw\u2019s Masters victories in 1984 and 1995 came in just six days shy of that mark.RecommendedFrom Lauren James to Sam Kerr \u2013 Players set to light up Women\u2019s World Cup5 talking points ahead of the Women\u2019s World CupPlayers\u2019 fight for fairness means Women\u2019s World Cup arrives at critical momentTiger Woods memorably won the 2019 Masters almost 11 years on from his 2008 US Open win, with Lee Trevino and Ernie Els also cracking the 10-year barrier.A keen student of the game, chances are McIlroy will be well aware of such facts. Whether he can do anything about adding his name to the list remains to be seen."}, {"_id": "64b1414851ac331974948992", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/ella-toone-lionesses-england-manchester-united-germany-b2375153.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England\u2019s Ella Toone chasing winning feeling after Euro 2022 \u2018pinch-me moment\u2019", "lead": "Substitute Toone opened the scoring in the Wembley showdown against Germany as the Lionesses secured their first ever major trophy.", "author": "Phil Medlicott", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 05:00:11", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:24.747826", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T05:00:11+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/06/b21ce88e8ae21f7ae80b3f6254101f39Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzI1Njk3-2.68126556.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It\u2019s football and people move on. No matter what, I know we will be friends for life.

With each passing game the left-handed Vondrousova made herself increasingly awkward to face, putting comical spin on her backhand slice, picking obscure angles and covering the court so nimbly that there was no safe space for Svitolina to find, no easy way out.The looping top-spin on Vondrousova\u2019s forehand refused to slot into Svitolina\u2019s hitting arc. Drop shots would appear unannounced. It made the Ukrainian wonder: do I stand on my heels to receive a deep, bouncing groundstroke, or stay on my toes to anticipate the drop? It was a question she could never fully answer.Full article here:How do you solve a problem like Marketa?

Her simple stand of refusing to shake hands with Russian and Belarussian players took on heightened scrutiny at Wimbledon, a place where etiquette is sacred. The spotlight brought with it relentless questions, and an insatiable lust for her emotions.Soldiers are dying on the front line, what\u2019s your message for them? The UK is supporting Ukraine, what\u2019s your message for us? Harry Styles has offered you tickets to his concert, what\u2019s your message for him?Here on Thursday, after a bruising semi-final defeat by Marketa Vondrousova, who pulled her all over the court with a tormenting array of spinning slices, deep groundstrokes and disguised drop shots, Svitolina broke down.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of responsibility, a lot of tension,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI tried to balance as much as I can, but sometimes it gets too much.\u201dShe was turned into a totem: a symbol of what a new mother can achieve, and the embodiment of a defiant nation\u2019s spirit. More weirdly, amid the stream of searching questions, she was often prompted to give thanks and be grateful, as if satisfying a certain sort of Western saviour complex.Read Lawrence Ostlere\u2019s excellent piece here:Elina Svitolina breaks down in Wimbledon spotlight: \u2018It gets too much\u2019Constant questions about her emotions and her status as a symbol of Ukrainian defiance took a toll on the Wimbledon semi-finalist Alex Pattle14 July 2023 12:471689334660Wimbledon 2023: The moment Novak Djokovic\u2019s quarter-final became theatreIt is almost remarkable that every step Novak Djokovic takes on Centre Court does not emit a low thud \u2013 an ominous boom oscillating around the grounds of the All England Club, the SW19 postcode, and in fact the wider Wimbledon area. For such a sound would be a fitting soundtrack to the presence and progression of the seven-time champion at this tournament.And while it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the looming threats to Djokovic\u2019s throne at Wimbledon this year, the reigning champion saw off another threat, another contender, another pretender to his crown on Tuesday, as the air of inevitability around the Serb intensified.With this 4-6 6-1 6-4 6-3 victory over seventh seed Andrey Rublev, Djokovic\u2019s 33rd straight win at Wimbledon, he set up a semi-final clash with eighth seed Jannik Sinner, and for all the youthful exuberance and precocious skill that the 21-year-old possesses, it is difficult not to see the Italian falling the same way as Rublev. Any one of Holger Rune, Daniil Medvedev, underdog Christopher Eubanks or world No 1 Carlos Alcaraz may then await, but their attributes risk disappearing under an asterisk \u2013 one stamped in the record books, above the section on Djokovic\u2019s prospective 24th major title.Report from Djokovic\u2019s win over Rublev: Djokovic, Rublev, and the moment a match became theatreThe seven-time champion fought from behind to win in four sets and reach the semi-finals Alex Pattle14 July 2023 12:371689334000Wimbledon 2023: Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s clinical brilliance sends warning to rivalsAfter more than an hour of Carlos Alcaraz and Holger Rune serving up a classic opening set of futuristic tennis, the door suddenly closed. Standing in its way was the World No 1, as Alcaraz took the match away from his young rival and raced through the second and third sets to reach his first Wimbledon semi-final.This first grand slam meeting between Alcaraz and Rune, and first Wimbledon quarter-final played between two men under the age of 21, burned immensely bright to begin with. The stunning attacking play on both sides, creating fun points and absorbing rallies, seemed set to last until it reached the fading evening light on Centre Court.There was a shine to it, a gleaming freshness, until Alcaraz put his foot down. Staggeringly, after edging ahead by taking the first-set tiebreak, Alcaraz didn\u2019t make a single unforced error in the second set and only one in the third. This was a performance that Novak Djokovic would have been proud of.Here\u2019s Jamie Braidwood on Alcaraz\u2019s quarter-final performance:Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s clinical brilliance sends warning to Wimbledon rivalsThe Spaniard outclassed Holger Rune in straight sets to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals for the first time Alex Pattle14 July 2023 12:261689333400Wimbledon 2023: Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev\u2019s only other clash hereCarlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev have played each other once before at Wimbledon, in 2021.Medvedev was a straight-sets winner that day, and Alcaraz is hoping to implement learnings from that second-round loss in their rematch today.\u201cHe\u2019s playing great here on grass,\u201d Alcaraz said this week. \u201cI lost the first match we played here on grass, so I have to learn [from] it.\u201cHe has had a great, great year as well.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf someone other than Marketa Vondrousova is to win Wimbledon on Saturday, they will first have to figure out how to win a tennis match while putting themselves through the mental and physical misery of playing Marketa Vondrousova.Each time Elina Svitolina returned to her seat she looked a little more perplexed, more drained. With each passing game the left-handed Vondrousova made herself increasingly awkward to face, putting comical spin on her backhand slice, picking obscure angles and covering the court so nimbly that there was no safe space for Svitolina to find, no easy way out.The looping top-spin on Vondrousova\u2019s forehand refused to slot into Svitolina\u2019s hitting arc. Drop shots would appear unannounced. It made the Ukrainian wonder: do I stand on my heels to receive a deep, bouncing groundstroke, or stay on my toes to anticipate the drop? It was a question she could never fully answer.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Vondrousova said after winning this semi-final 6-3 6-3, her first ever match on Centre Court. \u201cIt was so tough, she\u2019s such a fighter and such a great person. I was crazy nervous, the whole match. I was leading and she came back, so I needed to stay focused and try to fight for every game.\u201dIt is the culmination of a journey for the 24-year-old, back in a grand slam final for the first time since reaching the 2019 French Open final as a barely known teenager, where she lost to the then world No 1 Ashleigh Barty in straight sets. A string of injuries followed and progress stalled, and she watched last year\u2019s Wimbledon on TV wearing a cast. \u201cI never knew whether I could get to this level again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful to be healthy.\u201dRecommendedWho is in the Wimbledon final?Wimbledon 2023 finalist Marketa Vondrousova in profileOns Jabeur and a Centre Court love affair Marketa Vondrousova deploys some slice  (Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)Unseeded and inexperienced here \u2013 she had won only one match at Wimbledon before this tournament \u2013 she battled through back-to-back three set matches and won this one against the will of a demanding crowd. As a Czech, she represented a country that has supported Ukraine in its plight, but from the moment Svitolina first made the walk to the baseline under the Royal Box to serve, it was made abundantly clear that Centre Court would be behind every swing.The noise echoed against a closed roof. The environment here is different when the stadium transforms from amphitheatre to greenhouse: it traps humid air which slows down the ball and this suited Vondrousova, a player who grew up on slower clay courts. She raised her game dramatically once the Court One roof closed over her quarter-final match to knock out Jessica Pegula, and her performance here was better still.The match started evenly enough. Vondrousova broke to go up 3-2 and then saved a break point with one of her customary drop shots. But a moment later she missed a down-the-line winner with the court gaping and Svitolina broke back. Centre Court let out an urgent howl. Yet that was the beginning of the end. Vondrousova lifted every aspect of herself and rattled off the next seven games, clinching the first set 6-3 and taking charge of the second 4-0.Along the way she produced touches of magic, like a loose-wristed slap on the run that won a point late in the first set which the partisan crowd were already celebrating. Winners were retrieved from remote corners; delicate spinning lobs made Svitolina turn and watch as they dropped inside the baseline; deep shots followed by drop shots followed by point-killing winners made Svitolina yo-yo back and forth. \u201cShe played amazing, great tennis,\u201d Svitolina later said.RecommendedToday\u2019s Wimbledon\u2019s schedule as Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz in semi-finalsThe old me would have lost \u2013 Ons Jabeur ready to take the next step at WimbledonWimbledon day 11: Ons Jabeur and Marketa Vondrousova deny Ukraine-Belarus finalAnd so the loudest cheer of the afternoon was a moment of stubborn resistance, with the match all but done at 4-0 in the second set, when Svitolina scrapped and fought her way into the ascendancy on deuce before crushing a forehand winner with feeling. She went on to break Vondrousova\u2019s serve a moment later, and her streak of lost games was finally over.Two more followed and it was as if Svitolina had finally found a solution. But too much damage had already been done on the scoreboard, too much of a toll on her legs and her head. At 6-3 5-3, a long backhand confirmed her fate. The crowd rose once more as Svitolina picked up her bag, spun and waved, and then she was gone.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intentional, it\u2019s just their normal reaction, but they enjoy it.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveSearle reached the quarter-finals of the French Open and has built on that here, beginning his campaign by knocking out top seed Juan Carlos Prado Angelo and going on to set up a semi-final clash with American fourth seed Cooper Williams.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely given me confidence playing against some of the top juniors at this level, knowing going into any match that I can play any player and giving it my best will hopefully make me come out on top,\u201d said Searle, who trains at the Lawn Tennis Association\u2019s national academy in Loughborough.\u201cIt was a really cool experience being able to play on Court Three and I managed to put in a good performance against a very good opponent. It\u2019s a dream from a young age to win at Wimbledon and to have a few wins this week is pretty amazing.\u201dLiam Broady and Jack Draper both reached junior finals at Wimbledon in recent years but no British boy has won the title since Stanley Matthews, son of the famous footballer, in 1962.\u201cThat was a long time ago. I don\u2019t really know too much about him but I\u2019m just focusing on the match tomorrow, not thinking too far ahead,\u201d said Searle.Draper\u2019s run in 2018 was much more recent, and Searle has been inspired by his fellow lefty.\u201cI remember watching bits of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to think he plays a little bit similar to myself. I take a few things from him and try to implement them into my game. He\u2019s doing extremely well.\u201dRanah Stoiber and Mika Stojsavljevic were both hoping to join Searle in the semi-finals but neither could progress beyond the last eight in the girls\u2019 singles.Fourteen-year-old Stojsavljevic has had a memorable week on her Wimbledon debut and fought back from 5-2 down in the second set to force a decider against Slovakian fifth seed Renata Jamrichova only to lose out 6-2 6-7 (6) 6-1.RecommendedReally good start \u2013 Rory McIlroy eyeing Scottish Open glory before Hoylake testKen Skupski won\u2019t attend brother Neal\u2019s Wimbledon final due to family holidayWimbledon day 11: Ons Jabeur and Marketa Vondrousova deny Ukraine-Belarus finalStoiber, 18, also took the opening set against Czech Nikola Bartunkova, who is in the top 350 of the women\u2019s rankings, but fell to a 1-6 6-1 6-2 defeat.British duo Isabelle Lacy and Hannah Klugman, meanwhile, are through to the semi-finals of the girls\u2019 doubles."}, {"_id": "64b1414b51ac33197494899e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-scottish-genesis-xander-schauffele-b2374936.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Really good start \u2013 Rory McIlroy eyeing Scottish Open glory before Hoylake test", "lead": "McIlroy recorded an eagle and six birdies in an opening six-under-par 64 at The Renaissance Club.", "author": "Phil Casey", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 18:28:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:27.219492", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T18:28:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/19/422e9c4a0ba830cdffb3367b46cdb20bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5MzU4NTYz-2.72987443.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Mathieu Van Der Poel attacked from that front group along with Andrey Amador on the penultimate climb of the Col de la Croix Montmain, soon leaving Amador behind to set out alone with 47km left.But it was too much for the Dutchman, who was caught midway up the final climb of the Col de la Croix Rosier as the front group swelled to eight.Izagirre had led the chase, but still had the power left to launch the stage-winning move as he arrived at the line 58 seconds clear of Mathieu Burgaudeau and Matteo Jorgenson in second and third.Recommended\u2018Very emotional\u2019 Ion Izagirre thrilled to follow compatriot with Tour stage winMark Cavendish expects recovery to be \u2018number of weeks\u2019 after collarbone surgeryJasper Philipsen cements sprint dominance with another Tour de France winThe Ineos Grenadiers had done much to pace the main contenders in the latter part of the stage, ensuring that Thibaut Pinot\u2019s presence in the breakaway did not threaten Tom Pidcock\u2019s eighth place overall as the Frenchman moved up as far as 10th.The Tour now heads into the Alps with Friday\u2019s stage a 138km test that ends with the climb of the Grand Colombier."}, {"_id": "64b1414b51ac3319749489a0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/marketa-vondrousova-wimbledon-ons-jabeur-ukraine-aryna-sabalenka-b2374918.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon day 11: Ons Jabeur and Marketa Vondrousova deny Ukraine-Belarus final", "lead": "Defeats for Aryna Sabalenka and Elina Svitolina prevented a politically-charged women\u2019s final.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 17:49:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:27.739849", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T17:49:14+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/18/13182627-7f97b9b1-28dd-4d7b-b656-734e9ffef19b.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Jonas Vingegaard retained his 17-second lead over Tadej Pogacar as the Alps loom this weekend, but only after putting a big effort in over the first part of the stage which he admitted could come with a price to pay in the days ahead.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe stage was always seen as one for the breakaway, but it was a war of attrition from the off as the peloton was quickly whittled down to a few dozen riders by a series of attacks.With his Jumbo-Visma team-mates Wout van Aert and and Tiesj Benoot seemingly determined to be in any move, Vingegaard was repeatedly left isolated in the yellow jersey, forced to chase down moves as Jai Hindley, third overall, followed the wheels to protect his own position.It was not until 85 kilometres to go that a 15-strong group got away, but their lead over a peloton reduced to just 39 riders never grew rapidly \u2013 fatigue seemingly having set in for everybody.And having taken half the stage to form, the break lasted less than 40km as a fighting force. Mathieu van der Poel attacked from that front group along with Andrey Amador on the penultimate climb of the Col de la Croix Montmain, soon leaving Amador behind to set out alone with 47km left.But it was too much for the Dutchman, who was caught midway up the final climb of the Col de la Croix Rosier as the front group swelled to eight.Izagirre had led the chase, but still had the power left to launch the stage-winning move as others did not react, instead eyeing his team-mate Guillaume Martin.By the time they did consider a counter, Izagirre had gone, winning the stage by 58 seconds from Mathieu Burgaudeau and Matteo Jorgenson.When Pello Bilbao won Tuesday\u2019s stage 10, it was a first Spanish stage winner in five years. Two days later there was another, both from Basque riders thriving in a race which began in their home region.\u201cI felt strong in the last kilometres,\u201d Izagirre said. \u201cMany things went through my mind. It\u2019s all very emotional. It\u2019s a very Basque Tour de France. It started at home for us and we took two stage wins. I\u2019m happy to follow the line drawn by Pello Bilbao.\u201dThe Ineos Grenadiers had done much to pace the main contenders in the latter part of the stage, ensuring that Thibaut Pinot\u2019s presence in the breakaway did not threaten Tom Pidcock\u2019s eighth place overall as the Frenchman moved up as far as 10th.The Tour now heads into the Alps with Friday\u2019s stage a 138km test that ends with the climb of the Grand Colombier, where Vingegaard may find out if there is anything to pay for Thursday\u2019s efforts.RecommendedOns Jabeur beats Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka to reach another Wimbledon finalNovak Djokovic hopes to hold off the future as he targets eighth Wimbledon titleMark Cavendish expects recovery to be \u2018number of weeks\u2019 after collarbone surgery\u201cEvery race day is full on, and today\u2019s was no exception,\u201d the Dane said. \u201cFrom your perspective, I\u2019m sure this is being a great Tour de France.

She is fulfilling a lot of things the Ukrainians need these days.\u201dAlthough it did not maintain its ban on Russian and Belarusian players, Wimbledon organisers have tried to show they are still on Ukraine\u2019s side, welcoming 1,000 refugees to the Championships and helping Ukrainian players with training and accommodation costs.They are also donating one pound for every fan who comes through the gates to the British Red Cross\u2019 humanitarian work in Ukraine, with the total at \u00a3412,132 after 10 days.Svitolina has spoken at length about the new mindset she has on her return to tennis, as a new mother and as a result of the war, with on-court defeats no longer the disaster they might once have felt.But here she found herself perhaps the favourite against a similarly unexpected semi-finalist \u2013 this was the first time in the open era that a last-four clash here had featured two unseeded players.The freedom with which Svitolina had progressed through her first five rounds was missing, while Vondrousova is also a player who offers a frustrating lack of rhythm.The Czech mixes big hits from the baseline with drop shots, lobs and short angles and she wrapped up the first set in less than half an hour, breaking Svitolina\u2019s serve three times in a row.The fans tried to will Svitolina, who lost both her previous slam semi-finals here and at the US Open in 2019, back into the match in the second set but Vondrousova was firmly in her groove and she moved to the brink of victory at 4-0.The Czech can be a nervous closer and there were definite signs of tension as Svitolina broke twice in succession to claw her way back to 4-3 only to play another poor game, and she looked emotional as she walked off court to a standing ovation.The Ukrainian admitted she has been carrying a lot on her shoulders, saying: \u201cFor sure it\u2019s a big motivation but it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, a lot of tension. I try to balance it as much as I can.\u201cBut sometimes it gets maybe too much. But I don\u2019t want to take it as an excuse that I lost today. I try to take it as a motivation for me. I just hope that Ukrainian people continue supporting me. It was really amazing. And I just hope that I\u2019m going to get another chance.\u201dA year ago, Vondrousova came to Wimbledon to watch best friend Miriam Kolodziejova in qualifying with her wrist in a cast after surgery and she did not play a match between April and October.That she has reached another slam final on grass is of particular surprise to Vondrousova, who said: \u201cHere on grass, it was almost impossible. I didn\u2019t play many matches on grass before. My best one was second round (at Wimbledon). It\u2019s even crazier that this is happening.\u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve been through, two surgeries, it\u2019s not always easy to come back. You don\u2019t know if you can play at this level and if you can be back at the top and back at these tournaments. I just feel like I\u2019m just grateful to be on a court again, to play without pain.\u201dRecommendedNovak Djokovic hopes to hold off the future as he targets eighth Wimbledon titleMark Cavendish expects recovery to be \u2018number of weeks\u2019 after collarbone surgeryDeli finds plenty of allies after moving interview \u2013 Thursday\u2019s sporting socialVondrousova will have two extra supporters for the final against Ons Jabeur, meanwhile, with her husband Stepan Simek abandoning cat-sitting duties to fly to London.\u201cHe\u2019s coming tomorrow with my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cWe texted the cat sitter to come to our home.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1414d51ac3319749489a9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/dele-alli-interview-abuse-drugs-gary-neville-overlap-b2374517.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dele Alli reveals childhood drug dealing, sexual abuse and sleeping pill addiction", "lead": "<p>Everton midfielder Alli spoke candidly about his trauma and recently checking into a mental health rehab facility </p>", "author": "Mark Mann-Bryans", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 16:30:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:29.260044", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T16:30:14+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/10/Image1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

At seven, I started smoking, eight I started dealing drugs.\u201cAn older person told me that they wouldn\u2019t stop a kid on a bike, so I rode around with my football, and then underneath I\u2019d have the drugs, that was eight. Eleven, I was hung off a bridge by a guy from the next estate, a man.\u201cTwelve, I was adopted \u2013 and from then, it was like... I was adopted by an amazing family, like I said, I couldn\u2019t have asked for better people to do what they\u2019d done for me. If God created people, it was them.\u201cThere were a number of times my adopted family and my brother \u2013 you know, it makes me sad \u2013 they would take me to rooms crying, asking me to just speak to them, tell them what I\u2019m thinking, how I\u2019m feeling, and I just couldn\u2019t do it because I wanted to deal with it by myself.\u201dDele Alli said he had mostly hidden his difficulties during his football career  (Sky Sports)After signing for Tottenham from MK Dons, Alli enjoyed a fine run of form that culminated in playing a key role in England\u2019s progress to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018. But he was still battling in silence off the pitch \u2013 leading to a \u201cscary\u201d addiction to sleeping pills and a reliance on alcohol.\u201cI got addicted to sleeping tablets and it\u2019s probably a problem that not only I have, I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s going around more than people realise in football,\u201d he said.\u201cI think, without me realising it, the things I was doing to numb the feelings I had... I didn\u2019t realise I was doing it for that purpose, whether it be drinking or whatever.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about numbers but it was definitely way too much, and there were some scary moments I had.\u201cTo take a sleeping tablet and be ready for the next day is fine, but when you\u2019re broken as I am, it can obviously have the reverse effect because it does work for the problems you want to deal with.\u201cThat is the problem \u2013 it works until it doesn\u2019t. So yes, I definitely abused them too much. It is scary, now I\u2019m out of it and I look back on it.\u201cProbably the saddest moment for me, was when [Jose] Mourinho was [Tottenham] manager, I think I was 24. I remember there was one session, like one morning I woke up and I had to go to training \u2013 this is when he\u2019d stopped playing me \u2013 and I was in a bad place.\u201cI mean, it sounds dramatic but I was literally staring in the mirror \u2013 and I was asking if I could retire now, at 24, doing the thing I love. For me, that was heartbreaking to even have had that thought at 24, to want to retire. That hurt me a lot, that was another thing that I had to carry.\u201dAlli has opened up in public about his issues for the first time  (Sky Sports)Alli said that he had largely been able to mask his difficulties during his football career but to the detriment of his mental health.He added: \u201cTo be honest, I was caught in a bad cycle. I was relying on things that were doing me harm and, yeah, I think I was waking up every day and I was winning the fight, you know, going into training, smiling, showing that I was happy.\u201cBut inside, I was definitely losing the battle and it was time for me to change it because when I got injured and they told me I needed surgery, I could feel the feelings I had when the cycle begins and I didn\u2019t want it to happen any more.Recommended\u2018Powerful and brave\u2019: Dele Alli praised for interview about abuse and addictionLiverpool announce star striker Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez takes No. 9 shirtLionesses bonus row could drag on until after World Cup\u201cSo, I went there [rehab], I went there for six weeks and Everton were amazing about it, you know.

Dubois, 25, is not the Briton that fans wanted to see take on Uysk, 36, but talks between the unbeaten Ukrainian and Tyson Fury fell through this spring. As a result, this match-up came about, as did Fury vs Francis Ngannou \u2013 which was announced on Tuesday.

He\u2019s a nice man, a nice guy, a nice athlete. He came to the position of mandatory, so he deserves it, but let\u2019s stop talking; let\u2019s see each other on 26 August.\u201dWhen asked if he had a message for Dubois, Usyk simply said, \u201cI am the message myself,\u201d before launching into a rap after their face-off.The Ukrainian, an Olympic gold medalist, previously reigned as the only undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era. After moving up to heavyweight, he beat Anthony Joshua to win the unified titles, which he retained against \u201cAJ\u201d in their rematch last summer \u2013 again defeating the Briton on points.Meanwhile, Dubois last fought in December, stopping Kevin Lerena after recovering from three knockdowns, two of which were caused by a knee injury. Dubois (19-1, 18 KOs) has since had surgery to resolve the issue.Egis Klimas, Usyk\u2019s manager, said: \u201cWe were introduced to Daniel Dubois as a killer. All that speed, all that power, he\u2019s gonna come to knock Oleksandr Usyk out, as I understand it. First of all, to knock someone out, you need to touch them.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSteve Borthwick mops at his brow, the England head coach feeling the heat. The sun shines bright in the Veneto, where Borthwick and his side have decamped for a vital week of hot weather training. This summer of preparation is all the more important after squandering a World Cup cycle, four years of work having to be done almost on fast forward.There are certainly worse places for those preparations to intensify, but with temperatures up over 40C, and the humidity stifling as they train, England\u2019s players are not finding Verona quite so fair.\u201cWhen we introduced to the players why we\u2019ve come to this camp in Verona to train in the heat, one of the reasons was for physical adaptation,\u201d Borthwick explains. \u201cThere are physiological benefits to training in a more temperate climate. I think that will be beneficial for us.\u201cIt also affects the way you think. When you train in the heat, and I\u2019ve seen it and experienced it as a player, it is important to think clearly under a different type of pressure and challenge the players to think in the situations we give them when they\u2019re under the physical and emotional strain of training in the heat. That\u2019s also a factor.\u201dSome teams prefer to test themselves at altitude. Wales, for example, are up in the Alps at a favoured mountain retreat of Warren Gatland. England, with only one spare week to take the squad away, elected for trial by fire instead.RecommendedHow Erling Haaland could help England hopeful reach Rugby World CupEngland announce Rugby World Cup training squad as Owen Farrell named captain Stuart Hogg retires from rugby ahead of World CupBen Youngs warms up before a training session (Getty)Beyond the obvious benefits of a week of training, a few days away offer an opportunity for a squad to further bond, build relationships and keep things fresh, away from England\u2019s regular Teddington and Bagshot bases. All 41 of England\u2019s fit training squad members travelled and trained fully; Ollie Lawrence, one of several injury absentees, has come, too, with England hopeful the centre will be fit for their second warm-up game.Verona, at first, seems an odd choice, the local rugby side of little renown, lurking in the second tier of Italy\u2019s domestic structure \u2013 Serie A\u2019s Hellas Verona are the town\u2019s sporting obsession. But the Payanini Centre is a first-rate facility, built by a family of aggregate magnates and utilised by the Italian national side before the Six Nations. England went to Treviso four years ago, a trip that ended with an infamous bust-up between Ben Te\u2019o and Mike Brown that ended the pair\u2019s international careers. For various reasons, a return to the city was not favoured by Borthwick.England\u2019s staff now includes Aled Walters, appointed to lead the strength and conditioning programme. Walters\u2019 performance expertise was highly valued as Borthwick turned around Leicester, and, before that, the affable Welshman was the fitness guru for South Africa\u2019s 2019 World Cup winners.England\u2019s physical readiness is a key point targeted for improvement. The gap that must be closed to the top four sides in the world is vast and, while they will be aided by a friendly draw in France, time is tight. There is, then, an emphasis on making sure the non-negotiables are right. England may not be the biggest or best team at the World Cup, but they hope to be among the fittest.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be physically equipped for the toughest situations in a game,\u201d Borthwick says. \u201cThere are extreme moments within a game and Test matches are so tight. So, if you are not conditioned for those extreme moments, those are the ones which can make or break you.\u201cIf you are conditioned better than the opposition for those extreme moments, you get the crucial score in a game. If not, you might concede the crucial score, or you make a poor decision.\u201dSteve Borthwick holds an England training session (Getty)Given time off between a morning strength session and evening training, a number of players elected to go into the city itself, grappling with electric scooters by the Roman amphitheatre \u2013 new meeting old. There is that sense about this England squad, too. Beyond the young guns like Tom Willis and Henry Arundell, there is heaps of experience. Two players namechecked repeatedly by Borthwick since his selection first assembled have been Danny Care and Joe Marler, the Harlequins pair included to add a bit of attacking invention and set-piece solidity respectively.RecommendedStuart Hogg retires from rugby ahead of World CupSouth Africa demolish Australia in Rugby ChampionshipAustralia handed Rugby Championship boost with co-captain injury updateEngland know they are up against it. The final squad of 33 for the World Cup will be named on 7 August, giving Borthwick just a single warm-up game to assess his options. Attitude, intensity and accuracy in these early weeks will be key as the head coach tries to narrow his selection down. And while the graft may be hard, if England transform themselves into genuine tournament contenders the summer swelter will be worth it.\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge I\u2019ve given to the players,\u201d says Borthwick. \u201cI give them why we\u2019re doing something; I don\u2019t try and trick them. I say what we\u2019re doing and the purpose behind it. The challenge is for them to excel, to bring their very best and we\u2019ll move a bit further forward today.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s players could have to wait until after the Women\u2019s World Cup for the stand-off over bonuses to be resolved, as there is still no sign of a breakthrough in negotiations between the Football Association (FA) and Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA), who are representing manager Sarina Wiegman\u2019s group.The tournament begins on 20 July and the dispute centres on the squad\u2019s argument that the governing body should already have in place an agreed performance-based bonus structure that is independent of the Fifa prize money, in the same way that both Australia and the USA teams do. The governing bodies of those countries have agreed deals in excess of the 60 per cent of prize money guaranteed by Fifa, with both heavily performance-related. As it is, the only performance-based payment England are assured is from Fifa. Fifa\u2019s new stipulations mean that every player at the World Cup will be guaranteed at least $30,000 (\u00a323,000), with that drastically increasing the further teams go. The team that lifts the trophy will be guaranteed $270,000 (\u00a3206,000) per squad member.A major point of principle for the England players is also that the Euro 2022 victory offered the opportunity to immediately clarify all this but that didn\u2019t really happen. It is only in the last 10 days that a concrete offer has been put on the table. This has made the players less willing to just accept agreement after the World Cup, and has fostered a frustration now that they are already in Australia.RecommendedWomen\u2019s football \u2018could be billion-pound industry\u2019 claims Karen CarneyAddicted players urged to contact PFA after Dele Alli\u2019s \u2018scary\u2019 pill revelationKai Havertz, Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber \u2013 this is Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal nowThe FA were part of a group of federations that worked with Fifa to stipulate a hard percentage that should go directly to players, and The Independent understands that figure will of course be honoured. The players\u2019 representatives have also been told, however, that it might be better for all parties to discuss bonuses after the World Cup as there could naturally be a huge difference in \u201ccommercial uplift\u201d depending on whether the team, for example, reach the quarter-finals or win the tournament. The arguments put forward by the PFA on the players\u2019 behalf, however, are that this is lacking in transparency and that it would be better for all concerned if it would be settled beforehand. As numerous involved sources have also insisted, it is a situation that would simply \u201cnever happen\u201d in the men\u2019s game.\u201cCan you imagine telling them we\u2019ll discuss it when we\u2019re back,\u201d one said.The players also feel that their demands are in keeping with the \u201cworld-leading\u201d side the Lionesses are supposed to now be, as reflected by the comparisons with Australia and USA.RecommendedLucy Bronze says \u2018it\u2019s a shame\u2019 women have to fight for change amid bonus rowEllen White tips \u2018proven winner\u2019 Sarina Wiegman to lead England to further gloryTalking points as England fly out ahead of Women\u2019s World CupThe FA, whose discussions are handled by the commercial team, are pointing to the different dynamics of this competition \u2013 especially as it is the first 32-squad World Cup in the women\u2019s game. There is also the issue that Fifa\u2019s 60 per cent stipulation means the prize money from the governing body does not fully cover the travel costs for a hugely expensive tournament, in the manner that customarily happens with such funds. While the FA will of course cover all of that, it is one additional factor complicating discussions over the prospective budget for this World Cup and commercial income.Lucy Bronze has spoken out in frustration over the bonuses situation  (PA Wire)The governing body have attempted to assure the players that they will get fair reward for their contributions, but the PFA naturally want clarity now, especially as commercial income for the team has \u201cskyrocketed\u201d in the last year.

During a press conference on Thursday, Crabtree-Ireland alleged that a proposal from Hollywood studios was to use \u201cgroundbreaking AI\u201d to scan background performers and only offer them a day\u2019s pay while the companies get to own the scans and use them for any project they want.\u201cThis \u2018groundbreaking\u2019 AI proposal that they gave us yesterday, they proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day\u2019s pay, and their companies should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity on any project they want, with no consent and no compensation,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you think that\u2019s a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again.\u201dA statement from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) that represents the studios claimed the \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d proposal \u201cprotects actors\u2019 digital likenesses for SAG-AFTRA members\u201d.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

But too many people are using it against us and using it to create mediocrity. They\u2019re also in violation of copyright. They\u2019re also plagiarising,\u201d Michael Winship, president of the WGA East, said in May.With these risks in mind, the WGA seeks more safeguards on how AI can be applied to the screenwriting process.RecommendedActors strike could last at least six months - liveJohn Cusack rails against \u2018legendary\u2019 Hollywood greed as actors\u2019 strike beginsNetflix has quietly added one of the best films of 2023In a recent interview with The Independent, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend writer Rachel Bloom said that AI creates \u201cformulaic\u201d writing, but feared that execs would use AI-generated scripts as a jumping-off point which writers would be asked to hone.\u201cIf you are not artistically ambitious and you\u2019re like, \u2018I just want... a formulaic but passable script, that\u2019s very scary,\u201d she said. \u201c[AI] doesn\u2019t yet extrapolate in the way that writers do, but it very well could very soon.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1415051ac3319749489b6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/john-cusack-actor-strikes-say-anything-b2375245.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "John Cusack rails against \u2018legendary\u2019 Hollywood greed as actors\u2019 strike begins", "lead": "<p>Star of Eighties teen romcom \u2018Say Anything\u2019 suggested Fox wasn\u2019t completely honest about how much money film made</p>", "author": "Nicole Vassell", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:27:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:32.059263", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T11:27:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/10/Collage%20Maker-14-Jul-2023-10-36-AM-5324.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse LoughreyGet our The Life Cinematic email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cUnpolished\u201d is how Rita Ora describes the sound of her third album, You & I. At least, by comparison to 2018\u2019s Phoenix. But there\u2019s still a shiny \u2013 and slightly deflective \u2013 sheen over this solid collection of 12 radio-ready pop songs. It\u2019s weird that despite her impressive vocal range and power, Ora\u2019s emotion often feels more TV-talent-show-performed than deeply owned. \u201cI lost a part of me trying so hard to please/ I just find my echo/ Now I\u2019m trying to let go\u201d she admits towards the end of the album.The singer, 32, has got a narrative you want to get behind. She\u2019s a refugee who fled Kosovo for London during her childhood. Her mum (a psychiatrist) is her biggest fan, and she earned her stripes singing in her dad\u2019s pub. She was signed to Jay Z\u2019s Roc Nation label at 18 and released her platinum-selling debut Ora in 2012. After a messy split from Roc Nation (Ora claims she had recorded material the label failed to release), she bounced back (on Atlantic) with the forgettably fun Phoenix. Over the past decade, she\u2019s clocked 10 billion global streams and held the record for the most Top 10 singles for a British female artist. She\u2019s sung at the Oscars, the Vatican, and for then-president Barack Obama. Props.This album was written in the wake of Ora\u2019s marriage to New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi last year \u2013 its upbeat mood is buoyed by the confidence that comes with stability. Those who\u2019ve worried if love is ever coming their way will relate to \u201cWaiting for You\u201d, on which Ora confides: \u201cI had enough/ Given up/ Watched all my friends get married/ Lonely under the chandelier\u2026\u201d But then the song shakes off angst like a raincoat and explodes onto the dance floor in a bright burst of chunky synth chords. Single \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice\u201d finds her plunging headfirst into romance. Melodramatic strings give way to a more prosaic, head-nodder of a four/four beat as the singer urges her lover on: \u201cHeaven is a shot in the dark/ So shoot with your heart\u2026 and aim for love.\u201d Any potential tension of the moment, however, is undercut by the \u201cnah-nahs\u201d, which feel rather cynically engineered to make the song easier for listeners to hum along with. Instead of seizing the moment for a once-in-a-lifetime passion, you get the sense of songwriters trying to give you something to keep you from boredom in traffic.\u201cPraising You\u201d (ft Fatboy Slim) picks up the pace. It\u2019s a slick evolution of Norman Cook\u2019s original, on which Ora sounds genuinely jubilant \u2013 arms aloft and giddy for it. She also gets a tantalising little Stevie Nicks-esque vocal scratch going on \u201cUnfeel It\u201d. To a murky beat and thready pizzicato pulse, she rails against having her \u201cheart locked\u201d: \u201cF*** you I love you/ I\u2019m freaking out.\u201dThe title track is a series of big swells that don\u2019t stick \u2013 the sort of ballad that plays you out of the cinema. \u201cShape of Me\u201d comes stacked with more determined grit as Ora pays tribute to her mother repeatedly reassuring her through her troubles: \u201cIt\u2019s OK though/ Use this s*** as ammo\u201d. \u201cNotting Hill\u201d is a piano ballad that finds Ora nostalgic for the days when she sold sneakers on Portobello Road and thought breaking up with her teen boyfriend was the end of her world. It\u2019s sweet and ought to let us into the specifics of her world \u2013 and yet, still it feels generic. You & I is strong enough to sell well. You\u2019re bound to find yourself dancing to it at some point over the summer. It\u2019s safe. Still polished. Nothing special.RecommendedRita Ora reflects on breaching lockdown rules: \u2018You should ask Boris about that\u2019Mad Cool festival is still settling into its new home \u2013 reviewLana Del Rey returns self-assured and impressive post-Glastonbury debacle \u2013 review"}, {"_id": "64b1415351ac3319749489c7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/sag-strike-house-of-the-dragon-continue-filming-b2375031.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "House of the Dragon hit with backlash for continuing filming despite SAG-AFTRA strike", "lead": "<p>UK law prohibits Equity union from legally calling a strike in support of SAG-AFTRA</p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 04:33:42", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:35.360733", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T04:33:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/12/27/15/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Impressively, it managed this feat while being released in half the number of screens as the new Indiana Jones film, which marks Harrison Ford\u2019s final adventure as the popular character.The film, titled Sound of Freedom, comes from director and co-writer Alejandro Monteverde and was shot in 2018, with its release delayed due to Covid. The film came to fruition after distributor Angel Studios launched a crowdfunder in order to earn enough money to market the film.In just two weeks, the crowdfunder \u2013 endorsed by Caviezel\u2019s Passion of the Christ director Mel Gibson \u2013 succeeded in amassing the studios\u2019 goal of $5m (\u00a33.8m), which was donated by 7,000 people.RecommendedDavid Tennant savagely roasts Alex Jones during One Show interview\u2018No need to infantalise her\u2019: Fans defend Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy\u2019s age gap in OppenheimerCara Delevingne explains why she turned down Martin Brundle F1 interview requestThe film is purported to be based on real events, with Caviezel\u2019s character embarking on a mission to rescue children from sex traffickers in Colombia. The lead role is inspired by anti-human trafficking activist Tim Ballard, whose story has been questioned by researchers since 2020.In the past, Ballard has credited his organisation Operation Underground Railroad (OUR) with saving thousand of trafficking victims.However, according to American Crime Journal investigative reporters Lynn Packer and Damion Moore, Ballard embellished details about the story depicted in Sound of Freedom.Caviezel himself has courted controversy in recent years. In 2021, the actor supported certain claims made by the conspiracy theory known as QAnon.The far-right-supported theory, claimed to be formulated by someone who has seen classified government materials, circulated in 2021, and made baseless claims that devil-worshipping paedophiles were working for the US government.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

It\u2019s very difficult to make that connection when it\u2019s actually based on a true story.\u201dIn 2020, he also suggested the belief that QAnon shares unfounded theories, telling The New York Times: \u201cSome of these theories have allowed people to open their eyes, so now it\u2019s our job to flood the space with real information so the facts can be shared.\u201dHowever, Caviezel didn\u2019t help matters when promoting the film at at a QAnon-affiliated conference in Oklahoma in 2021. While participating, he said Ballard was currently \u201csaving children\u201d from \u201cadrenochroming\u201d,\u00a0a conspiracy theory that claims traffickers drain children\u2019s blood to harvest a life-enhancing substance called adrenochrome.When asked to elaborate, Caviezel said: \u201cIf a child knows he\u2019s going to die, his body will secrete this adrenaline. These people that do it, there\u2019ll be no mercy for them.\u201d He then appeared to conflate the theory with events in the movie, calling Sound of Freedom \u201cone of the best films I\u2019ve ever done in my life\u201d.Despite the controversy, Sound of Freedom is attracting a large audience \u2013 and has grossed $41.7m (\u00a332.3m) from a budget of just $14.5m (\u00a311.2m).\u2018Sound of Freedom\u2019 actor Jim Caviezel has supported QAnon theories (Angel Studios)Brandon Purdie, head of theatrical distribution at Angel Studios, said the figures have \u201cexceeded our expectations\u201d.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeI\u2019m fed up with the idiots,\u201d Sean Connery once said, upon announcing he was quitting Hollywood. \u201cThe ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\u201d This was in 2005, two years after the release of what would end up his final film: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a comic-book adaptation so cursed that the history-making floods that derailed its production may have been nature\u2019s way of telling everyone involved that trouble was afoot.It\u2019s been 20 years since the League assembled, Avengers-style. That was the idea, at least. Based on the comic-book series by writer Alan Moore and artist Kevin O\u2019Neill, it\u2019s a riff on the traditional superhero team-up story. But instead of superheroes, The League is comprised of a collection of Victorian literary characters, all of whom band together to save the world. Like The Avengers, the film was also an attempt at kickstarting a mega-franchise. But due to its troubled journey to the screen and all-round critical shoeing, it never happened.In LXG, Connery plays League leader Allan Quatermain, the colonial adventurer from King Solomon\u2019s Mines. The film\u2019s final showdown sees him fight to the death with Professor Moriarty (Richard Roxburgh), the arch-nemesis of Sherlock Holmes, but the real battle was happening behind-the-scenes, and between Connery and director Stephen Norrington (who previously directed the well-received Blade). As reported in a set visit by Entertainment Weekly, tensions between the star and his director almost came to fisticuffs, after Norrington shut down production for an entire day \u2013 because he didn\u2019t like an elephant gun prop. The 72-year-old Connery \u2013 a long-tenured, formidable star who did not like to be kept waiting \u2013 was \u201clivid\u201d and threatened to get the director fired. Norrington challenged Connery by screaming, \u201cI\u2019m sick of it! Come on, I want you to punch me in the face!\u201dBig words, of course. This was Sean Connery \u2013 007 himself. The man who broke out of Alcatraz (and then back in again) in The Rock, who took on Al Capone in The Untouchables, who pilfered the Soviets\u2019 best nuclear sub in The Hunt for Red October \u2013 the man whom League co-star Jason Flemyng tells me he always called \u201cBig Sean\u201d. As an unnamed friend of Connery\u2019s said to the New York Daily News: \u201cIf they came to blows, do you think Norrington would be alive?\u201d Flemyng \u2013 who played Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in LXG \u2013 sums up the Connery vs Norrington feud more delicately. \u201cBig Sean and the guv\u2019nor were not getting on great,\u201d he laughs.Though tensions were high, actor Stuart Townsend \u2013 who played the LXG\u2019s best, smarmiest character Dorian Gray \u2013 never saw any of the well-reported bust-ups. \u201cWhenever I was on set, everyone was having a great time,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAs I\u2019d go, or just before I arrived on set there\u2019d be a huge fight.\u201dRecommendedAngus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, as told by its stars: \u2018I still get asked \u2013 are you Slaggy Lindsay?\u2019Hulk smash! Eric Bana\u2019s vilified Marvel flop deserved so much better\u2018All of a sudden, the clothes are flying off\u2019: Plot twists, full frontal nudity and the X-rated making of Wild ThingsThe original LXG comic was first published in 1999. Film producer Don Murphy heard about it while on the phone to Alan Moore himself. At the time, Murphy was developing another adaptation of Moore\u2019s work \u2013 his Jack the Ripper graphic novel, From Hell, which would ultimately be made with stars Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Moore \u2013 who also wrote the seminal Watchmen and V for Vendetta \u2013 is notoriously grumpy about adaptations of his comics (\u201cI would be the last person to want to sit through any adaptations of my work,\u201d he told GQ last year. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard of them, it would be enormously punishing.\u201d) Still, Murphy took the idea to 20th Century Fox. The studio head loved it. \u201cIt became this project that you always knew was going to get made because the idea was such a crazy but original good one,\u201d Murphy said in a making-of documentary.Like Moore\u2019s other work, there is an air of highfalutin smugness about the original comic. Though it\u2019s brilliant, of course \u2013 rich with commentary on colonialism, suffragettes, industrial scale arms, and 19th-century sleaze. The film version, adapted by British comics writer James Robinson, was inevitably dumbed down \u2013 a by-the-numbers, getting-the-band-together origin tale. This was a time when the average CGI-powered blockbuster was only as deep as its new-fangled computer effects. And lots of them were very average in the late Nineties and early Noughties: the Mummy films, Wild Wild West, Pearl Harbor, Men in Black II and the Star Wars prequels, to name just a handful.\n\nAfter the premiere, my thought was, \u2018Jesus, was that really worth six months of my life?\u2019 Stuart TownsendIn LXG, the League must stop Moriarty (masquerading as \u201cM\u201d in a bit of gimmicky post-modernism) from starting a world war. \u201cThere will be others like me!\u201d he warns, marking himself as an OG Hitler. The movie League consists of Allan Quatermain (Connery), Dracula\u2019s would-be bride Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), the split-personalitied Jekyll and Hyde (Flemyng), a crafty, cockney Invisible Man (Tony Curran), Oscar Wilde\u2019s immortal hedonist heartthrob, Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), and the legendary submariner, Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.Fox couldn\u2019t secure the film rights to all the characters from the comic. Fu Manchu was dropped and The Invisible Man became an average, run-of-the-mill invisible man, not the specific one from the HG Wells book. To appease American cinemagoers, classic literary hero Tom Sawyer (Shane West) was also added to the line-up. There was some grumbling at the time. It\u2019s a peculiarly British irritation: studios changing things to pander to American audiences (see also, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone becoming \u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d, or Americans muscling in on The Great Escape).Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

For Connery, it was also too much like the effects-heavy Lord of the Rings and Matrix films, both of which he was offered and turned down. Connery didn\u2019t understand any of them. LOTR may have actually been a factor in Connery accepting LXG. Asked to play the role of Gandalf in exchange for a share in the film\u2019s profits, he missed out on an Eye of Sauron-watering $350m. Connery didn\u2019t miss out this time: he was paid an impressive $17m for LXG. \u201cBig Sean was paid a lot of money but wasn\u2019t massively interested in making films,\u201d remembers Flemyng. \u201cHe wanted to be playing golf.\u201dOrigin story: The volume one cover of Alan Moore\u2019s \u2018The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\u2019  (WildStorm/DC)The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen certainly had money-spinning potential. Comic book movies were the hot new trend, and director Norrington should have been a sure bet. His Blade was \u2013 Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man films aside \u2013 the slickest of the pre-MCU Marvel movies. LXG was also a major production, costing a reported $75-$95m. Based mainly in Prague, the production built recreations of Venice \u2013 \u201cbrick-by-brick\u201d says Flemying \u2013 and Nairobi, with livestock, actors, and everything else flown in. \u201cThe size of that film\u2026 it was the kind of thing I always dreamt about making,\u201d he adds. But that came with big problems. \u201cThis was a big studio movie with a lot of interference and a lot of politics.\u201dTwenty years on, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen doesn\u2019t live up to its bad rep: it\u2019s not quite that bad, and certainly no worse (though no better) than any number of CGI-powered studio films from the time. It whips through clunky lines and clich\u00e9s, always rushing to get to the next punch-up, but it has good instincts for practical effects thanks to Norrington\u2019s SFX background and a strong team. \u201cThere was no area of that film where the talent was lacking,\u201d says Flemyng. \u201cThey were paying the best money \u2013 everyone was the best they could be.\u201dThe most impressive creation is Flemyng\u2019s Mr Hyde \u2013 a 45lb full-body suit made from eight main parts, 6,000 components, and animatronic hands. It took seven hours to get Flemyng suited up. He recalls getting into the Hyde gear for the first time and being surrounded by producers. \u201cThey were all looking at me going, \u2018It\u2019s amazing!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ve got one question \u2013 how do I go to the toilet?\u2019 Everybody looked at each other and said, \u2018We didn\u2019t think of that\u2026\u2019\u201dThe Jekyll/Hyde transformations are the film\u2019s best bits \u2013 he is a discombobulating, juddering monstrosity \u2013 and in the spirit of what LXG should have been: an image of old-school horror leaping out from the shadows and grime of the Victorian era.Transformer: Jason Flemyng in \u2018The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\u2019  (Shutterstock)The production had a major problem, though, that went beyond politics and fallings out: the weather. Following weeks of intense rainfall across Europe in the summer of 2002, Prague suffered its worst floods in a century. The floods destroyed $7m worth of sets. Connery fled his hotel amid the chaos and only managed to rescue his golf clubs. \u201cIronically, our submarine set was 13 ft underwater,\u201d Townsend says.\u201cWe lost all our sets, we lost everything,\u201d adds Flemyng. \u201cFinancially, that was a huge bind. We had to leave everything and go to Malta \u2013 to spend way too long on bits that weren\u2019t scheduled to be filmed yet \u2013 while they rebuilt the sets in Prague.\u201d\u201cWhen we came back it was like another production,\u201d says Townsend. \u201cNo one knew what was going on, there was no finish date. It was like doing two movies.\u201dAs for the alleged star vs director feud, Connery described the friction to The Scotsman while the film was still in production. \u201cThere have been differences of opinion about almost everything,\u201d Connery said. \u201cProfessional differences, personal differences, you name it. But my philosophy has been to shoot the movie and talk about right and wrong afterwards. To be honest, I just want to complete the picture. That\u2019s all I want right now.\u201dSo, what was the problem? A matter of respect, perhaps, between an old-timer who liked things done a certain way and a young hotshot? Townsend recalls Norrington being \u201ca total rebel\u201d and \u201ca total \u2018f*** you, Hollywood\u2019 guy. But an amazing director.\u201d\u201cI think Big Sean\u2019s instincts were right and deserved to be listened to,\u201d says Flemyng. \u201cOn the other side, I think Norrington was really creative and a really huge character \u2013 he\u2019s a filmmaker and he had an opinion. And it was important that his concept for how it should be was listened to. I don\u2019t think either of them were listened to enough \u2013 by each other or by the studio.\u201dAccording to reports, Norrington only supervised the editing on a small portion of the film. Connery, however, got stuck into post-production, trying to knock the film into the best possible shape. Editor Paul Rubell was credited with getting the final cut over the line. Norrington was also absent from the premiere at the Venetian casino in Las Vegas. Connery looked like he was having a blast, arriving at the Venetian in a gondola. He also took some more jabs at the director. When asked where Norrington was, Connery quipped, \u201cHave you checked the local asylum?\u201d After repeated questions about Norrington, Connery said, \u201cAsk me about someone I like, will you? \u2026 Everyone else in the film was a pleasure to work with. Not him.\u201dAvengers (not) assembled: Jason Flemyng, Stuart Townsend, Naseeruddin Shah, Sean Connery, Peta Wilson, Tony Curran and Shane West in \u2018The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\u2019  (Shutterstock)Certainly, the cast had fun with Connery. \u201cBig Sean couldn\u2019t have been more lovely,\u201d says Flemyng. \u201cHe had the devil in him and a twinkle in his eye.\u201d Townsend enjoyed the experience but recalls his reaction to the film at that premiere: \u201cMy thought was, \u2018Jesus, was that really worth six months of my life?\u201dCritics were similarly unsure. \u201cIt\u2019s just so silly you have to like it \u2013 sort of,\u201d wrote The Guardian. \u201cBut once the novelty wears off, you are left with a very over-egged pudding low on real thrills.\u201d The Independent called it \u201cone to avoid\u2026 silly, inept and very ordinary\u201d. LXG performed strongly the first weekend of its release and made an eventual $179.3m \u2013 not a disaster. Needless to say, a sequel \u2013 which is teased in the film\u2019s final scene \u2013 never happened. \u201cBig Sean wasn\u2019t up for that,\u201d says Flemying.But did it really make Connery quit acting? \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d says Townsend. \u201cHis passion had definitely left him by that stage.

Peter, meanwhile, has his guard up after Catherine inadvertently butchers his double, Pugachev (also Hoult), in revenge. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some difficulties,\u201d Catherine tells her couples\u2019 confessor. \u201cApparently marriage has challenges,\u201d Peter adds in understatement.After the toing and froing for control in the first seasons of The Great, the balance of power seems to have settled: Catherine the iron-fisted administrator of the Russian realm, and Peter the amoral playboy at her side. For them, the stakes are life and death, but for the advisors around them there\u2019s still room for political manoeuvring. Orlo (Sacha Dhawan) is on the out, while the stars of Elizabeth (Belinda Bromilow) and Archie (Adam Godley) are rising. This is a more pragmatic, less ideological, era of the revolution. \u201cI will happily watch you gun down the disloyal friends who I love,\u201d Georgina (Charity Wakefield) proclaims grimly. \u201cThis is all getting very disturbing,\u201d Marial (Phoebe Fox) adds, succinctly.Those familiar with The Great will need no introduction to its tone or style but, for the uninitiated, it is an intoxicating combination of the rambunctious absurdity of sketch comedy and the lavish historicism of great period drama. Australian writer-creator Tony McNamara (who also co-wrote The Favourite, if you are in need of further confirmation of timbre) has enormous fun with the court machinations and the characters who people them. Particularly delicious is Hoult\u2019s Peter, who maintains his abominable, and intransigent, charisma (the performance must be modelled on a young Hugh Grant, Hoult\u2019s About a Boy co-star). \u201cI once killed three men and ate a whole reindeer stuffed with a goose, stuffed with a pomegranate,\u201d he blithely announces over dinner. \u201cF***ing amazing.\u201dThe Great has always been typified by an ahistorical, anachronistic interpretation of the reign of a woman who loomed over Russia for more than three decades. That naturally engenders the question of whether this relentless stylism is sustainable, especially as the years pass and Fanning continues to look like the Catherine of the 1740s (and no later). McNamara handles this by introducing a sitcom quality to proceedings, with B-plots involving duels to the death between 11-year-old boys and horses who will not copulate and produce a \u201cEuropean superhorse\u201d. It is, of course, by its own proclamation an \u201coccasionally true story\u201d, in much the same way that Fargo was \u201ca true story\u201d. For all concerned, this is a liberation \u2013 though events do, at times, feel like they are heading towards a narrative cul de sac.RecommendedI\u2019m a Virgo review: One of the most urgent, intense pieces of television in recent yearsBlack Mirror season six review: Charlie Brooker\u2019s sci-fi mishmash needs to stop messing with a winning formulaBest Interests review: Unflinching Sharon Horgan drama imagines parents\u2019 ultimate nightmareIf it does run out of momentum before Catherine can reach old age and infirmity (and the horse sex rumours), then it will have been quite the ride to get there.

The union says the staff \u2013 who run check in, baggage handling and aircraft dispatch \u2013 are paid \u201ca pittance\u201d.The ground-handling companies involved are ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services Ltd.The first strike is from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August, with a repeat a week later: Friday 4 August until Tuesday 8 August.A Gatwick spokesperson said although the airport did not employ the staff directly, it would work with the ground handles to ensure \u201cas many flights as possible operate as scheduled\u201d.RecommendedAirport drop-off charges for drivers and how to avoid themYour rights if your easyJet Gatwick flight this summer is cancelledHoliday chaos for 180,000 as easyJet cancels 1,700 flightsBut with memories of the chaos of summer 2022, when ground-handling shortcomings caused massive disruption across the UK\u2019s airports, passengers are understandably concerned.These are the key questions and answers.Who exactly is going on strike?Ground handling staff working for four ground-handling companies at Gatwick airport. They are:ASC, handling TuiDHL Services Ltd, handling easyJetGGS, a wholly owned subsidiary of British Airways, handling BA and its sister Spanish airline, VuelingMenzies Aviation, handling Wizz AirWhy are they going on strike?The union says most staff are paid under \u00a312 per hour (the current national minimum wage for an adult is \u00a310.42). The staff, says Unite, have \u201chighly demanding and safety critical roles\u201d. It has been talking to the four companies since January \u201cbut they all have failed to make offers that meets the workers\u2019 expectations\u201d.The union\u2019s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said she is \u201ccommitted to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport\u201d.Unite\u2019s regional officer Dominic Rothwell said: \u201cThis dispute is entirely of the companies\u2019 own making. They have had every opportunity to make our members\u2019 a fair pay offer but have chosen not to do so.\u201dWhat is the likely impact?The walk-outs are planned for days when Gatwick is at full stretch. It is the busiest single-runway airport in the world, and any disruption can rapidly escalate.During the strike period, Gatwick airport is projected to see an average of 441 daily departures, with easyJet being the biggest airline, followed by British Airways, Tui, Vueling and Ryanair.Aviation depends on groups of experienced professionals working together to coordinate the passenger process, baggage handling and dispatch. If the strikes go ahead, and are well supported, it is difficult to see how the affected airlines could operate their full schedule\u00a0\u2013 even with staff brought in from outside.A spokesperson for the airport said: \u201cWe are aware of the recent ballot result. London Gatwick will support the airlines affected, who hold the contracts with the third-party ground handling and check-in companies, with their contingency plans to ensure that as many flights as possible operate as scheduled.\u201dMr Rothwell of Unite said: \u201cStrike action will inevitably cause severe delays, disruption and cancellations across Gatwick\u2019s operations.\u201dWill all the days be equally affected?No. The exact timing of each strike varies depending on the individual company\u2019s shift patterns but all strikes will begin in the early hours of the morning on the 28 July and 4 August and end in the early hours of the morning on 1 and 8 August. Therefore the operations on the Tuesdays, 1 and 8 August, are unlikely to be significantly affected \u2013 except if disruption continues from the preceding four days of strikes.Could it be called off?Yes, there is every chance that it will be; many ground-handling strikes are announced, followed by serious negotiations with the employers, and then called off. However, by calling the strike at the minimum 14 days legally stipulated by employment law, the union has given little time for talks.What if my flight is delayed or cancelled?Normal European air passengers\u2019 rights rules apply. The airline must pay for meals (and, if necessary, accommodation) during a delay. If a flight is cancelled it must get you to your destination as close as possible to the original time of the flights \u2013 including buying a ticket on a rival airline for you if necessary.Didn\u2019t we have this problem last year with ground handlers?There was no significant industrial action, but as the travel industry emerged from the restrictions imposed during the pandemic, ground handling firms faced severe staff shortages \u2013 in some cases leading to last-minute flight cancellations.British Airways, easyJet and Tui cancelled large numbers of departures.Are there any ground-handling companies not going on strike at Gatwick?Yes, for example Dnata, which handles Emirates, jetBlue and Turkish Airlines; and Red Handling, which handles Norwegian, Norse Atlantic and TAP Portugal.Any other trouble on the horizon at Gatwick?RecommendedScammers move in to target easyJet passengers after mass summer flight cancellationsJapan is out of the question so where should they visit?Gatwick second runway moves closer \u2013 with airport challenging HeathrowUnite says: \u201cIn addition to the four companies where an industrial action mandate has already been secured, Unite is also balloting its members at DHL Gatwick Direct, Red Handling and Wilson James.\u201cAll three ballots will close on Monday 31 July if workers vote for industrial action, the strikes in these companies could begin by the middle of next month.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b1415851ac3319749489e1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/passengers-flight-plane-frontier-airlines-usa-b2375219.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mid-air brawl between passengers forces pilot to land plane 700 miles from destination", "lead": "<p>A woman can be seen screaming and threatening fellow passengers  </p>", "author": "Chris Wilson", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:05:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:40.217379", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T11:05:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/14/09/Screenshot%202023-07-14%20at%2009.12.46.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Footage taken by fellow passengers shows the two women involved screaming at each other \u2013 and other passengers \u2013 in a series of threatening, expletive-filled rants. Other passengers can be heard voicing their discontent, repeatedly telling the women to \u201cshut up\u201d. It\u2019s unclear what started the fight between the pair, who appeared to be travelling together. The women began loudly arguing with each other, and one of them was even moved to a different part of the aircraft by a flight attendant. The verbal barrage continued even after they had been moved, with one women seemingly hitting a male passenger on or near the head as she made her way to the toilets.

The Met Office forecast for southern Spain predicts completely clear skies from Saturday 16 to Wednesday 26 July inclusive.Nine Italian cities, including Florence, Bologna and Rome, are on red alert because of the extreme weather. One forecast for the islands of Sicily and Sardinia put the possible temperature as high as 48C (118F).The Cyprus Department of Meteorology says: \u201cThe maximum temperature is expected to reach around 40 degrees Celsius over inland areas and around 32 degrees Celsius over the highest mountainous areas.\u201cDuring Friday and Saturday the temperature is expected to increase further.\u201dAway from the Mediterranean, the landlocked countries of Hungary and Serbia have issued severe heat warnings.What are the health risks \u2013 and how can they be reduced?Young and old traveller, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (especially cardiovascular and respiratory) are particularly susceptible to excess heat.The NHS Scotland Fit For Travel website warns: \u201cExposure to high temperatures can result in loss of fluids and salts.\u201cWhen the body gets overheated, blood is directed away from the centre of the body by relaxation of the blood vessels, this causes sweating and cooling.\u201cRapid dehydration may occur in hot dry conditions.

Symptoms of heat exhaustion include a body temperature above 38C, fast breathing and pulse, dizziness, headache and confusion.\u201cSudden fainting in the heat may occur when travellers are not acclimatised. Fainting occurs when the blood vessels relax to increase the circulation and radiate heat from the skin. This also has the effect of lowering the blood pressure and reducing the blood supply to the brain. Consciousness should quickly return once the person is lying flat.\u201dHow can I reduce the risks?Obvious steps include avoiding being outside during the hottest part of the day (typically 11am-3pm); wearing light, loose clothing and a hat; and drinking plenty of water (possibly with hydration salts). Dark urine is a certain indication you need to up you fluid intake.The NHS say: \u201cLimit physical exertion until you have become acclimatised, most travellers will adapt to higher temperatures in approximately 10 days\u201cClothing should be light and airy \u2013 avoid wearing dark or tight-fitted clothing.\u201cA hand-held personal fan may prove invaluable when it is not possible to escape heat.\u201dAge UK offers advice specifically for older people, which includes the possibly disappointing recommendation: \u201cAvoid alcohol, and keep eating even if you\u2019re not feeling too hungry.\u201dIf someone in my party is in a risk group, can I cancel the trip and get a full refund?

In the UK last July, when the country experienced the hottest spell on record, rail services were drastically reduced and many cancellations made \u2013 because of concern about the steel rails buckling.While Mediterranean nations are prepared for significantly higher temperatures, if unprecedented heat is experienced some departures could be interrupted.Transport providers may also cancel some services to protect their staff.What about aviation?Planes are perfectly able to take off in all but the highest temperatures \u2013 as they do routinely from airports in the Gulf and the southwestern US.

Therefore the operations on the Tuesdays, 1 and 8 August, are unlikely to be significantly affected \u2013 except if disruption continues from the preceding four days of strikes.Could it be called off?Yes, there is every chance that it will be; many ground-handling strikes are announced, followed by serious negotiations with the employers, and then called off. However, by calling the strike at the minimum 14 days legally stipulated by employment law, the union has given little time for talks.What if my flight is delayed or cancelled?Normal European air passengers\u2019 rights rules apply.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThirteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever. July has seen the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen train operators by both main rail unions.In a separate dispute, staff working for the London Underground will walk out for six days in late July in a row over over pensions, job cuts and what the RMT union calls \u201cattacks on working conditions\u201d.In the national rail disputes, the biggest union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding decent, no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately with commensurate boosts to pay. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue, in particular the loss of much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales since the Covid pandemic.Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedCornish beach battles private school parties by installing floodlights and CCTVYour rights if your easyJet Gatwick flight this summer is cancelled180,000 easyJet passengers hit by hundreds of summer flight cancellationsTransport for Wales and ScotRail are not involved and will run normal services, but some of the affected operators usually run trains in Wales and Scotland.These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. It carried out the first six-day walk-out from 3 to 8 July. The next is 17 to 22 July inclusive.Hundreds of trains are likely to be cancelled each day.Later in the month the biggest rail union, the RMT, will call 20,000 of its members out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. The first two dates coincide with the Aslef overtime bans. The late July walk-outs are likely to cause widespread cancellations at the start of the main summer school holidays in England. A London Underground strike, also involving members of the RMT, will run from Sunday 23 to Friday 28 July. It is sandwiched between two of the national walk-outs called by the same union.Which train operators are involved the national disputes?The RMT strikes and Aslef overtime ban are aimed at rail firms contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressMost London commuter operators will be hit:C2C (not involved in the Aslef action)Greater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected:Chiltern RailwaysNorthern TrainsWest Midlands TrainsWhat is happening about the London Underground?The RMT plans a walk-out from Sunday 23 July until Friday 28 July. General secretary Mick Lynch says: \u201cThis week of action will shut down the London Underground and show just how important the work of our members is.\u201dThe union claims 600 jobs are scheduled to be axed, leading to \u201cmore unstaffed stations and a lowering of safety standards\u201d. The union says bosses \u201cplan to make London Underground staff poorer in retirement\u201d.London Overground and the Elizabeth Line are unaffected by the planned industrial action. But routes that offer alternatives to strike-hit routes, such as Stratford, Walthamstow Central and Ealing Broadway to central London, are likely to be especially busy during the walk-outs by RMT members working for train operators and the London Underground,Why were the July dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. Aslef\u2019s first overtime ban coincided with the first week of the Wimbledon tennis championships in southwest London.The second Aslef overtime ban will affect passengers hoping to travel to the first four days of the fourth Ashes Test between England and Australia, which begins on Wednesday 19 July at Old Trafford in Manchester. The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs are targeting what are likely to be three of the busiest days of the month.Many families will be on the move at the start of school holidays on 20 and 22 July; those dates also fall during the Open golf championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club.The 29 July strike will hit journeys to and from holiday resorts as well as cricket fans travelling to London for the fifth Ashes Test at the Oval.The strike days for the London Underground, from 23 to 28 July, are intended to disrupt travel in the capital for as long as possible. In combination, passengers in the capital who depend on both national rail and the Tube will be hit by strikes on nine out of 10 days between 20 and 29 July.How will the train drivers\u2019 overtime ban affecting travellers?All train operators rely on a certain amount of overtime/rest-day working to operate their usual timetables. The impact of the Aslef action from 17 to 22 July will vary according to how much the individual train operator depends on overtime, and also staff sickness levels.For the first Aslef overtime ban, several operators introduced emergency timetables. A similar pattern is expected in the next round.South Western Railway, which runs to and from Britain\u2019s busiest rail station, London Waterloo, said: \u201cInstead of making numerous short-notice amendments and cancellations to our standard timetabled services for this week, we have decided to provide greater certainty for our customers by creating an amended timetable that we have a high degree of confidence we can reliably and safely deliver each day.\u201cOverall, services will usually be reduced to hourly in off-peak periods with a small number of cancellations during the morning and evening peaks. Some first and last trains may also be cancelled.\u201dGTR, the biggest rail firm involved by passenger numbers, also operated a reduced timetable throughout the Aslef action from 3 to 8 July. No Gatwick Express ran, while Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink passengers operated fewer trains.TransPennine Express, the intercity operator in northern England and southern Scotland, said: \u201cWe expect some services to start later and finish earlier than usual, and some journeys may be altered late or on the day of travel.\u201dOther operators reported little impact.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhy is the RMT striking nationally?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 28 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.What is the likely effect of the RMT national rail strike?On each of the strike days, thousands of trains will be cancelled, wrecking travel plans for millions of passengers. Some lines will see no services, and where trains are running they are likely to start later, be less frequent and finish earlier than normal.All operators are likely to run some trains. LNER will run a regular service on the East Coast main line between London and Edinburgh via Yorkshire and northeast England, while Avanti West Coast is likely to operate a basic service, with one train an hour from each of Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow to London Euston.Great Western Railway will run between London Paddington, South Wales (as far as Cardiff Central) and Devon.Shorter distance services around the big cities are likely to be hard hit. Passengers can expect normal service on:Caledonian SleeperGrand CentralHeathrow ExpressHull TrainsLondon OvergroundLumoMerseyrailScotRailTransport for WalesWill airport trains run?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is unlikely to operate during the Aslef overtime ban, but Southern and Thameslink trains are available. Gatwick, Luton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during the RMT walk-outs. Stansted Airport is likely to have trains to and from London Liverpool Street every hour from around 7am until the evening.Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground. But during the RMT Tube strike against Transport for London, the airport\u2019s Tube link on the Piccadilly Line is likely to be suspended \u2013 in common with almost all other Underground servicesWill Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station will walk out. On London Underground strike days, 23-28 July, access will also be difficult.What do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation. We remain open to talks and we have said repeatedly that we want to give our people a pay rise.\u201cBut until the union leadership and executive is united in what it wants and engages in good faith with the 30 per cent shortfall in revenue the industry is continuing to grapple with post-Covid, it is difficult to move forward.\u201cSadly our staff, our customers and the communities across the country which rely on a thriving railway are the ones that are suffering as a result.\u201dWhat does the government say?A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \u201cThe RMT leadership\u2019s decision to call strikes targeting two iconic international sporting events, as children and families begin their summer holidays, will disrupt people\u2019s plans across the country.\u201cAfter a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s high time the union leaders realised that strikes no longer have the impact they once did and are simply driving people away from the railway.\u201dCould the industrial action be called off?Such is the antipathy between the parties that it seems most unlikely.I have a ticket booked for one of the RMT national strike days. What can I do?Passengers with Advance, Anytime or Off-Peak tickets can have their ticket refunded with no fee if the train that the ticket is booked for is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.Train operators are likely to offer flexibility to travel on a wide range of non-strike days.Passengers with season tickets who do not travel can claim compensation for the strike dates through Delay Repay.RecommendedCornish beach battles private school parties by installing floodlights and CCTVYour rights if your easyJet Gatwick flight this summer is cancelled180,000 easyJet passengers hit by hundreds of summer flight cancellationsWhat are the alternatives?As always, long-distance coach operators \u2013 National Express, Megabus and Flixbus \u2013 will keep running, though seats are becoming scarce and fares are rising."}, {"_id": "64b1415951ac3319749489e9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/drop-off-airport-charges-drivers-passengers-b2374481.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Drop-off rip-off?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHi-diddly-ho! I was enjoying a morning tour through the Alphabet District of Nob Hill in Northwest Portland, and I felt as though I was being stalked by a cast of goofy cartoon characters. The neighbourhood is all close-knit Colonial Revival houses, coffee shops, and burger and beer taverns where you could easily find yourself trapped for hours \u2013 and yet there is something else at work here.First, we walked past a sign for Quimby Street. Then, in quick succession, we crossed Lovejoy Street, Kearney Street and Flanders Street. To the south of the neighbourhood, I was told there is a Burnside. I also learnt about Montgomery Park and Van Houten Avenue. I\u2019m no map geek, but I am, I confess, a super fan of The Simpsons \u2013 and I found myself drawn into the story of its origin in Portland like Homer to Duff Beer.\u201cPortland\u2019s not Springfield where the cartoon is set, that\u2019d be too contrived,\u201d said guide John Moran, of America\u2019s Hub World Tours, as he recounted the backstory of America\u2019s longest-running scripted primetime show (after first appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, it\u2019s now up to 34 seasons and counting).Read more on USA travel:The best New York hotelsUltimate USA travel guide8 of the best Hawaii beaches to visit for a slice of paradiseRecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksBest cheap hotels in New York to stay for style, location and valueBest hotels in New York: Where to stay in Manhattan, Brooklyn and more\u201cThere are no Simpsons museums or themed attractions here, but if you know where to look it\u2019s pretty obvious Portland\u2019s in the show\u2019s DNA.\u201dPortland shares plenty of street names with Simpsons characters \u2013 and is that Mount Springfield in the background?  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Certainly, these days, there is a throng of destinations allied to TV shows, and set-jetting on \u2018location vacations\u2019 is a bankable travel trend. HBO has made stars of the swanky hotels, villas and restaurants used in Succession, while Albuquerque, New Mexico, is now synonymous with Breaking Bad, as is Baltimore, Maryland, with The Wire and Snoqualmie, Washington, as the home of Twin Peaks. Not to mention the extra star-power sprayed all over Hawaii, Sicily and reportedly Thailand with each new series of White Lotus. Cartoons are another matter entirely, of course; and yet, if a TV show is the sum of its creator\u2019s influences, The Simpsons is steeped in the spirit of Matt Groening\u2019s Portland.By that measure, the most important address in the city is 742 Evergreen Terrace, where The Simpsons\u2019 cartoonist grew up in the 1950s \u2013 with father Homer, mother Marge and younger sisters Lisa and Maggie, all of whom Groening named his most famous characters after. His childhood home is hidden at the end of a long suburban road that switchbacks through the redwoods of Washington Park, as if to keep the house a secret (fans of the show will know the Simpsons family also live at the same address in the cartoon).The park itself, with party piece rose gardens and beehive hairdo shrubbery, is a museum of living trees, where hiking trails unlock views of Downtown Portland and the meandering Willamette River. Miles away still is the arrowhead cone of Mt Hood, a forest-ringed stratovolcano that has an uncanny likeness to the cartoon\u2019s totemic Mount Springfield.Below Washington Park, our next stop wouldn\u2019t make it onto many visitor itineraries. It is a no-frills bicycle and pedestrian bridge over an interstate that first opened two years ago. But it is also one that has been re-dedicated to honour Homer Simpson\u2019s do-gooder next-door neighbour and nemesis, who, as it happens, was named after one of Portland\u2019s founding fathers.The character of Ned Flanders has been immortalised on a bridge over an interstate  (Mike MacEacheran)Part of me finds the Ned Flanders\u2019 Crossing a bit silly, but the fan boy inside applauds the nonsense. If you come 10 years from now, there\u2019ll probably be a shrine dubbed with all manner of \u201cokily-dokily\u201d catchphrases (a personal favourite: \u201cCan I make my famous mimosa? A little sparkling water in a glass full of regular water?\u201d).Just as important, the overpass acts as a transition from Northwest Portland and Lincoln High School (Matt Groening\u2019s alma mater; there was never a Principal Skinner, though) to the arty Pearl District and Old Town, where most out-of-towners come to sample doughnuts Homer would sell his soul for. Voodoo Doughnut, opened 20 years ago, with its novelty designs and ingenious toppings, is as nutty as Portland gets. The classics are a voodoo doll, with raspberry jelly and staked with a pretzel, a bacon maple bar, and a creative take on male genitalia filled with Bavarian cream.It\u2019s little coincidence, perhaps, that America\u2019s self-styled capital of doughnuts and beer \u2013 the city has more than 70 inner-city breweries, after all \u2013 had a clear influence on forming Homer\u2019s addictive personality. Simpsons fan or not, you\u2019ll likely know the much-quoted line: \u201cHere\u2019s to alcohol: the cause of, and solution to, all of life\u2019s problems.\u201dIn the same neighbourhood at weekends, the riverfront also welcomes the largest arts and crafts market in the US. Pen and ink artworks and gicl\u00e9e paper prints are always front and centre, daubed in bright sunflower yellow, sky blue and bubblegum pink.Like the fictional Springfield, Portland has a statue at the centre of town  (Getty Images)Portland\u2019s living room is Pioneer Courthouse Square, and it\u2019s a different setting today to the one Matt Groening experienced before he moved to Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, to hone his love for animation. There is still plenty of deep-rooted Oregonian history here, but a visit to Downtown and the close by Willamette riverfront needs to be tempered by an acceptance of the city\u2019s current homeless epidemic, which has seen tent encampments surge and the numbers of unhoused Portlanders spiral. For the time being, City Hall\u2019s motivation to fix the problem somewhat moderates the tension between the haves and have-nots.All this is juxtaposed with the grandeur of Portlandia \u2013 a monstrous copper repouss\u00e9 monument, second only to the Statue of Liberty in size \u2013 as well as Portland\u2019s dozen steel and deck arc bridges scattered along the riverfront. These lead out across the city to the former site of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant (an obvious reference point for Mr Burns\u2019 operation); to the genuine city of Springfield in Central Oregon; to Eugene, where Matt Groening was inspired after a visit to a Moe\u2019s-style tavern; to Seattle, the clear inspiration for fan favourite episode Marge vs. the Monorail; and, ultimately, all the way to Los Angeles, where the story of The Simpsons continues unabated today.\u201cMatt Groening set out to create a place that satirised Nowheresville, USA, and everyone now knows what happened next,\u201d concluded Mason, as our tour finished beside a dimly lit tavern where the first beers of the day were being poured. \u201cWhat many fans don\u2019t realise is our weirdness and wit are part of the bigger story \u2013 and that\u2019s Portland at its finest.\u201dMike MacEacheran was a guest of Travel Oregon.

Well, it turns out you can climb that volcano, and it might just be one of the best things you do on a trip to Iceland \u2013 even if you\u2019re completely new to mountaineering. Eyjafjallajokull glacier, which sits around 75 miles east of Reykjavik, is the second highest peak in Iceland and can be seen on most trips around the southwest of the country. The summit is 1,651m; for context, Ben Nevis is 1,345m, Iceland\u2019s highest peak Hvannadalshn\u00fakur is 2,110m, Mont Blanc is 4,809m, and Kilimanjaro is a towering 5,895m. Under the shadow of such competition, it might not sound too challenging. That said, you\u2019ll want to take into consideration that you\u2019ll be hiking from near enough sea level \u2013 a solid 16km or so of walking and around 1,500m elevation gain. It\u2019s a long, tough day of hiking, and your legs will certainly feel it the day after (and possibly several more after that). But the beauty of Eyjafjallajokull is that it\u2019s entirely manageable if you\u2019ve got a decent level of fitness, some mental endurance and a good mountain guide. Eyjafjallajokull is famous for causing havoc to air travel when it erupted in 2010  (Tom Barker for Much Better Adventures)Fortunately, when climbing Eyjafjallajokull as part of Much Better Adventures\u2019 Iceland 3 Peaks Challenge in the spring, I had the best. \u00cdvar Finnbogason is something of a legend in Iceland, having summited Hvannadalshn\u00fakur more than 70 times and led expeditions across the world, including in Greenland and Antarctica.

That\u2019s doable for most people \u2013 and enjoyable.\u201dRead more: How to see Iceland in a long weekendHis second point is key. The world of mountaineering, like many adventure sports, can be intimidating, not to mention dangerous. Although it\u2019s foolish to underestimate any ascent, particularly one with significant elevation in a day, Eyjafjallajokull is far less punishing than most. \u00cdvar points out that you need no technical skills and, if you hike at the right time of year, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need any specialist equipment. Yet you still get the rush of glacier hiking.The start of the climb is a relatively steep ascent until you reach the glacier, when it levels out to a steady climb. Then comes hiking through deep snow and navigating crevasses and icy terrain. The views before we reached the snow line were already inspiring (Iceland truly is in a class of its own when it comes to landscapes), but the glacier itself is almost otherworldly. Moss and gentle streams give way to black volcanic rock contrasting sharply against the briliant white of the snow in the sun, with the ice-capped peak rising in the distance.Hiking above the clouds on an expanse of white, knee deep in snow, is an experience like no other. The deep crevasses that run across the volcano remind you of the immense power of Eyjafjallajokull; it\u2019s slightly terrifying but utterly thrilling.Eyjafjallajokull is a great introduction to the world of mountaineering, according to top guide \u00cdvar Finnbogason  (Tom Barker for Much Better Adventures)Like most glacier travel, summiting Eyjafjallajokull requires working as part of a rope team to protect against falling into crevasses, and on cold days crampons may be required while hiking on ice. For our group, on a sunny day in May with a little cloud cover, a solid pair of Gore-Tex lined hiking boots with gaiters sufficed.Eyjafjallajokull wouldn\u2019t have been on many travellers\u2019 radars 15 years ago, but it quite literally exploded into the world\u2019s consciousness in 2010. Around 100,00 flights were cancelled after the volcano sent clouds of ash and dust into the atmosphere, costing the aviation industry more than \u00a31bn.Read more: The ultimate Iceland travel guideIt also provided a considerable degree of amusement for Icelanders as news readers across the globe struggled with the near-impossible pronunciation of the name (if you\u2019re curious, the correct pronunciation is \u201cAY-uh-fyat-luh-YOE-kuutl-uh\u201d). Despite the disruption and huge financial cost, \u00cdvar speaks surprisingly fondly of the impact of the eruption. \u201cIn the long term it\u2019s publicity,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSuddenly, everyone was talking about Iceland.\u201d The volcano erupting cost the airline industry more than \u00a31bn  (Tom Barker for Much Better Adventures)Just a couple of years previously, the country\u2019s travel industry benefited from another global event that shook Europe, but unexpectedly gave Iceland tourism a leg up. Although the 2008 economic crisis hit Iceland hard, with a complete collapse of the banking system, it made the notoriously expensive country attractively affordable to visit, fuelling a quite staggering tourism boom.But although Eyjafjallajokull did a rather nice PR job for Iceland tourism as a whole, \u00cdvar notes that it\u2019s still not well known for mountaineering.Read more: The best time to see the Northern Lights in Iceland\u201cIt\u2019s not really popular,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t really caught on \u2013 most tend to go for the high summit (Hvannadalshn\u00fakur). If they have just one day of glaciated travel on a rope, they go for the big one.\u201dWhich is fair enough; but if you\u2019re not too concerned about bragging rights and want the thrill of glacier hiking without a gruelling ascent, it\u2019s well worth giving Hvannadalshn\u00fakur\u2019s more famous, less intimidating neighbour a go.The correct pronunciation is \u2018AY-uh-fyat-luh-YOE-kuutl-uh\u2019  (Tom Barker for Much Better Adventures)Where to stayHotel Skogafoss in Skogar is just 15 minutes from where you\u2019ll start your climb at the base of Eyjafjallajokull, which makes it the ideal location to stay the night before and after the hike. It has the benefit of being located right next to the rather magnificent Sk\u00f3gafoss Waterfall, which is possibly the most famous waterfall in Iceland and one of the key sights to visit in the south of the country. The hotel itself is very comfortable, with pleasant double, twin and family rooms, and a decent restaurant that\u2019s perfect for a post-climb dinner. Reykjavik is just two hours from Eyjafjallajokull, where you\u2019ll find a range of accommodation, including some more affordable options. Reykjavik Marina is a good mid-range hotel that\u2019s ideally located for getting out of the city for outdoor adventures, as well as exploring the capital.More reviews of the best hotels in ReykjavikWhen to goLate spring or early summer is the ideal time for inexperienced mountaineers to climb Eyjafjallajokull (Tom Barker for Much Better Adventures)You can climb Eyjafjallajokull all year round, but late spring or early summer is the ideal time for inexperienced mountaineers. At this time of year days are long (around 16 hours of daylight), allowing plenty of time for hiking. The weather is famously unpredictable in Iceland \u2013 brilliantly sunny days give way to raging storms in a matter of hours \u2013 but in April and May there\u2019s a good chance of enjoying clear skies and views of the glacier, plus pleasant hiking conditions that won\u2019t require crampons. Ascending Eyjafjallajokull in the winter is entirely possible, but around half the trip will be in darkness and you\u2019ll need a good head torch.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHere\u2019s a confession. When I hear the crackle of a pull tab as a drinks can is opened, followed by that rush of carbonated fizz, it kickstarts a conditioned response. Almost immediately, I start to think about how much better my current situation would be if I was sipping on a Diet Coke. It\u2019s embarrassing, but over the years I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that I\u2019m basically the Pavlov\u2019s dog of Big Soda.My Diet Coke consumption has never come close to reaching the level achieved by Donald Trump (who reportedly gets through 12 cans in 24 hours) or the late Karl Lagerfeld (whose daily regime included 10 of them, according to the diet guide he released in 2004). But it\u2019s habitual enough that when a certain news alert pinged onto my phone screen last month, it made me shudder.The chill-inducing headline in question? The revelation that the World Health Organisation\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) was preparing to label aspartame as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d, also known as category 2B. Aspartame is, of course, the artificial sweetener used in my beloved DC, along with countless other sugar-free fizzy drinks and low-calorie food options.The International Sweeteners Association has already taken issue with the report, noting that the IARC is \u201cnot a food safety body\u201d and claiming that its review is \u201cnot scientifically comprehensive\u201d. And the potential WHO ruling, it should be noted, doesn\u2019t consider how much of a substance a person can consume safely; that is the job of another WHO group, known as JECFA (the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, in partnership with the UN).Confused yet? It has always been difficult for consumers to get a handle on aspartame\u2019s risk. The sweetener has been around since 1965, when the American chemist James Schlatter accidentally discovered it while attempting to formulate an anti-ulcer drug. After combining two naturally occurring amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, Schlatter, a health and safety officer\u2019s worst nightmare, stuck his finger into the mixture and licked it.RecommendedWe still don\u2019t know how to talk about extreme celebrity dietsDorito casseroles, butter diets and how weird food took over the internetConflict, toxic group chats and organised fun: How we came to despise the hen doHe might have bypassed basic lab rules (and basic common sense), but he\u2019d stumbled across a new low-calorie sweetener in the process. Aspartame is \u201capproximately 180 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose\u201d, a naturally occurring sugar, explains Dr Terun Desai, senior lecturer and researcher in exercise physiology and clinical nutrition at the University of Hertfordshire. So, you need \u201ca lot less product to achieve that sweet taste. And obviously, from a manufacturing point of view, if you need less of something, then that\u2019s more efficient.\u201dBut since its discovery, aspartame has been beset by controversy. It received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) in 1974, and initially, Desai says, researchers \u201cstarted looking at aspartame as a product that might potentially have health-promoting benefits\u201d. Their early work, he explains, was \u201cprimarily looking for its benefits on cardio-metabolic health\u201d \u2013 exploring its effect on the heart, blood, and blood vessels. But then some scientists argued that the studies into its overall effects \u201cweren\u2019t as rigorous as they could have been, so the FDA removed its approval\u201d in 1980.\n\n[Diet Coke] has only reinforced the dichotomy between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 [products], perpetuating the idea that certain foods or ingredients are inherently virtuous or sinfulKirsty MinnsThe following year, they \u201creapproved it again, having done more [research]\u201d. Soon after, Coca-Cola launched its silver-canned Diet spin-off. Ever since, there have been question marks hanging over the potential health implications. A report from the Ramazzini Institute linked cancers in mice and rats to aspartame consumption, and a French study of around 100,000 adults last year suggested that people who consumed large amounts of artificial sweeteners had a slightly higher risk of cancer. Confusingly, though, there is also plenty of research out there stating that there is no link between artificial sweeteners and cancer (and the deleterious impact of sugar itself is also very well documented).Against this backdrop of ongoing uncertainty, why are diet-drink diehards like myself so keen to keep drinking? As well as being super-sweet, aspartame\u2019s calorific value is pretty negligible. One can of Diet Coke contains about one calorie, a fact that has been seared into my consciousness in the brand\u2019s wiggly cursive font since adolescence. Did my enthusiasm for the drink precede this knowledge? I\u2019d like to tell myself so, but I\u2019d probably be lying.Documenting her attempts to kick her Diet Coke habit in The Guardian, the writer Sirin Kale described it as \u201cdiet culture in a can\u201d. It\u2019s an assessment I\u2019m inclined to agree with. As a teenager in the mid and late Noughties, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have gravitated towards diet drinks quite so zealously if they weren\u2019t whispered about as a sure-fire route to that era\u2019s most aspirational quality \u2013 thinness. Another caveat: earlier this year, the WHO released new guidelines recommending against the use of sweeteners to control weight, as there is no evidence of long-term benefit. But when cultural messaging and urban myth have got under your skin, it\u2019s hard to shake them off.Aspartame: What effects do carcinogens have on your body?Before aspartame, there was saccharin (and the less well-known cyclamate). When diet sodas first launched in the late Fifties and early Sixties, the link with thinness was more explicit \u2013 and more explicitly tied up in old-fashioned ideas of femininity, seen through a male gaze. In 1964, Diet Pepsi launched with a tagline that was both convoluted and spectacularly creepy. \u201cThe girls that girl-watchers watch drink Diet Pepsi,\u201d the ads claimed \u2013 a bottle of this stuff, they suggested, would make you worthy of being leered at in the street by passing men. The early marketing for Tab, Coca-Cola\u2019s debut foray into the diet drinks world, wasn\u2019t any better. \u201cStay in his mind with a shape he can\u2019t forget!\u201d the product promised, claiming that drinking Tab would turn you into... wait for it... \u201ca mindsticker\u201d.The end goal \u201cwasn\u2019t really about health per se, but about beauty and appearances\u201d, says Pierre Chandon, professor of marketing at the INSEAD business school in Fontainebleau, France. These drinks, the ads seemed to be saying, offered indulgence in a limited form. You could have something sweet, and still be slim enough to be deemed worthy of attracting male attention. Indeed, \u201cdiet soft drinks historically promoted the idea that a woman could \u2018have it all\u2019, enjoying the taste of a sweet beverage while avoiding all of the negative consequences associated with sugar consumption,\u201d notes Kirsty Minns, executive creative director at branding agency Mother Design. \u201cThis approach has only reinforced the dichotomy between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 [products], perpetuating the idea that certain foods or ingredients are inherently virtuous or sinful,\u201d she adds. \u201cThink of the term \u2018full-fat coke\u2019\u201d \u2013 a nickname laden with value judgements.The model Andrew Cooper is ogled by a group of women in a 2013 British advert for Diet Coke (Coca-Cola/Shutterstock)Because Tab was so blatantly aimed at women, Coca-Cola was concerned that male customers wouldn\u2019t pick up a can of this (quote unquote) girly drink. Enter Diet Coke. Yes, ironically, this second low-cal offering was initially intended as a way of getting men to get on the diet-drink bandwagon: the early advertising featured blokes at sports games, blokes fishing, blokes joking around at the swimming pool. By the end of 1983, it was America\u2019s best-selling diet soft drink, but the d-word was apparently still putting men off. In a report in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a Coke source claimed that \u201cdiet\u201d was still considered to be \u201ca four-letter word\u201d for men, at least the younger ones.It was time for Diet Coke to lean into its female demographic \u2013 which they famously did in 1994, with the introduction of the first notorious \u201cDiet Coke break\u201d ad. \u201c[They] were kind of risqu\u00e9 for the category,\u201d notes Chandon, \u201cby showing women ogling an attractive man drinking Diet Coke. Although now the man was drinking the soda, it was still clearly targeted at women\u201d \u2013 thirsty ones, you could say. It flipped the script on the old-school drink ad: this was a game-changing clip that was unabashedly all about the female gaze.But how empowering can an advert encouraging us to buy into a megabrand (especially one that\u2019s rooted in strict beauty standards) ever really be? In pop culture in the late Nineties and the Noughties, a procession of skinny celebrities were papped clutching their diet drinks; Diet Coke also cropped up through product placement in teen movies like Clueless and John Tucker Must Die (perhaps because revenge, like Diet Coke, is best served cold?)Later partnerships with figures like Marc Jacobs, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Lagerfeld (notorious for his fatphobic comments) \u201csought to reinforce the drinks icon\u2019s connection with fashion \u2013 a sector long muddied by accusations of peddling unhealthy beauty standards and ideals\u201d, Minns notes. And now that the Diet Coke break ads have been retired, the marketing undercurrent has, \u201cwhether intentional or not\u201d, been \u201cone that feeds on diet culture and its associated unhealthy beauty ideals\u201d, she adds: recent ads with taglines like \u201cRegret nothing\u201d and \u201cBecause I can\u201d have \u201carguably played into the hands of the diet mindset\u201d.Kim Cattrall sips from a Diet Coke on the set of the \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 movie in 2007 (London Entertainment/Shutterstock)In a wellness-focused world, Diet Coke might not quite have the cultural cachet it once had (the Trump link probably didn\u2019t help, either). The way we think about healthy eating and drinking has changed, Chandon says. Once, he explains, brands could claim to be healthy \u201cbecause of the presence of \u2018good\u2019, like proteins, or the absence of \u2018bad\u2019, like salt, sugar or fat\u201d \u2013 diet drinks took the latter approach. But \u201cbrands now claim to be healthy in a totally different way\u201d \u2013 the trend is \u201cfor foods that are healthy by nature rather than healthy by nutrition\u201d (making artificial ingredients, like sweeteners, seem less attractive by default).Will the scare-inducing headlines around aspartame cause us to turn our backs on diet drinks for good? Minns is pragmatic. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest here,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact is that consumer habits are inherently difficult to influence, let alone change.\u201d In 2015, she notes, the WHO put red meat onto the 2B watchlist of possible carcinogens. \u201cIf the meat industry is anything to go by,\u201d she says, \u201cthe drinks sector is likely to experience a drop-off in sales in the immediate weeks that follow the WHO report, but the chances are that the diehard diet-drinks loyalists will throw caution to the wind and return to their usual drinking habits, if they ever abandon them in the first place.\u201d Another confession: I got through a can of Diet Coke or two while writing this feature.RecommendedFran Drescher responds to backlash over Kim Kardashian selfie during Hollywood strikeWhat to know about vinho verde, Portugal\u2019s effervescent bargain wineFlorence Pugh\u2019s reaction to Emily Blunt\u2019s red carpet wardrobe malfunction applaudedThe aspartame risk needs to be considered in context, too. Other substances in category 2B include aloe vera, nickel, caffeic acid (found in coffee), pickled vegetables and coconut oil products. As Desai puts it, the sweetener has \u201conly gone up to a possible carcinogen, rather than a probable cause\u201d. The semantics are important \u2013 and so is the aforementioned fact that the WHO ruling doesn\u2019t take the amount consumed into account. \u201cThe amount that is considered acceptable for daily intake is relative to body weight \u2013 it\u2019s 50 milligrams per kilo per day in the US, and according to the Food Standards Agency in this country, it\u2019s 40.\u201d If you assume that the average adult male weighs around 85kg, he notes, that \u201cequates to about 17 cans per day\u201d before you reach the threshold. For women, it\u2019s 14 cans. In a risk assessment released on 14 July, JECFA reaffirmed that 40mg per kilo daily limit as the \u201cacceptable daily intake\u201d.I suddenly feel a little bit less panicked about my own imminent demise.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTo beat summer heat, wine lovers often turn to vinho verde, a light, refreshing wine from northern Portugal that has enjoyed a boomlet the past few years. One sign of its popularity \u2013 several local wineries are producing their own \u201cverde-style\u201d wines with the hallmarks of sharp acidity and slight carbonation. But what exactly is this \u201cgreen wine\u201d? Here are five things to know about this popular summer sip.1. The nameThere\u2019s no agreed on explanation for the name, which apparently evolved around the 17th century when the wines were first exported to Britain. It could be a reference to the \u201cgreen\u201d underripe flavours of tart apples and lime blossom in the very fresh, raw wine. It could also refer to the lush green landscape of the Minho region in northwestern Portugal, where the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s maritime influence produces a climate and terroir starkly different from the parched Mediterranean lands in the Algarve to the south.The Portuguese pronunciation is VEEN-yo VER-da, with the last syllable all but swallowed. If, like most people, you pronounce it VEE-no VERD-ee, the Portuguese winemakers will not complain. They will smile politely, pocket your cash and be happy you are enjoying their wine.RecommendedSierra Nevada lakes change more in past 100 years than three millenniaHow the climate crisis played a role in fueling Hurricane IdaAgainst the odds: The fight to save sea turtles in Ras BaridiGreen wine comes in white, pink and red (sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist). Very little red is produced. Both the whites and ros\u00e9s are notable for tart acidity (those green flavours) and a slight spritz of carbonation, which combine to make them refreshing, especially in hot weather. They are intended to be enjoyed, not aged. In fact, many are not even vintage-dated because they\u2019re not expected to last long enough for the year to be relevant. So drink up!2. The region and the grapesVinho verde is Portugal\u2019s largest demarcated wine region, or appellation (though the administrative region is called Minho). There are nine subzones which generally do not appear on wine labels but may become increasingly important as winemakers explore different expressions of vinho verde. The main grapes are alvarinho (familiar to us as albari\u00f1o) and loureiro, a crisp white often compared to riesling. There are several other varieties that are even harder to pronounce and noteworthy only if you are keeping track of varieties you\u2019ve tasted. Alvarinho dominates the blends in the north (where the Minho borders Spain\u2019s Rias Baixas region), and loureiro is more prominent further south.3. That spritzVinho verde has been exported at least since the 17th century. Back in the day, the wine\u2019s signature spritz resulted from a little bit of sugar remaining as the wines were rushed into bottle before fermentation had finished. Today, the bubbles are added artificially by carbonation before bottling. The level of carbonation is up to the producer \u2013 some vinho verde can be quite fizzy, while others gently tickle the palate.4. You can use it in cocktailsVinho verde\u2019s fizz and still relatively low price make it an ideal foil for your summer mixology efforts. An ice cube, slice of lime and a splash of gin make a nice spritzer. It can also be a great base for sangria.5. New styles are evolvingWhile we think of vinho verde as a simple, enjoyable starter wine for a summer repast, some winemakers are producing more serious versions. These are usually made from a single variety (such as alvarinho or loureiro) and labelled with the vintage. Some producers are bottling single-vineyard wines to highlight a site\u2019s granite or schist soils.\u201cThe wines are changing and moving forward with an international, incredibly bright and pure style,\u201d says Eug\u00e9nio Jardim, the brand ambassador for Wines of Portugal. He cited Anselmo Mendes and Quinta da Soalheiro as pioneers of this new style.RecommendedThe Norwegian sparkling wine aged at the bottom of the seaThe curious history of sauvignon blanc \u2013 and what to drink if you hate itThe Independent Wine Club best cases 2023: Wine from small growers\u201cThis is a region in flux, with the quality of wines soaring in recent years,\u201d Jardim tells me. \u201cThis is not a one-note region.\u201d\u00a9 The Washington Post"}, {"_id": "64b1415c51ac3319749489f5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/oppenheimer-premier-emily-blunt-florence-pugh-b2374372.html", "primaryCategory": "Fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fans applaud Florence Pugh\u2019s response to Emily Blunt\u2019s red carpet wardrobe malfunction", "lead": "<p>\u2018Florence Pugh is a real one for protecting Emily Blunt from a wardrobe malfunction\u2019 </p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 10:51:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:44.054222", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-14T10:51:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/12/21/florence%20pugh%20emily%20blunt.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Mostly white, rarely red, while ros\u00e9 that both looked and tasted like Ribena was a world away from the delicate pale provencal style we\u2019re so au fait with now. Then as now, the cheaper the better. Location, grape variety, acidity levels \u2013 it all meant absolutely nothing. Hell, taste didn\u2019t matter either. Slurp it fast enough and you\u2019d barely notice a slight whiff of paintstripper on the nose or a lingering hint of vinegar on the palate. It was just your (well below) average plonk. The number one important factor was price \u2013 swiftly followed by ABV, of course. The rough budget for a bottle was the mighty sum of\u00a0\u00a33-4. A tenner was a good night out. Remember those days?It was around this time that sauvignon blanc began its world domination. It was the IT wine to buy. Rocking up to your friend\u2019s house with a bottle in tow made you look like you knew something about wine, maybe even had great taste (despite still buying the cheapest bottle possible, of course). It was even better if it was from New Zealand \u2013 top points if it came from Marlborough, the top of the South Island, where about 70 per cent of the country\u2019s wine is produced.

It\u2019s been off the table ever since. The mere smell of it takes me right back to those heady, alcohol-drenched days. Perhaps it\u2019s just a case of unfortunate timing for my age group \u2013 victims of the wine\u2019s popularity surging at the height of early-Noughties boozing culture. RecommendedThe Norwegian sparkling wine aged at the bottom of the seaThe Independent Wine Club best cases 2023: Wine from small growersWin a mixed wine case, perfect for pairing with foodBut why did sauvignon blanc become so popular 15 years ago? \u200b\u200bEmily Harman, wine consultant at Firmdale Hotels and Vina Lupa, says it\u2019s \u201csimply because when people get into wine, they usually like wines that are quite fruity\u201d.Sauvignon blanc offers these fruity notes, as well as freshness. It\u2019s famed for its notes of crisp asparagus, green pepper and often a grassy or herbaceous flavour too. High acidity makes it very dry. The New Zealand sauvignon blanc vines were planted in the Seventies, and its arrival on the British scene a few decades later served as a pointed change in taste from the overly oaked Chardonnays and sickly syrupy rieslings (the latter is now cool again; more drinkable and less sweet) that were popular at the time.Sam Tendall, co-founder of online wine shop Smashed Grapes agrees, and says sauvignon blanc\u2019s prominent rise is owed to consumers wanting \u201clip-smackingly thirst-quenching drinks\u2026 that are naturally high in acidity with tropical fruit flavours\u201d, and wines from Marlborough had that sort of fruitiness people were looking for.It wasn\u2019t just in wine that tastes were changing, either. \u201cThis taste shift was mirrored in other drinks such as the boom of gin and flavoured tonics, or tropical IPAs in the beer world, which are all high in acidity and fruity,\u201d Tendall adds.It quickly became Britain\u2019s most popular white wine choice, both in supermarkets and restaurant wine menus, whether that\u2019s by the glass or bottle, or even served as the house wine.Wine consultant Emily Harman says new wine lovers tend to prefer fruity flavours, hence sauvignon blanc\u2019s rise to popularity  (Ash Nayler)Lauren Denyer, an educator at the Wine and Spirit Education Trust (WSET), says that along with New Zealand\u2019s \u201ctropical fruit, such as passion fruit and mango, which many drinkers find very appealing\u201d, it\u2019s also its \u201clightness which make it easily quaffable\u201d.However popular it may be, it can still divide opinion in the upper echelons of the wine world, especially among the more commercial labels that everyone is familiar with (Oyster Bay, we\u2019re looking at you). Sauvignon blanc grapes originate in France, where the premium wines, Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 (from the highly regarded French regions of the same names) are still made. These are usually seen as a step up from your average savvy B, despite being made with the same grapes, and not just because they\u2019re more expensive, but because they\u2019re more complex.A lot of the Kiwi sauvignon blanc\u2019s popularity is down to marketing. They do it very, very well to us Brits, who largely bought NZ\u2019s green image (although there\u2019s nothing green about shipping wine to the other side of the world).WSET educator says sauvignon blanc\u2019s \u2018lightness makes it easily quaffable\u2019  (Supplied)The price point of New Zealand\u2019s offering also made them appealing. \u201cPeople probably know the New Zealand sauvignon blanc more as it\u2019s a more accessible price point\u2026 wines from the Loire region are more expensive because it\u2019s a more challenging climate to grow wine, so you produce less,\u201d explains Harman.Its popularity knew no boundaries during the Noughties. So much so that wine makers couldn\u2019t grow enough of the grapes. According to the NZ Winegrowers association\u2019s annual 2020 report, between 2003 and 2015, sauvignon blanc vine planting increased five-fold to keep up with the demand. Although now, as climates warm up around the world leading to more extreme and freak weather, experts think it\u2019s only a matter of time until this changes the wines beyond their signature characteristics.This has seen as recently as February when New Zealand felt the force of cyclone Gabrielle, which saw unprecedented amounts of rain and devastating effects including flooding some vineyards and burying others in silt on the North Island, just ahead of harvesting. In 2021, a harsh frost combined with an early budburst meant the crop yields were down by 30 per cent.The knock-on effect is already being felt, along with the rise in inflation and cost of living crisis, as Tendall says, in the wider market: \u201cSauvignon blanc is going up in price and big branded pinot grigio has stayed at the value end, so with the cost of living we are seeing a small decline in sauvignon popularity.\u201dThe pandemic has also contributed to a change in tastes and buying habits.\u00a0Some people stopped drinking altogether, while others used the time to nurture their passion for it. As shopping in person became harder, subscription boxes and independent online sellers introduced lesser known varieties to the market. Dayner explains: \u201cPrompted by the pandemic, drinking the same wines regularly became less desirable\u201d, and instead, people were \u201cincreasingly willing to try a wider range of wines and sales of wine for home consumption increased hugely as drinkers looked to mix things up a little bit\u201d.Sam Tendall, left, co-founder of Smashed Grapes, says consumers want \u2018lip-smackingly thirst-quenching drinks\u2019  (Smashed Grapes)Harman doesn\u2019t see any indication that the guests of the hotels she consults for (which are mostly high end including London\u2019s Ham Yard Hotel and The Soho Hotel) are changing their mind on sauvignon blanc. However, she deals in artisan, handcrafted and mostly organic wines, rather than the commercial wines we buy in supermarkets for less than \u00a310.Instead, what Harman is seeing more of is some producers experimenting with skin contact styles, and more natural varieties, a style which sauvignon blanc grapes lend themselves well to. \u201cA producer in Australia called Tom Shobbrook makes a wine called giallo (yellow in Italian) which is one of the benchmark examples of the more experimental natural wines,\u201d she explains.Skin contact sauvignon blanc feels a world away from my entry level days into savvy B, which were so atrocious that I steered clear of white wine for many years. It was the reappearance of viognier on menus that enticed me back \u2013 in particular an organic viognier from South Australia\u2019s Yalumba vineyard. But if you really can\u2019t hack it, I asked the experts for their advice, and these are the wines to drink if you don\u2019t like Sauvignon blanc:1. VerdejoAll three experts mentioned this wine. \u201cFrom Spain\u2019s Rueda region, it\u2019s the country\u2019s favourite white wine, loved for its brisk acidity and vibrant fruit. It\u2019s now starting to become more popular in the UK market,\u201d says Denyer.2. PicpoulFor something more mineral, that\u2019s lighter and fresh, Harman suggests Picpoul, which is quickly growing in popularity again. Denyer adds that \u201calthough grown somewhere that can get extremely hot, the wines are super-fresh with apple, lemon and hints of peach on the palate\u201d.3. BacchusDenyer says: \u201cIt\u2019s a grape variety that is originally a German cross. It has all the appeal of Sauvignon Blanc and a plus point is that the wine does not have to travel far. You can even get sparkling versions, great for summer picnics and gatherings.\u201d4. Albari\u00f1o\u201cAlso from Spain, the main grape in Vinho Verde and is a cracking patio wine, jam-packed with the lemon sherbert refreshment sauvignon blanc drinkers love,\u201d says Tendall.5. Austrian Gr\u00fcner Veltliner\u201cForgot its old reputation of tasting like antifreeze, it\u2019s full of those classic gooseberry flavours long associated with top Marlborough varieties,\u201d says Tendall.6.

Wait approximately 24 hours to observe any skin sensitivity.\u201dIt\u2019s particularly important to be careful with products used so close to the eyes, so do your research and buy from a reputable retailer.How long does it take to see results?\u201cThe time it takes to see results may vary individually, depending on the stage of the lash growth cycle when the serum is started,\u201d says Pourian.\u201cThat\u2019s why it is recommended to use eyelash and eyebrow serums once a day for eight to 12 weeks, which aligns with a full growth cycle.\u201dYou\u2019ll have to be patient, because you can\u2019t simply double up to get lengthy lashes twice as fast.\u201cIt is crucial to follow the instructions provided with the serum and avoid overuse,\u201d he continues.\u201cLike any other topical skincare product, proper usage and adherence to the recommended application frequency will ensure the best results.\u201dDo you have to keep using the serum forever?\u201cIf you discontinue using the product your lashes will continue to go through their natural growth and shedding phases,\u201d says Claire Larsen, global master educator at RevitaLash Cosmetics.\u201cSo the new lashes that come back in will be untreated and will appear the way they originally did before starting your lash serum. If you love the results, you are a lifer!\u201dHowever, you can reduce the frequency of use once you reach the maintenance phase.Pourian advises: \u201cOnce you have achieved your desired results, it is recommended to use the lash serum three to four times a week to maintain the length and health of your lashes.\u201dAre there any reasons why a serum might not work?Proper application is key to making sure the serum can get to work quickly and effectively.\u201cIf the serum is not applied properly, such as being applied like mascara instead of reaching the roots and hair follicles, it may not yield desired results,\u201d says Pourian.\u201cIt\u2019s important to avoid using other products like oil-based cleansers or serums before applying the lash serum, as they can create a barrier, preventing proper absorption.\u201dAnd remember, you\u2019ve got to be consistent with daily use for at least a few weeks before you\u2019ll see a noticeable difference.\u201cCertain medical conditions, health issues, hormonal changes and lifestyle factors can influence the results of lash serums,\u201d Pourian adds, meaning your lashes might not reach TikTok-worthy proportions, or may take longer to do so.\u201cGenetics also play a role, as individuals naturally have different hair, lash, or brow growth genetics. This doesn\u2019t mean the serum won\u2019t work at all, but it may result in less significant outcomes.\u201dGo long: 8 highly-rated lash serums to try1.

I really adored that aspect of Kath,\u201d Allison recalls.The 28-year-old won\u2019t be returning for Sex Education\u2019s fourth and final season (premiering in September), but she\u2019s grateful for the legacy of the teen comedy drama. \u201cSex Education made people very curious about themselves, gender and all the things we touched on about personal boundaries. It incited people\u2019s passions,\u201d she says.Recently she joined Hendrick\u2019s Gin\u2019s Flora Adora campaign, which immortalises curious thinkers who are shaping this century. Allison is honoured alongside creative powerhouses across art, literature and theatre, including writers Dolly Alderton and Zadie Smith.Hendrick\u2019s found 84% of the 2,000 adults surveyed would consider themselves to be curious, while 54% feel like their curiosity has plateaued over the past two years.In fact, almost a third wish they were more curious about life and its wonders \u2014 a sentiment particularly strong with 46% of Gen Z. So how does Allison stay curious?\u201cSelf-care is very important to me and the functioning of my career,\u201d she says. \u201cI do a lot of yoga, meditation, I definitely love swimming, reading and things that prioritise me time \u2014 a good time \u2014 so I can regain my energy, which helps to reinspire myself.\u201cI tend to journal as well, which is the number one thing I do, because I need to be in constant communication with myself and my spirit through writing.\u201dAllison started journalling when she was 18 years old, \u201cAfter a bad break up, funnily enough\u201d, she admits. \u201cI don\u2019t use any writing prompts. I find that it comes naturally to me, which I really enjoy. It\u2019s really useful for coping with all the things going on in the world, and helps you figure out how you really feel about it.\u201cI used to do it everyday during lockdown, but now I maybe journal twice a week and I\u2019ll do a really long session, to work around my work schedule. Sometimes I\u2019m up early filming and I can\u2019t wake up super early before then. So I prioritise keeping myself both physically and vocally able to do my job properly.\u201dGoing outdoors is also important to Allison. \u201cI love exercising in nature. Being out in it, breathing the air, touching trees,\u201d she continues. \u201cI think all of these activities give you time to relax, which is one of the most important things for any creative thing.\u201dFor Allison, establishing healthy boundaries hasn\u2019t always been straightforward \u2013 especially when navigating the highs and lows of the entertainment industry. From getting nos and doubting herself to working on projects she\u2019s passionate about, the dial is constantly moving.\u201cI think boundaries are extremely important and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been learning more of as my career develops. You have to be on game, and even better \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 so I\u2019ve had to become stricter with myself \u2013 not strict, but give myself a nice baggy routine that I can stick to.\u201cAnd this just means making sure I take care of myself properly and making sure I\u2019m eating well and sleeping properly. It\u2019s key. But it\u2019s not always easy. I have to try and create these boundaries, otherwise I won\u2019t be able to do anything.\u201dAllison has adopted the same approach with social media, particularly after Sex Education first came out.\u201cSo many people felt connected to that show, and in turn, wanted to connect with the entire cast, which was really exciting. But it can be overwhelming. Overnight so many people are checking out your social media. It\u2019s kind of mad,\u201d she explains.\u201cIt\u2019s hard, but I absolutely do not look at my social media first thing in the morning, at all, and surround myself with good people and real-life connections, making sure I\u2019m there for my friends.\u201dRecommendedNon-binary influencers share what they wish people understood about their experienceCamilla will not receive \u00a3360,000 annuity from parliament like Prince Philip didSarah Ferguson says corgis were unimpressed by her post-surgery recuperationAllison is excited to have such a platform where she can reach so many different people, but she adds: \u201cI want to be able to use that in the right way and be in a clearheaded space.

According to the Mayo Clinic, Bell\u2019s palsy causes a \u201cweakness in the muscles on one side of the face,\u201d but the condition is often temporary and improves in a couple of weeks. In Chen\u2019s experience, both sides of her face were affected.According to King, Chen told her that as her symptoms became more noticeable throughout the last few months,\u00a0that\u2019s when she noticed more \u201churtful\u201d headlines about her appearance.\u201cYou can see it a little bit on her face. She said it was really a bad situation because both sides of her face dropped and she said it was hurtful and unkind that you read the headlines [asking], \u2018What\u2019s wrong with her? She\u2019s never smiling, she looks so somber, why does she look so mean?\u2019\u201d the journalist recalled.King went on to express how Chen told her that \u201cpeople have no idea what women are going through,\u201d which is why she \u201cwanted to share the story of Bell\u2019s palsy and how this can happen in your pregnancy\u201d.

While she said no to this question, according to King, Chen still expressed that she wasn\u2019t happy when people made \u201cassumptions\u201d about her.\u201c[Chen] goes, \u2018No, I\u2019m not gonna say it hurt my feelings, but it was upsetting to me that people just make assumptions when they don\u2019t know you,\u201d King explained. \u201cAnd as women, we just need allies to give us some grace and some understanding.\u2019\u201dDuring the interview, which airs in full on Friday, Chen revealed to King that her \u201cface felt weird\u201d and her tongue was funny after giving birth.\u201cWhen I got home it was like everything was just starting to fall down on itself, like my face was melting,\u201d she said, in a preview of the episode. \u201cA week after giving birth, that was when it all hit, and I called my doctor.

While there is no confirmed cause of the neurological condition, The Facial Paralysis Institute has linked many cases to women post-pregnancy.During her interview with ET, King said that while Chen wasn\u2019t scared or ashamed of her condition, she knows that there have been other women out there who are \u201csuffering [from] Bell\u2019s palsy after pregnancy\u201d\u00a0 and \u201cdon\u2019t want to leave the house\u201d.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGayle King has revealed why Robert De Niro\u2019s girlfriend, Tiffany Chen, was upset by the headlines that have been written about her.During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the 68-year-old reflected on her conversation with Chen, who revealed in an interview onCBS Mornings that she was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy after giving birth to her and De Niro\u2019s daughter, Gia Virginia, in April. According to the Mayo Clinic, Bell\u2019s palsy causes a \u201cweakness in the muscles on one side of the face,\u201d but the condition is often temporary and improves in a couple of weeks. In Chen\u2019s experience, both sides of her face were affected.According to King, Chen told her that as her symptoms became more noticeable throughout the last few months,\u00a0that\u2019s when she noticed more \u201churtful\u201d headlines about her appearance.\u201cYou can see it a little bit on her face. She said it was really a bad situation because both sides of her face dropped and she said it was hurtful and unkind that you read the headlines [asking], \u2018What\u2019s wrong with her? She\u2019s never smiling, she looks so somber, why does she look so mean?\u2019\u201d the journalist recalled.King went on to express how Chen told her that \u201cpeople have no idea what women are going through,\u201d which is why she \u201cwanted to share the story of Bell\u2019s palsy and how this can happen in your pregnancy\u201d. The journalist also shared the message about compassion that Chen wanted people to gain from their interview.RecommendedWhat is Bell\u2019s palsy? The neurological disorder Tiffany Chen was diagnosed with after giving birthRobert De Niro\u2019s girlfriend Tiffany Chen talks about \u2018postpartum complications\u2019 after birth of their daughterRobert De Niro\u2019s girlfriend Tiffany Chen reveals she lost \u2018all facial functions\u2019 after giving birth\u201cHer message really is, \u2018Everybody, can you just be kind and can you just understand that we could all be going through something?\u2019\u201d she added.King recalled that she asked Chen if the headlines about her appearance \u201churt [her] feelings\u201d. While she said no to this question, according to King, Chen still expressed that she wasn\u2019t happy when people made \u201cassumptions\u201d about her.\u201c[Chen] goes, \u2018No, I\u2019m not gonna say it hurt my feelings, but it was upsetting to me that people just make assumptions when they don\u2019t know you,\u201d King explained. \u201cAnd as women, we just need allies to give us some grace and some understanding.\u2019\u201dDuring the interview, which airs in full on Friday, Chen revealed to King that her \u201cface felt weird\u201d and her tongue was funny after giving birth.\u201cWhen I got home it was like everything was just starting to fall down on itself, like my face was melting,\u201d she said, in a preview of the episode. \u201cA week after giving birth, that was when it all hit, and I called my doctor. I was trying to eat. I went to put a fork of food in my mouth and everything came out. I couldn\u2019t eat. And I was starting to slur.\u201dAccording to Chen, she then got admitted to the hospital and \u201clost all facial function\u201d when she got there.As noted by the Mayo Clinic, the disorder, also known as \u201cacute peripheral facial palsy,\u201d can make the face appear lopsided or droopy suddenly and worsen within days. While there is no confirmed cause of the neurological condition, The Facial Paralysis Institute has linked many cases to women post-pregnancy.During her interview with ET, King said that while Chen wasn\u2019t scared or ashamed of her condition, she knows that there have been other women out there who are \u201csuffering [from] Bell\u2019s palsy after pregnancy\u201d\u00a0 and \u201cdon\u2019t want to leave the house\u201d. With that in mind, King said that Chen was even more encouraged to speak out about Bell\u2019s palsy.\u201c[Chen] said, \u2018I just wanted women to know it\u2019s OK. Most times, you will get through it. Normally it\u2019s not permanent. It can take some time... I want women to know that. Please don\u2019t be ashamed, please don\u2019t huddle in your house, please come out, it\u2019s all right,\u2019\u201d King explained.In May, De Niro announced the birth of Gia Virginia \u2013 his seventh child \u2013 when he corrected an ET Canada correspondent who described him as a father of six children. \u201cI just had a baby,\u201d he told the interviewer.Along with Gia, the GoodFellas star has six children from previous relationships. De Niro and his first wife, Diahnne Abbott, share one daughter, Drena, 51, and one son, Raphael, 46. In 1995, he welcomed his twins, Julian and Aaron, 27, with ex-girlfriend Toukie Smith. He also shares his 25-year-old son, Elliot, and 11-year-old daughter, Helen Grace, with ex-wife Grace Hightower.RecommendedRobert De Niro\u2019s partner Tiffany Chen says she had Bell\u2019s palsy after giving birthRobert De Niro\u2019s girlfriend Tiffany Chen reveals she had \u2018postpartum complications\u2019Jorja Smith reflects on social media criticism about her weightDuring her interview with ET, King also recalled how Chen and De Niro first met in 2015, while she worked as the Tai Chi instructor on the set of his film, The Intern.

Some of the slurs she recited were: \u201cMy parents say I can\u2019t talk to you because you\u2019re gay,\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to live,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to hell,\u201d and \u201cMy parents say you\u2019re a pervert and if I beat you up, they wouldn\u2019t care.\u201dIn her speech, she continued to criticise her zone\u2019s representative, Joseph Padilla, for proposing a policy that required teachers to tell parents if students identify as transgender. As noted by WSMV4, he also \u201ccompared being transgender to a mental illness\u201d at the board meeting Monday night. \u201cMy kid\u2019s lucky. When they go home, they have a family that doesn\u2019t believe their identity is a mental illness, Joe,\u201d she said. \u201cNot all kids have that support at home, and you all know that.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRobert De Niro\u2019s girlfriend Tiffany Chen told Gayle King in an interview on CBS Mornings that she was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy after giving birth to their daughter Gia Virginia. Bell\u2019s palsy is a neurological disorder which temporarily paralyses one side of the face and causes it to appear droopy and lopsided. According to the Mayo Clinic, the condition \u201ccauses sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. In most cases, the weakness is temporary and significantly improves over weeks.\u201d However, it\u2019s not uncommon to experience paralysis on both sides of the face as Chen did. Also known as \u201cacute peripheral facial palsy,\u201d the disorder is an inflammation of the nerve which controls the facial muscles and could potentially be the result of a prior viral infection. While there is no confirmed cause of the neurological condition, The Facial Paralysis Institute has linked many cases to women post-pregnancy. The typical time frame for women to develop symptoms after giving birth is seven to 10 days (about one and a half weeks), according to the institute. Symptoms are likely to worsen within 48 hours (about two days) of when they initially appear and begin to ease up in the following weeks. A full recovery typically won\u2019t take place until six months after.RecommendedRobert De Niro\u2019s girlfriend Tiffany Chen reveals she lost \u2018all facial functions\u2019 after giving birth\u2018It\u2019s like having your legs broken\u2019: The truth about flying as a disabled travellerVaping is on every corner \u2013 so why do we still not know if it\u2019s safe?The 45-year-old actress noticed her speech was slurred and she was unable to eat in the week after delivery. \u201cWomen who experience Bell\u2019s palsy symptoms after childbirth should pursue treatment immediately. Bell\u2019s palsy that goes undiagnosed or untreated can lead to permanent facial paralysis,\u201d the institute asserted. If the neurological disorder develops during pregnancy, the chance of complete recovery is lower. Per The Facial Paralysis Institute report: \u201cThe prognosis for complete recovery isn\u2019t as great as the general population, 52 per cent vs 80 per cent, respectively. It should be noted that the poorer outcomes reported are likely related to the past reluctance of physicians to prescribe steroids and antivirals in treatment.\u201d After eight months of experiencing symptoms, the individual is encouraged to seek long-term treatment, but in general, pregnant women are encouraged to be treated with steroids as any other person experiencing the disorder would. \u201cBotox, neuromuscular retraining, and selective neurolysis\u201d are all \u201cnovel treatments\u201d for the permanent condition, according to the institute.\u201cBotox injections can provide safe, reliable, and painless treatment of permanent Bell\u2019s palsy post-pregnancy. When administered to the normal side of the face, the nonsurgical injections relax the overactive muscles, restoring facial symmetry and improving facial appearance,\u201d the institute reported.

This includes not having your phone on charge.\u201cA good night\u2019s sleep is important in order to process information throughout the day as well as to repair and re-balance the body physically and mentally,\u201d Dr Ramlakhan previously told\u00a0The Independent.Lights outLike technology, light bulbs radiate heat, which won\u2019t help when you\u2019re trying to keep cool in this weather.OVO Energy adds that conventional incandescent light bulbs generate light quite inefficiently, giving off up to 90 per cent of their energy as waste heat in the process.As such, switching to low-energy light bulbs will help reduce overheating, as well as saving money.Buy house plantsRecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?Indoor plants can also help cool down a home, as they can help bring moisture into a stuffy room. \u201cPlanting trees and vegetation and the creation of green spaces to enhance evaporation and shading are other options, as temperatures in and around green spaces can be several degrees lower than their surroundings,\" the NHS says."}, {"_id": "64b1416251ac331974948a1b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/royal-box-wimbledon-queen-camilla-mary-berry-b2373879.html", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "test", "title": "From Queen Camilla to Mary Berry: Who is in the Royal Box on the 10th day of Wimbledon?", "lead": "<p>The Royal Box is usually occupied by members of the royal family, celebrities and public figures</p>", "author": "Kate Ng and Ellie Muir", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:47:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:50.815685", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T15:47:04+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/12/12/camilla-mary.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The year set a new record for fires that burned over 400 hectares.

The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue\" - Sean GallupGettyPhotographers stories of capturing extreme weather\"On the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills. I captured this photo in Big Bend, as the story was shifting away from the fire itself and focusing on trying to locate missing persons and recover remains of those who had perished\" - Justin SullivanGettyPhotographers stories of capturing extreme weather\"You can see the Belchatow power plant and the rising steam and smoke from over 20km away. I went there the day before the start of the United Nations\u2019 climate conference in Katowice, which took place in a region where coal has a long history and coal mining is woven into local tradition. Poland has made some strides with renewables, such as with wind turbines that now dot portions of the western Polish countryside. However, given how heavily Poland still relies on coal, it is unlikely that Belchatow will close anytime soon.

With light-skinned people, any tanning that will occur usually happens quickly or within minutes - with the risk of burning much more likely. Those with more melanin in their skin take typically longer to develop a tan and can usually spend hours in the sun without burning. Some people tan faster than others (Stock)However, the amount of time spent in the sun before developing a tan or a burn is all dependent on each individual person\u2019s pigmentation.While outside, it is important to know your skin type and wear the SPF factor sunscreen that will provide the correct amount of protection for you.Is tanning safe ever safe?Tanning increases the risk of skin cancer \u2013 and studies conclude that tanning is never healthy.RecommendedHow much sunscreen you need to apply, according to dermatologistsAccording to skincancer.org, different skin types are at different risks of sun damage.Damage occurs when the ultraviolet light damages the skin\u2019s cellular DNA \u2013 creating genetic mutations.Light-skinned people have a higher risk of damage associated with tanning because of the lack of melanin to protect the skin from the sun.However, people with darker skin are also at risk.Can you still tan when wearing sunscreen?Sunscreen protects the skin from the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun \u2013 prolonging the time a person can spend outside without getting burnt.The higher the SPF, the more protection a sunscreen offers \u2013 with SPF 50 filtering 98 per cent of UV rays.There is no sunscreen that can protect skin 100 per cent from UV rays.SPF\u00a050 offers the highest sun protection (Stock)You can, however, tan while wearing sunscreen.According to ABC Australia, if your unprotected skin would take 10 minutes to show signs of burning, properly applying SPF 50 sunscreen would extend this rate by 50 times \u2013 meaning you could sit in the sun for 500 minutes before burning.Sunscreen only extends the length of time until burning takes place, it does not impact how deeply a person will tan or how long it will take to show a tan.Is it possible to tan in the shade and how do you protect your skin from the sun?According to skincancer.org, \u201cpeople can spend long hours in the shade while still receiving quite a lot of sun exposure and risking sun damage\u201d and shade alone can rarely provide full UV protection.Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsBurns are also possible as UVB rays can reach the skin indirectly.Even if you are in the shade or under an umbrella, wearing sunscreen is necessary to protect skin from the sun.Umbrellas do not protect from UV radiation (Stock)In reality, a combination of multiple sun protection measures is typically needed to provide \u201coptimal protection,\u201d according to a study published in US National Library of Medicine journal. To increase protection, clothing that covers your skin, hats, sunglasses and shade are all important factors.This article was originally published in June 2018."}, {"_id": "64b1416351ac331974948a20", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/tan-sunscreen-shade-uv-protection-b2374810.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Do you still tan when wearing sunscreen and when you sit in the shade?", "lead": "<p>You should always wear sunscreen when outside to protect from harmful UV radiation\u00a0</p>", "author": "Chelsea Ritschel", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:34:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:51.694423", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T15:34:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/27/14/istock-815654798.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

In addition to pigmenting our hair and eyes, it is also responsible for tanning skin exposed to sunlight or UVA radiation, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RecommendedHow much sunscreen should you use and how often do you need to apply it?Does sunscreen expire, what does SPF mean and which type is best?The pigment is also what protects the skin from getting burned \u2013 people with cells that produce more melanin typically don\u2019t burn as quickly, if at all.For people with fair or light skin, less melanin is produced \u2013 meaning the skin is not protected from UVB rays, the rays that cause burns. With light-skinned people, any tanning that will occur usually happens quickly or within minutes - with the risk of burning much more likely. Those with more melanin in their skin take typically longer to develop a tan and can usually spend hours in the sun without burning. Some people tan faster than othersHowever, the amount of time spent in the sun before developing a tan or a burn is all dependent on each individual person\u2019s pigmentation.While outside, it is important to know your skin type and wear the SPF factor sunscreen that will provide the correct amount of protection for you.Is tanning ever safe?Tanning increases the risk of skin cancer \u2013 and studies conclude that tanning is never healthy.RecommendedHow much sunscreen you need to apply, according to dermatologistsAccording to skincancer.org, different skin types are at different risks of sun damage.Damage occurs when the ultraviolet light damages the skin\u2019s cellular DNA \u2013 creating genetic mutations.Light-skinned people have a higher risk of damage associated with tanning because of the lack of melanin to protect the skin from the sun.However, people with darker skin are also at risk.Do you still tan when wearing sunscreen?Sunscreen protects the skin from the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun \u2013 prolonging the time a person can spend outside without getting burnt.The higher the SPF, the more protection a sunscreen offers \u2013 with SPF 50 filtering 98 per cent of UV rays.There is no sunscreen that can protect skin 100 per cent from UV rays.SPF\u00a050 offers the highest sun protection You can, however, tan while wearing sunscreen.According to ABC Australia, if your unprotected skin would take 10 minutes to show signs of burning, properly applying SPF 50 sunscreen would extend this rate by 50 times.Sunscreen only extends the length of time until burning takes place, it does not impact how deeply a person will tan or how long it will take to show a tan.Is it possible to tan in the shade and how do you protect your skin from the sun?According to skincancer.org, \u201cpeople can spend long hours in the shade while still receiving quite a lot of sun exposure and risking sun damage\u201d and shade alone can rarely provide full UV protection.Burns are also possible as UVB rays can reach the skin indirectly.Even if you are in the shade or under an umbrella, wearing sunscreen is necessary to protect skin from the sun.In reality, a combination of multiple sun protection measures is typically needed to provide \u201coptimal protection,\u201d according to a study published in US National Library of Medicine journal. To increase protection, clothing that covers your skin, hats, sunglasses and shade are all important factors.This article was originally published in June 2018."}, {"_id": "64b1416351ac331974948a21", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/skincare-summer-makeup-change-routine-moisturiser-sunscreen-dermatologist-acne-a9625106.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How your beauty and skincare routine should change in the summer, according to a dermatologist", "lead": "<p>Changes in temperature, humidity, and UV exposure can all affect skin</p>", "author": "Chelsea Ritschel", "datePublished": "2023-07-13 15:24:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:36:51.887825", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-13T15:24:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/17/15/istock-637130586.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

To find out what changes, if any, we should be making in the summer, we asked board-certified medical dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon Dr Melanie Palm, who explained that it all comes down to your skin\u2019s behaviour.\u201cOur skin responds and intercepts the environment around us,\u201d she told us. \u201cChanges in temperature, humidity, and UV exposure during the summer can affect our skin environment in terms of sebum and sweat production, which can in turn affect the pH or microenvironment of our skin.\u201dBefore changing up your routine, Dr Palm advises seeing how your skin is behaving, as it may be perfectly comfortable with the same products year-round.RecommendedThe sweat-proof skincare and make-up products for when it's humidThe best skincare routine for acne, explained by expertsVitamin C: Everything you need to know about the skincare ingredientHow many steps your skincare routine should beBut, if you notice your skin is responding differently, whether that means you are experiencing more acne or increased dryness, then you should consider amending your routine, according to Dr Palm.The first change she recommends is switching to \u201clighter formulation products that are less occlusive and hydrating to allow skin to breathe.\u201dOcclusives, a group of ingredients that include waxes, petrolatum, silicone and mineral oils, are used in skincare to form a protective seal over the skin to lock in hydration. While the ingredients may be useful in the winter, especially if you have dry skin, they can often be too heavy in the summer. \u201cAvoid an occlusive or heavy moisturiser, as well as makeup that is not labelled non-comedogenic,\u201d Dr Palm recommends, referring to the term used to describe products that are specially formulated to not block pores. \u201cIf you are normal/combo or even oily/acne-prone skin, those products and cosmetics could cause an acne bonanza on the skin.\u201dSwapping powders or heavy liquid foundations for lighter BB creams, which usually come tinted, is one possible alternative for more-breathable summer makeup.For those with oily skin, the warmer summer months may mean an increase in both oil and sebum production - which means that mattifying or oil-control products could be something to consider, according to Dr Palm. If you\u2019re concerned that using mattifying products could cause acne, another alternative is blotting papers, which can blot away excess oil that accumulates on your face during the day.

Antioxidants protect skin by limiting the production of free radicals, which are linked to ageing, while also assisting with hydration and inflammation.Exfoliation is also key during the hotter months of the year to encourage skin turnover, when our skin sheds dead skin cells and replaces them with younger cells.

The higher the SPF number, the stronger the protection you'll have.SPF provides you with an insight into how much longer it will take for your skin to turn red in response to UVB rays in comparison to if you weren't using any protection at all.Therefore, if you would normally start burning within 30 minutes without sun protection, then a sunscreen with SPF 30 would theoretically provide you with 30 times more protection, which equates to 15 hours of protection.NHS recommends using suncream with minimum SPF 30 (Getty Images/iStockphoto)However, this relative measure does not mean that you should go 15 hours without reapplying sunscreen, as sunscreen can come off by being dried by the sun or coming into contact with water.\u201cNo sunscreen, regardless of strength, should be expected to stay effective longer than two hours without reapplication,\u201d states the Skin Cancer Foundation.The NHS recommends reapplying sunscreen at least every two hours, suggesting that children and adults use a sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30.How much sunscreen should you apply?The NHS warns that if sunscreen is applied too thinly, then the amount of protection that it is able to provide will decrease.According to the NHS, adults should use approximately two teaspoons of sunscreen if they're exposing their head, arms and neck to the sun.However, if they're wearing a swimsuit, adults should aim to use two tablespoons of sunscreen.Adults in the care of children should make sure that any area of skin that is exposed to the sun is covered in sunscreen.Different types of sunscreenSome sunscreens claim to only be necessary for use once a day, while others state that they are water resistant.Here's everything you need to know about the various forms you can find:Once-a-day sunscreenAccording to research conducted by Which?, sunscreens which claim to only require application once a day do not provide a sufficient amount of protection.Therefore, consumers are advised to not rely on a sunscreen which states that it only needs to be applied once a day.Applying suncream once a day is not recommended (Getty Images)Water-resistant sunscreenWater-resistant sunscreen is especially ideal for those spending time in the pool or sea this summer to cool down.It does exactly what it says on the bottle \u2013 provide you with sun protection while you're in the water.However, you must not assume that this protection will continue when you're out of the water.Even if you're using a water-resistant suncream, you should still reapply once you're back on dry land.Sunscreen with insect repellantWhile sunscreen which contains insect repellant may sound appealing to those who want to ward off any pestering bugs, it may not be advisable.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using sunscreen separately to insect repellant.\n\n20 swimsuits and bikinis to buy for your summer holidayShow all 211/2120 swimsuits and bikinis to buy

The higher the SPF number, the stronger the protection you'll have.SPF provides you with an insight into how much longer it will take for your skin to turn red in response to UVB rays in comparison to if you weren't using any protection at all.Therefore, if you would normally start burning within 30 minutes without sun protection, then a sunscreen with SPF 30 would theoretically provide you with 30 times more protection, which equates to 15 hours of protection.NHS recommends using suncream with minimum SPF 30 (Getty Images/iStockphoto)However, this relative measure does not mean that you should go 15 hours without reapplying sunscreen, as sunscreen can come off by being dried by the sun or coming into contact with water.\u201cNo sunscreen, regardless of strength, should be expected to stay effective longer than two hours without reapplication,\u201d states the Skin Cancer Foundation.The NHS recommends reapplying sunscreen at least every two hours, suggesting that children and adults use a sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30.How much sunscreen should you apply?The NHS warns that if sunscreen is applied too thinly, then the amount of protection that it is able to provide will decrease.According to the NHS, adults should use approximately two teaspoons of sunscreen if they're exposing their head, arms and neck to the sun.However, if they're wearing a swimsuit, adults should aim to use two tablespoons of sunscreen.Adults in the care of children should make sure that any area of skin that is exposed to the sun is covered in sunscreen.Different types of sunscreenSome sunscreens claim to only be necessary for use once a day, while others state that they are water resistant.Here's everything you need to know about the various forms you can find:Once-a-day sunscreenAccording to research conducted by Which?, sunscreens which claim to only require application once a day do not provide a sufficient amount of protection.Therefore, consumers are advised to not rely on a sunscreen which states that it only needs to be applied once a day.Applying suncream once a day is not recommended (Getty Images)Water-resistant sunscreenWater-resistant sunscreen is especially ideal for those spending time in the pool or sea this summer to cool down.It does exactly what it says on the bottle \u2013 provide you with sun protection while you're in the water.However, you must not assume that this protection will continue when you're out of the water.Even if you're using a water-resistant suncream, you should still reapply once you're back on dry land.Sunscreen with insect repellantWhile sunscreen which contains insect repellant may sound appealing to those who want to ward off any pestering bugs, it may not be advisable.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using sunscreen separately to insect repellant.\n\n20 swimsuits and bikinis to buy for your summer holidayShow all 211/2120 swimsuits and bikinis to buy
