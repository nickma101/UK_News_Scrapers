My thoughts are with Fran, the boys and his wider family,\" she said.<br/>Alagiah died earlier on Monday, but \"fought until the bitter end\", his agent added.<br/>BBC director general Tim Davie said: \"Across the BBC, we are all incredibly sad to hear the news about George. We are thinking of his family at this time.<br/>\"He was more than just an outstanding journalist, audiences could sense his kindness, empathy and wonderful humanity. He was loved by all and we will miss him enormously.\"<br/>BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson tweeted: \"A gentler, kinder, more insightful and braver friend and colleague it would be hard to find.\"<br/>BBC chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet called him \"a great broadcaster\", a \"kind colleague\" and \"a thoughtful journalist\".<br/>Clive Myrie, presenting the BBC News at One, said: \"On a personal note, George touched all of us here in the newsroom, with his kindness and generosity, his warmth and good humour. We loved him here at BBC News, and I loved him as a mentor, colleague and friend.\"<br/>Fellow journalists including LBC's Sangita Myska, the Guardian's Pippa Crerar and Mark Austin of Sky News were among those to also pay tribute.<br/>Austin tweeted: \"This breaks my heart. A good man, a rival on the foreign correspondent beat but above all a friend. If good journalism is about empathy, and it often is, George Alagiah had it in spades.\"<br/>Myska noted Alagiah's influence on British Asian reporters.<br/>\"Growing up, when the BBC's George Alagiah was on TV my dad would shout \"George is on!\". We'd run to watch the man who inspired a generation of British Asian journalists. That scene was replicated across the UK. We thank you, George. RIP xx\"<br/>Former BBC North American editor Jon Sopel wrote: \"Tributes will rightly be paid to a fantastic journalist and brilliant broadcaster - but George was the most decent, principled, kindest, most honourable man I have ever worked with. What a loss.\"<br/>BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner recalled Alagiah visiting him in hospital after he was shot and critically injured in an al-Qaeda attack in Saudia Arabia in 2004.<br/>\"He brought me his book A Passage to Africa, and we talked for hours about the continent he loved and spent so much of his career covering. A true journalist and a great author.\"<br/>Alagiah won awards for reports on the famine and war in Somalia in the early 1990s, and was nominated for a Bafta in 1994 for covering Saddam Hussein's genocidal campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq. <br/>He was also named Amnesty International's journalist of the year in 1994, for reporting on the civil war in Burundi, and was the first BBC journalist to report on the genocide in Rwanda.<br/>George Maxwell Alagiah was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka, before moving to Ghana and then England in childhood.<br/>His main childhood memory of Sri Lanka was leaving it. His parents were Christian Tamils; the country, then called Ceylon, mired in ethnic violence. <br/>His father, Donald, was an engineer specialising in water distribution and irrigation. Feeling unwelcome and unsafe in his own land, he took his young family to Africa in search of a new and better life.<br/>The family initially prospered in Ghana but Alagiah's parents decided to educate their children in England. At the age of 11, his father dropped him off at boarding school in Portsmouth; they both had to hold back the tears. <br/>His childhood of change and assimilation helped shape his personality and informed his professional judgement.   <br/>There was some racism. He was almost the only boy of colour; there were \"Bongo Bongo land\" taunts in the showers. He gave up asking people to say his name correctly (his family pronounced it, \"Uller-hiya\").  <br/>\"In those days,\" he reflected \"you were almost apologetic if you had a 'funny name'.\" The alternative was to stick out like an \"exotic cactus in a bed of spring meadow plants\".<br/>But, in some ways, his school in England - St John's College - was a closed and unreal society, which sealed him off from the huge social changes going on outside its walls. The anti-immigrant sentiment in many parts of the country was something that largely passed him by. <br/>As he grew up, he became, he believed, the \"right sort\" of foreigner in a land where \"class trumps race every time\".<br/>Later, he attended Durham University, where he met, and later married, Frances Robathan.<br/>After graduating, he spent seven years at South Magazine, proud of its editorial line which painted an unequal world as an unstable one. <br/>He joined the BBC as a foreign affairs correspondent in 1989 and then became Africa correspondent, the continent of his childhood.<br/>It was often a depressing experience. He interviewed child soldiers in Liberia, victims of mass rape in Uganda and witnessed hunger and disease almost everywhere.<br/>\"There is a new generation in Africa\", he wrote, \"my generation, freedom's children, born and educated in those years of euphoria after independence, we have had a chance. We didn't do much with it.\"<br/>One of his proudest professional moments came when he broadcast some of the first pictures of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo in 1999, he said.<br/>Other stories he covered in news reports and documentaries included the trade in human organs in India, street children in Brazil, civil war in Afghanistan and human rights violations in Ethiopia.<br/>He interviewed figures including South African President Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.<br/>Moving to news presenting, he fronted the BBC One O'Clock News, Nine O'Clock News and BBC Four News, before being made one of the main presenters of the Six O'Clock News in 2003.<br/>He anchored news programmes from Sri Lanka following the December 2004 tsunami, as well as reporting from New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and from Pakistan following the South Asian earthquake in 2005.<br/>He was appointed an OBE for services to journalism in 2008.<br/>After Alagiah's initial cancer diagnosis in 2014, the disease spread to his liver and lymph nodes, which needed chemotherapy and several operations, including one to remove most of his liver.<br/>He said he was a \"richer person\" for the experience upon returning to presenting in 2015, and said working in the newsroom was \"such an important part of keeping energised and motivated\".<br/>He had to take several further breaks from work to have treatment, and in January 2022 said he thought the cancer would \"probably get me in the end\", but that he still felt \"very lucky\".<br/>Speaking on the Desperately Seeking Wisdom podcast in 2022, he said that when his cancer was first discovered, it took a while for him to understand what he \"needed to do\".<br/>\"I had to stop and say, 'Hang on a minute. If the full stop came now, would my life have been a failure?'<br/>\"And actually, when I look back and I looked at my journey... the family I had, the opportunities my family had, the great good fortune to bump into [Frances Robathan], who's now been my wife and lover for all these years, the kids that we brought up... it didn't feel like a failure.\"<br/>Alagiah had two children with Frances.<br/>Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer, but the NHS advice is to see your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms and they have persisted for more than four weeks.<br/>And if you, or someone you know, have been affected by cancer, information and support is available on the BBC's Action Line page.<br/>Allan Little: Empathy was George\u2019s great strength<br/>Tributes paid to much-loved BBC journalist Alagiah<br/>Watch: Tributes to George Alagiah<br/>George Alagiah takes TV break after cancer spreads<br/>Cancer will probably get me, says George Alagiah<br/>Alagiah takes break from TV for cancer treatment<br/>BBC's Alagiah on living with coronavirus and cancer<br/>Alagiah 'overwhelmed' by viewers' support<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The European Union has sent extra firefighters to help. <br/>\"We are at war and are exclusively geared towards the fire front,\" Mr Mitsotakis said as he warned Greece faces \"another three difficult days ahead\" before high temperatures are forecast to ease.<br/>Rhodes has been battling fires fanned by strong winds since Tuesday and roughly 19,000 people have been evacuated so far, in what Greek authorities say is the largest operation of its kind they have carried out.<br/>Helen Rendell, 66, and her husband, Ray, 72, had to evacuate their home in Lardos and head to Rhodes Town.<br/>The couple, originally from Chelmsford, told the BBC their home has survived the fierce fires but other locals were not so lucky.<br/>\"The impact on the people here is terrible,\" Mrs Rendell said. \"It's awful.\"<br/>Around 2,500 people have been evacuated from Corfu, some 1,027km (670 miles) miles away, a fire department spokesman told the AFP news agency.<br/>Boats were used to rescue people from beaches but officials have told the BBC the situation is less serious than on Rhodes.<br/>Emergency services are also tackling fires on Evia, the second largest of the Greek islands, and some areas are being evacuated, the state news agency ANA-MPA reports.<br/>It is unclear what started the fires but extreme temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds across Greece have aided their spread. <br/>Chariton Koutscouris, North Corfu's head of tourism, said arson was suspected and the fire department had been warned someone was planning on deliberately starting a fire.<br/>He said the blazes were down to a \"group of people\" who \"get pleasure out of this with the pain of the other people\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Wildfires spread on hills near the resort of Lardos<br/>Emma Brennan, a spokesperson for ABTA - the travel association trade body whose members are travel agents and tour operators - said people in the resorts of Lindos, Pefkos and Kalathos in Rhodes have had their evacuation order removed and can safely return.<br/>She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"Travel companies will be liaising with their accommodation providers to ensure that they are ready to receive customers, and customers will be notified accordingly.\"<br/>Airspace remains open and, while firms are cancelling package holidays, most flights are still running in order to allow people to travel to safe parts of the islands, or return home.<br/>'Our holiday has become a survival exercise'<br/>Locals step in to help tourists after Rhodes fires<br/>Corfu latest Greek island to evacuate over fires<br/>Tourists in Rhodes slept in cardboard boxes<br/>Scots sleep on street as Rhodes wildfires spread<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This now goes right back to the Natwest Banking Group [owners of Coutts].<br/>\"Someone in that group decided it was appropriate, legal and ethical to leak details of my personal financial situation. <br/>\"That, I think, is wrong on every level - and that is where the spotlight should be and it will.\"<br/>Mr Jack, who tweeted his apology, said his story had been \"from a trusted and senior source\".<br/>\"However, the information turned out to be incomplete and inaccurate. Therefore, I would like to apologise to Mr Farage,\" Mr Jack continued.<br/>Mr Farage later said:  \"Jack says, in the tweet, that his information came from a trusted and senior source. I would suggest that it may well have been a very senior source.\"<br/>On 21 July, the BBC updated its original article to say it had \"not been accurate\".  Mr Farage then asked for a formal apology from the BBC.<br/>On Monday, the BBC said on its Corrections and Clarifications website:  \"We acknowledge that the information we reported - that Coutts' decision on Mr Farage's account did not involve considerations about his political views - turned out not to be accurate and have apologised to Mr Farage.\"<br/>When Coutts decided to close Mr Farage's account, he said it did not give him a reason.<br/>Mr Farage subsequently obtained a document looking at his suitability as a Coutts customer.<br/>The 40-page document provided to Mr Farage included minutes from a meeting in November last year reviewing his account.<br/>The document flagged concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\", and also raised concerns about the reputational risk of having Mr Farage as a client.<br/>It said that to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts' \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".<br/>Mr Farage said the BBC had fallen for \"spin\" and he had been \"cancelled\" for his political views.<br/>The boss of NatWest Group, Dame Alison Rose, apologised on Thursday to Mr Farage for what she called the \"deeply inappropriate\" comments made in the document.<br/>She also said that she was commissioning a full review of Coutts' processes on bank account closures.<br/>Mr Farage has called for Dame Alison to be questioned by MPs.<br/>Speaking on GB News on Monday evening, Mr Farage said he had now submitted a subject access request (a request for a copy of information held about you) to NatWest and had raised his case with the Information Commissioner's Office.<br/>He also disclosed the contents of the letter sent to him on Monday by the BBC's Deborah Turness, in which she apologised, saying: \"I can understand why you feel this story has contributed to you being put through a considerable and humiliating amount of publicity.\"<br/>The Treasury has called a meeting with bank bosses over account closures, following the row between Mr Farage and NatWest.<br/>The BBC will hope its apology will draw a line under the story.  <br/>The fallout is an insight into a key tenet of journalism - sourcing stories.

The posts claim to help end money worries but charities warn some companies are misleading people who are struggling. <br/>Some who sign up to the products on offer, known as IVAs, could end up worse off, a BBC investigation has found. <br/>Shauna was \u00a317,000 in debt with car and furniture loans when a specific sort of social media post started to appear in her feed. As she scrolled online in the evenings while her three children were in bed, she was drawn to pictures of worried-looking women alongside claims of wiping away financial troubles.<br/>It was autumn 2020, and Shauna, then 23, was on maternity leave from her job as a care worker in a supported living facility. Costs had started to mount when she was pregnant and the bills and reminder notices were clogging up the letterbox of her south Wales home.<br/>\"I saw no end to it,\" she says. \"It was just building and building\u2026 I didn't know how to cope.\" <br/>A company called Mums in Debt, she remembers, caught her eye on Facebook. It promised to write off up to 85% of debt. The more Shauna searched, the more it seemed like the perfect solution. One amount she could budget for. The belief she was taking control of her finances. <br/>\"I thought\u2026 'this is something for mothers, struggling'\", she explains. \"That's what sold it to me\".<br/>She says she answered some questions from Mums in Debt on Facebook Messenger and a representative gave her a call. She was passed on to another company, which signed her up to an Individual Voluntary Arrangement - a court-approved debt solution in which debts are combined into a single monthly payment. The arrangement, she was told, would last for five years. <br/>Shauna kept up with her agreed payments of \u00a3185 a month. But after a year, she realised her debts had barely budged.  <br/>Set up in the 1980s as a way to help owners of small companies keep trading and deal with their debt, IVAs are a booming business. Almost 90,000 were registered in England and Wales in 2022, compared to about 50,000 in 2014, according to figures from the Insolvency Service. <br/>Although they can be a welcome solution for people who want to protect their assets, like their homes, IVAs are unlikely to be suitable for people with low levels of debt, people without much disposable income, or people whose income solely comes from benefits.<br/>But the Citizens Advice charity says IVAs are being aggressively marketed at people in vulnerable situations by companies seeking to earn referral fees. <br/>\"You can just search online, on Google for debt advice and the [sponsored] ads will typically be from IVA firms\", explains its head of policy Morgan Wild.<br/>\"We're seeing worrying trends of companies making false claims about IVAs, and even posing as charities on social media\u2026 these tactics lure people into IVAs which they simply can't afford\". <br/>The BBC asked three independent debt advisers to review Shauna's case. They expressed concerns about the affordability of her IVA payments because it was set up when her outgoings were smaller because she was living with her mother.<br/>Fourteen other people who said they had signed up to IVAs after seeing social media posts also told the BBC they were struggling with repayments.  <br/>In a recent report, Citizens Advice deemed a sample of Facebook and Instagram IVA ads to be \"misleading\". Some ads failed to mention IVAs, while others used names that could be confused with charities or claimed to offer, free, impartial debt advice. <br/>Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment when asked about social media adverts promoting IVAs on its platforms.<br/>The BBC decided to investigate what was happening on TikTok. In June 2023, the BBC's data team searched TikTok for videos promoting IVAs, by typing in keywords like \"debt help UK\", \"stop bailiffs\" or \"debt advice\".<br/>Of more than 400 videos the team looked at which directly promoted IVAs or linked to IVA websites, more than 75% appeared to breach Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) rules. <br/>Most of the videos that appeared to break the rules did not mention the risks, terms and conditions or fees associated with taking out an IVA, while about a third overstated the speed or simplicity involved in setting one up. <br/>The ASA reviewed a sample of the videos. It said it had concerns about \"irresponsible ads\" and was \"continuing to monitor and take action where they appear\".<br/>It said: \"Advertisers need to be responsible. They shouldn't exploit consumers' fears or lack of experience, or trivialise the decision to use IVAs.\" <br/>TikTok said it was \"committed to working with the Advertising Standards Authority to ensure advertisers and creators comply with their guidelines\". It added that adverts promoting debt consolidation and debt assistance programs, which IVAs fall under, \"are not allowed on our platform and are removed\".<br/>Debt Trap: Who's Cashing In?<br/>As the cost of living crisis deepens, Panorama investigates the booming debt management industry and the companies signing up people for Individual Voluntary Arrangements.<br/>Watch Debt Trap: Who's Cashing In? on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 24 July (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) and on BBC iPlayer afterwards (UK only)<br/>After three years of repayments, Shauna now says she feels \"manipulated\" by the claims she saw on social media and says she would not have gone ahead with the IVA if she had known about other options. <br/>A statement she shared with the BBC from 2021 showed that she had paid \u00a31,537.99 of the \u00a33,650 in fees that she owes, with just \u00a3360 knocked off her debt. <br/>With prices rising, she says she has found it harder and harder to make ends meet and has had to use a foodbank for the first time.  <br/>\"I couldn't afford [the food shop] because the IVA went out [of my account],\" she says. \"I just feel ashamed of myself.\" <br/>The BBC wrote to Mums in Debt about Shauna's case but did not receive a response.<br/>Experiences like Shauna's are familiar to Morgan Wild of Citizens Advice. He says cracking down on social media content is \"much needed\", but also calls for greater regulation of the IVA sector itself. <br/>BBC Panorama called several companies in the IVA industry to see what happens when they are approached by potential customers. The team heard high pressure sales tactics being applied in some cases, with a reference to bailiff action if a potential client didn't go ahead.<br/>It is a complex field to navigate. Two types of companies - lead generators and debt packagers - can pass on potential customers to companies which provide IVAs. But lead generators are not regulated by the UK's financial watchdog - the Financial Conduct Authority. They typically earn up to about \u00a31,000 in fees for finding a customer who signs up to an IVA. <br/>Separately, insolvency practitioners, who set up the IVAs and earn money in fees, are not overseen by a fully independent regulator, but are members of professional membership associations who oversee their work.<br/>The patchwork of regulation could mean that people like Shauna are falling through the cracks. <br/>The government agency the Insolvency Service acknowledged there are concerns about the use of IVAs, but said when used appropriately they are an \"effective way for someone who is in financial difficulty to\u2026 pay their creditors\". The FCA said it was doing everything within its remit to ensure firms \"really are supporting borrowers in financial difficulty\". <br/>For now, Shauna is in touch with Citizens Advice and is considering her options - she could cancel the IVA and negotiate with her creditors directly, or see if she is eligible for another debt solution. Cancelling the IVA would mean she loses any money she has paid in fees so far. <br/>She has always dreamed of owning her own home, with a bedroom for each of her three children but now feels the prospect is growing ever more distant. <br/>\"[I'm] living from paycheck to paycheck,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm getting absolutely nowhere.\" <br/>To anyone in a complicated financial situation, she urges them to think carefully before signing up to a debt solution. <br/>\"If you see an ad [online], do your research and find out exactly what you're getting yourself into.\" <br/>Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

He said the bill was necessary for the government to \"carry out policy in line with the decision of the majority of the citizens of the country\".<br/>The vote brings to a head months of turmoil, with Israel's president warning political leaders on Monday that the country was \"in a state of national emergency\".<br/>On Monday morning protesters blocking a boulevard outside the Knesset were sprayed with water cannon and pulled off the road by police amid a cacophony of noise from drums, whistles and air horns.<br/>One protester was hurt, local media say, and six were arrested, police said.

The government says the reforms serve to strengthen democracy, arguing the Supreme Court has accrued too much power over politics in recent decades.<br/>Deepening the crisis, thousands of reservists, including pilots in the air force crucial to Israel's offensive and defensive capabilities, have vowed not to volunteer for service. Such unprecedented dissent has caused alarm over the potential impact on Israel's military readiness.<br/>Former heads of Israel's security services, chief justices, and prominent legal and business figures have also been vocal against the government's reforms.<br/>The measures have also been criticised by the US President Joe Biden, who in his most explicit comments yet called for the \"divisive\" reforms to be postponed.<br/>Netanyahu leaves hospital ahead of key judicial vote<br/>What is the crisis in Israel about?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He has no criminal record and has never appeared on any offenders register.<br/>\"How can he show contrite or remorse for something he staunchly claims he did not do?\"<br/>They added: \"We do a lot of work in our community helping those in need and this is only an extension of that work.<br/>\"We are supporting David with his mental health and will continue to do so.

Footballers are role models - particularly for young people - and it's not okay to have someone in this position who has been found to be a rapist.\"<br/>Glasgow United, who play in the West of Scotland third division, selected Goodwillie to play in a match against West of Scotland Premier Division side Pollok on July 12 but lost 7-0.<br/>A few days later, Goodwillie spoke out for the first time since the 2017 ruling on the Anything Goes podcast by Scottish actor James English.<br/>The footballer said he did not feel like he has had justice and that both parties had been left in limbo.<br/>In 2017, Goodwillie and former Dundee United teammate David Robertson were ordered to pay \u00a3100,000 in damages after a judge ruled they raped a woman at a flat in Armadale, West Lothian, in 2011.<br/>Neither faced a criminal trial over the rape accusation after prosecutors said there was not enough evidence.<br/>Robertson retired from football aged 30 in the days after the ruling, while Goodwillie left English side Plymouth Argyle by \"mutual agreement\".<br/>However, the forward soon signed with Scottish League One side Clyde, who he played for more than 100 times and captained before leaving in 2022.<br/>Raith Rovers sparked outrage by signing Goodwillie in January 2022 and a loan move back to Clyde also collapsed.<br/>Rape Crisis Scotland described the Raith Rovers move as another \"clear message of disregard\" to survivors of rape and sexual violence.<br/>The forward was released without playing a game in September 2022, with Raith Rovers admitting it \"got it wrong\" by signing him.<br/>In February this year, Northern Premier League side Radcliffe FC, based in Bury, Greater Manchester, released the striker after one game following a public outcry.<br/>Four months later, Goodwillie's contract with Australian semi-professional club Sorrento FC was rescinded.

Small yellow birds tweeted noisily from their cage as Edisa talked; family pets which they had carried to safety.<br/>Just a few days ago, tourists soaked up the sun and splashed about in the glittering blue water here. Now all that is left are the smouldering remains of what looked like a caf\u00e9 and the burnt-out skeleton of a local tourism business.<br/>Edisa had just been told their house had survived undamaged, but fires rage on nearby and much of the area is badly damaged. She fears for her future here.<br/>\"It's going to take a lot of years to be repaired and I don't think tourists will want to come back after all this,\" she says.<br/>Strong winds carried the pungent smell of smoke across the beach as a tanned man in reflective sunglasses came to view the wreck of his water sports hire company.<br/>Takis Mitropoulos was resigned, but optimistic.<br/>\"We lost the business. But we have good health and we hope to fix it again. If we are in good health, we can fix everything.\"<br/>But then he took a phone call and rushed off. The fire was spreading again. Everyone here is on high alert, ready for the moment the wind shifts it in their direction.<br/>It is all having a terrible impact on the local community, explained Kyriakos Sarikas, the marketing manager for H Hotels collection which has six properties on Rhodes. <br/>Our footsteps echoed as we stepped across the vast cool lobby of one hotel. All the guests were evacuated over the weekend. But, he added, many local workers have had to flee their homes too. As we spoke, the authorities announced the evacuation of several other villages.<br/>\"It's like a biblical catastrophe,\" he says.<br/>The hotel itself was undamaged and with the fires still raging, it was still too early to fully assess the scale of destruction, but he's horrified by the burnt-out landscapes around the area.<br/>\"We need to have a plan going out of this crisis to restore the whole area. The hotel is a hotel - you can rebuild it, you can repaint it - but the nature outside is the most important thing, because all this is a result of the environmental crisis that we are facing.\"<br/>As we drove back north, thick smoke obscured the wooded hillsides to the west and fire engines clustered at the roadside.

So what are their rights?<br/>A number of airlines are continuing flights as normal, but some have cancelled flights or package holidays scheduled for the coming days.<br/>Crucially, the official advice from the UK Foreign Office has stopped short of advising against travel to Rhodes. Instead, it is advising people to follow guidance from the Greek emergency services. Anyone planning to travel should first check with their operator, airline or hotel.<br/>That guidance can change so people should keep checking, wherever they are planning to travel to.<br/>Around 2,400 visitors and locals have been evacuated from Corfu and there are also wildfires on Evia.<br/>Greek officials say the fires in Corfu are coming under control and are urging travellers to go ahead with their holiday plans.<br/>Travellers should still check their flights and accommodation are not affected.<br/>There is unlikely to be a specific clause - which is why the Foreign Office advice is so crucial.<br/>Were there to be official advice not to travel, then claims would usually become valid. At present, that is not the case.<br/>So, for now, it depends on your specific policy. For some people who have stated particular medical conditions, or if they have become ill as a result of the wildfires, then there might be limited opportunities to claim.<br/>Different companies have varying policies at present, and varying degrees of flexibility on rebooking: <br/>There is no Foreign Office advice against travel to Rhodes or Corfu, so there's nothing to stop airlines selling standalone flights, nor do they have to cancel those already scheduled.<br/>However, package holidays are more complex. They may include accommodation that has been affected by fire, and the duty of care lasts for longer, so operators may decide to cancel. <br/>Someone who travelled on a package deal and is forced to come home early may receive a partial refund. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Holidaymakers describe \"terrifying\" wildfires ordeal<br/>However, if you were booked for two weeks, and came back after one, that does not mean you get half your money back, because, for example, you would still have travelled on an outbound and inbound flight.<br/>The best option is to keep in close contact, where possible, with your holiday company.<br/>If you travelled independently, then accommodation costs will depend on the individual hotel.<br/>Anyone who shortens their holiday because it is not a very pleasant experience or are concerned about being trapped is unlikely to be able to claim refunds, according to travel expert Simon Calder.<br/>That is because it is their choice, rather than necessity. Not all of the island is at risk from the fires.<br/>Not all of the island is affected by the fires, so it is a mixed picture. Some holidays are cancelled, while individual flights may still leave.<br/>If you have a package deal, then there is a chance your whole holiday has been cancelled. If that is the case, then there would be a full refund or the chance to rebook elsewhere.<br/>If you simply don't want to go, then it is more dependant on your specific travel company - there is no automatic right to get your money back, according to the Association of British Travel Agents.<br/>Anyone who has booked flights and accommodation separately would receive a refund for the flights element if they are cancelled, but would need to contact their hotel for other elements.<br/>Again, refunds if you chose not to travel is a decision for specific airlines and hotels.<br/>If people do not want to travel owing to the heat, many of the same cancellation rules apply. <br/>We have an explanation of those issues here.<br/>Thousands flee 'disaster film' Rhodes wildfires<br/>How to manage your holiday in a heatwave<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Others changed from storage and industrial premises. <br/>The government is now planning to launch a new consultation on allowing commercial premises - such as a shop or a takeaway - to be changed into residential accommodation.<br/>However, former PM Boris Johnson announced similar plans back in 2020. There was also a consultation on supporting housing delivery in 2021, which looked at creating new permitted development rights. <br/>A commitment to build one million new homes in England by the end Parliament was also reaffirmed by Mr Gove.<br/>This would be in December 2024 - five years since the current Parliament first sat. The pledge was originally made in the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto - a set of promises set out by political parties ahead of an election. <br/>So how is the government doing?<br/>Between 2019 and 2022 (the latest available data), 687,390 additional homes were built in England. <br/>This means - in order to meet the one million target - more than 300,000 homes will need to be built in the next year and a half. <br/>In 2021-22, nearly 233,000 additional homes were built. This includes converted properties as well as new builds. <br/>The government also has a second target - to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. However, this one has never been met. <br/>The Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee has said the government is not on track to fulfil this pledge.<br/>Setting up the \"Office for Place\" was another of Mr Gove's proposals.<br/>Described as a \"new body\", the Office would ensure housing was designed to a high standard. It would also give local communities a say in the look of new developments. <br/>The government's press release said that the Office for Place \"will be launched today\".<br/>However, this may be a surprise to the former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, who gave a speech two years ago on 20 July 2021 launching the Office for Place. <br/>What has actually changed is that the Office for Place has gone from being a small team within Mr Gove's department to being a legally-constituted, arm's-length body.<br/>A \"new \u00a324 million Planning Skills Delivery Fund\" was also announced by Mr Gove.<br/>The money, the government says, will be used to speed up housing developments and improve planning capacity.<br/>But only half of the \u00a324m is new funding. The government told the BBC that while \u00a312m is new funding allocated to the Department, the other half would come from its existing budget. <br/>A great deal of Mr Gove's speech was given over to plans for large numbers of new homes and lab space in Cambridge. <br/>He announced the establishment of a Cambridge Delivery Group to work out how to do this - although it was only allocated \u00a35m to start work.<br/>These plans are new, although there has been significant local opposition in newspaper reports ahead of the announcement.<br/>The government's Levelling Up White Paper from February 2022 talked about how research funding was concentrated in Oxford, Cambridge and the South East of England.<br/>That same document also talked about the \u00a3500m City Deal with Greater Cambridge, investing in infrastructure, housing and skills.<br/>BBC Verify asked the Department for Levelling Up to set out which of the announcements were new.

But if you speak to people who've worked on both you might be surprised.<br/>No, we're not talking about warp pipes or a battle royale in the Queen Vic. <br/>But we are talking about what it's like to act on a big-budget game.<br/>For most actors, getting a long-running, steady gig can be difficult, but soaps can provide one.<br/>Jennifer English and Devora Wilde tell BBC Newsbeat that working on fantasy role-playing game Baldur's Gate 3 gave them the same sort of stability. <br/>The long-awaited title is set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, and Jennifer plays Shadowheart - a half-elf cleric.<br/>It's not her first time acting in a game, but this is the longest project she's worked on. <br/>That's not too surprising - Baldur's Gate 3 is a huge title, reported to have 17,000 possible variations to its ending, <br/>Jennifer first found out she'd got the role in 2019. Since then, she's spent hours and hours recording lines and full-body motion capture sequences.<br/>\"I didn't realise before starting this is how hard it is, creating this entire universe,\" she says.<br/>\"It's not like an everyday kitchen sink drama, there's a lot going on. And you have to create that in your imagination on your own.\"<br/>Acting for video games presents challenges you wouldn't find on a traditional TV or film set.<br/>For example, actors recording motion capture have to picture their surroundings in their heads before they're added on a computer later on.<br/>And Baldur's Gate 3, with its branching storylines, presented some new and unique elements.<br/>In the game, players can make choices that influence the story, which means the actors need to record multiple versions of a scene with small tweaks to the script each time.<br/>It leads to a lot of work and studio time, which means stable employment.<br/>\"When do you get to play characters for that long unless you're doing a soap?\" says Jennifer.<br/>Jennifer's cast mate Devora Wilde plays githyanki warrior Lae'zel. She's previously appeared in long-running UK soap Hollyoaks. <br/>She says getting into character can quickly become second nature, even when you're playing a mythical creature with green skin and pointy ears.<br/>\"At one point I was in recording every single day,\" she says.<br/>\"By the end, you can just slip into the character. It's become so much a part of you.\"<br/>Jennifer also revealed that parts of the script were altered during recording, with actors and directors workshopping changes as they went along.<br/>\"At the start of recording, Shadowheart was very different,\" she says.<br/>\"We've played and created, and we've made a character that's really nuanced. That comes from conversation and collaboration,\" she says.<br/>That's why Jennifer isn't convinced AI will be coming for her job any time soon - despite concerns about the technology.<br/>\"AI is terrifying for us, but can it get the depths of human emotion that actors bring and the surprising creativity we bring?\"<br/>Speaking of human emotions, love, lust and romance are a key part of Baldur's Gate 3, which allows players to flirt and build relationships with female or male companions.<br/>This included Jennifer and Devora's characters, and it meant acting out some potentially awkward love scenes.<br/>Devora says she was pleased game developer Larian employed specially trained intimacy co-ordinators to make sure actors feel comfortable during romantic scenes.<br/>While common in film production, Baldur's Gate 3 maker Larian believes they're one of the first to use them on a traditional video game, and say they hope others will follow their lead.<br/>Jennifer admits there was some weirdness during recording but the game's story never took things too far.<br/>\"I never felt 'yuck' in a recording session at all. And I've got quite a low 'yuck' threshold,\" she says.<br/>The game's romance angle also throws up another challenge that you probably wouldn't find on the set of Hollyoaks.<br/>You might've seen viral posts about a love scene involving a human character that shapeshifts into a bear.<br/>Larian says a reveal of the scene on TikTok got them temporarily banned from the platform.<br/>But Devora thinks it's hilarious. <br/>\"It just shows you how crazy in the best possible way this game is.\" <br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Warcraft fans trick AI article bot with Glorbo hoax<br/>Has Diablo IV completed its quest for inclusivity?<br/>Metal Gear Solid 3 actors not told about remake<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

I thought this world was hidden and hard to access, but it is so easy to find.<br/>I've gone undercover online to investigate how drug gangs use social media to groom children.<br/>The fake account is for a 15-year-old girl called Mia. <br/>Setting up Mia's account, I've not gone looking for drugs - or followed any accounts that seem criminal.  <br/>I've only followed accounts a teenager might, like musicians or funny videos. <br/>On one account, which posts videos of people messing around with cars and motorbikes, I click on a story and up pops another app called Telegram. <br/>On it is a page trying to sell drugs including cocaine and ketamine. <br/>I am shocked that this content is so readily available, even though I set up this account posing as a child.<br/>Snapchat said using its platform to buy or sell drugs was illegal and it proactively moderates content to detect and prevent any dealing.<br/>I know these gangs do not just use social media to sell their drugs - they also recruit children.<br/>Anna, not her real name, who is in her 20s, was exploited and controlled by an Eastern European drugs gang in south Wales as a teenager.<br/>She got sucked into that dark world after a friend request on Snapchat from a young man she met on a night out. <br/>\"He would be quite romantic, quite flirty and just shown a massive interest in me,\" Anna told me. \"We'd message 24/7.\"<br/>Anna thought she was getting into a relationship. She saw a man, not much older than herself, taking an interest in her.<br/>But he had other ideas and saw Anna as young, vulnerable and ripe for exploitation.  <br/>\"The more I would be around, the more I would help with the drug dealing,\" she said. <br/>\"It was a bit scary at first, but I kind of realised that I didn't look like your typical drug dealer so I could get away with it a bit easier.\"<br/>Anna felt like she was doing a favour for someone who cared about her, but she soon realised she was being used.<br/>\"I thought that this person was my boyfriend,\" she added.<br/>\"Then I would see messages from other girls or him messaging other girls.<br/>\"It was heart-breaking because he was the only person I had to turn to.\"<br/>The gang used fear to control and manipulate Anna and they plied her with drugs - but it came at a cost.<br/> \"We would just drive around and they would be drug dealing and we'd just be listening to loud music,\" she said.<br/>\"They had a boot full of drugs. They would just say just put your hand in the bag and take whatever you want out.\" <br/>It's the question almost every parent worries about the most. Just how safe is your child online and on social media?<br/>BBC Wales Investigates explores your children's safety in Snaptrap: Is your child safe? on 24 July on BBC One Wales and on BBC iPlayer<br/>Anna believed she was being given the drugs for free - but that was not the case.<br/>\"They gave me an ultimatum which was 'you now owe us a debt for all these free drugs that you've used',\" Anna said.<br/>\"They said 'now you have two choices - you can either help us drug deal and earn the money back for us or you can do sexual favours'.\"<br/>Anna felt trapped by a debt that she'd never be able to pay off.  <br/>\"I chose the option that I thought was going to land me in the least trouble with the police - the sexual favours,\" she said.<br/>It was social media that pulled Anna into the gang's orbit. I wanted to see if the same might happen on my fake account. <br/>Soon after setting up Mia's account, Snapchat started to suggest \"quick adds\" who I might want to make friends with.<br/>I started adding them at random, and Snapchat suggested more and more.<br/>Some of those suggested friends appeared to be drug dealers - constantly posting pictures of the drugs they claim to be selling.<br/>What does this say about Snapchat's algorithm? It thinks I am 15, but it is connecting me to potential criminals.<br/>One of my suggested friends even seemed to claim he was part of a gang transporting drugs from London to Swansea.<br/>He started to message me - saying he was on the lookout for a \"loyal girl\".<br/>When I said I lived in Wales, he seemed particularly interested.<br/>But gangs are on the lookout for fake accounts like mine. <br/>He asked to see a picture of me - which is impossible without blowing my cover. <br/>This happened again and again during my investigation. Is this how gangs check kids out and make sure they were as young and vulnerable as they said?<br/>Snapchat said buying or selling drugs on its platform was illegal.<br/>\"We work in multiple ways to detect and prevent this content to help keep our community safe, including proactive detection technology and in-app reporting tools,\" it said.<br/>\"We have a dedicated team that supports police investigations and meet regularly with experts to understand drug-related trends, terminology and behaviours used by gangs.\"<br/>Snapchat said it had \"extra protections for younger users to make it harder for them to be contacted by people they don't know\".<br/>Tom, not his real name, used to work for gangs in Cardiff and was faced with the impact of grooming when he was forced to pick up the teenagers they'd targeted. <br/>\"At the start they were like 21, 20 then that got down to 17 or 16,\" Tom said.<br/>\"I was in fear of my life the whole time. I couldn't see a way out.\"<br/>Tom entered the world of organised crime by helping gangs from bigger cities like London and Birmingham to establish themselves on his home turf of Cardiff - in return for free drugs - as part of a system called County Lines.<br/>He took me to a popular residential area of Cardiff near the city centre where he used to operate.<br/>\"This area is full of drugs,\" he told me as we drove around Roath showing me where the traphouses - places where people buy and sell drugs - were.<br/>\"Areas around the city centre are full of gangs, not from this city, operating and selling drugs from cars, from flats to gorgeous five-bedroom houses. It's everywhere.\"<br/>I'm curious about the area Tom showed me round - Roath - and so I decide to test out the app that I was redirected to when I first set up my Snapchat account - Telegram. <br/>Telegram's \"people nearby\" feature said people all around me were selling drugs. There was someone selling MDMA, ketamine, meth and even heroin only 400m away.<br/>Telegram said it \"actively moderates harmful content' and added: \"Moderators proactively monitor public groups and channels and accept user reports in order to remove content that breaches our terms of service.\"<br/>Dealers are not even trying to hide their accounts. They are so easy to find I think children could come across them accidentally. <br/>There are estimated to be more than 500 of these County Lines gangs operating across the UK.<br/>The Metropolitan Police has a specialist team dedicated to tackling these drug gangs and claims to have shut down almost 1,500 of these networks since 2019, working with 26 police forces across the UK.<br/>Detectives say they have shut down 122 drug lines and prosecuted more than 700 people in the past year.<br/>\"It's a problem that traverses the whole of the UK really,\" said Det Ch Insp Dan Mitchel.<br/>\"The average age of the individuals prosecuted is 25 and two-thirds of the time they've been previously convicted of drug supply so they're often embedded in criminality.<br/>\"What they tend to do is use children to run their drugs lines for them and we see children taking up a role at the very forefront where they're transporting the drugs from London.\"<br/>South Wales Police said it arrested 29 people in recent operations in Swansea, Neath and London to tackle County Lines gangs - seizing \"significant quantities\" of crack cocaine, heroin and cash. <br/>Anna eventually escaped the gang's clutches after going underground on social media but admitted she would \"never stop looking over her shoulder.\"<br/>Tom feels \"sorry, guilty and ashamed\" for his part in ruining children's lives for being part of a gang.<br/>But he said: \"I was just a pawn and I was used from day one.\"<br/>His own gang nightmare changed one day by a knock at the door that ended with him in prison.<br/>\"When I seen [sic] the police, it was just relief, I just knew that was my way out.\"<br/>\u2018I was a drugs courier at 11 - why did nobody save me?\u2019<br/>'Your whole family's gonna end up dead'<br/>County lines crackdown leads to 1,100 arrests<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

If all this technology really is making us all work faster and better, there is precious little evidence.<br/>Between 1974 and 2008 the UK's productivity - the amount of output you get per worker - grew at an annual rate of 2.3%. But between 2008 and 2020 the rate of productivity growth collapsed to around 0.5% per annum.<br/>And in the first three months of this year, UK productivity was actually down 0.6% on a year earlier.<br/>It is a similar picture in most other Western nations. In the US, productivity growth between 1995 and 2005 was 3.1%, but it then fell to 1.4% from 2005 to 2019. <br/>It feels like we are continuing to go through a huge period of innovation and technological advancement, but at the same time, productivity has slowed to a crawl. How can you explain this apparent paradox?<br/>It might be that we are all just using the technology to avoid doing work. Such as endlessly messaging friends on Whatsapp, watching videos on YouTube, arguing angrily on Twitter, or simply mindlessly surfing the internet.<br/>Or there might, of course, be bigger underlying factors.<br/>Productivity is something economists look at very closely. And while it is a complicated issue, with the 2008 financial crisis and current high inflation having a negative impact, there are said to be two main explanations for why technology is not boosting productivity.<br/>The first is that we are just not measuring the impact of technology properly. The second is that economic revolutions tend to be rather slow-burning affairs. And therefore, technological change is happening, but it just might be decades before we see the full benefits.<br/>Dame Diane Coyle is the Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, and a recognised expert on how we measure productivity.<br/>\"There is nothing that doesn't use digital now, but it is difficult to see what is going on because none of this is visible in the statistics.  We just don't collect the data in ways that would help us understand what is happening.\" <br/>For example, a company that used to invest in its own computer servers and IT department might now outsource both to an overseas, cloud-based provider.<br/>The firm doing the outsourcing gets the best software, updated all the time, and it is reliable and cheap.<br/>But in terms of how we measure the size of the economy, this efficient move makes the company look smaller not larger. And it is no longer seen to be investing in that area of its IT infrastructure, which would have previously been measured as part of its economic growth.  <br/>Dame Coyle has an example from the 19th Century's industrial revolution that illustrates how productivity can be missed from statistics.<br/>\"I have a wonderful 1885 yearbook of statistics for the UK, it is 120 pages long, of which almost all is about agriculture, and there are 12 pages on mines and railways and cotton mills,\" she says.<br/>This was at the very height of the industrial revolution, the time of so-called \"dark satanic mills\", yet 90% of the data gathered was about an old, increasingly less important sector of the economy, and just 10% on what we now see as the one of the most important economic changes in world history.<br/>\"The way we see the economy is through the lens of how it used to be in the past, not how it is today,\" is how Dame Coyle puts it.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>The other argument is that the current technological revolution is happening, but just more slowly than we expect.<br/>Nick Crafts is emeritus professor of economic history at the University of Sussex Business School. He points out that the huge sea changes in economic performance we tend to think of as having happened almost overnight, actually took decades, and the same may well be happening how.<br/>\"James Watt's steam engine was patented in 1769,\" he says. \"Yet the first serious commercial railway, the Liverpool to Manchester line only opened in 1830, and the core of the railway network was built by 1850. That was 80 years after the patent.\"<br/>You can see the same pattern in the use of electricity. The time from Edison's first public use of the light bulb in 1879, to the electrification of whole countries and the replacement of steam power in manufacturing was at least 40 years.<br/>In fact, we might be in a similar hiatus at the moment, something like when the world was between the peak of steam power and the full development of electricity.  <br/>But the country and the businesses that can make the best and fastest use of new technology are going to win the productivity race. This, as it was with steam and electricity, seems to come down not to the technology itself but to how well you can use it, adapt it, and exploit it - in short how skilled you are.<br/>Dame Coyle sees this happening already. \"There is a lot of evidence now that whatever kind of company it is, there is a growing divergence between those that can use the technology well and those that can't.<br/>\"It seems to be that if you have highly-skilled people, you have a lot of data and you know how to use the sophisticated software, and you can change your processes, so that people can use the information, your productivity is going through the roof.<br/>\"But in the same sector of the economy there are other companies that just can't do that.\" <br/>The technology is seemingly not the problem, and in some respects it is not the solution either. High productivity growth will come only to those that learn how to use it best. <br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Minutes later the two young women were dragged out on to the street and beaten unconscious - Ms Sianching thinks the mob thought they were dead, so ran away.<br/>Police who found their bodies only realised they were alive after checking their pulses.<br/>Fake news on social media, purporting to show women being sexually assaulted by Kuki men were fuelling this mob of Meitei men against Chiin and her friend.<br/>Early in the conflict a photo of a dead woman was circulated, apparently showing a Meitei nurse who had  been raped and killed by Kuki men. Later, many news outlets debunked this.<br/>Faultlines quickly deepened after the conflict flared up, causing a complete separation of two communities who had previously lived alongside one another. Both now have barricades at village entry points and there are continuing reports of overnight clashes.<br/>Meitei groups have told the BBC that women from the community also faced sexual assault - the BBC has not been able to confirm this. But the video of the two Kuki women being paraded naked united Meitei women in protest too.<br/>Manipur has a longstanding tradition of women playing a powerful role in civil society, among them the Meira Peibis, or torch-bearers - also known as the mothers of Manipur - who have protested against abuses of power by the state and the army, and human rights violations.<br/>Sinam Surnalata Leima, who leads the Meira Peibis in a group of villages where the two Kuki women in the video were attacked, says that villagers themselves handed over the main suspect to police.<br/>Then the local members of Meira Peibis got together and burned his house.<br/>\"The burning is a symbol of the community's condemnation of the heinous crime that those men committed, their actions cannot tarnish the whole Meitei community's honour,\" says Ms Leima.<br/>The accused's wife and three children have been banished from the village.<br/>But why did the mob act the way it did, in a society that regards its women highly?<br/>\"It was grief and revenge for the Meitei women who had been attacked by Kuki men,\" Ms Leima reasons. <br/>She does not personally know of any such attacks, but says Meitei women would not discuss a crime of this kind, as it would be considered shameful. <br/>State police said soon after the start of the clashes that they had not received reports of violence against Meitei women, but a spokesman for the Meitei community told me there had been many unreported attacks. <br/>Khuraijam Athouba, who represents a Meitei organisation called Cocomi, said that Meitei women had chosen not to speak about the \"violations they faced\".<br/>In his view the focus should remain on the issue of killings and displaced people, rather than sexual violence.<br/>The brother of one of the Kuki women who was seen paraded in the video is tormented by all of these issues.  <br/>The mob that stripped and sexually assaulted his sister, also killed their father and their younger brother - he and his mother were saved as they were visiting family in another village when the clashes started.<br/>The 23-year-old man has a blank expression for most of the time when I meet him in a small room in the home of one of his relatives.<br/>I ask him what he would like the government and police to do?<br/>\"Arrest each person in that mob, especially those who killed my father and brother,\" he says.<br/>\"And treat both communities with fairness.\"<br/>Faith in the federal and state government seems lacking in both communities.<br/>The Chief Minister of Manipur, N Biren Singh, who belongs to the Meitei community, promised the \"harshest punishment to the accused, including capital punishment\". But when asked about the calls for his resignation for failure to resolve the conflict, he said, \"Don't want to go into this, my job is to bring peace to the state and punish miscreants.\"<br/>Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence on the conflict only after the video of the two women sparked national outrage.<br/>\"What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,\" he said, adding that no guilty person would be spared.<br/>But for Ms Leima, that statement painted her community in a bad light and ignored the violence that has raged since May, causing 60,000 people to be displaced.<br/>\"The prime minister spoke when Kuki women were attacked. What about everything we have been facing, are we Meitei women not citizens of India?\" she asks.<br/>The video has put the spotlight back on the continuing Manipur conflict.<br/>\"If it wasn't for this video, we would have not got so much attention from the government and other political parties,\" says Gracy Haokip, a researcher supporting victims of the clashes, including the nursing student, Chiin Sianching. <br/>She says it will help the survivors who have courageously shared their experiences while trying to rebuild their lives.<br/>Chiin tells me about the speech she gave to the women in her community, when she told them that she had enrolled into another nursing institute situated in her local area.<br/>\"My mother told me that God has kept me alive for a reason, so I have decided I will not give up my dreams.\"<br/>What is happening in Manipur and why?<br/>India police face scrutiny after women paraded naked<br/>India video shows how rape is weaponised in conflict<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This included firms using the wrong forms, entering incorrect details and sending papers to the court late.<br/>In the UK will writing is an unregulated service and anyone can legally draft a document.<br/>The CMA says in some instances consumers have been attracted by an \"extremely low\" initial fee for advice without being warned how the costs could escalate significantly. <br/>Some complaints involve reports of vulnerable customers being subjected to pressure selling and coercion.  <br/>Pre-paid probate plans will also come under investigation. This is where customers pay set fees upfront for probate - the legal process of managing someone's estate when they die. <br/>The idea of these plans is that when someone dies their families will not have to pay anything else towards the finalising of their financial affairs.  <br/>Apart from pressure selling, the CMA is concerned about there being a lack of transparency about what costs are covered by the plans, or people being sold unnecessary plans. In some cases this can lead to delays in the probate process and bereaved relatives being left unable to settle bills or sell property. <br/>CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said the three areas identified - online divorce services, will writing and pre-paid probate plans - were essential to people, \"often at the most challenging times in their lives\".<br/>\"That's why it's so important that we investigate so that people can select the right legal service for them - for divorce or probate or will writing - with confidence. It's essential that firms get the basics right, including complying with general consumer law which applies to all traders. Customers must get a fair deal.\" <br/>The watchdog is calling for consumers who have used any of the services or other interested parties to get in contact by 4 September with details of their experiences.<br/>If the CMA concludes that firms have breached consumer law, it can respond in a number of ways, including taking enforcement action such as obtaining a court order.<br/>Initially though, it might simply provide advice on complying with the law or obtain a commitment from the company that it will change its practices.<br/>Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

After a few moments the silence was broken by the most terrible screams.<br/>\"I tried to free my arm but it was completely trapped.\"<br/>Mr Kennedy said the man sitting next to him, who had been talking to his wife on the phone moments before, was then lying on top of him, unresponsive.<br/>\"He had suffered a fatal head injury.

Under laws known as \"permitted development rights\", more than 10,000 properties - such as former offices - were turned into homes in 2021-2022.<br/>The Local Government Association has warned that offices, shops and barns are not always suitable for housing, and could result in the creation of poor quality homes.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Anthony Browne: Cambridge is \"already growing incredibly rapidly\" but a lack of water means expansion plans are \"undeliverable\u201d.<br/>Mr Gove also wants to ease rules on building extensions to commercial buildings and repurposing agricultural buildings. <br/>In order to speed up big developments, the government will invest \u00a324m to train up planning authorities. Half of the funding is newly-allocated, while the other half will come from the department's existing budget. <br/>There will also be \u00a313.5m for what it calls a \"super squad\" of planners to unblock certain projects - a development in Cambridge will be the team's first task. Developers will be asked to pay higher fees to fund improvements to the planning system.<br/>However, in an early sign that Mr Gove's plans may attract criticism from the government's own backbenchers, Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire Anthony Browne has tweeted: \"I will do everything I can to stop the government's nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge, where all major developments are now blocked by the Environment Agency because we have quite literally run out of water.\"<br/>Asked about the criticism, Mr Sunak said: \"No one is doing mass house building in Cambridge, this is about adding a new urban quarter to Cambridge.\" <br/>He added that developments would be done \"in dialogue with local communities\" and that Westminster should not \"ride roughshod\" over their views. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Labour's Lisa Nandy claims the government is \"at war with itself\" over housing<br/>The issue of building more homes has been a tricky one for the government. While there is great demand for housing, particularly among younger voters struggling to get on the property ladder, new housing developments have proved unpopular in Conservative heartlands.<br/>The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said Mr Gove's policies were \"a positive start\" but \"nowhere near the scale or ambition that is needed\".<br/>The body's director of public impact, Rhys Moore, said the changes to the planning process were \"relatively piecemeal\" and called for more investment in social housing - homes available for lower rents.<br/>Polly Neate, head of housing charity Shelter, praised Mr Gove for being a minister who is \"not afraid to build\" but warned that plans to convert takeaways into homes risked creating \"poor quality, unsafe homes\".<br/>In May, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would give English councils more powers to build on green belt land, but added that new developments would not be permitted if they affected \"the beauty of our countryside\". <br/>He said he would take \"tough decisions\" and \"back the builders, not the blockers\".  <br/>Labour has also said it would reintroduce local housing targets and change the planning system to make it easier to build on brownfield sites. <br/>Housing targets to be diluted after Tory revolt<br/>What's happened to the government's housebuilding target?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Despite increasingly grim news from medics, George Alagiah's spirit remained indomitable - writes Sophie Raworth.<br/>I have a daughter called Georgia. She is 17 years old. In November 2005, on the day she was due to be born, my husband and I walked into a Moroccan-style tent in a back garden in north London. It was filled with bunting, long tables, food and George Alagiah's whole family - his wife and two sons, his father, four sisters, nieces, nephews and a handful of close friends. It was his 50th birthday party. A small, intimate affair for a man who adored his family more than anything else. When my baby finally appeared two weeks later, we named her Georgia after him.  <br/>George had a rich spirit. He radiated warmth with a wonderful smile and a velvety laugh. I first worked with him in January 2003 when we launched the new BBC Six O'Clock News, sitting side by side in the studio at Television Centre in west London. He was a foreign correspondent at heart. That was his passion. He loved being out on the road, telling other people's stories. But he also felt enormously proud to be asked to present the BBC TV's main news bulletins - and he felt a real connection with the audience. <br/>He was terrible with technology. We would laugh for hours in the newsroom as I tried to help him grapple with sending a text or photos on his new mobile phone - or working his way around his computer. But he was brilliant with words and when it came to stories he had such a fine sense of judgement. <br/>George was a man of great empathy. In the newsroom he was adored and admired by the team of producers behind the scenes. He was a true team player. He wanted to listen to everyone's opinion and never assumed he was right. A man without ego - unusual in the TV world - he never wanted the story to be about him. And then, suddenly, it was. <br/>George was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in April 2014 at the age of 57. He texted me one evening. \"Sophie, I know you're on holiday but could we have a chat? G x\" - George always texted before calling. He never wanted to bother people. <br/>The cancer had already spread to his liver. I sat on the floor listening. We talked for ages. \"I just hope I am here and able to have a conversation with you in five years time,\" he said before hanging up. I went online. The statistics didn't look good - just a 10% chance that he would be. <br/>I flew to America a few days later to run the Boston Marathon. It turned into a run for George. In just a couple of days I had raised almost \u00a310,000 for a bowel cancer charity. So many people wanted to do something for him. It was a year after the Boston Marathon bombing. The words \"Boston Strong\" were written everywhere across the city. I flew home to London with a Boston Strong T-shirt and my medal in my bag - and gave him both. <br/>During the following months of gruelling chemotherapy and then major operations, he took the medal with him and wore it for luck. When the treatment was finally over 18 months later, he returned to work and returned my Boston medal to me. He'd had it framed with a picture of him and his wife in the middle, wearing their Boston Strong T-shirts. It's on the wall in my kitchen by the fridge. I smile at it every day. <br/>Exactly five years after George had first called me to tell me about his cancer, we went for lunch on a sunny terrace in London to celebrate still being able to chat. He was back at work, looking good. George rarely spoke publicly about having cancer. He said he didn't want to give a running commentary about his illness. But when he did give interviews, he was always taken aback to find himself on the front page of newspapers. He never understood the interest in him and just how much people wanted to hear his story. <br/>Privately though, he was very open about what was happening. He thought about it all deeply too. Listening to him talk about it was both moving and inspiring. He seemed to take it all in his stride, with a calm dignity. He was not frightened. <br/>\"I answered a lot of the big questions eight years ago,\" he told me recently. He found his way of coping, always positive, full of hope. At night, he had his checklist. \"Will you be here tomorrow Georgie boy?\" he'd ask himself. \"Yes I will,\" he'd answer and then go to sleep. He somehow managed to find a sort of peace - a place of contentment, as he later called it. <br/>He told his team of brilliant doctors that they would have to do the worrying for him. He was going to spend the time he had living. What did upset him deeply though, was the thought of leaving his family behind.<br/>Work helped him cope too. George loved being in the newsroom, surrounded by colleagues and friends. As the rounds of chemo mounted up, he began to find work physically exhausting. But mentally, he said it was rejuvenating, being with people who treated him as they had always done and who didn't patronise him. He kept working for as long as he could, despite at least five major operations and more than a hundred rounds of chemotherapy. <br/>I sat with him in hospital during his last round of chemo in May. He knew by then that he would not be coming back to work. But, after 20 years of presenting the BBC News at Six, George did want to say goodbye. Since being first diagnosed with cancer, just over nine years ago, he had received thousands of letters and messages from viewers who wrote to him as if they knew each other - strangers who treated him as a dear friend. It touched him deeply. And so he wanted to go on air one last time. <br/>He had worked it all out. His plan was to do an interview with me at the end of the evening news and then turn to camera, on his own, with a simple goodbye. We could record something, I suggested. No. George wanted to do it live. I wasn't entirely sure I would be able to hold it together. But if he could, I was going to have to as well. <br/>In the end he didn't get to do that. Shortly after that conversation he was back in hospital. <br/>But despite the increasingly grim news from the medics, his spirit remained indomitable. Even towards the very end he was sending me texts, asking about my mother who was in hospital, also with bowel cancer. \"How is your mum doing? You must be absolutely shattered. No pressure to answer until 100% convenient\", he wrote. I laughed out loud. It was so George. No mention at all of himself or his worsening health. He was always thinking about everyone else. <br/>George died at the age of 67. The kindest, most thoughtful and generous soul. A man of great judgement and values. A great friend who taught me so much about living.

A colleague reported that heavy shelling had, as they put it, rocked the city centre. Later, George said to me quietly \"Allan don't say that. Heavy shelling didn't rock anything tonight. Three bombs fell close to where we happened to be and gave us a fright. Keep it in proportion.\" And I thought, not for the first time, \"My name is George Alagiah and I'm here to calm you down.\" George didn't want to be dramatic. He wanted to be true. <br/>I came to understand that I was learning from him at a time when I was still trying to find my own distinctive broadcasting voice. What did I learn? That good reporting, honest and true, is rooted in respect for others. That the best reporters have almost no ego. That they are never the story, but the means by which the voices of others can be heard. I hoped that the values he embodied and lived would rub off on me.<br/>George wasn't just a good reporter; he was a good man. He was completely without malice. He carried his profound decency very lightly without a hint of sanctimony. He seemed unaware of his own instinct for kindness. When we worked in dangerous and morally troubling places, I looked to him for guidance. I loved his unflappability, his calm authority, his extraordinary wisdom. I thought of him as something like an older brother - someone I quietly looked up to, whose success I could admire and celebrate without envy. I'm not ashamed to say that I felt looked after by him. I thought when I was with George nothing bad could happen to me. <br/>I am aware I am in danger of making him sound a bit saintly - he wasn't. He was great fun. He could be a witty and sometimes hilarious raconteur - with a gift for sometimes merciless mimicry. And like all of us, he enjoyed a bit of intrigue and gossip. <br/>There is a word in the Nguni languages of Southern Africa that was, I think, George's lodestar. He spoke about it at a party to celebrate his 60th birthday in 2015: Ubuntu. It expresses the idea that human beings are bound together in a shared responsibility for each other. <br/>George and I both interviewed Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who'd helped end South Africa's racist system of white-minority rule. He defined Ubuntu like this: \"I am me because you are you. I can never be free while you are enslaved. I can never be rich while you are poor. We two are connected.\" <br/>George had been a migrant twice by the age of 11. Born in Sri Lanka, moved to Ghana and then to a boarding school in England. <br/>Adapting to new cultures and thriving were formative experiences. And it planted in him something that was also key to his talent: he could see how the world looked from the point of view of the Global South - the view from Africa and Asia especially - and convey that perspective to the living rooms of the globally prosperous.<br/>George would never have made such a claim for himself. Off screen he was funny, clever, entertaining, a generous friend and confidant. I told him once that the pan in companion came from the Latin word for bread, that the word carried in it the ingrained human desire to break bread with those we love and care about. He laughed and said, \"How do you know these ridiculous things?\" But I have had some of the richest experiences of companionability and conviviality at George's table, breaking bread. <br/>For George was also full of a kind of energetic hope. There was something infectious about his optimism. You always walked away from time with George liking the human race more, feeling better about the world.<br/>He brought that cheerful disposition to his cancer diagnosis. I rang him when I heard the news. \"It's much worse than the public statement implies, Allan,\" he confided. \"But I have great doctors.\"<br/>Years later, when the cancer had returned and we knew it would never go away, I sat with him in the garden of the London home he shared with Frances, his wife of 40 years. \"I'm not afraid to die,\" he said. \"There's no point in that. The only thing I find unbearably painful is the idea of Frances being left here on her own.\"<br/>Always that in George. Others before self. I saw him one last time shortly before he died. He was very weak. \"Is it wrong to say that there is something positive in all this?\" he said. \"I've had the time to reflect on my life and make sense of it. Time to say to people the things I want them to know. Not everybody is lucky enough to get that\u2026<br/>And the next word he used pierced me - and I still feel the sting of it: \"Not everybody is lucky enough to get that luxury.\" And he added in a moment of self-doubt: \"Is it bad, is it taboo, to say that about cancer?\" <br/>I was guided by him, taught by him, at a key time in my own life. I think I will be guided by him all my days. Becoming his friend, being exposed to his abundant affection, has been one of the greatest privileges of my life.<br/>Ubuntu: I watched George close up while working in Africa. I marvelled at the way he engaged with people, and the way they reciprocated with their trust. <br/>For in George's reporting there was an outstretched hand - the outstretched hand of a shared humanity, of solidarity. <br/>Sophie Raworth: I will miss George terribly<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

What a loss.\"<br/>While the corporation's security correspondent Frank Gardner recalled one of his \"fondest memories\" of Alagiah being when his colleague had visited him in hospital back in 2004. \"He brought me his book, A Passage to Africa, and we talked for hours about the continent he loved and spent so much of his career covering.\" <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: A look back at George Alagiah's extraordinary career at the BBC<br/>Away from journalism, Alagiah's debut novel, The Burning Land - a thriller about corruption and killing in South Africa - was nominated in 2020 for a Society of Authors award recognising the best new writers over 60.<br/>Fellow writer Sarfraz Mansoor called him \"the kindest, bravest and most inspiring people I have ever been privileged to know\".<br/>\"Never complained about his fate and always curious about the world. We are all poorer without him.\"<br/>BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera noted how the phrase \"never meet your heroes\" had not applied to him working with Alagiah.<br/>\"He was an inspiration and a role model as a journalist,\" he tweeted. \"And when I was lucky enough to work with him, I found him the most kind and generous colleague.\"<br/>In an interview with BBC Newscast last year, Alagiah was asked if he felt any responsibility to be a role model for other non-white people like him wishing to become journalists.<br/>\"Well, it's a slightly embarrassing episode in my professional role actually,\" he replied. \"Because when I started off in - dare I say it 1989, I think I was the BBC's first kind of fully fledged foreign correspondent and person of colour...\"<br/>\"I just wanted to be a really good journalist, and I didn't want to be the best black or brown journalist,\" he added, about once nearly declining an award.<br/>\"And somebody took me aside and said, 'you idiot, you think it's about you, don't you? These awards are about all the people who look at you and think, you know, if that bloke Alagiah can do that I can certainly do it.'\"<br/>Paying tribute, LBC's Sangita Myska stressed the significance the success of the Sri Lanka-born Alagiah had on other Asian journalists. <br/>\"Growing up, when the BBC's George Alagiah was on TV my dad would shout, 'George is on!'. We'd run to watch the man who inspired a generation of British Asian journalists. That scene was replicated across the UK. We thank you, George. RIP xx.\"<br/>A tearful Naga Munchetty interrupted the sports news on BBC Radio 5 Live on Monday to break the news of the death. \"Apologies for the emotion in my voice,\" she said. \"He was so loved in the newsroom.\"<br/>She added: \"He was someone I looked up to greatly because it wasn't his ego, it was never his ego that reassured me, it was the way he obviously cared about what he was reporting. <br/>\"You almost felt, as a news presenter, he broke down those barriers.\"<br/>Chris Bryant MP highlighted how much Alagiah had done to raise awareness of the symptoms of bowel cancer. <br/>\"Everyone who has had cancer, or being touched by it, will know the sadness that this moment brings,\" he said. \"And the gratitude, for amazing doctors.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>BBC newsreader George Alagiah on living with coronavirus and cancer<br/>Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, added that he never \"shied away from talking about it\", and how \"that will have helped countless other people living with bowel cancer and will probably have prompted people to go and see their doctors maybe with symptoms that they've been worrying about.\"<br/>Sky News presenter Mark Austin wrote: \"A good man, a rival on the foreign correspondent begat but above all a friend.<br/>\"If good journalism is about empathy, and it often is, George Alagiah had it in spades.

The sector has seen considerable upheaval in the past year, after many years of ultra-low rates.<br/>The typical interest charged on fixed rates for new borrowers shot up after last autumn's mini-budget, then calmed somewhat, but has now risen to a 15-year high.<br/>That's because wages and prices are rising faster and for longer than expected, and meaning the Bank of England may raise the base rate to 6%.<br/>The Bank has warned that more than two million households will pay between \u00a3200 and \u00a3499 more a month on new deals from the end of this year and the end of 2026. <br/>A further one million mortgage holders will see their monthly payments rise by at least \u00a3500 over the next two and a half years.<br/>If the base rate does rise again, anyone on tracker deals will also face higher repayments.<br/>House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.<br/>The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggests that UK house prices will fall by 10% by 2024 compared with last year's peak.<br/>There are still likely to be plenty of options, depending on your circumstances. The bigger question is whether people can afford higher repayments.<br/>An agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage without a new affordability test when their current deal ends, as long as their payments are up-to-date.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.<br/>Interest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.<br/>If you have savings, you could consider paying down some of the total amount borrowed. <br/>Savings could also be put into a linked offset savings account, where you only pay interest on the mortgage balance, minus the amount you've saved.<br/>You may want to extend the length of the mortgage term, although that would mean paying more in total. <br/>A broker can guide you through the different options.<br/>Owing two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.<br/>But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates mortgage firms, says lenders must treat customers fairly.<br/>It says borrowers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they will struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must offer help.<br/>Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:<br/>Your lender must consider any reasonable request to resolve the arrears. This could include reducing your monthly payment by extending the term of the mortgage, or switching to an interest-only payment for a certain period. <br/>Missing monthly payments - or arranging to pay less than you owe - will be reflected on your credit file, which could affect your ability to borrow money in the future. <br/>A mortgage payment holiday lets borrowers delay repayments for a short time.<br/>Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances, although probably not to those already in arrears. <br/>The level of support offered to customers during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.<br/>Again, a payment holiday will show on your credit file. <br/>Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.<br/>Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be. <br/>There are several stages before a lender can do this, and the whole process takes about two years.<br/>But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice about your options. <br/>Governments tend not to get directly involved in support when people face higher mortgage repayments, but many lenders have signed up to the government's mortgage charter which ensures they are clear about the options available.<br/>For people on qualifying benefits, Support for Mortgage Interest is available across the UK. The government pays some of your mortgage interest payments, but in the form of a loan (which must be repaid, with interest). <br/>Borrowers tend to pay off the loan when they sell the property, or when they die.<br/>There are various conditions and requirements that need to be considered before signing up.<br/>Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also run some mortgage support schemes, but the rules are complicated, and they tend to focus on people at risk of homelessness. <br/>There is more information on the government-backed Moneyhelper website.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff.<br/>The ONS says median pay for \"train and tram drivers\" is just under \u00a359,000.<br/>Although Aslef members tend to be better paid than other rail workers, Mick Whelan, general secretary of the union, told BBC News on 12 May that train drivers \"haven't had a pay rise for four years\". He was just referring to the ones who are taking industrial action.<br/>That's because a new pay deal has not been reached since their last agreement ended in 2019.<br/>However, Transport Minister Huw Merriman said the pay of train drivers \"has gone up by 39% since 2011... the highest increase of any employment group.\"<br/>He is right about the 39% increase, but we have not been able to establish whether it's the highest increase for any employment group. That's because of changes to the way the figures have been released over the last decade.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents the 14 train companies, made an offer that would have seen rail workers receive a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022. It would then negotiate reforms ahead of a second year's pay rise with individual operators.<br/>On 5 May, RMT members voted to extend the strike mandate for another six months.  <br/>The Aslef union, meanwhile, has rejected a two-year offer which would see drivers get a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.<br/>Separately, a revised offer from Network Rail was accepted by RMT members on 20 March, ending that dispute. <br/>The union said the offer amounted to an uplift on salaries of between 14.4% for the lowest paid grades to 9.2% for the highest paid. <br/>Unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. <br/>How will the rail strikes affect your journey?

If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs. <br/>The Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in over 300 years, hurting business and employment, and forcing government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.<br/>The UK narrowly avoided falling into recession at the end of 2022, after the economy grew by 0.1% between October and December compared with the previous three months.<br/>At the Budget in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility - the government's independent forecaster - predicted the economy would shrink by 0.2% this year but would avoid a recession.<br/>If GDP is growing, the government will use that as evidence to say that it is doing a good job of managing the economy. Likewise, if GDP falls, opposition politicians will say the government is running it badly.<br/>But it's not just a report card on how the government is doing. If GDP is going up steadily, people will pay more in tax simply because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals.<br/>Governments also like to keep an eye on how much they are borrowing in relation to the size of the economy. <br/>For example borrowing was equivalent to about 14% of GDP in the first year of the Covid pandemic, the highest proportion since World War Two.<br/>GDP can be measured in three ways:<br/>In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. <br/>The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.<br/>At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in.<br/>The ONS publishes more information on how this is done on its website.<br/>GDP growth doesn't tell the whole story. <br/>There are lots of things the statistics might not take into account:<br/>Just because GDP is increasing, it doesn't mean that an individual person's standard of living is improving. <br/>If a country's population increases, that will push GDP up, because with more people, more money will be spent. But individuals within that country might not be getting richer. They may be getting poorer on average, even while GDP goes up.<br/>So the ONS publishes a figure for GDP per head (of population), which can often tell a different story to the main GDP number. <br/>Critics have argued that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable, or the damage it might do to the natural world. Alternative measures have been developed. <br/>In 2010, the ONS started measuring well-being alongside economic growth. This measures health, relationships, education and skills, as well as personal finances and the environment. <br/>In 2019, New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, released the country's first \"well-being budget\", prioritising health and life-satisfaction rather than economic growth. <br/>Despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.<br/>Bank defends rate hike ahead of looming recession<br/>Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite<br/>Does GDP tell the whole economic story?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.<br/>Rosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. \"We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,\" she says. <br/>\"There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard.\" <br/>She keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around \u00a340.<br/>Lynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced section. \"If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,\" she says.<br/>She suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.<br/>\"Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,\" she says. \"If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings.\"<br/>According to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around \u00a3700 every year by throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on waste.<br/>\"If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,\" she says. \"You'll also be able to buy things cheaper in supermarkets that are close to their sell-by date. Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them.\"<br/>More on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website.<br/>Kate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.<br/>\"You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,\" she explains. \"But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money.\"<br/>Rosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours. \"How often have you bought a tray of mushrooms covered in cling film only to have them go off in their packaging? They're wrapped up like that to make them easier to transport,\" she explains. <br/>She puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.<br/>Helen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group. <br/>\"Just putting a piece of kitchen roll into an open bag of salad to absorb moisture is going to help it last longer,\" she says. <br/>Keeping fruit in the fridge will help it last longer, but she suggests checking that the temperature is set to below 5\u00b0C. \"We think millions of UK fridges are at least two degrees too warm,\" she says. \"This is bad news for milk and other food items kept in the fridge, which can go off [more quickly] when not stored at the right temperature.\"<br/>Rosie tries to use local, smaller retailers a lot to tap into their years of experience. <br/>\"Butchers are a great resource and someone we shouldn't be afraid to talk to about saving money,\" she says. \"If you go into your local butcher and tell them you've only got \u00a38 for your meat for the week, they'll be able to tell you how to stretch your money by buying the cheapest cuts.<br/>\"They're the best people to advise on how to cook them and how to make them go further.\"<br/>We asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in: <br/>My wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery. We then check at the end total costs including delivery and whoever is cheapest 'wins' our order. We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland<br/>I highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of \"what's for dinner\"? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey<br/>Tip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder. Helen Borodzicz, Lytham, St Annes<br/> I go to the supermarket at about 2.30 pm when they are reducing sandwiches - that's my tea sorted!

Prices are still rising quite sharply compared to a year ago, just at a slower rate than they have been.<br/>Prices are still likely to keep going up over the next few months, but not at the rate that has caused such a shock to households and businesses across the country over the last year.<br/>The inflation figure is an average - so your own cost of living could be rising at a very different rate to what's reported in the news, depending on what you spend your money on.<br/>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) which calculates inflation, bases its numbers on a basket of goods that reflects what most people across the UK are buying. But it doesn't include everything. So if you are buying a lot of unusual or niche items, or you have atypical tastes, you might find the cost of your own bag of shopping is going up more quickly - or more slowly - than the headlines suggest.<br/>Food inflation is currently at 17.3%, much higher than the average rate, so people who spend a greater proportion of their outgoings on food will find their personal inflation rate is higher than the 7.9% headline figure.<br/>The ONS says energy, food, and drink accounts for around 15% of lower-income households' spending, compared to 10% for high-income groups.<br/>The Bank of England tries to control inflation by putting up interest rates which makes it more expensive to borrow money. This encourages people to borrow and spend less, and save more.<br/>The Bank is expected to stick with that strategy - of putting up interest rates - throughout this year. So if you have a tracker mortgage or a credit card or loan you could find yourself paying more interest. That's another way your own personal inflation rate could be affected.<br/>Try our personal inflation rate calculator<br/>Occasionally prices will fall very slightly compared to the previous month, but they are much less likely to fall year-on-year.<br/>And while this might be difficult to believe right now, falling prices aren't always a good thing - here's why.<br/>If people expect that prices are likely to fall, they delay spending with the aim of getting a cheaper deal later on. <br/>That means businesses have less money coming in, so they try to find ways to cut costs - most likely by cutting wages or laying off staff. <br/>So prices falling can mean people lose their jobs, which in turn makes prices fall further. This is called \"deflation\", a different kind of economic crisis that brings its own set of problems.<br/>That's why the Bank of England aims to have prices consistently rising by 2% - it's better to aim for a bit of inflation than to risk the negative effects of prices falling.<br/>It's important to remember that the price rises we've seen recently have been primarily driven by global energy prices. These are expected to come down, but not to as low as they were before, and any fall in energy prices will take time to feed through into the wider economy.<br/>Petrol prices drop but food keeps inflation high<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts?<br/>Why inflation is worse for some people than others<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.<br/>Personal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.<br/>Some ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. <br/>Split ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.<br/>Some websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.<br/>Split My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. <br/>Also, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money.\u202f\u202f<br/>Rail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.<br/>There are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. <br/>For example, the regional Cotswold Line Railcard costs \u00a39.95, is valid for one year and gives you a 34% discount on off-peak single and return tickets.<br/>More information on the different types of railcard are here.<br/>You can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults. <br/>The group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. <br/>Groups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.<br/>National flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. <br/>The flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. <br/>Train companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic.\u202f <br/>The Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.<br/>For those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper.

It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users.

If that is granted and you don't leave, landlords can apply for a \"warrant for possession\".<br/>Eviction rules differ in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. <br/>Tenants in England have the right to \"live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair\". Similar rules are in place in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.<br/>Landlords are not expected to do small jobs like changing light bulbs.<br/>However, a rented home could be unfit if, for example, the electrics are unsafe, it's damp, or there's a problem with rats or mice.<br/>If so, you can complain to your landlord, or - if that doesn't work - your local council.<br/>Your landlord may try to evict you rather than make repairs, but you might have more protection if you've already complained to the council. <br/>Tenants need to pay rent on time, cover the bills they are responsible for, and look after the property. This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean.<br/>There are no laws explicitly stopping this, but MPs are considering more protections for renters in England.<br/>Under a new law tabled in Parliament, tenants will be given a legal right to request to keep a \"well-behaved\" pet, which the landlord can only refuse on reasonable grounds - such as the size of the property.<br/>However, landlords will be able to charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage.<br/>The law is also set to make it illegal for a landlord to refuse tenancies to families with children, or those on benefits.<br/>At present it could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children.<br/>However, BBC News foundalmost a quarter of some 8,000 adverts examined on the property website OpenRent indicated that families were not eligible.<br/>More than 300 listings on another property portal, Zoopla, explicitly said children were not wanted, although this was less than 1% of those we looked at.<br/>Some 73% of sampled OpenRent listings said tenants with pets were not welcome, compared with 6% on Zoopla. <br/>Shelter warned the problem would be even more widespread as sometimes prospective tenants were only told they were not welcome when they applied. <br/>Landlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to.<br/>If a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge a tenant more than the amount they pay. <br/>Exhausting, costly, miserable: My search to rent a one-bed flat<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

So if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded. <br/>If you still want to travel, your airline must find you an alternative flight. If another airline is flying to your destination significantly sooner, or there are other suitable modes of transport available, then you have a right to be booked onto that alternative transport instead. <br/>If you are stuck abroad or at the airport because of a flight cancellation, airlines must also provide you with other assistance until you are able to fly to your destination. <br/>This includes: <br/>If your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later. In this case, the Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary. <br/>You are entitled to the same assistance if your flight is delayed by more than two hours. <br/>You may also be able to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late. Again, the amount is based on how far you are flying. <br/>If you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund.<br/>Disruption caused by things like airport or air traffic control employee strikes, bad weather or other \"extraordinary circumstances\" are not eligible for extra compensation.<br/>However, in other circumstances - which are the airline's fault - you have a number of rights under UK law if you are flying from a UK airport on any airline, arriving at a UK airport on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline. <br/>What you are entitled to depends on what caused the cancellation and how much notice you were given. <br/>If your flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, you may be able to claim compensation based on the timings of the alternative flight you are offered.<br/>The amount you are entitled to also depends on how far you were travelling. For example: <br/>If you booked a package holiday with a company that is an Abta member and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund. <br/>Easyjet cancels 1,700 flights from July to September<br/>Strike action could hit holiday flights in Europe<br/>Closed Ukraine airspace may delay flights next summer<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He said the bill was necessary for the government to \"carry out policy in line with the decision of the majority of the citizens of the country\".<br/>The vote brings to a head months of turmoil, with Israel's president warning political leaders on Monday that the country was \"in a state of national emergency\".<br/>On Monday morning protesters blocking a boulevard outside the Knesset were sprayed with water cannon and pulled off the road by police amid a cacophony of noise from drums, whistles and air horns.<br/>One protester was hurt, local media say, and six were arrested, police said.

But this one did throw up some surprising results - here are four things we learned. <br/>All the pre-election headlines focused on the possibility of a surge for the far-right Vox party and its entry into a coalition with the conservative People's Party (PP). <br/>As it turned out, it lost half a million votes compared to 2019.<br/>The poor performance was a big surprise, particularly after its strong showing in May's local elections. Vox's leader, Santiago Abascal, lay at least some of the blame at the door of the PP, which he said had been too triumphalist in its campaigning on behalf of the right. <br/>\"They sold the bear's skin before they had even hunted it,\" he told supporters. \"That is clearly the reason why there was a lack of mobilisation [of voters].\"<br/>With only 33 seats, down from 52 in 2019, Vox has fallen below the threshold which allows it to present appeals before the constitutional court against legislation. <br/>In recent years, the court has been barraged by Vox with appeals against the S\u00e1nchez government's laws, including on transgender rights, a euthanasia bill and even the use of the state of emergency during the pandemic. <br/>It has now been stripped of this powerful tool for capturing the limelight.<br/>PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o has a reputation as an election-winner and secured four consecutive majorities in his native region of Galicia. <br/>He can now add to that a general election victory in which his party got 47 seats more than in 2019. However, the PP did not win an outright majority and its possible coalition partners failed to win enough to make up the difference. <br/>This is not the result he wanted, given that he appears to have very little chance of forming a government.<br/>The PP benefited from the collapse of the centre-right Ciudadanos. But it might have won even more seats if Mr N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o had not had such a poor campaign. <br/>In the final week before voting, he declined to take part in a televised debate, was put on the spot over incorrect claims about pensions, and faced scrutiny over a friendship he had with a drug trafficker in the 1990s.<br/>The election was also taking place as the PP negotiated the formation of dozens of local governments with Vox. This was an ideal situation for the left, which was able to warn voters of a repeat at national level - with negative results for minority rights. <br/>That may have spooked moderate voters on the right while mobilising the left. <br/>Although he came second, this felt like a win for Socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, given how low expectations had fallen after a poor performance in May's local elections. <br/>His party gained two seats and ended up with just 14 seats fewer than the PP. The result apparently means the right cannot form a government and it also ensures S\u00e1nchez will continue as the country's leader for at least another few months, enough to see out Spain's tenure of the revolving EU presidency.<br/>The 51-year-old has repeatedly defied the odds throughout his relatively short career in frontline politics: <br/>Add those to scoring an unlikely election result that almost looks like a victory.<br/>It is six years since Catalan secessionists tried to break away from Spain. The crisis continues to dog the nation's politics.<br/>Mr S\u00e1nchez's reliance on, and concessions to, Catalan and Basque nationalist parties has contributed to his status as a hate figure for the right and dominated much of the campaign. <br/>But now the dust has settled on the result, those same parties could hold the key to a new left-wing government being formed. <br/>The problem for Mr S\u00e1nchez is that among them is the hardline Catalan separatist party Together for Catalonia (Junts), which has described this result as \"a window of opportunity\" to achieve secession. <br/>With the self-exiled former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont as its figurehead, it is demanding a Scotland-style referendum on independence in exchange for any parliamentary co-operation, a concession Mr S\u00e1nchez has said he will never make.<br/>If that is indeed the case, Spain could be heading for a repeat election.<br/>Spain's conservatives fall short of all-out victory<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Here is a brief guide to what is going on.<br/>Since the start of the year, huge weekly protests have been held by people opposed to the government's reform plans. The scale of the protests has escalated, with hundreds of thousands of people packing the streets in towns and cities across the country. <br/>Undeterred, the government passed into law on Monday the first planned change - a so-called \"reasonableness\" bill - removing the Supreme Court's power to cancel government decisions it deems unreasonable.<br/>Protesters have called for all the planned reforms to be scrapped and for the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to resign. They are supported by Mr Netanyahu's political rivals, as well as former top officials in Israel's military, intelligence and security services, former chief justices, and prominent legal figures and business leaders amongst others.<br/>In a move which has caused deep concern on both sides, hundreds of military reservists, including air force pilots crucial to Israel's defence, have threatened to refuse to report for service. This has led to warnings that it could leave the country's security seriously exposed.<br/>Mr Netanyahu's opponents say the reforms will severely undermine the country's democracy by weakening the judicial system, the only tool for keeping the government's use of its power in check.  <br/>Underlying this is strong opposition to the kind of government currently in office - the most right-wing in Israel's history - and to Mr Netanyahu himself. <br/>Critics say the reforms will shield Mr Netanyahu, who is currently on trial for alleged corruption (he denies the charges) and help the government pass laws without any brakes.<br/>The government argues that the judiciary interferes too much with legislation, is biased in support of liberal issues and is undemocratic in the way judges are selected.<br/>They concern the power of the government versus the power of the courts to scrutinise and even overrule the government. The government - and others - say reform is overdue, though the plans go much further than many people would like.<br/>Besides the \"reasonableness\" law, the government wants to:<br/>With fury on the streets and a battle of wills playing out, the crisis seems likely to intensify.<br/>Mr Netanyahu has said he will try and reach wide public agreement on the rest of the reforms during the Knesset's summer recess (August to mid-October).<br/>The prime minister is however dependent on far-right ministers in his cabinet, without whose support his government could collapse. Those ministers have insisted the reforms must be passed and not watered down. <br/>The opposition says it will not re-enter talks unless the process is stopped.<br/>Israel's main labour union has threatened a general strike and protesters are vowing to step up their action, with no end to the turmoil in sight.<br/>Israel PM delays legal reforms after mass protests<br/>Mass Israel protests after Netanyahu sacks minister<br/>Israel defence minister fired in legal reform row<br/>Halt Israel legal reform, urges defence minister<br/>Israel's PM vows to continue with legal reforms<br/>Israel turmoil dogs Netanyahu's UK trip<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

She is the breadwinner for her family,\" the mother of two said. <br/>\"I couldn't even look at the mirror when my eyebrow was being done. Everyone was in tears. There was silence.\"<br/>Zarmina lives in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, the Taliban's conservative citadel where the supreme leader resides.  <br/>She says it's common here for men to ban their daughters from wearing make-up or going for a beauty treatment. <br/>\"Most women walk around in a burqa or hijab here. We have accepted it as part of our culture.\"<br/>Zarmina was married at 16. She says a chat at the beautician was enough to give her a rare sense of freedom.<br/>\"I wasn't allowed to leave my house on my own, but I managed to persuade my husband, and was allowed to visit the beauty salon two or three times a year.\"  <br/>She used to go to the salon with a woman from her neighbourhood, developing a deep friendship with one of its workers. <br/>\"In the past, women used to talk about ways to influence their husbands. Some were open about their insecurities.\"<br/>But the economic crisis had gradually intruded into their lives after the Taliban retook power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of US forces from the country.<br/>Women's freedoms have steadily shrunk since then.<br/>\"Now women only talk about unemployment, discrimination and poverty,\" Zarmina says.<br/>Madina covers her head with a scarf when she leaves home. Only her husband and female members of her family can see her coloured hair. <br/>The 22-year-old lives in Kabul, and keenly follows the latest beauty trends online. <br/>\"Every woman I know loves to improve her style. I love the latest fashion and wearing make-up.\"<br/>She says going to the beauty salon has kept her marriage fresh. <br/>\"My husband really loves to see my hair in different colours and cut in different styles.<br/>\"He always takes me to the beauty salon and waits patiently at the door,\" she says proudly.<br/>\"He compliments my looks when I walk out, which makes me feel good.\"<br/>Her ambition was to become a lawyer but the Taliban stopped women going to university. She's been unable to find work since as women are also banned from many other roles. <br/>Madina used to accompany her mum to the salon as a child and vividly recalls how women would openly share their life stories with each other.  <br/>\"Women employees in the salon no longer wear skirts or jeans, they're all in hijabs.\"<br/>And fear is everywhere. <br/>\"No-one knows who is a Taliban supporter and no-one wants to say anything about politics.\"<br/>In the past, grooms were allowed to watch their bride get ready. Madina even remembers some men taking photos inside the salon. This is all now banned.<br/>But Madina says she at least has joyful memories of her \"big day\" to cherish.<br/>\"I went to the beauty salon and got full bridal make-up before my wedding last year,\" she says. <br/>\"When I looked at myself in the mirror, I was so beautiful. It transformed me. I couldn't describe my happiness.\"<br/>For 27-year-old Somaya from the north-western city of Mazar-i-Sharif, a beauty salon is a necessity.<br/>Three years ago she suffered burns to her face, losing her eyebrows and eyelashes after a heater in her room exploded. <br/>\"I couldn't bear to look at my face. I looked ugly,\" she says, her voice full of emotion. <br/>\"I thought everyone was looking at me and laughing at me because my eyebrows were gone. I didn't go out for a couple of months. I cried a lot during that time.\" <br/>Medical treatment healed her wounds, while the beauty salon helped her recover her sense of self. <br/>\"I went to the beauty salon and had micro-blading [a semi-permanent form of cosmetic tattooing]. It made me look much better,\" she says.<br/>\"When I looked at my eyebrows, I started to cry. They are tears of joy. The beauty salon gave me my life back.\" <br/>Somaya has a master's degree in psychology and works as a mental health counsellor. She has seen the number of women seeking her services swell since the Taliban imposed sweeping restrictions. She is not alone in using the beauty parlour for \"therapy\". <br/>\"For us, salons are more than places to do your make-up. It helped us hide our sorrows. It gave us energy and hope.\"<br/>Zarmina agrees. As she walked home that June day, from what would be her last trip to the salon, she kept looking back. <br/>She was fully aware of what she was losing - her tiny stab at independence.<br/>\"I paid for myself at the salon and it gave me strength and power. I have money but I can't spend it on myself in the beauty salon. This makes me feel poor.\"<br/>(All names have been changed)<br/>Kabul make-up artist: 'Women like me are Taliban targets'<br/>Afghan women slate UK MP's praise for 'country transformed'<br/>Afghan women protest against beauty salon closures<br/>Taliban order hair and beauty salons to shut<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

There were no midwives and no-one to support me. Everyone was thinking of themselves. Everyone was running to save their lives<br/>\"The baby got out, I wrapped it up. I didn't think of anything else. I continued walking to Adr\u00e9,\" Arafa Adoum said when I met her at a refugee camp of tens of thousands of people on the outskirts of the Chadian town. <br/>The 38-year-old said she had walked in the scorching sun for 25km (15 miles) from her hometown of El Geneina with her four daughters, while her husband had - for his own safety - taken a longer and more arduous route to reach the camp. <br/>\"When I arrived at the border I found myself wiped out and exhausted until I delivered the baby,\" Mrs Adoum said, pointing out that she had named her son Mohamed, after the Prophet of Islam.<br/>She left behind the unburied corpses of her other boys - aged three, seven and nine years - after she says they were killed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied Arab militiamen at the centre of the war raging in Sudan since April.<br/>Darfur is the worst-affected area, with the RSF and the militias accused of trying to establish Arab supremacy in the region by \"cleansing\" it of black Africans - including those from Mrs Adoum's Massalit community. <br/>Not surprisingly, the battle for El Geneina - historically a symbol of black African power in Darfur, and the traditional capital of the Massalit kingdom - has been vicious.<br/>\"We tried to defend ourselves, but they were using very big weapons,\" said Sheikh Mohammed Yagoub, an influential Muslim cleric and Massalit leader, who has also become a refugee in Adr\u00e9.<br/>\"In our area in one day, we lost 82 [people] within three hours,\" he added. <br/>The RSF denied involvement in the fighting, but said that Darfur was witnessing the resurgence an old conflict between Arab groups and the Massalit.<br/>Giving her version, Mrs Adoum said her three sons were killed at El Geneina's university - where they were taking refuge - after it was shelled and torched by the RSF and Janjaweed, as the Arab militias are known.<br/>\"The three kids were hit by the shells and lost their lives at that same spot,\" Mrs Adoum said.<br/>Several members of her extended family were also killed, she said, including her father-in-law, who had both his legs \"smashed\", one of his ears cut, and then \"they fired some bullets, finishing him\".<br/>Mrs Adoum and her husband then fled with their four daughters, but he took back routes to avoid passing through RSF-manned roadblocks as the paramilitaries were - according to numerous refugees - killing Massalit men and boys, sometimes by dousing them with petrol and setting them alight. <br/>The couple reunited at the refugee camp, where her husband cradled Mohamed for the first time - a child whom they see as a blessing after the loss of three sons. <br/>The sheikh's wife, Rakhiya Adum Abdelkarim, told me that she had also been pregnant, but she lost her baby the day after reaching Adr\u00e9 - a walk that left her hungry, exhausted and weak.<br/>\"I started to bleed. Then I started to get headaches, and all the while blood was coming. Then, at dawn, the foetus came,\" she said. <br/>A field hospital has been established in Adr\u00e9 by a charity, but Mrs Abdelkarim did not manage to get there for treatment. <br/>The hospital is packed with patients - mostly women, babies, and children, some of whom have gun-shot wounds. <br/>One of the patients, Naima Ali, said she and her nine-month-old son were shot by a RSF sniper as they fled their village. <br/>The boy was strapped on her back, when a bullet hit him on the leg, and \"me on my side, narrowly missing my kidney.<br/>\"We were both bleeding and no-one was helping us,\" she said, pointing out that she too kept fleeing on foot until she reached the camp.<br/>To end the atrocities, four East African states have called for a regional peacekeeping force to be deployed to Sudan, with Kenya's President William Ruto raising concern that the country was being \"destroyed\", and there were \"already signs of a genocide\" in Darfur. <br/>A joint United Nations (UN) and African Union (AU) peacekeeping force withdrew from Darfur in 2021, about 18 years after conflict first broke out in the region, causing the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people.<br/>The conflict caused global outrage, with the International Criminal Court (ICC) indicting Sudan's then-ruler Omar al-Bashir on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, which he denied.<br/>When the peacekeepers withdrew, the UN said the decision was aimed at \"empowering Sudan's government to take charge of maintaining peace in the region\".  <br/>But since their withdrawal, Sudan has been hit by a coup, and plunged into a civil war in mid-April after its two most powerful generals - army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti - fell out. <br/>Their feud has reignited the conflict in Darfur, forcing more than 160,000 people from the Massalit community to flee to Chad. It is unclear how many people have been killed in the region, with the lowest estimate of the death toll in El Geneina put at 5,000. <br/>According to Sudan's Professional Pharmacists Association, the number is higher. It says 11,000 bodies have been buried in mass graves in the city, while some refugees told the BBC they had seen corpses being thrown into a river.<br/>The RSF also ransacked the city of Zalingei, home to the Fur community, and encircled the two biggest cities in the region, Fasher and Nyala.<br/>Many Darfuris fear this is the culmination of a long-standing plan to transform the ethnically mixed region into an Arab-ruled domain.<br/>They say that El Geneina - along with numerous other towns and villages - have been emptied of most of their residents, with buildings and infrastructure - including hospitals and water stations - destroyed. <br/>\"What is happening is worse than what happened in 2003,\" the sheikh said, pointing out that the Massalit people's most-famous personalities - including doctors and lawyers - have been killed. <br/>Mrs Adoum - a presenter at the now-silent Radio El Geneina - was fortunate to survive when the RSF raided the broadcaster's office in the early days of the war. <br/>\"They went in and smashed all the equipment and looted what they could,\" she said. <br/>Now Mrs Adoum lives in a hut, built with sticks and pieces of clothing, not knowing whether she will ever be able to return home. <br/>\"We came as refugees. Many died along the way. But we had to keep moving,\" she said, as she held her three-week-old baby in her arms. <br/>Another refugee ruled out ever returning, saying: \"Who do I go back to? I have been here for weeks and the smell of the rotting corpses on the streets of El Geneina have refused to leave my nose.\" <br/>WATCH: The baby born on the Sudan-Chad border<br/>Darfur: 'I saw pick-up trucks full of dead people'<br/>Why an accountant took up arms Darfur<br/>Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militias<br/>BBC reporter: My heartbreaking decision to leave Sudan<br/>What is going on in Sudan?

As the mutiny began, he was resting with his unit in barracks in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region.<br/>Early in the morning on 23 June they got the call to join a column of Wagner fighters leaving Ukraine. The order came from a Wagner commander who Gleb is reluctant to name for security reasons, but who was acting on orders from Prigozhin and the Wagner Command Council.<br/>\"It's a full deployment,\" he was told. \"We're forming a column, let's move out.\"<br/>Gleb says no-one was told where the column was heading, but he was surprised when he realised they were moving away from the frontline.<br/>The Wagner fighters encountered absolutely no resistance, he says, as they crossed the Russian border into the Rostov region.<br/>\"I didn't see any border guards,\" he recalls. \"But the traffic police saluted us along the way.\"<br/>Channels closely associated with Wagner on the messaging app Telegram later claimed that border guards at the Bugayevka checkpoint had laid down their weapons as the Wagner fighters arrived. <br/>These channels shared a photo purportedly from the scene showing two dozen unarmed individuals in camouflage.<br/>As they approached Rostov-on-Don, the fighters were given orders to surround all the law enforcement agency buildings in the city and to occupy the military airport. Gleb's unit was told to take control of the regional offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB).<br/>As they approached the building it appeared to be completely locked and empty. They flew a drone overhead to check for any signs of life.<br/>Eventually, after half an hour, a door opened and two people came out onto the street.<br/>\"They said, 'Guys, let's make a deal',\" Gleb recounts. \"I said, 'What's there to make a deal about? This is our city'. <br/>\"So we just agreed that we would leave each other alone. They came out to smoke from time to time.\"<br/>Rostov journalists have reported a similar situation with many government buildings in and around the city. The Wagner fighters would first fly drones over them and then surround them. No-one was allowed to leave, but delivery couriers were allowed in with food.<br/>While all this was going on Wagner leader Prigozhin was at the Russian army's Southern Military District headquarters meeting Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Lt Gen Yunus-bek Yevkurov, and the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev.<br/>Prigozhin demanded that they hand over the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.<br/>At the same time as Prigozhin was in his meeting, there was another column of Wagner fighters on the move.<br/>Gleb confirms media reports that this column was led by Wagner founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer who is rarely seen in public.<br/>This column was on the main highway towards Voronezh, and apparently bound for Moscow, he says.<br/>So did Gleb know the plan - what Prigozhin was intending or planning to do? <br/>He swears as he bluntly says he didn't have a clue. \"We learned what was happening from Telegram, just like you did.\"<br/>As the day went on, pictures of what was happening in Rostov were beamed around the world. People were surprised to see local residents and even local journalists apparently smiling and chatting to some of the normally tight-lipped Wagner fighters occupying their city.<br/>\"It was the ex-cons,\" says Gleb, referring to the many serving prisoners or convicts conscripted into Wagner last year. \"Nobody told them not to, nobody cares about them.\"<br/>For established fighters like Gleb, who were hired long before the war in Ukraine, the rules are much more clearly understood. <br/>He told the BBC that back in the spring, they had been told by the senior command that anyone who spoke to the media would be \"nullified\", ie killed. Several former Wagner fighters have told us the same thing.<br/>On the evening of 24 June, Gleb was contacted by one of his superiors and told, without any explanation, that he and his unit should now return to base in Luhansk.<br/>As they made their way back to barracks, they were following the news on Telegram.<br/>They read that criminal charges had been initiated against Prigozhin, then dropped, and that he was to move to Belarus. <br/>They then read that W\u0430gner fighters would not be held accountable for their role in the mutiny because of their \"combat merits\", according to President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. <br/>For Gleb and his unit, their future is now unclear. They've been told to stay in their barracks in Luhansk and await further orders. <br/>Their hosts, authorities of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, pro-Russian separatist militants in eastern Ukraine, are keen to find out more about their future plans and what will happen to their equipment and ammunition, he says.<br/>When asked why he doesn't leave Wagner, Gleb has a simple answer: \"My contract hasn't expired yet.\"<br/>Wagner boss Prigozhin met Putin after mutiny<br/>What is Russia's Wagner mercenary group?<br/>From Putin's chef to rebel in chief<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Minutes later the two young women were dragged out on to the street and beaten unconscious - Ms Sianching thinks the mob thought they were dead, so ran away.<br/>Police who found their bodies only realised they were alive after checking their pulses.<br/>Fake news on social media, purporting to show women being sexually assaulted by Kuki men were fuelling this mob of Meitei men against Chiin and her friend.<br/>Early in the conflict a photo of a dead woman was circulated, apparently showing a Meitei nurse who had  been raped and killed by Kuki men. Later, many news outlets debunked this.<br/>Faultlines quickly deepened after the conflict flared up, causing a complete separation of two communities who had previously lived alongside one another. Both now have barricades at village entry points and there are continuing reports of overnight clashes.<br/>Meitei groups have told the BBC that women from the community also faced sexual assault - the BBC has not been able to confirm this. But the video of the two Kuki women being paraded naked united Meitei women in protest too.<br/>Manipur has a longstanding tradition of women playing a powerful role in civil society, among them the Meira Peibis, or torch-bearers - also known as the mothers of Manipur - who have protested against abuses of power by the state and the army, and human rights violations.<br/>Sinam Surnalata Leima, who leads the Meira Peibis in a group of villages where the two Kuki women in the video were attacked, says that villagers themselves handed over the main suspect to police.<br/>Then the local members of Meira Peibis got together and burned his house.<br/>\"The burning is a symbol of the community's condemnation of the heinous crime that those men committed, their actions cannot tarnish the whole Meitei community's honour,\" says Ms Leima.<br/>The accused's wife and three children have been banished from the village.<br/>But why did the mob act the way it did, in a society that regards its women highly?<br/>\"It was grief and revenge for the Meitei women who had been attacked by Kuki men,\" Ms Leima reasons. <br/>She does not personally know of any such attacks, but says Meitei women would not discuss a crime of this kind, as it would be considered shameful. <br/>State police said soon after the start of the clashes that they had not received reports of violence against Meitei women, but a spokesman for the Meitei community told me there had been many unreported attacks. <br/>Khuraijam Athouba, who represents a Meitei organisation called Cocomi, said that Meitei women had chosen not to speak about the \"violations they faced\".<br/>In his view the focus should remain on the issue of killings and displaced people, rather than sexual violence.<br/>The brother of one of the Kuki women who was seen paraded in the video is tormented by all of these issues.  <br/>The mob that stripped and sexually assaulted his sister, also killed their father and their younger brother - he and his mother were saved as they were visiting family in another village when the clashes started.<br/>The 23-year-old man has a blank expression for most of the time when I meet him in a small room in the home of one of his relatives.<br/>I ask him what he would like the government and police to do?<br/>\"Arrest each person in that mob, especially those who killed my father and brother,\" he says.<br/>\"And treat both communities with fairness.\"<br/>Faith in the federal and state government seems lacking in both communities.<br/>The Chief Minister of Manipur, N Biren Singh, who belongs to the Meitei community, promised the \"harshest punishment to the accused, including capital punishment\". But when asked about the calls for his resignation for failure to resolve the conflict, he said, \"Don't want to go into this, my job is to bring peace to the state and punish miscreants.\"<br/>Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence on the conflict only after the video of the two women sparked national outrage.<br/>\"What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,\" he said, adding that no guilty person would be spared.<br/>But for Ms Leima, that statement painted her community in a bad light and ignored the violence that has raged since May, causing 60,000 people to be displaced.<br/>\"The prime minister spoke when Kuki women were attacked. What about everything we have been facing, are we Meitei women not citizens of India?\" she asks.<br/>The video has put the spotlight back on the continuing Manipur conflict.<br/>\"If it wasn't for this video, we would have not got so much attention from the government and other political parties,\" says Gracy Haokip, a researcher supporting victims of the clashes, including the nursing student, Chiin Sianching. <br/>She says it will help the survivors who have courageously shared their experiences while trying to rebuild their lives.<br/>Chiin tells me about the speech she gave to the women in her community, when she told them that she had enrolled into another nursing institute situated in her local area.<br/>\"My mother told me that God has kept me alive for a reason, so I have decided I will not give up my dreams.\"<br/>What is happening in Manipur and why?<br/>India police face scrutiny after women paraded naked<br/>India video shows how rape is weaponised in conflict<br/>The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Many of the demonstrators were seriously injured and the day came to be called Black Friday in the UK.<br/>Sophia was among the 119 women who were arrested.<br/>She was the daughter of Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh - the last Sikh emperor of Punjab - and a goddaughter of Queen Victoria.<br/>\"Sophia Duleep Singh was as close to a celebrity as you could get in November 1910 when she took part in Black Friday,\" her biographer Anita Anand said in an interview. <br/>Much of what is now known of her comes from Anand's in-depth 2015 biography, Sophia: Princess, Suffragette, Revolutionary, pieced together from detailed archival research, police and intelligence records and first-hand accounts from people who knew her.<br/>Born in 1876, Sophia was the fifth of the six children Duleep Singh had with his first wife Bamba M\u00fcller.<br/>As a boy, Duleep Singh had been exiled to England from India after his kingdom was annexed by the British in 1849, with the priceless Koh-i-Noor diamond handed to them under the terms of a punitive treaty.<br/>Sophia grew up in the family's home in Suffolk but had a tumultuous childhood, Anand writes. Duleep Singh was exiled to France in 1886 after failed attempts to reclaim his throne, and abandoned his family to debt. <br/>But the family's close relationship with Queen Victoria helped them secure a home and yearly allowance from the India Office, a department of the British government.<br/>When Sophia grew up, she was given a grace-and-favour apartment by the queen in the Hampton Court Palace, outside which she would later go on to protest for the right to vote.<br/>\"From an early age, [Sophia] learned to negotiate between the easy existence granted to her as a member of Britain's elite and her ambiguous position as an Indian woman living in Britain during the heyday of the British Empire,\" historian Elizabeth Baker writes in a chapter in the book The British Women's Suffrage Campaign.<br/>Over her lifetime, Sophia made about four visits to India, each of them closely monitored by British officials who feared that the presence of Duleep Singh's family would foment dissent.<br/>In 1906-07, Sophia met freedom fighters Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Lala Lajpat Rai in Lahore (now in Pakistan) and was moved by their speeches and political conviction.<br/>\"By April 1907, Sophia had spent six months in India and had witnessed firsthand the growing political turbulence in India. The push for Indian self-determination had seduced her,\" Anand writes in her book.<br/>In 1908, a few months after returning to the UK, Sophia joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a suffrage group led by British political activist Emmeline Pankhurst.<br/>She later also joined the Women's Tax Resistance League, whose slogan was \"No Vote, No Tax\".<br/>Sophia participated in these movements with great vigour. In 1911, she threw herself at the prime minister's car as it was leaving Downing Street, holding a banner that said \"Give women the vote!\". The same year, she left her census form blank and refused to pay taxes.<br/>A photo from 1913 shows the princess standing outside the Hampton Court Palace where she lived, selling copies of The Suffragette newspaper next to a board that read \"Revolution!\".<br/>The photograph made her \"the face of 'Suffragette Week', an initiative concocted by the WSPU to recruit more members and inundate Britain\", Baker writes.<br/>Newspapers reported on how authorities seized and auctioned her jewels for failing to pay certain taxes. Sophia was arrested several times but unlike other suffragettes, charges against her were always dropped. <br/>In the book South Asian Resistances in Britain, 1858 - 1947, historian Sumita Mukherjee pointed to Sophia's involvement to highlight the contradictions in the suffragette movement - that they could capitalise on her title for their cause without interrogating or challenging class hierarchies.<br/>Her presence also drew more scrutiny.<br/>\"India Office bureaucrats collected press clippings and swapped memoranda regarding her personal and financial affairs in an effort to control Duleep Singh's actions as a politicised member of the Indian diaspora in Britain,\" Baker writes.<br/>She calls Sophia \"an important bridge between Indian activists and white British activists for female suffrage\".<br/>In 1918, the British Parliament passed a reform that allowed women over the age of 30 to vote if they met certain qualifications regarding property. Equal franchise would come 10 years later.<br/>In 1919, Sophia accompanied political activists Sarojini Naidu and Annie Besant to the India Office in London. Naidu and Besant led a delegation of Indian women to lay out their arguments for the right to vote before the Secretary of State. He heard them out but made no promises (Indians got universal franchise after the country became independent).<br/>The spotlight on Sophia particularly annoyed King George V who was \"anti-suffrage\", Anand writes in her book. But there was little he could do as \"Parliament held ultimate control\" over her finances.<br/>Sophia was involved in other causes too - during World War I, she helped tend to wounded Indian soldiers in Britain and raised money for them.<br/>According to Anand's book, the princess returned to India for another visit in 1924, determined to travel across Punjab.  <br/>As she traversed the old Sikh kingdom with her sister Bamba, crowds thronged to see them, with some crying, \"Our princesses are here!\"<br/>Among the places they visited was the site of the 1919 Jallianwala massacre where hundreds of Indians were shot by British troops.<br/>During World War Two, she left London for Buckinghamshire along with her sister Catherine and three evacuees from London. <br/>Her last years were spent with her companion and housekeeper Janet Ivy Bowden, whose daughter Drovna was Sophia's goddaughter.<br/>Drovna told Anand that the princess would talk to her often about the importance of voting.<br/>\"She would say '...When you are allowed to vote you are never, ever to fail to do so. You don't realise how far we've come,'\" Drovna recounts.<br/>Sophia died in her sleep on 22 August 1948 at the age of 71. <br/>As per the princess's wishes, her ashes were brought to Lahore by her sister Bamba but it is not clear where they were scattered.<br/>But she is still fondly remembered by many, especially in the UK - a plaque honouring her was unveiled at her former home earlier this year and a film about her is expected to be released next year.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

If all this technology really is making us all work faster and better, there is precious little evidence.<br/>Between 1974 and 2008 the UK's productivity - the amount of output you get per worker - grew at an annual rate of 2.3%. But between 2008 and 2020 the rate of productivity growth collapsed to around 0.5% per annum.<br/>And in the first three months of this year, UK productivity was actually down 0.6% on a year earlier.<br/>It is a similar picture in most other Western nations. In the US, productivity growth between 1995 and 2005 was 3.1%, but it then fell to 1.4% from 2005 to 2019. <br/>It feels like we are continuing to go through a huge period of innovation and technological advancement, but at the same time, productivity has slowed to a crawl. How can you explain this apparent paradox?<br/>It might be that we are all just using the technology to avoid doing work. Such as endlessly messaging friends on Whatsapp, watching videos on YouTube, arguing angrily on Twitter, or simply mindlessly surfing the internet.<br/>Or there might, of course, be bigger underlying factors.<br/>Productivity is something economists look at very closely. And while it is a complicated issue, with the 2008 financial crisis and current high inflation having a negative impact, there are said to be two main explanations for why technology is not boosting productivity.<br/>The first is that we are just not measuring the impact of technology properly. The second is that economic revolutions tend to be rather slow-burning affairs. And therefore, technological change is happening, but it just might be decades before we see the full benefits.<br/>Dame Diane Coyle is the Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, and a recognised expert on how we measure productivity.<br/>\"There is nothing that doesn't use digital now, but it is difficult to see what is going on because none of this is visible in the statistics.  We just don't collect the data in ways that would help us understand what is happening.\" <br/>For example, a company that used to invest in its own computer servers and IT department might now outsource both to an overseas, cloud-based provider.<br/>The firm doing the outsourcing gets the best software, updated all the time, and it is reliable and cheap.<br/>But in terms of how we measure the size of the economy, this efficient move makes the company look smaller not larger. And it is no longer seen to be investing in that area of its IT infrastructure, which would have previously been measured as part of its economic growth.  <br/>Dame Coyle has an example from the 19th Century's industrial revolution that illustrates how productivity can be missed from statistics.<br/>\"I have a wonderful 1885 yearbook of statistics for the UK, it is 120 pages long, of which almost all is about agriculture, and there are 12 pages on mines and railways and cotton mills,\" she says.<br/>This was at the very height of the industrial revolution, the time of so-called \"dark satanic mills\", yet 90% of the data gathered was about an old, increasingly less important sector of the economy, and just 10% on what we now see as the one of the most important economic changes in world history.<br/>\"The way we see the economy is through the lens of how it used to be in the past, not how it is today,\" is how Dame Coyle puts it.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>The other argument is that the current technological revolution is happening, but just more slowly than we expect.<br/>Nick Crafts is emeritus professor of economic history at the University of Sussex Business School. He points out that the huge sea changes in economic performance we tend to think of as having happened almost overnight, actually took decades, and the same may well be happening how.<br/>\"James Watt's steam engine was patented in 1769,\" he says. \"Yet the first serious commercial railway, the Liverpool to Manchester line only opened in 1830, and the core of the railway network was built by 1850. That was 80 years after the patent.\"<br/>You can see the same pattern in the use of electricity. The time from Edison's first public use of the light bulb in 1879, to the electrification of whole countries and the replacement of steam power in manufacturing was at least 40 years.<br/>In fact, we might be in a similar hiatus at the moment, something like when the world was between the peak of steam power and the full development of electricity.  <br/>But the country and the businesses that can make the best and fastest use of new technology are going to win the productivity race. This, as it was with steam and electricity, seems to come down not to the technology itself but to how well you can use it, adapt it, and exploit it - in short how skilled you are.<br/>Dame Coyle sees this happening already. \"There is a lot of evidence now that whatever kind of company it is, there is a growing divergence between those that can use the technology well and those that can't.<br/>\"It seems to be that if you have highly-skilled people, you have a lot of data and you know how to use the sophisticated software, and you can change your processes, so that people can use the information, your productivity is going through the roof.<br/>\"But in the same sector of the economy there are other companies that just can't do that.\" <br/>The technology is seemingly not the problem, and in some respects it is not the solution either. High productivity growth will come only to those that learn how to use it best. <br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

El Ni\u00f1o normally doesn't really have a global impact until five or six months into the phase,\" Dr Smith says.<br/>El Ni\u00f1o is the world's most powerful naturally occurring climate fluctuation. It brings warmer water to the surface in the tropical Pacific, pushing warmer air into the atmosphere. It normally increases global air temperatures.<br/>The average global temperature in June this year was 1.47C above the typical June in the pre-industrial period. Humans started pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when the Industrial Revolution started around 1800.<br/>Asked if summer 2023 is what he would have forecasted a decade ago, Dr Smith says that climate models are good at predicting long-term trends but less good at forecasting the next 10 years.<br/>\"Models from the 1990s pretty much put us where we are today. But to have an idea about what the next 10 years would look like exactly would be very difficult,\" he says.<br/>\"Things aren't going to cool down,\" he adds.<br/>The average global ocean temperature has smashed records for May, June and July. It is approaching the highest sea surface temperature ever recorded, which was in 2016.<br/>But it is extreme heat in the North Atlantic ocean that is particularly alarming scientists.<br/>\"We've never ever had a marine heatwave in this part of Atlantic. I had not expected this,\" says Daniela Schmidt, Prof of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.<br/>Press play to see the map animated.<br/>In June temperatures off the west coast of Ireland were between 4C and 5C above average, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classified as a category 5 heatwave, or \"beyond extreme\".<br/>Directly attributing this heatwave to climate change is complex, but that work is ongoing, Prof Schmidt says.<br/>What is clear is that the world has warmed and the oceans have absorbed most of that heat from the atmosphere, she explains.<br/>\"Our models have natural variability in them, and there are still things appearing that we had not envisaged, or at least not yet,\" she adds.<br/>She emphasises the impact of this heat on marine ecosystems, which produce 50% of the world's oxygen.<br/>\"People tend to think about trees and grasses dying when we talk about heatwaves. The Atlantic is 5C warmer than it should be - that means organisms need 50% more food just to function as normal,\" she says.<br/>The area covered by sea-ice in the Antarctic is at record lows for July. There is an area around 10 times the size of the UK missing, compared with the 1981-2010 average.<br/>Alarm bells are ringing for scientists as they try to unpick the exact link to climate change.<br/>A warming world could reduce levels of Antarctic sea-ice, but the current dramatic reduction could also be due to local weather conditions or ocean currents, explains Dr Caroline Holmes at the British Antarctic Survey.<br/>She emphasises it is not just a record being broken - it is being smashed by a long way.<br/>\"This is nothing like anything we've seen before in July. It's 10% lower than the previous low, which is huge.\"<br/>She calls it \"another sign that we don't really understand the pace of change\".<br/>Scientists believed that global warming would affect Antarctic sea-ice at some point, but until 2015 it bucked the global trend for other oceans, Dr Holmes says.<br/>\"You can say that we've fallen off a cliff, but we don't know what's at the bottom of the cliff here,\" she says.<br/>\"I think this has taken us by surprise in terms of the speed of which has happened.

What is real about us? What is the watermark of being human?\" she says. <br/>Central to the system is a technique called Photoplethysmography (PPG), which detects changes in blood flow. <br/>Faces created by deepfakes don't give out these signals, she says. <br/>The system also analyses eye movement to check for authenticity. <br/>\"So normally, when humans look at a point, when I look at you, it's as if I'm shooting rays from my eyes, to you. But for deepfakes, it's like googly eyes, they are divergent,\" she says. <br/>By looking at both these traits, Intel believes it can work out the difference between a real video and a fake within seconds. <br/>The company claims FakeCatcher is 96% accurate. So we asked to try out the system. Intel agreed. <br/>We used a dozen or so clips of former US President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. <br/>Some were real, some were deepfakes created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The BBC's James Clayton puts a deepfake video detector to the test<br/>In terms of finding the deepfakes, the system appeared to be pretty good. <br/>We mostly chose lip-synced fakes - real videos where the mouth and voice had been altered. <br/>And it got every answer right, bar one. <br/>However when we got onto real, authentic videos it started to have a problem. <br/>Several times the system said a video was fake, when it was in fact real. <br/>The more pixelated a video, the harder it is to pick up blood flow. <br/>The system also does not analyse audio. So some videos that seemed fairly obviously real by listening to the voice were allocated as fake. <br/>The worry is that if the program says a video is fake, when it's genuine, it could cause real problems.<br/>When we make this point to Ms Demir, she says that \"verifying something as fake, versus 'be careful, this may be fake' is weighted differently\".<br/>She is saying the system is being overly cautious. Better to catch all the fakes - and catch some real videos too - than miss fakes. <br/>Deepfakes can be incredibly subtle: a two second clip in a political campaign advert, for example. They can also be of low quality. A fake can be made by only changing the voice. <br/>In this respect, the ability for FaceCatcher to work \"in the wild\" - in real world contexts - has been questioned.<br/>Matt Groh is an assistant professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, and a deepfakes expert. <br/>\"I don't doubt the stats that they listed in their initial evaluation,\" he says. \"But what I do doubt is whether the stats are relevant to real world contexts.\"<br/>This is where it gets difficult to evaluate FakeCatcher's tech.<br/>Programmes like facial-recognition systems will often give extremely generous statistics for their accuracy.<br/>However, when actually tested in the real world they can be less accurate. <br/>Earlier this year the BBC tested Clearview AI's facial recognition system, using our own pictures. Although the power of the tech was impressive, it was also clear that the more pixelated the picture, and the more side-on the the face in the photo was, the harder it was for the programme to successfully identify someone.<br/>In essence, the accuracy is entirely dependent on the difficulty of the test. <br/>Intel claims that FakeCatcher has gone through rigorous testing. This includes a \"wild\" test - in which the company has put together 140 fake videos - and their real counterparts.<br/>In this test the system had a success rate of 91%, Intel says.<br/>However, Matt Groh and other researchers want to see the system independently analysed. They do not think it's good enough that Intel is setting a test for itself. <br/>\"I would love to evaluate these systems,\" Mr Groh says. <br/>\"I think it's really important when we're designing audits and trying to understand how accurate something is in a real world context,\" he says. <br/>It is surprising how difficult it can be tell a fake and a real video apart - and this technology certainly has potential. <br/>But from our limited tests, it has a way to go yet. <br/>Watch the full report on this week's episode of Click<br/>Martin Lewis felt 'sick' seeing deepfake scam<br/>Revenge and deepfake porn laws to be toughened<br/>Trauma of deepfake porn can be 'life-shattering'<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

But through his deft curation, Osei has pulled off a visual feast, creating a vivid tapestry that thrusts contemporary African art firmly into the global centre. <br/>Speaking to the BBC, he explained how his thematic approach allows examination of how the continent's \"shared histories\" - from its colonial experience to post-independence revolutionary movements and its urban future - had \"shaped and reshaped\" how people in Africa see themselves and their place in the world.<br/>The exhibition's title, A World in Common, is inspired by the work of the pioneering Cameroonian historian and intellectual Achille Mbembe, who argued that we must think of the world from an African perspective. His ideas provide the intellectual thread that runs through the exhibition, offering a bold invitation to reconsider how we view the place of Africa in the world.<br/>By featuring many artists for the first time internationally, the Tate Modern puts emerging African talent centre stage in a museum so crucial in setting the world's artistic agenda. <br/>One artist featured is the British-Nigerian, Zina Saro-Wiwa. Her work, The Invisible Man Series, 2015, explores the tradition of mask-wearing among the Ogoni, her ancestral ethnic group in the Niger Delta of Nigeria.  <br/>Her work unpacks the role masks traditionally play in Ogoni culture and is also an ode to a more personal and emotional journey. \"I made this work to help me heal myself,\" she told the BBC.<br/>Her intimate, mournful and beautiful images demonstrate the power of art to bridge the past and the present, the group and the individual.  <br/>Another artist shown is the Angolan artist Kiluanji Kia Henda, whose work titled Rusty Mirage (The City Skyline), 2013, is a series of photographs of sculptures he created in the Jordanian desert. <br/>These sculptures look like the outlines of cities emerging from barren desert lands. Inspired by the cityscapes of Dubai and Luanda, the capital of Angola and the city of his birth, Kiluanji told the BBC that he was interested in exploring the \"idea of emptiness\".<br/>He explains how Luanda, wrecked by one of Africa's longest civil wars, from 1975 to 2002, was reimagined as a city of glistening towers.<br/>He says many buildings have gone up unfinished, infamously including the town of Kilamba Kiaxi, but these buildings are \"monuments to greed and corruption\".<br/>Another featured artist is Eritrean-Canadian Dawit L Petros, whose work speaks powerfully of the perilous migration journeys taken by many young people across Africa. <br/>His images highlight the contrast between Mauritania and the Italian island of Sicily, shedding light on the intricate realities of migration.<br/>This is just the beginning for Osei, who hopes someday that an exhibition like this could travel to Africa and beyond.<br/>For now, he wants this dazzling show to \"inspire\" those on the continent and elsewhere to look with African eyes.<br/>Ismail Einashe is a freelance journalist based in London and Nairobi and the author of  Look Again: Strangers, a book exploring migration through the lens of art.  <br/>Images subject to copyright<br/>Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica<br/>What a bird's eye view of Africa reveals<br/>Do you know this baby?

The posts claim to help end money worries but charities warn some companies are misleading people who are struggling. <br/>Some who sign up to the products on offer, known as IVAs, could end up worse off, a BBC investigation has found. <br/>Shauna was \u00a317,000 in debt with car and furniture loans when a specific sort of social media post started to appear in her feed. As she scrolled online in the evenings while her three children were in bed, she was drawn to pictures of worried-looking women alongside claims of wiping away financial troubles.<br/>It was autumn 2020, and Shauna, then 23, was on maternity leave from her job as a care worker in a supported living facility. Costs had started to mount when she was pregnant and the bills and reminder notices were clogging up the letterbox of her south Wales home.<br/>\"I saw no end to it,\" she says. \"It was just building and building\u2026 I didn't know how to cope.\" <br/>A company called Mums in Debt, she remembers, caught her eye on Facebook. It promised to write off up to 85% of debt. The more Shauna searched, the more it seemed like the perfect solution. One amount she could budget for. The belief she was taking control of her finances. <br/>\"I thought\u2026 'this is something for mothers, struggling'\", she explains. \"That's what sold it to me\".<br/>She says she answered some questions from Mums in Debt on Facebook Messenger and a representative gave her a call. She was passed on to another company, which signed her up to an Individual Voluntary Arrangement - a court-approved debt solution in which debts are combined into a single monthly payment. The arrangement, she was told, would last for five years. <br/>Shauna kept up with her agreed payments of \u00a3185 a month. But after a year, she realised her debts had barely budged.  <br/>Set up in the 1980s as a way to help owners of small companies keep trading and deal with their debt, IVAs are a booming business. Almost 90,000 were registered in England and Wales in 2022, compared to about 50,000 in 2014, according to figures from the Insolvency Service. <br/>Although they can be a welcome solution for people who want to protect their assets, like their homes, IVAs are unlikely to be suitable for people with low levels of debt, people without much disposable income, or people whose income solely comes from benefits.<br/>But the Citizens Advice charity says IVAs are being aggressively marketed at people in vulnerable situations by companies seeking to earn referral fees. <br/>\"You can just search online, on Google for debt advice and the [sponsored] ads will typically be from IVA firms\", explains its head of policy Morgan Wild.<br/>\"We're seeing worrying trends of companies making false claims about IVAs, and even posing as charities on social media\u2026 these tactics lure people into IVAs which they simply can't afford\". <br/>The BBC asked three independent debt advisers to review Shauna's case. They expressed concerns about the affordability of her IVA payments because it was set up when her outgoings were smaller because she was living with her mother.<br/>Fourteen other people who said they had signed up to IVAs after seeing social media posts also told the BBC they were struggling with repayments.  <br/>In a recent report, Citizens Advice deemed a sample of Facebook and Instagram IVA ads to be \"misleading\". Some ads failed to mention IVAs, while others used names that could be confused with charities or claimed to offer, free, impartial debt advice. <br/>Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment when asked about social media adverts promoting IVAs on its platforms.<br/>The BBC decided to investigate what was happening on TikTok. In June 2023, the BBC's data team searched TikTok for videos promoting IVAs, by typing in keywords like \"debt help UK\", \"stop bailiffs\" or \"debt advice\".<br/>Of more than 400 videos the team looked at which directly promoted IVAs or linked to IVA websites, more than 75% appeared to breach Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) rules. <br/>Most of the videos that appeared to break the rules did not mention the risks, terms and conditions or fees associated with taking out an IVA, while about a third overstated the speed or simplicity involved in setting one up. <br/>The ASA reviewed a sample of the videos. It said it had concerns about \"irresponsible ads\" and was \"continuing to monitor and take action where they appear\".<br/>It said: \"Advertisers need to be responsible. They shouldn't exploit consumers' fears or lack of experience, or trivialise the decision to use IVAs.\" <br/>TikTok said it was \"committed to working with the Advertising Standards Authority to ensure advertisers and creators comply with their guidelines\". It added that adverts promoting debt consolidation and debt assistance programs, which IVAs fall under, \"are not allowed on our platform and are removed\".<br/>Debt Trap: Who's Cashing In?<br/>As the cost of living crisis deepens, Panorama investigates the booming debt management industry and the companies signing up people for Individual Voluntary Arrangements.<br/>Watch Debt Trap: Who's Cashing In? on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 24 July (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) and on BBC iPlayer afterwards (UK only)<br/>After three years of repayments, Shauna now says she feels \"manipulated\" by the claims she saw on social media and says she would not have gone ahead with the IVA if she had known about other options. <br/>A statement she shared with the BBC from 2021 showed that she had paid \u00a31,537.99 of the \u00a33,650 in fees that she owes, with just \u00a3360 knocked off her debt. <br/>With prices rising, she says she has found it harder and harder to make ends meet and has had to use a foodbank for the first time.  <br/>\"I couldn't afford [the food shop] because the IVA went out [of my account],\" she says. \"I just feel ashamed of myself.\" <br/>The BBC wrote to Mums in Debt about Shauna's case but did not receive a response.<br/>Experiences like Shauna's are familiar to Morgan Wild of Citizens Advice. He says cracking down on social media content is \"much needed\", but also calls for greater regulation of the IVA sector itself. <br/>BBC Panorama called several companies in the IVA industry to see what happens when they are approached by potential customers. The team heard high pressure sales tactics being applied in some cases, with a reference to bailiff action if a potential client didn't go ahead.<br/>It is a complex field to navigate. Two types of companies - lead generators and debt packagers - can pass on potential customers to companies which provide IVAs. But lead generators are not regulated by the UK's financial watchdog - the Financial Conduct Authority. They typically earn up to about \u00a31,000 in fees for finding a customer who signs up to an IVA. <br/>Separately, insolvency practitioners, who set up the IVAs and earn money in fees, are not overseen by a fully independent regulator, but are members of professional membership associations who oversee their work.<br/>The patchwork of regulation could mean that people like Shauna are falling through the cracks. <br/>The government agency the Insolvency Service acknowledged there are concerns about the use of IVAs, but said when used appropriately they are an \"effective way for someone who is in financial difficulty to\u2026 pay their creditors\". The FCA said it was doing everything within its remit to ensure firms \"really are supporting borrowers in financial difficulty\". <br/>For now, Shauna is in touch with Citizens Advice and is considering her options - she could cancel the IVA and negotiate with her creditors directly, or see if she is eligible for another debt solution. Cancelling the IVA would mean she loses any money she has paid in fees so far. <br/>She has always dreamed of owning her own home, with a bedroom for each of her three children but now feels the prospect is growing ever more distant. <br/>\"[I'm] living from paycheck to paycheck,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm getting absolutely nowhere.\" <br/>To anyone in a complicated financial situation, she urges them to think carefully before signing up to a debt solution. <br/>\"If you see an ad [online], do your research and find out exactly what you're getting yourself into.\" <br/>Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

For some people who have stated particular medical conditions, or if they have become ill as a result of the wildfires, then there might be limited opportunities to claim.<br/>Different companies have varying policies at present, and varying degrees of flexibility on rebooking: <br/>There is no Foreign Office advice against travel to Rhodes or Corfu, so there's nothing to stop airlines selling standalone flights, nor do they have to cancel those already scheduled.<br/>However, package holidays are more complex. They may include accommodation that has been affected by fire, and the duty of care lasts for longer, so operators may decide to cancel. <br/>Someone who travelled on a package deal and is forced to come home early may receive a partial refund. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Holidaymakers describe \"terrifying\" wildfires ordeal<br/>However, if you were booked for two weeks, and came back after one, that does not mean you get half your money back, because, for example, you would still have travelled on an outbound and inbound flight.<br/>The best option is to keep in close contact, where possible, with your holiday company.<br/>If you travelled independently, then accommodation costs will depend on the individual hotel.<br/>Anyone who shortens their holiday because it is not a very pleasant experience or are concerned about being trapped is unlikely to be able to claim refunds, according to travel expert Simon Calder.<br/>That is because it is their choice, rather than necessity. Not all of the island is at risk from the fires.<br/>Not all of the island is affected by the fires, so it is a mixed picture. Some holidays are cancelled, while individual flights may still leave.<br/>If you have a package deal, then there is a chance your whole holiday has been cancelled. If that is the case, then there would be a full refund or the chance to rebook elsewhere.<br/>If you simply don't want to go, then it is more dependant on your specific travel company - there is no automatic right to get your money back, according to the Association of British Travel Agents.<br/>Anyone who has booked flights and accommodation separately would receive a refund for the flights element if they are cancelled, but would need to contact their hotel for other elements.<br/>Again, refunds if you chose not to travel is a decision for specific airlines and hotels.<br/>If people do not want to travel owing to the heat, many of the same cancellation rules apply. <br/>We have an explanation of those issues here.<br/>Thousands flee 'disaster film' Rhodes wildfires<br/>How to manage your holiday in a heatwave<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This included firms using the wrong forms, entering incorrect details and sending papers to the court late.<br/>In the UK will writing is an unregulated service and anyone can legally draft a document.<br/>The CMA says in some instances consumers have been attracted by an \"extremely low\" initial fee for advice without being warned how the costs could escalate significantly. <br/>Some complaints involve reports of vulnerable customers being subjected to pressure selling and coercion.  <br/>Pre-paid probate plans will also come under investigation. This is where customers pay set fees upfront for probate - the legal process of managing someone's estate when they die. <br/>The idea of these plans is that when someone dies their families will not have to pay anything else towards the finalising of their financial affairs.  <br/>Apart from pressure selling, the CMA is concerned about there being a lack of transparency about what costs are covered by the plans, or people being sold unnecessary plans. In some cases this can lead to delays in the probate process and bereaved relatives being left unable to settle bills or sell property. <br/>CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said the three areas identified - online divorce services, will writing and pre-paid probate plans - were essential to people, \"often at the most challenging times in their lives\".<br/>\"That's why it's so important that we investigate so that people can select the right legal service for them - for divorce or probate or will writing - with confidence. It's essential that firms get the basics right, including complying with general consumer law which applies to all traders. Customers must get a fair deal.\" <br/>The watchdog is calling for consumers who have used any of the services or other interested parties to get in contact by 4 September with details of their experiences.<br/>If the CMA concludes that firms have breached consumer law, it can respond in a number of ways, including taking enforcement action such as obtaining a court order.<br/>Initially though, it might simply provide advice on complying with the law or obtain a commitment from the company that it will change its practices.<br/>Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

Include growth, jobs and taxes and it's a mixed picture.<br/>For all the talk of lower inflation, it still means prices are a painful 7.9% higher in the UK than a year ago. In the EU, that rate is 5.5%, it's even lower in the US.<br/>Britain experienced the worst of both sources of price shocks impacting rich countries - last year's spike in energy and food costs prompted by the war in Ukraine, and a post-pandemic shortage of workers.<br/>Like the EU, the UK buys in a lot of energy - but the effects of the fall back in wholesale gas prices is taking longer to show in our inflation numbers<br/>This is because of the later introduction of energy support and price movements take a while to be reflected in the cap on domestic bills here. <br/>But so-called \"core\" inflation, a measure which strips out energy and food, remains near its highest rate for 30 years. That suggests there is still strong spending on non-essentials, treats, with some people using savings stashed away during the pandemic, or due to pay rises.<br/>It's that discretionary spending that the Bank of England targets when it raises the cost of borrowing.<br/>But we're not alone. The rates on new mortgage deals in many other countries have shot up over the last 18 months. <br/>But the impact differs. In the US and some of Europe, fixed rate mortgage deals tend to typically run for 25 or 30 years. In some, mortgage holders can switch deals with minimal penalty. The French government also effectively caps rates, so a new 30-year mortgage deal may cost 3.5%. In America those mortgage rates have neared 7%. <br/>It's more meaningful to compare effective rates - the average across existing and new home loans. According to the latest published calculations, in the UK, where the majority are on two or five-year fixed deals, that's just below 3% (although that will rise as more loans are re-fixed). In France and Germany it's below 2%<br/>Although inflation here has slowed, the Bank of England is still expected to raise rates at least once more - and they may stay high for longer than in the EU or US . <br/>But there's a price.<br/>When it comes to growth, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt opts to highlight that since 2010, the UK has expanded faster than France, Japan and Italy.<br/>But many experts compare where economies were prior to the pandemic. By the spring of his year, Germany and the UK were the only G7 nations still to have smaller economies than at the end of 2019, according to the quarterly official figures.<br/>Analysts suggest factors behind that may include British consumers being more reticent to ramp up spending coming out of the pandemic and sluggish investment. Also international trade being slower to recover from that shock than it was in other major countries. Perhaps this is a result of changes in trading arrangements brought about by Brexit.<br/>In 2023, however, the UK has been more resilient than some expected.<br/>Growth may have flatlined but consumer spending has held up better - those higher wages and pandemic savings again. It was actually the Eurozone which slipped into recession over the early part of this year.<br/>But higher interest rates engineer a slow down, which takes some time to become apparent. There is now concern among some economists that we could see the UK slipping into recession - and others with it.<br/>But we've further to go in playing catch up.<br/>Despite the ravages of Covid and higher interest rates, our jobs market hasn't done too badly. The unemployment rate in the UK, at 4%, is below that in the EU, although above America's 3.6%  <br/>But there's far more to the picture. <br/>To count as unemployed, people have to be available for work and seeking a job. Those who aren't count as inactive. The UK is rare in being one of few rich countries in which there are more inactive people than prior to the pandemic, hundreds of thousands more, in particular as the number of long-term sick has soared. The OECD ranks the UK at the bottom for the G7 for the workforce participation rates (the proportion working or seeking a job). <br/>Add in Brexit restrictions, and that equals shortages in some industries. On the flip side, it may boost wage growth - as workers are more able to secure bigger pay rises.<br/>But as those interest rates bite, unemployment too could rise. <br/>In not just inflation and rates impacting fortunes. Those earning wages or running companies may have noticed higher tax bills.<br/>The proportion of our nation's income, GDP, paid to the tax man is currently set to reach a post-war record of 37.7% by 2028. <br/>Feeling short changed? Our so-called tax burden was actually lower than the EU average, although above that in the US on the latest comparable numbers. The tax man in France already receives 45 cents for every Euro generated in the economy there. <br/>But most nations will face increased pressures on their public purse, thanks to an ageing population and existing debts.<br/>It's been a tough few years all round but there are some areas in which the UK might feel particularly short-changed.<br/>How the interest rate rise affects you<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

But many airports and airlines that had made cuts during the pandemic struggled to recruit staff quickly enough.<br/>They insist they've pulled out all the stops to make their operations more resilient this year.<br/>For example, EasyJet told the BBC in March it started recruiting far earlier than usual and was already fully staffed for summer.<br/>However, there are different headaches this year, which could mean further disruption, although not necessarily on the scale of last year's problems.<br/>Strike action, notably by French air traffic controllers, has been causing cancellations and delays for months. <br/>Flights over France to destinations such as Spain and Portugal have also been affected, which Ryanair's boss has repeatedly complained about.<br/>The Unite union says ground handlers contracted by airlines at Gatwick Airport will take eight days of strike action  in late July and early August. Gatwick is Europe's busiest single-runway airport.<br/>Around 450 Menzies aviation, ASC and GGS workers are due to walk out from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August, and then again from Friday 4 August to Tuesday 8 August.<br/>Employees of DHL, who do jobs like baggage handling for Easyjet, were also due to take part in a four-day strike from 28 July but this has been suspended while they vote on a new pay offer.<br/>This could less mean disruption than originally anticipated. Gatwick says it will work with airlines to ensure as many flights as possible operate as scheduled.<br/>Proposed summer strike action by security workers at Heathrow was called off after the Unite union accepted an improved pay offer.<br/>And at Birmingham Airport, a strike expected to involve more than 150 security staff and technicians has been suspended after a fresh pay offer.<br/>The threat of strikes by European air traffic managers at Eurocontrol remains, but no dates have been set. The union involved told the BBC it hopes to reach an agreement with the employer.<br/>Industrial action isn't the only issue. <br/>The air traffic control environment is \"challenging\", according to Willie Walsh, who heads up global airline body Iata.<br/>EasyJet has already axed 1,700 summer flights at Gatwick to reduce the chance of last-minute cancellations, blaming what it called \"unprecedented\" air traffic limitations.<br/>Europe's air space remains constrained and clogged up due to the Ukraine war.<br/>\"In the event of French strikes some flights may be rerouted through other, already congested, air space which itself creates additional pressure,\" says aviation expert John Strickland.<br/>\"Manpower shortages in parts of Europe such as Greece and Denmark [are] causing capacity bottlenecks, which create further delays. <br/>\"Indeed one European airline CEO told me that the whole of European air traffic control except the UK was 'a mess'.\"<br/>Mr Strickland thinks events like summer storms could add pressure to an already stretched system, leading to delays and cancellations.<br/>On the railway, the plans of thousands of people going on day trips or holidays could be affected.<br/>Rail workers in the RMT union at 14 train companies with government contracts walk out again on Saturday 29 July. <br/>Their dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions has been going on for more than a year now.<br/>The operators are all based in England but some run services into Wales and Scotland.<br/>The level of disruption during these strikes will vary around the country. Many will run reduced services. <br/>Strike day timetables are published a week before each date.  <br/>It's worth checking before you set off.<br/>These RMT strikes are happening after the union rejected the latest proposals from the industry, which is backed by the government.<br/>The train companies are under pressure from the government to cut costs. With the national dispute at a standstill, they have since announced controversial plans to close most station ticket offices in England.  <br/>Passengers are being asked to provide their views until 26 July, in a consultation run by watchdogs Transport Focus and London Travelwatch.<br/>Train drivers in the Aslef union have also been taking action short of a strike in the form of an overtime ban at 15 train companies. The next overtime ban will be from Monday 31 July to Saturday 5 August.<br/>This could cause some reduced timetables and last-minute cancellations.<br/>In London, strikes on the Underground have been called off following last-minute talks.<br/>Traffic is expected to increase as we head into the summer holiday season, and roads could be busier than usual as train strikes push people into cars instead. <br/>\"It's likely that people will consider altering their journey plans and they may well travel by car instead so it's important they check their vehicle is roadworthy before setting off,\" says Frank Bird, senior network planner at National Highways.<br/>\"We'd also remind motorists to check the weather forecast... and to take plenty of drinking water with them as well as food that won't be affected by the heat in case of delays.\"<br/>Dover is Europe's busiest ferry port, and summer is its peak time as passengers head across the Channel.<br/>It will be under the spotlight again after many passengers experienced long queues last July and during this year's Easter holidays.<br/>Holidaymakers are being warned to expect to wait up to two-and-a-half hours to pass additional passport checks introduced after Brexit.<br/>In late May, port boss Doug Bannister told the BBC everything possible had been done to prevent the same level of delays.<br/>However, he said \"it would be foolish\" to guarantee there would never be queues. Mr Bannister added that additional passport checks were a factor.<br/>The port's location between cliffs and the sea means space is limited. <br/>It says measures in place ahead of the summer holidays include working with coach and ferry operators to spread out travel at peak times, extra space to process coach passengers, and putting in more border control posts. <br/>Local authorities and emergency services have traffic management plans for busy times, including queuing up lorries on the M20 motorway.<br/>This system was reinstated ahead of the busy July and August period.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Strike action could hit holiday flights in Europe<br/>Easyjet cancels 1,700 flights from July to September<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The action is part of their ongoing dispute about pay and conditions.<br/>On Saturday 29 July members of the RMT union will be taking action at 14 rail companies:<br/>GTR operates Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express.<br/>Greater Anglia includes Stansted Express.<br/>The RMT says 20,000 of its members, including guards, train managers and station staff, will walk out.<br/>On previous strike days there have been thousands of cancellations, with some lines not operating at all.<br/>On lines where there have been services, they have tended to start later and finish earlier than normal.<br/>National Rail has said passengers should expect large areas of the rail network to have little or no services and should check with the operator before travelling.<br/>Members of Aslef are taking industrial action short of a strike, in the form of an overtime ban.<br/>Services will be disrupted by this again from Monday 31 July to Saturday 5 August.<br/>Most train companies rely on drivers working overtime to run their full schedules. <br/>Many train operators will reduce their service levels.<br/>Unions say any pay offer should reflect the rising cost of living - with the inflation rate only recently having dipped below 10%.<br/>But the rail industry is under pressure to save money, after the pandemic left a hole in its finances. <br/>Bosses say reforms need to be agreed to afford pay increases and modernise the railway.<br/>London Underground workers have called off their strikes from Sunday 23 July until Friday 28 July after a \"major step forward\" in talks.<br/>Three unions had been due to walk out in a long-running dispute about pensions, job cuts and working conditions.<br/>The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was \u00a345,919, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). <br/>If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is \u00a339,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff.<br/>The ONS says median pay for \"train and tram drivers\" is just under \u00a359,000.<br/>Although Aslef members tend to be better paid than other rail workers, Mick Whelan, general secretary of the union, told BBC News on 12 May that train drivers \"haven't had a pay rise for four years\". He was just referring to the ones who are taking industrial action.<br/>That's because a new pay deal has not been reached since their last agreement ended in 2019.<br/>However, Transport Minister Huw Merriman said the pay of train drivers \"has gone up by 39% since 2011... the highest increase of any employment group.\"<br/>He is right about the 39% increase, but we have not been able to establish whether it's the highest increase for any employment group. That's because of changes to the way the figures have been released over the last decade.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents the 14 train companies, made an offer that would have seen rail workers receive a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022. It would then negotiate reforms ahead of a second year's pay rise with individual operators.<br/>On 5 May, RMT members voted to extend the strike mandate for another six months.  <br/>The Aslef union, meanwhile, has rejected a two-year offer which would see drivers get a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.<br/>Separately, a revised offer from Network Rail was accepted by RMT members on 20 March, ending that dispute. <br/>The union said the offer amounted to an uplift on salaries of between 14.4% for the lowest paid grades to 9.2% for the highest paid. <br/>Unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. <br/>How will the rail strikes affect your journey?

This was higher than the OBR forecast and \u00a35.6bn more than the same month last year.<br/>Overall, public sector net borrowing between April and June reached \u00a354.4bn - \u00a312.2bn ahead of the comparable period in 2022 but less than the \u00a361.9bn forecast by the OBR. <br/>Providing energy bill support was always going to bump-up public spending, while interest payments on the government's debt have increased too due to higher inflation and interest rates.<br/>But bigger tax receipts meant a smaller deficit in June than expected.<br/>Inflation has meant that there is an increasing number facing higher tax bills, given that the threshold at which different rates of income tax apply aren't being raised in line with the cost of living.<br/>Those receipts also reflect a more resilient economy than some reckoned. Separate official figures showed the volume of retail sales rising by 0.7% in June.<br/>Add in some revisions to earlier figures, and three months into the financial year the public finances appear on a better track than the official forecasts - leaving some to query if the chancellor may be able to afford modest pre-election tax cuts and meet his own self imposed rules.<br/>But it is early days.<br/>Persistent inflation and the risk of a slowdown in activity due to higher interest rates could yet to mean more pressures on the public purse in the months come.<br/>Figures from the ONS on Friday showed that retail sales rose by 0.7% last month.<br/>Department stores and furniture retailers said demand was boosted by good weather and summer discounts.<br/>How does government borrowing work?<br/>Warning public debt could soar as population ages<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

How can you be CEO of a company and not know this is going on?\" asked Warren, who says he was sexually harassed by his manager at a Hampshire restaurant when he was 16.<br/>\"He's either out of touch with reality or he's just saying this now because they've had this negative publicity.\"<br/>Emily, who says she was groped by her manager at a branch in the North West when she was 17, said she was sceptical about whether the new unit would make any difference.<br/>\"We've been let down time and time again,\" she said. \"I'm glad they're trying a new system but I'm not sure it's going to be any more effective than what they've already tried to do.\"<br/>A BBC investigation was told workers, some of them teenagers in their first jobs, are being groped and harassed almost routinely.<br/>Mr Macrow said: \"The unit will have oversight on all cases and the power to refer the most serious cases to a third-party legal team staffed by specialist investigators.<br/>\"The unit will be run by human resource and legal professionals full-time until at least the end of this year.\"<br/>More than 100 current and recent staff at UK outlets of McDonald's alleged that they worked in a toxic culture of sexual assault, harassment, racism and bullying. <br/>Since the BBC's report was published on Tuesday, more stories have surfaced, putting further pressure on McDonald's.<br/>As well as setting up the investigations unit, McDonald's is appointing external experts to independently examine how workers' claims are \"escalated\". This can mean looking at when and how complaints are passed to other departments or more senior managers.<br/>Many workers have alleged that their complaints were not escalated in an appropriate and timely way.<br/>Mr Macrow said he wanted to ensure people had the confidence to speak out. <br/>\"It is crucial that people feel safe and able to speak up,\" he said. \"Clearly this has not been the case in some parts of our business.\"<br/>Mr Macrow added: \"Any substantiated breaches of our code of conduct will be met with the most severe measures up to, and including, dismissal.\" <br/>Mr Macrow said the company had \"clearly fallen short\" in some key areas.<br/>\"I am determined to root out any behaviour or conduct that falls below the high standards of respect, safety and inclusion we demand of everyone at McDonald's,\" he added.<br/>Meanwhile, MPs have written to Mr Macrow demanding answers in the wake of the BBC's probe.<br/>Darren Jones, chair of the Business and Trade Committee, asked him what action the company takes to ensure that franchises comply with UK labour laws.<br/>Most workers are not directly employed by McDonald's because the company uses a franchise system. This means that individual operators are licensed to run the restaurants and employ the staff.<br/>Mr Jones also asked what processes are in place for McDonald's workers in the UK to raise complaints.<br/>McDonald's has until 11 August to respond to the letter.<br/>The fast-food chain is one of the biggest private sector employers in the UK. It has more than 170,000 people working in 1,450 restaurants.<br/>Mr Macrow also said he would assemble a panel of restaurant workers as an advisory group \"to help embed 'speak up' confidence throughout our business with special regard for our tens of thousands of younger employees\".<br/>Some of the names in this story have been changed to protect people's identities.<br/>Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

But the CMA found examples of retailers using grams and millilitres.<br/>The watchdog discovered a lack of transparency with missing or incorrectly calculated unit pricing information both in store and online. Examples include a 250ml bottle of handwash that was sold for \u00a31.19 but was mistakenly priced at \u00a3476.00 per 100ml.<br/>It also raised concerns about unit pricing information being too small to read and some retailers not displaying unit prices for any products on promotion.It added that some of the problems \"stem from the unit pricing rules themselves\", which fall under the Price Marking Order, saying the rules allowed \"unhelpful inconsistencies in retailers' practices and leave too much scope for interpretation\".<br/>Sue Davies, head of food policy at the consumer group Which?, said supermarkets must \"urgently act\" on the areas highlighted by the CMA.<br/>\"This includes the need to put unit pricing on promotions, such as on loyalty card offers and multi-buys, and make unit pricing clearer and more consistent,\" she said.<br/>She added that the the government must \"act swiftly on its promise to update pricing rules and close the loopholes that are allowing supermarkets to unnecessarily confuse shoppers\".<br/>While food price inflation remains at historically high levels - 17.3% in June - the watchdog said evidence it had collected indicated that competition issues had not been driving this.<br/>Ms Cardell told the BBC the CMA had found no evidence of profiteering on groceries, but said it was important to keep the market \"under review\" as the sector seeks to rebuild profits.<br/>It found that operating profits in the grocery sector fell by 41.5% in 2022-23, compared with the previous year, while average operating margins fell from 3.2% to 1.8%. <br/>This was due to retailers' costs increasing faster than their revenues, indicating that rising costs have not been passed on in full to consumers, the CMA said.<br/>It pointed to evidence that budget supermarkets Aldi and Lidl had gained market share, suggesting that supermarkets were \"restricted in their ability to raise prices without losing business\".<br/>However, it said that not everyone was able to benefit fully from strong competition, \"particularly those who cannot travel to large stores or shop online, and therefore may rely on higher-priced convenience stores\".<br/>The CMA said so far it had looked at competition overall between retailers but had not yet looked at individual product categories or across the wider grocery supply chain.<br/>It said it would now further analyse 10 product categories: baby formula, milk, bread, pet food, poultry, mayonnaise, baked beans, chilled desserts, ready meals, and lemonade. <br/>It added it did not have any provisional concerns that competition for these products was ineffective.<br/>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets and other retailers, said: \"Supermarkets have been working hard to support their customers through the cost of living crisis and will be reflecting on the CMA's recommendations on unit pricing. <br/>\"The CMA itself notes that 'many of these problems stem from the rules themselves', and retailers stand ready to support proposed changes to the unit pricing rules.\"<br/>The government said it welcomed the findings into competition and unit pricing, and said it would launch a consultation in the autumn on the Price Marking Order \"to make it work for consumers\".<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"It's reassuring that competition between supermarkets is working, but the CMA has my backing to look further into price rises for 10 everyday essentials.\"<br/>Read more tips here<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Sainsbury\u2019s boss denies profiting from high prices<br/>How a big yellow label influences what we buy<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Coutts, a private bank, is owned by the NatWest Group.<br/>In the letter to Mr Farage she said she believed \"very strongly that freedom of expression and access to banking are fundamental to our society and it is absolutely not our policy to exit a customer on the basis of legally held political and personal views\".<br/>Mr Farage had put in a request to the bank to see documents relating to the decision to close his Coutts account. <br/>The BBC had previously reported that it had been told that Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold required to hold an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.<br/>The 40-page document given to Mr Farage, published by the Daily Mail, included minutes from a meeting in November last year reviewing his suitability as a client.<br/>It stated continuing to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts's \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".<br/>It mentioned Mr Farage's retweet of a Ricky Gervais joke about trans women and his friendship with tennis player Novak Djokovic, who is opposed to Covid vaccinations. <br/>It gave several examples, including his comparing Black Lives Matter protesters to the Taliban, and his characterisation of the RNLI as a \"taxi-service\" for illegal immigrants, to flag concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\".<br/>On Thursday Dame Alison also reiterated her offer to Mr Farage of alternative banking arrangements with NatWest and said she wanted to ensure they provide \"a better, more transparent experience for all our customers in the future.\"<br/>Following her apology, Mr Farage was asked if he thought that she should now resign.<br/>\"I think what needs to happen is the Treasury select committee needs to reconvene, come out of recess, and let's give her the opportunity to tell us the truth,\" he told reporters.<br/>Mr Farage also said the Telegraph had reported how the BBC's business editor Simon Jack had sat next to Dame Alison at a dinner on 3 July and the next day he had then been called by Mr Jack and told \"the reason my bank account had been closed was that I had insufficient funds in the account.\"<br/>He said: \"I want to know, did Alison Rose breach my client confidentiality? Did she break GDPR rules?\"<br/>Parliament is now in recess until September.<br/>Asked whether it would reconvene in the meantime to discuss the issue, a spokesman for the Treasury Select Committee said it will be calling on \"relevant people as witnesses and keep our programme under constant review at our regular meetings\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Ros Atkins examines Nigel Farage and Coutts bank account closure dispute<br/>The apology to Mr Farage came after the Treasury announced plans to subject UK banks to stricter rules over closing customer accounts.<br/>Banks will have to explain why they are closing accounts and they will have to give a notice period of 90 days before closing an account, to allow people more time to appeal against the decision.<br/>The new rules are likely to be brought in after the summer, the BBC understands.<br/>The changes will not take away a bank's right to close accounts of people deemed to be a reputational or political risk.<br/>Instead, it will boost transparency for customers, the Treasury said.<br/>Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said: \"Banks occupy a privileged place in society and it is right that we fairly balance the rights of banks to act in their commercial interest with the right for everyone to express themselves freely.\"<br/>Dame Alison said she welcomed the plans and would implement the recommendations.<br/>The Treasury began looking at the issue in January after PayPal temporarily suspended several accounts last year.<br/>On Wednesday  Rishi Sunak warned it \"wouldn't be right if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech\".<br/>The bank boss caught up in the Nigel Farage row<br/>Banks face threat to licences over Farage account row<br/>Farage launches fresh attack over Coutts bank closure<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Previously this happened by giving you four conversation choices on screen, which is very limiting, it's only an illusion of choice. We want more than that.\" <br/>For Guy Gadney unlocking the potential of non-playable-characters will change how games tell stories, by allowing players to interact with what's in front of them differently to how they do it now. Charisma.ai is also working with companies like Warner, Dreamworks and Sky about how this technology might also work in other forms of storytelling. <br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>Dr Tommy Thompson, who also has a dedicated YouTube channel for AI in gaming, is excited about the potential of the technology. But he also warns that the industry needs to be cautious.<br/>He says using widely available, open access AI tools in their current form in games \"is not practical\" for studios. <br/>\"Who owns the copyright? With image generation for example, there's several ongoing lawsuits where people are asking if their art was used as the basis for image creation, and was appropriate consent given?<br/>\"If you're generating assets for your game using some AI platforms then you don't own any of that copyright on a legal basis. If you were to ship that game anyone could use those assets and put them in another game and there'd be zero legal basis to stop them. The law will say, 'well, actually you didn't own copyright.'\"<br/>Some games studios are creating their own AI platforms to get around these issues, but that is time-consuming and expensive. For small games companies who might be drawn to open source AI tools, the risks outweigh the benefits at the moment, according to Dr Thompson.<br/>\"I think it is important that we step back and look at the larger implications of this,\" he says.<br/>\"It is not something that's going to get solved overnight. That isn't to say that generative AI tools aren't being used internally in studios in new and really interesting ways, but I don't think it's going to be the Nirvana that people are imagining.\"<br/>In a statement to the BBC, Daniel Wood, UKIE co-CEO, said: \"The video games industry is always at the cutting edge of technology so we are already using AI in many areas including production, art, interaction with in-game characters and community management to create even more exciting and engaging experiences for our players.<br/>\"Whilst UKIE and the wider industry will continue to look at topics such as copyright and the fast-changing skills needs of games businesses, the future possibilities of AI promise a lot of exciting opportunities for our sector.\"<br/>For more gaming stories listen to Press X to Continue on BBC Sounds.<br/>Zelda: Why Nintendo's latest game is so important<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fifa no more?

The RDG continues to call on the union to give its members a vote on the offer.<br/>RMT boss Mick Lynch said \"there are conditions in this offer that we can't live with\", and ministers had not granted the operators permission to negotiate further.<br/>But RDG boss Jacqueline Starr said the existing \"very good\" offer remained on the table, and the RDG was \"very open to continuing conversations\".  <br/>She added that the industry \"can't afford for the industry to stand still\", and would \"continue with reform\".<br/>Train firms are pressing ahead with plans to close the majority of ticket offices in England. <br/>The plans have faced criticism from disability campaigners and unions which are trying to block the reforms. <br/>The Transport Focus watchdog called the response to its consultation, which is running until Wednesday 26 July, \"huge\" so far.<br/>However, it said it was too soon to say whether the responses were mostly for or against the proposed closures.<br/>Inside London, the consultation is being run by London Travelwatch.<br/>Five Labour mayors are preparing a legal challenge, saying the 21-day timescale for the consultation was  \"totally inadequate\".<br/>Under the proposals, some ticket kiosks would remain in large stations, but elsewhere staff will be on concourses to sell tickets, offer travel advice and help people with accessibility.<br/>However, Mr Lynch said that some stations would \"only get staff for two hours, so if you're an elderly person travelling off-peak, there will be no-one there to assist you\".<br/>He added that 2,300 station staff are \"not being moved from behind glass to assist passengers\" but instead would be made redundant \"en masse\".<br/>Last week, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle challenged rail minister Huw Merriman over the planned closures.<br/>Mr Merriman had said \"no currently staffed station will become unstaffed\" as a result of the proposals.<br/>But Mr Hoyle said the railway station in his constituency, Chorley, would effectively become unstaffed after 4pm.<br/>Ms Starr said on Wednesday that the planned closures were \"about people bringing people out from behind the glass screens\".<br/>Staff would be \"on the concourse, enabling a conversation with customers, enabling them to assist customers, have a dialogue, and also, when necessary, helping customers to navigate the ticket vending machines which would be on the platform,\" she said.<br/>Ms Starr insisted the industry was \"genuinely listening to the accessibility groups that have a number of concerns\", and she was having meetings with the rail minister and disability groups.<br/>When asked by the BBC on Wednesday if she would promise that every ticket currently available at ticket offices could be found on at a machine or online, including the least expensive, Ms Starr replied: \"I'm not going to make promises that I can't keep.\"<br/>She added: \"We are working hard to ensure that where possible, every ticket is offered by a ticket vending machine\".<br/>Campaigner Natasha Winter, who set up the Save Stourbridge Ticket Office group, said when she found out about the consultation on the ticket office closures she was \"absolutely outraged\".<br/>\"We're talking about punishing and penalising the members of society who maybe can't use new technology,\" she said.<br/>\"The station is going to become less user-friendly for the whole community,\" she added. <br/>Trains strikes: When are they and why are they taking place?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He said the company was committed to reaching an \"equitable\" agreement that helped the industry move into the future. <br/>But he added: \"We've got a lot of work to do.\"<br/>Netflix has been wrestling with a sharp slowdown in growth since the pandemic, as competition heats up, households grapple with rising costs and it reaches what analysts see as saturation point in some of its biggest markets.<br/>In the first half of last year, it shed roughly 1 million accounts. Though it later more than made up those losses, the declines jolted the company and sent it scrambling to shore up its growth prospects. <br/>Netflix said customers were enticed by new options it has introduced that cost less than a standard subscription.<br/>The company introduced its \"paid sharing\" programme in the UK, US and other major markets in May, charging an extra fee if users want to share passwords with people outside their households.<br/>In the UK, it asks a little less than half of the \u00a310.99 cost of a standard subscription.<br/>The programme is now present in more than 100 countries. <br/>The company also launched a less expensive streaming plan with ads last year and cut prices in dozens of countries in February. <br/>Netflix said few people had cancelled as a result of the password changes and it believed the programme would fuel similar subscriber gains in the months ahead. <br/>It has estimated that more than 100 million households share passwords in breach of its official rules.<br/>\"While we're still in the early stages, we're seeing healthy conversion of borrower households,\" the company said in a quarterly update to investors. \"Now that we've launched paid sharing broadly we have increased confidence in our financial outlook.\"<br/>Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the subscriber gains were robust and a \"strong endorsement\" of Netflix's strategy.<br/>But he called the password crackdown a short-term measure, saying the company would need to fine-tune its pricing in the months ahead.<br/>\"The company is still in a far stronger position compared to rivals and remains the benchmark,\" he said, noting that Netflix's streaming plan with advertising is much cheaper than many current offerings from rivals.<br/>Analysts said the company's big library and the scale of its international production may help it in the months ahead, as Hollywood wrestles with the impact of the strikes. <br/>These have already disrupted production schedules for a number of films and series. <br/>\"Of everyone in the entertainment industry, Netflix appears to be the best positioned,\" said Brandon Katz, entertainment industry strategist at Parrot Analytics, which tracks streaming demand, noting that the company still leads its peers, despite strong competition.<br/>Despite the subscriber gains, the $8.18bn (\u00a36.32bn) in revenue Netflix reported disappointed investors, rising just 2.7% from last year. Profits were $1.49bn.  <br/>Netflix said that it has limited its price hikes in recent months, leading to a slowdown in revenue growth that gains from its password crackdown and new advertising were not big enough to offset.  <br/>It said it expected that to change by the end of this year, as advertising revenue increases. <br/>It has stopped offering its least expensive commercial-free plan in the US, UK and Canada in a bid to push price-conscious customers to the ad-funded version. <br/>Membership of its ads plan \"nearly doubled\" from March - though from a \"small base\", the company said.<br/>\"Netflix needs to squeeze as much juice as it can from different avenues, given a recent lack of price increases could suggest that inflation is starting to bite Netflix's ability to crank up its subscription price, as households look to trim their spending,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.<br/>\"Initial progress seems positive, but we are realms away from knowing for sure if this venture is the cash cow it's been sold as.\"<br/>Shares, which have surged 60% this year amid investor enthusiasm for the company's plans, dipped in after-hours trade. <br/>Ms Lund-Yates said the company had delivered a \"sturdy\" performance and the fall reflected the high expectations for the company.<br/>What happens next as Hollywood grinds to a halt<br/>Hollywood strike could last until end of the year<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He has also made lots of controversial comments, and when you have a bit of loose cannon like that, they could bring you into disrepute, even though it's not intentional.<br/>\"That risk has to be very closely managed because it might come with a financial cost. If the returns on the account do not justify the costs, then the bank will see no point in carrying on the relationship.\" <br/>The report stated that Coutts had been happy to carry on banking Mr Farage while he had a mortgage with them, but once he had paid it off they planned to terminate the relationship.<br/>However, Angela Knight, former chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, told the BBC's Today programme she found what had happened to the firmer United Kingdom Independence Party leader \"somewhat uncomfortable\".<br/>\"It is somewhat uncomfortable to see a situation arise where because of somebody's legitimate views, even though you don't agree with them, it somehow has resulted in a service being withdrawn and they are not being told about it.\"<br/>She added: \"In this instance what seems to have happened is nothing was really said to the individual concerned and then when they put in an application [to the bank to see the evidence] they suddenly find that there's a whole series of reasons which seems to centre around what they have said.\" <br/>On Thursday Mr Farage welcomed reports of a government crackdown, saying closing bank accounts for political reasons could stop people from going into public life.<br/>\"Refusal to open [accounts] and closures have happened to several members of my family... Which is perhaps, above all, what has made me angry, really angry and motivated me to [speak out].\"<br/>On Wednesdday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that shutting someone's account over their views was \"wrong\", calling free speech the \"cornerstone of our democracy\". <br/>Meanwhile, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said elsewhere that the Coutts row \"exposes the sinister nature of much of the diversity, equity and inclusion industry\".<br/>The BBC had previously reported Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold needed for an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.<br/>The former politician accused the broadcaster of falling for \"spin\" and restated that he had been targeted for his political views.<br/>He cited the report by the bank's reputational risk committee which states that the Brexiteer's views did not \"align with our values\".<br/>\"Apparently, I'm a risk to them. I have virtually no links of any kind to Russia whatsoever. This is political. There is no other way of looking at it,\" he said.<br/>He later told BBC Newsnight he was \"literally shocked\" when he saw the report, which he described as a \"personal hit job\". \"This bank is behaving now like a political campaigning organisation,\" he said.<br/>Coutts has said it has offered Mr Farage an alternative account at its sister bank, NatWest and the offer still stands. <br/>Anyone concerned that they have not been treated fairly by their bank can appeal to the Financial Ombudsman Service.<br/>City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is also talking to NatWest about the handling of Mr Farage's accounts, its boss told MPs on Wednesday.<br/>Nikhil Rathi said that current rules made clear banks should not discriminate on the basis of political views.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Farage launches fresh attack over Coutts bank closure<br/>Farage: Coutts file 'shows account shut over my views'<br/>Bank account closures probe 'must be fast tracked'<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

AI is helping us see things in this data faster.\"<br/>She said this meant drug and vaccine discovery and development should become \"more predictive and improve our probability of success\".<br/>And she said that could mean better health outcomes for hundreds of millions of people. <br/>\"One in three of us is going to be battling with dementia, there are still many cancers that don't have have solutions, infectious diseases are still causing one in six deaths in the world,\" she said.<br/>There was \"no doubt\" that AI would \"help us unlock better solutions to these challenges\", she said. \"And that's got to be something worth investing in with optimism whilst regulating responsibly.\" <br/>Ms Walmsley thinks improving productivity through the use of AI will create more jobs and \"change some jobs quite meaningfully\". <br/>\"I think some will need maybe some less headcount on but there'll be other spaces where we need a lot more,\" she said.<br/>It is sometimes assumed that the creative arts will be the least affected by AI as machine learning will struggle to replicate human creativity. <br/>But that's wrong according to actress and voice over artist Laurence Bouvard who said that AI is being used to sample, analyse and replicate human voices without paying the original artist. <br/>\"When we do a job, in order to get paid, we have to sign away all our rights,\" she said. \"And these AI companies are just taking it without asking who it belongs to.\"<br/>She said AI was a particular threat to the \"army\" of lesser known artists who voice cartoons, video games, dictionaries and other audio work who could see their careers totally destroyed. <br/>\"A writer and an artist and a photographer, even if their work is stolen, they can create new work. If my voice is stolen, if my career is over,\" she said.<br/>AI has great power and is already changing industries and the work place. Last week the OECD said the world was \"on the cusp of an AI revolution\". <br/>The Paris-based body said: \"Urgent action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy way in the workplace.\"<br/>With great power comes great responsibility - and it is not yet clear in the UK or internationally - who will or who should take on that responsibility.<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"AI is set to fuel growth and create new highly-paid jobs throughout the UK, while allowing us to carry out our existing jobs more efficiently and safely. <br/>\"That is why we are working with businesses and regulators to ensure AI is used safely and responsibility in business settings.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Why some celebrities are embracing AI deepfakes<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

I have virtually no links of any kind to Russia whatsoever. This is political. There is no other way of looking at it,\" he said.  <br/>The document also gave examples of Mr Farage's views, including his retweet of a Ricky Gervais joke about trans women and his friendship with tennis player Novak Djokovic, who is opposed to Covid vaccinations, to flag concerns that Mr Farage is \"xenophobic and racist\".<br/>He said the 40-page document shows that in November 2022, Coutts' reputational risk committee \"met and said, I did not align with their values, that somehow I wasn't part of their diversity and inclusion agenda and that for those reasons there should be a glide path to closing my account\".<br/>The document - which the BBC does not have a copy of - makes disclosures including:<br/>Mr Farage said the report stated \"very clearly\" that he had met the bank's commercial criteria.<br/>\"For them to try subsequently to pretend that it's for commercial reasons just is not true.\"<br/>He later told BBC Newsnight he was \"literally shocked\" when he saw the report, which he described as a \"personal hit job\". \"This bank is behaving now like a political campaigning organisation,\" he said.<br/>Economist Frances Coppola told the same programme that \"having read the report, I actually don't think that's the reason why they closed his account. The report makes it clear that the reason they closed the account was that Nigel paid off his mortgage and the house was released as a security and that brought him below the criteria for an account at that bank.\"<br/>The bank, owned by NatWest, says customers must borrow or invest \u00a31m or have \u00a33m in savings. Mr Farage previously did not dispute that he did not meet Coutts' threshold but said the bank had not had a problem with this for the past 10 years.<br/>Coutts said on Wednesday it recognised \"the substantial interest\" in Mr Farage's case.<br/>\"We cannot comment on the detail given our customer confidentiality obligations. However, it is not Coutts' policy to close customer accounts solely on the basis of legally held political and personal views. Decisions to close an account are not taken lightly and involve a number of factors including commercial viability, reputational considerations, and legal and regulatory requirements.<br/>\"We recognise the critical importance of access to banking. When it became clear that our client was unable to secure banking facilities elsewhere, and as he has confirmed publicly, he was offered alternative banking facilities with NatWest. That offer stands,\" it added.<br/>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was discussing the situation with NatWest.<br/>FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi told MPs: \"You'd expect that we are talking to NatWest Group about this.<br/>\"A specific adjudication on an individual case is a matter for the Financial Ombudsman Service.\"<br/>He told the Treasury Select Committee: \"If a complaint is made and it is determined that there has not been an appropriate consideration of this case, that would then of course be relevant for us from a supervisory perspective.\"<br/>The BBC's previous report, published at the start of July, cited people familiar with Coutts' decision to shut his account as saying it was a \"commercial decision\".<br/>On Wednesday Mr Farage called for the BBC to apologise for its previous reporting, and said he would be making a complaint.<br/>At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday former Brexit secretary David Davis accused the bank of lying about the \"commercial viability\" of Mr Farage's account in anonymous briefings to the BBC.<br/>Separately, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, called for an inquiry into what happened to the Coutts bank account.<br/>Mr Sunak's press secretary said after PMQs it would be \"incredibly concerning and wrong\" if Mr Farage's account was closed due to his political opinions.<br/>\"No-one should be barred from bank services for their political views,\" she said.<br/>Meanwhile, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said elsewhere that this \"exposes the sinister nature of much of the diversity, equity and inclusion industry\". <br/>\"NatWest and other corporates who have naively adopted this politically biased dogma need a major rethink.\"<br/>A HM Treasury spokesperson said: \"It would be of serious concern if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech. <br/>\"We will soon set out plans to crack down on this practice by toughening the rules around account closures, protecting freedom of expression.<br/>\"In the meantime, people can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service which has the power to direct a bank to reopen an account.\"<br/>The government since January has been taking evidence on how private companies' right to commercial independence is balanced with individuals' rights to freedom of expression.<br/>Government insiders have told the BBC the government's view is that the balance has \"tipped\" too far in companies' favour. <br/>Coutts said: \"We understand the public concern that the processes for ending a customer relationship, and how that is communicated, are not sufficiently transparent.\"<br/>The bank added that it welcomed the Treasury plans to prioritise the review of the regulatory rules relating to politically exposed persons. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Farage: Coutts file 'shows account shut over my views'<br/>Bank account closures probe 'must be fast tracked'<br/>Farage account shut for falling below wealth limit<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

So all of that is air pollution, whether it smells good or bad,\" she says.<br/>\"Indoor air pollution is huge, and it's a relatively unknown frontier, because even my next-door neighbour's house has a different air pollution fingerprint than my house would have,\" Dr Hicks says.<br/>Indoor air pollution is highly complex, little regulated, and often beyond individual control. For instance, road traffic produces nitrogen dioxide, while moisture and structural issues in buildings can lead to mould.<br/>Air purifiers with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can help. But the initial cost plus the energy to run them can be out of reach for some households.<br/>This is one reason that it's so appealing to think of potted plants as passively, and inexpensively, cleaning the air. Essentially, plant leaves take in carbon dioxide and other pollutants, which are then used in various plant processes or broken down.<br/>Especially important here are the community of micro-organisms and the growing medium (such as soil or compost), which in many studies do more to absorb pollutants than the plant itself. <br/>An influential NASA study from 1989 found that indoor plants could remove formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air. But the study was unrealistic for real-world conditions.<br/>In essence, an indoor forest would be required to meaningfully reduce VOCs in a home. <br/>\"You need an awful lot of plants in very well-lit space to make any measurable impact on the removal of VOCs and many other gases,\" says Tijana Blanusa, the principal horticultural scientist for the Royal Horticultural Society, as well as a researcher at the University of Reading.<br/>Similarly, for carbon dioxide, \"you need very large numbers of plants to actually have measurable effects at room scale.\"<br/>So is scaling-up the answer?<br/>Some researchers, including Tijana Blanusa, have moved on from individual potted plants to active (living) green walls, which can concentrate more plants and also filter air more efficiently due to the way air can be moved through them.<br/>She explains that with active green walls: \"Air from the room is being pushed or encouraged through the root systems over and above the level which would happen naturally if you just had the plants sitting in a pot.\"<br/>However, such green walls are expensive to install and maintain.<br/>So people continue to experiment with plants.<br/>When building consultancy Cundall moved into their current London office in 2015, they filled one of the meeting rooms, known as the Green Lab, with plants.<br/>The aim was to monitor and record the plants' impact on indoor air quality. But it was challenging to look after them all.<br/>It also became clear that the plants weren't having the same effect on air quality as the mechanical ventilation and air purification systems.<br/>The room now has a few large plants in the corners, as well as a small rectangle of preserved reindeer moss on the wall. The spongy moss is lovely to touch and look at, but has no ability to absorb pollutants.<br/>When clients ask about plants for improving air quality, Kavita Kumari, the associate director of Cundall's London office, advises them on plants' advantages and limitations.<br/>She recommends plants that are relatively low-maintenance while being able to reduce some VOCs and produce oxygen, though she acknowledges that these effects are modest.<br/>One such plant is the snake plant (a common houseplant also sometimes known by the sexist moniker mother-in-law's tongue, due to its sharp shape).<br/>Ms Kumari says that while most plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the day, this plant\u202fis able to do so at night as well.<br/>She says that simply opening a window to allow the outflow of indoor air pollutants doesn't work in highly built-up areas, where outdoor pollutants can enter at the same time.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Scientists are working on a new generation of plants bioengineered to make them especially efficient at purifying air.<br/>Researchers at the University of Washington have genetically modified pothos plants with a synthetic version of a \"green liver\" protein found in rabbits, which can process chloroform and benzene.<br/>The company Neoplants has also tweaked genes in pothos plants to enable them to essentially recycle certain VOCs. As well, the company has produced beneficial bacteria that are especially effective at breaking down VOCs, which are delivered to the plants' root systems. It's this microbiome rather than the plant itself that produces most of the plants' air-cleaning effects.<br/>However, even improving on the NASA results 30-fold, as Neoplants claims to do, wouldn't make it feasible to rely on plants alone to clean the air. <br/>So for now, the actual air-purification benefits of indoor plants are limited. They can't compete with air purifiers.<br/>But plants have other clear benefits - for instance on mood, creativity and productivity.<br/>Ms Kumari advises clients on complying with the targets set out by the WELL Building Standard, a certification for buildings that promotes health and wellbeing. One of these targets is to have 1% of the indoor surface covered by plants.<br/>This target falls under the \"Mind\" category rather than \"Air\", suggesting that evidence of the benefits of indoor plants is stronger for the mental health benefits than the air quality ones. As Ms Kumari comments, \"plants do give you a sense of calm.\"<br/>Ultimately, air-quality experts remain in favour of indoor plants.

Clean air campaigners support it. <br/>However, some residents, businesses and politicians have expressed serious concerns. They include the financial impact during a cost of living squeeze, and the nine month-long notice period.<br/>Some people affected say the scrappage scheme won't help them. The cost of second-hand Ulez-compliant cars has also risen.<br/>Five Conservative-run councils launched legal action over the decision to expand Ulez. There have also been public protests.<br/>The mayor has defended the plan, arguing it is necessary to help prevent health conditions related to air pollution and even excess deaths. Preparations such as installing cameras have continued.<br/>The number of older polluting vehicles that have entered the Ulez has fallen dramatically with 97% now meeting the cleaner standards. <br/>Within that area it is estimated that NOx emissions have fallen by 26% since 2019 with PM2.5 emissions falling by 19% over the same period.  <br/>Air quality has improved as a result but all Londoners still live in areas exceeding World Health Organization guidelines for both pollutants.<br/>There are low emission zones in a number of European countries, and they vary by vehicle type and emissions.<br/>Italy has the most zones in Europe - some of them permanent, many seasonal - followed by Germany, according to the Urban Access Regulations website.<br/>In Paris, a zero emission zone is planned for 2030.<br/>Khan backs Ulez after Starmer by-election criticism<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

She was named to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's new business council just days ago.<br/>It was after she led this review that rumours started circulating that she would become the boss of the then RBS-group. <br/>As boss at NatWest, she has drawn headlines for changes, such as granting up to a year of leave to new fathers and ending new loans to oil and gas companies.<br/>She was named a Dame Commander of the British Empire by King Charles III at the start of this year.<br/>NatWest boss gets \u00a35m payout as profits soar<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

It meant that if prices were low, the companies would get a subsidy. If prices rise, the gains must be paid back.<br/>But Vattenfall said it had seen its costs, driven by inflation, supply issues and rising wages, soar by 40%.<br/>The money the government had agreed to pay them, the firm said, would not cover these increased costs.<br/>Chief executive Anna Borg said: \"Conditions are extremely challenging across the whole industry right now, with a supply chain squeeze, increasing prices and cost of capital, and fiscal frameworks not reflecting current market realities.\"<br/>The company said two other Norfolk sites - known as Vanguard East and Vanguard West - will be reviewed.<br/>Vattenfall said it remained committed to the region and was \"evaluating the best way forward for all three projects in the Norfolk Zone\".<br/>\"We have attractive wind power projects in the pipeline, and investment decisions will always be based on profitability,\" the company said.<br/>Norfolk County Council said while it was \"naturally disappointed\" the development had been \"paused\" the company had \"reassured\" it the rest of the Norfolk offshore plan would still go ahead.<br/>A spokesman said it remained \"optimistic\" about the future.<br/>Robert Bush, from the East of England Energy Group, said the impact \"will be felt on the local supply chain\" which includes about 1,000 companies.<br/>\"They have other projects to work on but this will be felt,\" he said.<br/>Orbis Energy, a Lowestoft-based clean energy hub for about 40 businesses, said the decision was \"disappointing\" but claimed there were \"opportunities and solutions that can bring it back on track\".<br/>Business development manager, Ian Pease, said the government needed to support developers.<br/>He said it was \"not just about subsidies\" but about how we can \"work smartly and reduce costs\" in order \"to make it the most cost-effective region for offshore wind in the world\".  <br/>Professor Aled Jones, director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, said rising costs meant the \"government needs to consider what role the private sector has in powering the future of Britain\".<br/>He said while renewable energy offered \"significant returns on investment\" those returns came over periods of time longer than the private sector is \"currently willing to tolerate\".<br/>\"The case for a UK-led renewable energy developer, backed by the UK public which can benefit from the returns over the next few decades, has just become stronger,\" he said.<br/>Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the government needed to take account of rising costs when awarding contracts.<br/>\"If the government gets the policy wrong on the current round of renewables auctions and doesn't keep pace with increasing costs,\" he said, \"the UK could end up even more reliant on foreign gas, leaving households on the hook with higher bills.\"<br/>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said CfDs offered developers burdened with high initial costs \"direct protection from volatile wholesale prices\".<br/>A government spokesman said: \"We understand there are supply chain pressures for the sector globally, not just in the UK, and we are listening to companies' concerns.\"<br/>Duncan Baker, Conservative MP for North Norfolk, said one of the reasons construction costs were high was the lack of a shared offshore ring main, which meant windfarms needed to run separate cables to onshore substations.<br/>\"The system and infrastructure for delivery is completely outdated, we have been saying this for many years and now it's come back to bite us,\" he said.<br/>George Freeman, MP for Mid Norfolk, said he was \"not too worried\" it would undermine the government's long term commitment to net zero.<br/>The Conservative MP for Waveney in North Suffolk, Peter Aldous, said there was \"a concern that the CfD mechanism\" needed to be reviewed. <br/>\"I think this can be resolved... I think all roads lead to the chancellor's autumn statement,\" he said.<br/>Among MPs, councillors and industry experts there is real disappointment.<br/>There is also frustration because I'm told that in private, the energy companies have been telling local MPs and ministers about their concerns for some time. High inflation, supply shortages and rising wages made it inevitable that an energy company would reconsider its plans.  Among MPs there's a feeling the government will have to come up with more money (which will probably end up on our electricity bills) and reform its contract with the energy companies. <br/>But I'm told there are other grumbles too: windfall taxes, delays in granting planning permission and public anger over pylons which one MP claims, makes energy companies feel unwelcome. <br/>The onshore work is still going ahead. There is a feeling that this will be resolved \"because there is no alternative\" as one expert put it. <br/>But this is a delay which the industry and arguably our climate could have done without.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

In fact, she signed up for it.<br/>\"It's a bit like that Black Mirror episode with Salma Hayek,\" Ms Yeo jokes.<br/>She was speaking to the BBC the day after the release of the new series of Charlie Brooker's Netflix show. In the first episode, actress Salma Hayek, playing a fictionalised version of herself, signs away her image to a production company.<br/>The deal allows it to use an artificial intelligence or AI-generated deepfake version of the Hollywood A-lister to \"star\" in their new TV drama. What she says and does in the show is controlled by the computer.<br/>The consequences for Ms Hayek - without spoiling the story - are not good.<br/>Concerns about the impact of AI are partly behind the first Hollywood actors' strike in more than four decades, bringing the US movie and television business to a halt.<br/>It comes after Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against the misuse of AI for its members.<br/>The actors' union has warned that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" as it prepared to dig in over the issue.<br/>However, Ms Yeo is not worried. She is one of a growing number of celebrities embracing AI-generated advertising.<br/>The new technology is being met with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Singapore celeb Jamie Yeo has embraced AI deepfakes<br/>Ms Yeo has just agreed a deal with financial technology firm Hugosave, which allows it to use a digitally manipulated likeness of her to sell their content.<br/>The process is fairly simple. She spends a couple of hours in front of a green screen to capture her face and movements, then a couple more hours in a recording studio to capture her voice.<br/>An AI programme then synchronises the images with the audio to create a digital alter-ego capable of saying practically anything. The results are uncanny.<br/>\"I do understand the concern, but this technology is here to stay,\" she says. \"So even if you don't embrace it because you're scared, there will be other people who will embrace it.\"<br/>Some already have. As part of his deal with PepsiCo, superstar footballer Lionel Messi allowed it to use a deepfake version of himself to advertise Lay's crisps.<br/>Not only can online users create personalised video messages from \"Lionel Messi\", they can get him to say it in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish.<br/>Fellow football superstar David Beckham and Hollywood legend Bruce Willis have also dabbled with deepfake technology - though, unlike Ms Yeo, they have so far stopped short of signing away full image rights.<br/>\"I think deepfakes will just become part of normal practice in the advertising industry over the next few years,\" says Dr Kirk Plangger, a marketing expert at King's College London.<br/>\"It opens the door to all kinds of creative options. They're able to micro-target consumers and are often extremely persuasive.\"<br/>The efficiency of the process also makes it attractive from a commercial point of view.<br/>\"You're not doing that much work for the money you're charging,\" Ms Yeo says.<br/>\"It's also good for the client on a budget because they get so much more content than from a normal shoot. So it works for everyone.\" <br/>The client - in this case Singapore-based Hugosave - agrees. <br/>\"Having this technology available means we can literally produce hundreds of videos in a matter of days. Compare that to the months, if not years, that we'd need if we were filming the content in the traditional way,\" says Braham Djidjelli, Hugosave's co-founder and chief product officer.<br/>\"We're able to leverage the benefit of AI while also retaining the human touch of a trusted local face - in this case Jamie's.\"<br/>But, as analysts such as Dr Plangger point out, there is a \"dark side\" to the technology. <br/>\"It's not something we can put back into the box,\" he says. \"The advertising industry needs to wake up to the risks as well as the possibilities of artificial intelligence. It means stepping back, as a society, and thinking about what is the proper or ethical use of this technology.\"<br/>One of the things Dr Plangger is referring to is a looming \"crisis of trust\", where consumers cannot tell between what is real or fake. This is something already being exploited by vested interests online and can range from synthetically manipulated pornography to misinformation to political messaging.<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>But there are also more practical risks for the talent voluntarily signing up to be deepfaked. Currently, there are no clear laws relating to AI to ensure your image is properly protected.<br/>For example, what happens if a brand uses your digital avatar to endorse a product that may damage your image or your alter-ego makes a joke in poor taste?<br/>\"We are in uncharted territory when it comes to AI and deepfake technology,\" says Tng Sheng Rong, an intellectual property lawyer at Rajah and Tann in Singapore. <br/>\"Many, many issues can arise. Who owns the intellectual property? Who do you go to for legal recourse? The truth of the matter is that the existing laws don't provide a robust enough regulatory framework to guard against these issues.\"<br/>That may be the final hurdle for advertisers before they start buying rights to digital versions of Hollywood A-listers, for example.<br/>At this early stage, Ms Yeo says she is very mindful of the risks, but her decision was informed mainly by trust - both in Hugosave and in the way business is done in Singapore.<br/>But ultimately, she says, it is about staying ahead of the curve.<br/>\"If you want to still be in the game, then you've got to learn how to be in it. Because if you don't, you should probably just retire.\"<br/>Additional reporting by BBC business reporter Annabelle Liang.<br/>The Black Mirror plot about AI that worries actors<br/>Students switch to AI to learn languages<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>AI 'godfather' says it won't destroy jobs forever<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Big tech was going to supercharge agriculture, one of the oldest industries in the world, and the revolution would start with salad leaves.<br/>Warehouse-grown greens, flourishing in trays neatly stacked beneath row upon row of glowing LEDs. It was lettuce - but sci-fi.<br/>US-based AeroFarms considered itself to be one of the leaders in the industry.<br/>\"We are so far above everybody else in this technology,\" AeroFarms' chief executive David Rosenberg boasted to the New Yorker in 2017. \"It will take years for the rest of the world to catch up.\"<br/>Hard times caught up with AeroFarms instead. In June, the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Mr Rosenberg stepped down.<br/>It is all part of a \"reset\" or \"pivot\", insists co-founder and chief marketing officer Marc Oshima: \"We're growing product every day, we're shipping product every day.\"<br/>But lately, AeroFarms has struggled to find enough capital to fuel its soaring ambition. \"The money just has not been there,\" admits Mr Oshima, though he adds that the firm still has some investors who are supplying \"millions of dollars\". <br/>AeroFarms famously designed its own indoor growing systems. \"We think it has served us well, we have unique technology,\" adds Mr Oshima.<br/>When asked whether initiatives, such as one targeting low income communities in Jersey City, New Jersey, will continue, he adds that these are currently \"being evaluated\".<br/>A spokeswoman for Jersey City says, \"We do not anticipate our operations to be interrupted in any way.\"<br/>A long list of other vertical farms have run into trouble in recent months.<br/>French firm Agricool went into receivership earlier this year, Pennsylvania-based Fifth Season shut down in late 2022, Iron Ox of California has laid off nearly half its workforce and Infarm has closed its operations in Europe - making 500 staff redundant.<br/>\"Infarm has decided to shift its geographical focus from Europe to high-potential regions better suited for indoor farming, with low energy prices and healthy market demand,\" the company says in a statement.<br/>Besides the major economic challenges that have hampered many industries during the last few years, within vertical farming a debate rages over the extent to which some companies may have set themselves up for a fall.<br/>\"My opinion is that we'll continue to see failures. It is bad,\" says Andrew Lloyd, chief operating officer at Intelligent Growth Solutions, which makes equipment for vertical farms. \"Many people are growing the wrong crops, they're very heavily focused on leafy greens.\"<br/>He also argues that some have foolishly attempted to design and build their own technology - such as robots that tend to the baby plants as they develop. <br/>That might sound like too easy a riposte for someone who sells such technology himself but Mr Lloyd does make a good point, says Mark Lefsrud at McGill University in Canada, who consults for the industry.<br/>\"I've seen to the extreme where one company redeveloped their own pipe,\" he says. \"Literally just a plastic pipe to transfer water through.<br/>\"I was like, 'I think the pipe has been developed'.\"<br/>What people don't often hear about vertical farming, though, is how an ability to care for plants, regardless of what technology you use, really matters, adds Mr Lefsrud.<br/>He says he has occasionally been called in by firms fretting over copious trays of crops that have started to die.<br/>\"You need somebody who's going to be full-time,\" he has told them, explaining that farming means giving constant attention to living things - not just firing up a few gadgets and waiting for the profits to roll in argues Mr Lefsrud.<br/>\"You have to be growing them properly all the time. You can't go, 'I'm not gonna work this weekend because I want to have a party' - and all the plants die on you. Which I've seen repetitively,\" he says.<br/>The industry has been blighted by \"hubris\", argues Chris Davies, chief executive and founder of Harvest London, which plans to open a new vertical farm in Beddington next year. The firm grows salad for companies including HSBC and Google.<br/>Mr Davies says he and his colleagues are trying to be cautious. For one thing, their new facility will be built near to a power-generating waste incinerator so that they can take advantage of cheap energy when it is available.<br/>\"Let's say we know that an hour from now power pricing is going to go up, we can just turn out the lights,\" he says. <br/>The firm has also successfully grown tomatoes, cucumbers and strawberries at a small scale and hopes to diversify its product line in the near future with these potentially higher value crops.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>It can be tricky to expand beyond growing just a few varieties of easy leafy greens, says David Meszaros, founder of Smartkas, a Dutch agricultural technology firm that owns the largest vertical farm in the UK - a 27,000 sq m facility in Harlow, Essex dedicated to growing strawberries.<br/>Dr Meszaros stresses that Smartkas operates a range of growing environments, including greenhouses, meaning the firm has not put all its eggs in the vertical farming basket alone. <br/>His company has still faced plenty of headaches lately, though. \"The big challenge came with the chip shortage,\" says Dr Meszaros, explaining how growing at one newly built facility was delayed by many months because Smartkas could not obtain the chips it required for the safety systems in robots tasked with moving around trays of plants.<br/>Without those chips, the robots would not have been able to detect collisions in the warehouse or dangerous levels of water or humidity, for example. <br/>Despite pitfalls, vertical farming still has a future, say many observers - even those who are critical of some business models. <br/>Growing more food indoors, and in urban places, is a matter of \"security\" says Paul Myers, managing director at Farm Urban, which is based in Liverpool. He mentions the veg shortage that hit British supermarkets earlier this year.<br/>\"What that highlights is that, actually, the UK should be investing in long-term solutions,\" he says.<br/>Britain is \"exposed\" to supply issues, agrees Jessica Davies at Lancaster University. She and colleagues published a study last year that suggested urban farming, including vertical farming, could boost agricultural production.<br/>For Mark Lefsrud, the vertical farming businesses falling by the wayside do not represent a death knell.

Sri Lanka had to go back to pandemic-era measures such as online classes and working from home. But even this was not practical because of power cuts - some of which went on for up to 13 hours a day.<br/>Food, medicine and other essentials were also in short supply, exacerbating the crisis. People had to stand in such long queues in the brutal heat, that at least 16 people - mainly the elderly - died.<br/>But now, just a year later, food, fuel and medicine are available again, offices, schools and factories are all open, and public transport is back up and running.<br/>Restaurants, especially high-end ones, are bustling.<br/>\"Last year this time I was on the verge of selling my restaurant. We had to close for a few days as the shortage of fuel meant no customers were coming. But now footfall has gone up nearly 70%,\" said Chathura Ekanayake who runs a fine dining restaurant in Colombo.<br/>The country's main source of foreign currencies - tourism - is also witnessing a revival. The industry has recorded a 30% jump in revenue from the previous year.<br/>\"The recovery has been magical for us. Last year we didn't even know if the country would survive\", said Hiran Cooray, CEO of Jetwings Symphony, a leading travel and hospitality player in Sri Lanka.<br/>Despite these good news stories, Sri Lanka's economy is still in a precarious place.<br/>The country still has more than $80bn (\u00a361.1bn) of debt - both foreign and domestic. In the worst of the crisis last year, the country defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in its history.<br/>Ranil Wickremesinghe who took charge as President after widespread protests saw then-ruler Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign, has managed to secure a lifeline of $2.9bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).<br/>This has been crucial to opening other funding channels and easing shortages, but the money came with strict economic and governance policy reforms. The country is now seeking to restructure terms of its debt payments with both foreign and domestic lenders, as mandated by the IMF.<br/>The main focus has been on restructuring its $36bn of foreign debt. This includes more than $7bn of loans from China, Sri Lanka's largest bilateral creditor.<br/>However, it is the restructuring of domestic debt that is likely to have a much bigger impact on the Sri Lankan people. Domestic borrowing accounts for around 50% of the country's total debt. Sri Lanka's cabinet recently approved a domestic debt restructuring proposal, but it has drawn massive criticism as it aims to cut workers' pensions, while banks will not be affected. There have been protests against the proposals in Colombo.<br/>It highlights that while life may seem to have returned to normal, in reality people are still struggling.<br/>Essentials are available, but unaffordable for many. Things are more expensive than ever before. Almost half of all Sri Lankan families spend about 70% of their household income on food alone. And prices of food, clothing and housing are continuing to rise.<br/>To add to the burden, income tax has been hiked to as much as 36% and subsidies on everything from food to household bills have been removed.<br/>One area where this has had a huge impact is electricity bills, which have soared by 65% after the subsidy was removed.<br/>\"Many families from the middle class have now slipped below the poverty line,\" said Malathy Knight, a senior economist with private think tank Verite Research.<br/>And according to the World Bank, this is likely to continue for a while.<br/>\"Poverty is projected to remain above 25% in the next few years due to the multiple risks to households' livelihoods,\" it said in a report. The organisation has extended a $700m loan to Sri Lanka for budgetary support, including $200m for the poor and vulnerable.<br/>The country's youth seem desperate to leave. <br/>An estimated 311,269 people left in 2022 - the country has never seen migration on such a large scale. Many are skilled workers like doctors, paramedical and IT professionals.<br/>The scale of the brain drain is leaving a worrying gap in the country's economic recovery.  Businesses trying to recover from the crisis are unable to find skilled labour. <br/>\"I am running daily advertisements but unable to get qualified chefs. Last year I had 14 chefs in my kitchen, now I am working with just 2. Even if I want to invest more money and expand, I cannot,\" Mr Ekanayake told the BBC. <br/>This is a dramatic fall for a country that was long held up as an economic success story and had one of the highest average incomes in South Asia. The quality of its infrastructure, its free public health and education systems and its high levels of social development have all been held in high regard.<br/>So how did things get so bad?<br/>The government blamed the crisis on the Covid pandemic, which badly affected tourism. However, although the pandemic was a factor, disastrous economic policies were more to blame. Populist moves like big tax cuts in 2019 cost the government $1.4bn in annual revenues. And a move to ban imports of chemical fertilisers in 2021 caused a domestic food shortage.<br/>In order to cut expenses further the government has proposed privatising state-owned enterprises like Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Insurance Corporation and Sri Lanka Telecom. This has triggered a fresh wave of protests - this time by trade unions.<br/>\"The government should not put the burden of the reforms on the salaried class and middle class who are already affected by the economic crisis,\" said Anupa Nandula, the Vice President of the Ceylon Bank Employees Union.<br/>Mr Nandula and his union participated in a recent demonstration against the proposal to privatise the Sri Lankan Insurance Corporation. He believes privatisation will lead to massive job losses and further burden the working class.<br/>Ever since last year's demonstrations were violently broken up, Sri Lankan authorities have been using force - such as tear gas, water cannon and even beating protesters. But experts warn that this is not a tactic that can work.<br/>Rather than using force, the government needs to be transparent and explain that reshaping the economy will be tough, says Bhavani Fonseka, a constitutional lawyer working with Centre for Policy Alternatives.<br/>\"I think people since the crisis has happened have gotten used to a harder lifestyle. But in the absence of information coming, in the absence of answers being given, there is growing uncertainty and fear that we will go back to a crisis point.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

If a child successfully found a Pok\u00e9mon then a computerised animation of the creature would appear on their handset's screen, superimposed on top of the actual view through the phone's camera.<br/>It proved irresistible to millions and millions of young users. But are adults equally impressed by the use of AR?<br/>Since Pok\u00e9mon Go's success, a growing number of consumer brands are continuing to embrace AR, such as Coca-Cola and US whiskey Jack Daniels. You use your phone camera to scan a QR code on the can or bottle label, and an animation or video pops up on your screen.<br/>Does this use of AR remain a novelty, a gimmick that most people ignore, or does it actually increase consumer engagement and sales?<br/>In 2021, US soft drink firm Jones Soda introduced its first AR campaign, which it called Reel Labels. If you scan an image on the bottle labels then it transforms into a short video.<br/>To create the videos the firm partnered with an initial 15 so-called influencers, including a skateboarder, a breakdancer, and a BMX bike rider. Since then the firm's customers have been able to send in their own videos to be featured. <br/>And last year Jones Soda worked with music labels Sub Pop and Hardly Art to promote videos from more than a dozen new bands.<br/>\"A brand's packaging is so much more than a container for a product,\" says Bohb Blair, Jones Soda's chief marketing officer. \"It's now an opportunity to make a consumer's moment with your product special.<br/>\"Content is a great way to do that, and AR is a fun and convenient distribution vehicle.\"<br/>Another drinks business that has used AR to connect with the music industry is Estonian milk brand Tere Piim. In 2019 it joined with the Eurovision Song Contest to enable customers to see mini digital animations of that year's entrants perform on their kitchen counters and tables. All they had to do was scan a label on the milk cartons.<br/>The AR technology was provided by Latvian software firm Overly. \"Although you may doubt the compatibility at first glance, milk and a song contest make a good cross-marketing duo,\" says Overly's chief executive Ainars Klavins.<br/>\"In this instance, a traditional milk carton became a new medium for broadcasting Eurovision songs. It inspired consumers who may not be existing viewers to explore the contestant line-up and choose their favourites.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>He adds that consumers, especially younger ones, are ready to engage with brands \"in the augmented reality realm\".<br/>While you'd expect those involved in helping firms create AR to sing its praises, what do independent experts think?<br/>Stuart Duff is a leading business psychologist, who studies how firms can best connect with consumers. He says that AR can help products seem more \"interesting, engaging and memorable\".<br/>\"Research has highlighted that using AR not only captures our attention more quickly but also increases the likelihood of committing information to memory. So while AR may seem like a gimmick, it offers a genuine alternative approach to lodging brands in our psyche.\"<br/>Jenny Stanley is managing director of Appetite Creative, a Madrid-based tech and marketing firm that helps consumer businesses create AR labels.<br/>She says that a product's label is already an example of \"extremely targeted marketing\", whose effectiveness only increases further when AR content is added.<br/>\"It's not only impactful, but also cost effective. The average cost per digital advertising click is \u00a31.50, whereas a click or scan on packaging is technically free, giving brands a compelling reason to use connected packaging.\"<br/>Yet, as Mr Klavins of Overly cautions, content is key. And by that he means that what the AR offers has to be interesting and engaging.<br/>\"The key point here is that quality content for augmented reality is vital. I always say that AR content should either inspire, educate or entertain. It has to do at least one of those things to transform from a novelty tech into a strategic tool that drives business value.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Kreiz began working on it when he became CEO of Mattel in 2018 and he remains executive producer. <br/>Barbie and Ken are played by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, with Greta Gerwig directing.<br/>Kreiz acknowledges there is some risk in giving Barbie the Hollywood treatment, working with directors and writers who have their own creative ideas.<br/>There is \"humour and self-deprecation\" in the film, he says (not least on his part, as he is played by Will Ferrell, a controlling and slightly stuffy CEO).<br/>It's clear even from the trailer that Barbie is the butt of jokes. <br/>If you're being generous, she is portrayed as na\u00efve and innocent. If you aren't, she's shallow and superficial, obsessed with appearance and unable to comprehend the meaning of sex, death - or life without high heels.<br/>Barbie's \"Dreamland\" is a pink utopia, divorced from reality.<br/>\"This movie has been 64 years in the making (Barbie launched in 1959),\" says Kreiz, \"but it represents how the culture sees Barbie today.\"<br/>Barbie remains Mattel's biggest-selling brand, making the company more than \u00a31bn ($1.5bn) annually. Its other brands include Hot Wheels, Masters of the Universe, Monster High, Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine.<br/>Kreiz argues Mattel's other brands also have the potential to be turned into successful spin-offs.<br/>\"The devil works hard but Barbie's marketing team is working harder,\" according to marketing expert Mike Buonaiuto, author of Founder Therapy, who admires the inventive advertising the team behind the film has been up to, including the Airbnb listing of a Barbie Dreamhouse. <br/>\"But let's be honest,\" Buonaiuto points out, \"the opportunity for the Mattel universe is vastly different to Marvel's, and whilst Barbie is being powered by millennial nostalgia collaborations, try and do the same for Thomas the Tank Engine or Hot Wheels and you probably won't get the same result. <br/>\"The depth of world-building Mattel can pull from isn't competition for Marvel's.\"<br/>But the recent collapse of Toys R Us shows why toymakers like Mattel need to diversify beyond the sale of physical products, adds Buonaiuto.<br/>Barbie was first introduced in America in 1959, developed by Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel. <br/>Before Barbie, dolls typically took the form of babies, so children could play at being a nurturing parent. However, Barbies encouraged children to play at being adolescents, imagining their future selves through the dolls.<br/>As the original TV adverts that ran during Mickey Mouse Club told children: \"Someday I'm going to be exactly like you.\"<br/>This proved alluring and good business. More than a billion Barbie dolls had been sold by the early 1990s.<br/>But there have also been questions about what exactly Barbie dolls teach children, especially around body image. <br/>The original Barbie design was extremely skinny and the messaging reinforced unhealthy ideas. One infamous slumber party set created in the mid-1960s featured bathroom scales fixed at 110 pounds (50kg) and a dieting book that advised: \"Don't eat\".<br/>Another talking Barbie created in the early 1990s had the doll saying, \"Math class is tough.\" Mattel later apologised.  <br/>These issues continued to affect people's perception of the brand and arguably lay behind a dip in popularity around a decade ago.<br/>Mattel has learned lessons and is now keeping up with the times, says Kreiz.<br/>\"Barbie is a flag carrier for diversity and inclusivity,\" he says, \"with more than 170 different Barbie types in terms of body shape and skin colour, and Barbie has more than 200 careers, so girls can explore their potential in different ways.\"<br/>Barbie has recently brought out dolls with disabilities, prosthetic limbs, and one with Down's Syndrome. <br/>The \"classic, traditional Barbie\" is less than half of the business now, says Kreiz.<br/>That new commitment to diversity is reflected in the cast of the film, while the classic Barbie, who is the central character, is gently mocked.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Kreiz also points out that Mattel is restructuring the company to move with the times.<br/>Now it simply divides its products into categories (like dolls, vehicles and pre-school), rather than having teams devoted to separate boys' and girls' products. This is despite the fact that many shops still divide toys by gender, with pink aisles for girls who want to be princesses, and blue ones for boys who like dinosaurs and construction sets.<br/>The Barbie film is part of Kreiz's masterplan to position Mattel as a \"talent magnet\", working with people like film directors to try different things with its well-known creations.<br/>\"People who buy our products aren't just consumers,\" says Kreiz. \"They are fans, who have an emotional relationship to the products. Kids touch, hug and go to bed with our toys.<br/>\"We believe in the long-term opportunity for Barbie.

The government has said that the soaring prices are a \"temporary problem\" and that they will drop in the coming months.<br/>Some states have started selling tomatoes at reduced prices at government-run or farmer-backed outlets to help consumers. On 30 June, the Indian government launched a Tomato Grand Challenge Hackathon in Delhi to encourage the public to share ideas to combat the escalating prices.<br/>The tomato holds a surprising amount of sway over Indian cooking - it's added to almost every dish. So when it becomes scarce and expensive, it becomes the subject of headlines and even political rows.<br/>Economists say the steep price rise could disrupt India's delicate inflation balance, pushing retail inflation towards 5.5% in July-September from 4-5% in April and May.<br/>Ironically, close to two months ago, farmers in India dumped crates of tomatoes on the road after prices crashed to 2-3 rupees a kilo in the wholesale market as supply exceeded demand. <br/>Farmers resorted to the same measure last year to draw attention to their plight and, in March, farmers in Maharashtra state took out a protest march to demand higher prices for onions.<br/>India often faces supply-demand challenges when it comes to perishable, but essential, vegetables like the onion and tomato. Both crops are grown almost around the year and produce from different states hits the market during different months.<br/>This year, a bumper crop of tomato was followed by a poor harvest season.<br/>\"The current bout of tomato prices is actually a result of unseasonal rains during March-April-May in tomato-growing areas, particularly Kolar belt [in southern Karnataka state], which has the largest tomato market of the country,\" says, Ashok Gulati, farm economist.<br/>\"From mid-June, the supplies have shrunk, while demand pressures have mounted, leading to spikes in fresh tomato prices,\" he adds.<br/>Mr Gulati says the excessive rains in north-western India are likely to put further pressures on supply. <br/>\"Significant areas are also reeling under floods, especially Himachal and Uttarakhand states. Supply lines during heavy rains often get displaced,\" he says.<br/>Anil Malhotra, an Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) member, told PTI news agency that though tomato prices escalate every monsoon, he had never seen them this high.<br/>\"There is a major dip in supply due to rains. Around half our stock, which we get from Himachal Pradesh, got damaged,\" he said.<br/>Arvind Malik, a tomato farmer from Haryana state, told the Guardian newspaper that while he usually sold 30,000kg of tomatoes every year, this year he could only harvest half of that as his crops had been destroyed by pests. <br/>\"Experts told us that irregular weather - sudden rise and decline in temperatures - is the reason behind the diseases in our tomatoes,\" he said.<br/>So how does India overcome this supply-demand gap? A straightforward solution would be to just store excess produce for the proverbial - and in this case, literal - rainy day. <br/>But experts say that this is easier said than done because tomatoes are highly perishable and tend to go bad after a few weeks even in cold storage. <br/>Mr Gulati says that one way to stabilise supply is to incentivise protected cultivation of tomatoes to save the crop from extreme heat or unseasonal heavy showers.<br/>Another step is to process tomatoes into puree, which can help consumers shift to processed tomatoes when prices of fresh tomatoes are running high. \"But to promote processing of tomatoes, the government has to incentivise the processing and lower GST [general sales tax] on tomato puree from 12% - 5%,\" says Mr Gulati.<br/>\"Overall, a value chain approach has to be adopted to de-risk the vegetable from production to consumption, but the framework is absent right now.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

The amount of money is expected to be more than $100m (\u00a378m) every 12 months.<br/>Meanwhile, the other 2% of the retailer's shares were transferred to a new trust, called the Patagonia Purpose Trust, which now runs the company, and - as the firm says - guides its environmental and philanthropic principals.<br/>Yvon Chouinard, who led Patagonia for 50 years, is now 84 years old. He and his family decided on the new business structure and cash giveaway as he stepped back from being in the company's driving seat.<br/>\"We looked at different approaches,\" says Patagonia's chair Charles Conn. He adds that one option could have been floating the firm on a stock exchange and  \"then give the money away\", but that may have resulted in the company subsequently not being run in such an environmentally-focused way.<br/>\"So we kept coming back to giving shares to environmental foundations, and using it to fight the environmental crisis,\" says Mr Conn. \"It's a radical thing to do, but we're dependent on Mother Earth.<br/>\"The family walked away from billions, but Yvon is the real deal. He doesn't have a mobile phone, they drive old cars.\"<br/>You might think that Patagonia is an unusual one-off, but a small number of other firms are making similar arrangements to add nature and the environment - at least figuratively  - to either their ownership or board rooms.<br/>UK beauty products company Faith in Nature now has two directors who are there \"to give nature a voice and a vote on how Faith In Nature is run\". These two external board members come from two environmental organisations - Earth Law Centre and Lawyers for Nature.<br/>\"It's about how to make business better, so less damage is done,\" says Anne Hopkins, creative director at Faith in Nature.<br/>\"We are a company with our hearts in the right place... we didn't want this to just be marketing. We wanted to create a formal and legal structure with a practical framework.\"<br/>Fellow creative director Simeon Rose adds that the two environmental directors come to an agreement \"and give nature's view\". He adds: \"The biggest difference is now it enables other board members to see what decisions nature makes, and it helps them make further conscious decisions\".<br/>Faith in Nature, which was founded back in 1974, has now created an online guide for any companies that would like to follow its example.<br/>In the Netherlands, Dutch vegan cheese-substitute company Willicroft appointed \"Mother Nature\" as its chief executive in 2020, replacing co-founder Brad Vanstone, who became head of impact.<br/>But what does that actually mean?<br/>\"It means that every single decision we make every day is geared towards the planet. For example, I now take the train when I travel to the UK, whereas before I wouldn't think about it, and I would fly,\" says Mr Vanstone.<br/>Since the new boss was appointed, other environmental decisions made by Willicroft include only accepting investors who are committed to ditching any fossil fuel investments within five years.<br/>In addition, the firm switched from making its cheese substitutes out of cashew nuts to using beans and pulses instead. This was because it calculated that the processing of cashews caused more carbon emissions.<br/>More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.<br/>Mr Vanstone adds that next year the business will bring in an \"impact board\" to sit alongside the main board of the company, to challenge any decisions not deemed environmentally led.<br/>In addition, he has called for other businesses to follow Willicroft's nature-led lead, and he says that 15 companies in Amsterdam have now followed suit.<br/>The actions of Patagonia, Faith in Nature and Willicroft seem easy to celebrate, but they are not without their critics.<br/>Kandi White, program director at US environmental group Indigenous Environmental Network describes such initiatives as \"largely greenwashing and empty gestures\". Her organisation was set up in 1990 to protect the \"sacred sites, land, water, air, natural resources, [and] health\" of indigenous communities across North America.<br/>\"Even with a symbolic recognition of Mother Earth as a board member, or donating profits to philanthropic organisations, climate justice will not be achieved until the practice of profit and consumption ends,\" she says.<br/>\"Corporations must change how they relate to Mother Earth, to nature, and must dispel the dominant anthropocentric belief that Mother Earth belongs to humans. Lastly, they must establish values, principles, operations and practices that are reflective of natural law.\"<br/>Still, for companies wishing to add an environmental representative to their ownership or board, Tad Ostrowski, founder and managing director of UK law firm Artington Legal, says they should carry out due diligence first.<br/>\"Care would need to be taken to ensure that the finances of the company and the relationships with the other shareholders were clear, transparent and aligned with the company and its relevant stakeholders,\" he says.<br/>\"But done properly, there is no reason why the company's long-term success for the benefit of its members as a whole cannot be linked to positive decision making for the long-term benefit of nature.\"<br/>Back at clothing firm Patagonia, Mr Conn says it was vital to put Planet Earth in charge of the business. \"Many species are in decline, and climate change is impacting us all. Like Yvon says, there's no business on a dead planet.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

However, the name of the service conjures up a rather different meaning to viewers who caught a seminal BBC drama aired almost 40 years ago.<br/>As families settled down in front of the TV on a Sunday evening in September 1984, little did they suspect the impact of the horror to come.<br/>At 9:30 the BBC aired the 112-minute film Threads.<br/>With only four channels to choose from, the harrowing post-apocalyptic Cold War drama found its way into millions of homes - and led to sleepless nights for many who saw the Sheffield-based dystopian drama unfold.<br/>Written by Kes author Barry Hines, the film showed the unrelenting impact of a thermonuclear blast on ordinary Britons - in graphic detail.<br/>Produced on a low budget and directed by documentary maker Mick Jackson, who would later go on to helm Hollywood blockbuster The Bodyguard, it managed to horrify people at a time when nuclear war seemed a very real possibility.<br/>From a kitchen sink drama focused around a young couple in a South Yorkshire, then riven by the Miners' Strike, Threads shows society breaking down as nuclear winter sets in.<br/>\"It never loses its power, ever. I have never seen anything so horrible and bleak in my life,\" said Stephen Brotherstone.<br/>He and David Lawrence are the authors of Scarred for Life - a series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.<br/>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it \"wrecked\" his head.<br/>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.<br/>\"I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much.\"<br/>Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had \"looked really special\" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.<br/>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama's impact.<br/>\"We said 'wow if we can pull this off it'll be great,' but I didn't have a clue that it held that much of a punch.\"<br/>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.<br/>\"There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room,\" the actor recalled.<br/>\"People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. <br/>\"People say it is the most scary thing they've ever seen in their life and remains so to this day.\"<br/>Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR.<br/>Lawrence and Brotherstone are currently working on a third volume of their series, which looks at the Cold War and includes a chapter on Threads.<br/>\"I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,\" said Lawrence.<br/>\"You've got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you've got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there's every nightmare you've ever had on screen.\"<br/>Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990.<br/>\"It wasn't a question of if they pressed the button, but when are they going to press the button,\" he said.<br/>Jimmy, played by Dinsdale, and Ruth, played by Karen Meagher, have just learnt that Ruth is expecting a baby as the film opens.<br/>The growing tensions between East and West appear on TV and newspapers as Sheffield's residents go about their daily lives, ignoring the looming threat.<br/>\"There's the build-up to war, but you don't see it you, just hear about it in the background as they are discussing what to have for tea,\" Lawrence said.<br/>\"They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think.\"<br/>For Dinsdale, it was a \"fantastic\" piece of writing by Hines.<br/>\"They are everyman and everywoman, they are just normal people with normal lives, there's nothing special about them and this very special event happens to them and it just draws you in.\"<br/>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.<br/>\"Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up,\" he said.<br/>\"It is very 70s, 80s Play for Today, but I think it works in its favour because it was so British.<br/>\"That was a house that looked like mine, there's Woolworths getting vaporised, it really struck home.\"<br/>The final parts of the film follow the characters as they struggle through the nuclear winter in the aftermath of the blasts.<br/>\"It is watching everyone die and it is watching society collapse forever. <br/>\"It makes the point we are never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other,\" Brotherstone said.<br/>For the actors and crew it was \"a ball\" to make, according to Dinsdale.<br/>\"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever.\"<br/>To him though, Threads remains a \"seminal\" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.<br/>\"It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created,\" he said.<br/>\"It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.<br/>\"I am very proud of it.\"<br/>Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Travellers pay higher ticket prices and more tax. <br/>It is often cheaper to fly to another continent than to another African country.  <br/>For a quick comparison, flying from the German capital, Berlin, to Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, will probably set you back around $150 (\u00a3120) for a direct flight taking less than three hours. <br/>But flying a similar distance, say between Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, you will be paying anything between $500 and $850, with at least one change, taking up to 20 hours. <br/>This makes doing business within Africa incredibly difficult, and expensive - and it is not just elite travellers that are affected.  <br/>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the global trade body representing some 300 airlines which make up about 83% of world air traffic - argues that if just 12 key countries in Africa worked together to improve connectivity and opened up their markets, it would create 155,000 jobs and boost those countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $1.3bn. <br/>\"Aviation contributes directly to the GDP in every country. It generates work and it activates the economy,\" says Kamil al-Awadhi, IATA's regional vice-president for Africa and the Middle East.<br/>Adefolake Adeyeye, an assistant professor of commercial law at the UK's Durham University, agrees that Africa as a whole is missing out because of its poor air service.   <br/>\"It's been shown that air transport does boost the economy. As we've seen in other continents, budget airlines can improve connectivity and cost, which boosts tourism, which then creates many more jobs,\" she says.  <br/>The poor quality of road networks and lack of railways in many African countries often makes air transport the practical choice for cargo too.  <br/>The climate emergency, which has severely impacted Africa, means everyone needs to be more careful about their carbon footprint and should aim to fly a lot less. <br/>But even though around 18% of the world's population lives in Africa, it accounts for less than 2% of global air travel and, according to the UN's Environment Programme, just 3.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is in contrast to 19% from the US and 23% from China.  <br/>Africa may be rich in minerals and natural resources, but of the 46 nations on the UN's Least Developed Countries list, 33 are on the continent, and poverty continues to be the biggest daily threat for millions of people on the continent.  <br/>But there is also a growing middle-class who could potentially travel by air if the tickets were priced at similar levels to Europe or elsewhere.<br/>African states have been trying for decades to integrate the aviation sector, but they haven't been successful, yet. <br/>\"There needs to be a coherent strategy by Africa to address the issue of its poor air service if they want to transform Africa's economies,\" says Zemedeneh Negatu, the global chairman of US-based investment firm Fairfax Africa Fund.<br/>He says that flights within Africa are still structured around cumbersome bilateral agreements from one country to the next, and that most  flag-carrying state airlines in Africa barely cover their costs, while some even run at a loss.  <br/>\"Every government in Africa wants to see their flag on the tail of an aircraft at Heathrow or JFK airport, but African governments need to realise that stand alone carriers are not viable.\" <br/>Mr Zemedeneh argues that African airlines should take inspiration from Europe and form major partnerships, such as between flag-carriers Air France and KLM of The Netherlands, and the Anglo-Spanish International Airlines Group (IAG) formed between British Airways and Iberia. <br/>He says even in the rich market of Europe, conglomeration is the way forward for airliners to survive, and provide a cheaper more reliable service. <br/>The current system in Africa is very fragmented, and although 35 countries are signed up to the Single African Air Transport Market, an African Union (AU) initiative to free up the skies to African airlines and bring down costs, it could be years before it's implemented.  <br/>IATA's Mr Awadhi says governments are reluctant to work together. <br/>\"There is a hard-headedness where each state thinks they know how to handle it better and will stick to their remedies even when they are not very effective,\" he says.<br/>\"In the end it's a business and there is a level of protectionism that starts to hurt the aviation industry. Then there is no benefit to having your own national carrier.\" <br/>There is one notable exception in Africa of an airline that is absolutely thriving, and that could provide a blueprint for others to copy - Ethiopian Airlines.  <br/>Just over 15 years ago the company employed about 4,000 people. Now that figure is over 17,000. <br/>It is state-owned but run entirely as a commercial venture without government interference. <br/>It has more than doubled the size of its fleet of cargo and passenger planes and has made Addis Ababa a regional hub, driving foreign currency into the Ethiopian capital, and boosting the country's service industry.  <br/>At the turn of the millennium Ethiopia was one of the poorest countries in the world, now it's one of the fastest growing economies. <br/>Mr Zemedeneh, an Ethiopian-American who played a key role as an adviser to Ethiopian Airlines as it developed its strategy, says Ethiopian Airlines has played a part in that boom. <br/>\"Ethiopian Airlines generates millions of dollars in hard currency for the country, and it makes every Ethiopian proud that they have been able to create one of the most successful indigenous African-owned, African-operated, multinational companies,\" he adds.    <br/>African travellers will be hoping these kinds of commercial successes will ultimately impact their airfares, bringing them down more in line with Europe or Asia - and that they can finally get to where they want to go more quickly and cheaply.<br/>One woman, 30 African countries, five lessons<br/>Waiting for take-off in West Africa<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He was in the audience watching Mr Namasivayasivam, and says that the story particularly resonated with him. <br/>\"If you've never made any mistakes as a coder, you probably weren't innovating enough,\" says Mr Murray.<br/>\"Most people want to hide their embarrassing moments or failures, but because the speakers open the floor with some of their toughest moments, it sets the stage for everyone attending to let their guard down and really get to know one another.\"<br/>Tech entrepreneurs shouldn't only celebrate their wins, Mr Murray adds. \"When you study someone's success, it's almost like asking them what lottery numbers they played to win.<br/>\"Of course you can learn lots from successful people, but to me the concept of openly talking about your failures felt like there was much more to learn from.\"<br/>Marsha Druker, who organises the regular failure talks in Toronto, says she looks for speakers willing to not just be open about their professional failure story.<br/>Instead she also wants them \"to tell audiences about what they learned about that mistake, now that they have had time to reflect on it\".<br/>She says a common theme to what tech entrepreneurs face when they fail is \"a story of resilience and coming out at the other side, and recognising that failure shouldn't be a taboo topic we don't talk about openly\".<br/>Venturing into that often off-limits topic is the reason why such celebrations of failure began in Mexico City in 2012, says Carlos Zimbr\u00f3n, a Mexican tech entrepreneur who first came up with the idea for the evenings.<br/>During a barbeque at home with other friends, Mr Zimbr\u00f3n says he expressed how boring it was to attend \"typical conference with keynote speakers talking about their successes, and how it was rare to hear the B-side of that story\".<br/>Soon after, he and his friends held the first failure talk in the same backyard space.<br/>As word spread about the Mexico City event, other entrepreneurs in cities in 80 countries around the world have since started their own parallel nights. They hold monthly talks, coupled with a Q&A session after each speaker.<br/>Mr Zimbron says that the talks, many of which are later uploaded to YouTube, \"can be inspiring for people who may have gone through the same problems\".<br/>He adds: \"When you can connect to someone else's mistakes, and can see how vulnerable they are in sharing that story, that's where you can connect with other entrepreneurs.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Leah Edwards, is both a director at US investment fund Lighter Capital, and a lecturer on leadership and innovation at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>She says she loves that these public talks about business failure are \"normalizing the fact that something is hard, and that it takes a number of at-bats [a baseball term for a batter's turn] in order to find the right combination of teams and market opportunity, and the right product or service\".<br/>Ms Edwards adds Silicon Valley has long had a high tolerance for start-ups not succeeding, and that it is good to see this spreading.<br/>\"There will always be entrepreneurs whose companies don't work out in the end, but they pick themselves back up and try again,\" she says. \"I'm excited to see this recognition of that kind of resilience spreading into other geographies and cultures.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

What is real about us? What is the watermark of being human?\" she says. <br/>Central to the system is a technique called Photoplethysmography (PPG), which detects changes in blood flow. <br/>Faces created by deepfakes don't give out these signals, she says. <br/>The system also analyses eye movement to check for authenticity. <br/>\"So normally, when humans look at a point, when I look at you, it's as if I'm shooting rays from my eyes, to you. But for deepfakes, it's like googly eyes, they are divergent,\" she says. <br/>By looking at both these traits, Intel believes it can work out the difference between a real video and a fake within seconds. <br/>The company claims FakeCatcher is 96% accurate. So we asked to try out the system. Intel agreed. <br/>We used a dozen or so clips of former US President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. <br/>Some were real, some were deepfakes created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The BBC's James Clayton puts a deepfake video detector to the test<br/>In terms of finding the deepfakes, the system appeared to be pretty good. <br/>We mostly chose lip-synced fakes - real videos where the mouth and voice had been altered. <br/>And it got every answer right, bar one. <br/>However when we got onto real, authentic videos it started to have a problem. <br/>Several times the system said a video was fake, when it was in fact real. <br/>The more pixelated a video, the harder it is to pick up blood flow. <br/>The system also does not analyse audio. So some videos that seemed fairly obviously real by listening to the voice were allocated as fake. <br/>The worry is that if the program says a video is fake, when it's genuine, it could cause real problems.<br/>When we make this point to Ms Demir, she says that \"verifying something as fake, versus 'be careful, this may be fake' is weighted differently\".<br/>She is saying the system is being overly cautious. Better to catch all the fakes - and catch some real videos too - than miss fakes. <br/>Deepfakes can be incredibly subtle: a two second clip in a political campaign advert, for example. They can also be of low quality. A fake can be made by only changing the voice. <br/>In this respect, the ability for FaceCatcher to work \"in the wild\" - in real world contexts - has been questioned.<br/>Matt Groh is an assistant professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, and a deepfakes expert. <br/>\"I don't doubt the stats that they listed in their initial evaluation,\" he says. \"But what I do doubt is whether the stats are relevant to real world contexts.\"<br/>This is where it gets difficult to evaluate FakeCatcher's tech.<br/>Programmes like facial-recognition systems will often give extremely generous statistics for their accuracy.<br/>However, when actually tested in the real world they can be less accurate. <br/>Earlier this year the BBC tested Clearview AI's facial recognition system, using our own pictures. Although the power of the tech was impressive, it was also clear that the more pixelated the picture, and the more side-on the the face in the photo was, the harder it was for the programme to successfully identify someone.<br/>In essence, the accuracy is entirely dependent on the difficulty of the test. <br/>Intel claims that FakeCatcher has gone through rigorous testing. This includes a \"wild\" test - in which the company has put together 140 fake videos - and their real counterparts.<br/>In this test the system had a success rate of 91%, Intel says.<br/>However, Matt Groh and other researchers want to see the system independently analysed. They do not think it's good enough that Intel is setting a test for itself. <br/>\"I would love to evaluate these systems,\" Mr Groh says. <br/>\"I think it's really important when we're designing audits and trying to understand how accurate something is in a real world context,\" he says. <br/>It is surprising how difficult it can be tell a fake and a real video apart - and this technology certainly has potential. <br/>But from our limited tests, it has a way to go yet. <br/>Watch the full report on this week's episode of Click<br/>Martin Lewis felt 'sick' seeing deepfake scam<br/>Revenge and deepfake porn laws to be toughened<br/>Trauma of deepfake porn can be 'life-shattering'<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Previously this happened by giving you four conversation choices on screen, which is very limiting, it's only an illusion of choice. We want more than that.\" <br/>For Guy Gadney unlocking the potential of non-playable-characters will change how games tell stories, by allowing players to interact with what's in front of them differently to how they do it now. Charisma.ai is also working with companies like Warner, Dreamworks and Sky about how this technology might also work in other forms of storytelling. <br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>Dr Tommy Thompson, who also has a dedicated YouTube channel for AI in gaming, is excited about the potential of the technology. But he also warns that the industry needs to be cautious.<br/>He says using widely available, open access AI tools in their current form in games \"is not practical\" for studios. <br/>\"Who owns the copyright? With image generation for example, there's several ongoing lawsuits where people are asking if their art was used as the basis for image creation, and was appropriate consent given?<br/>\"If you're generating assets for your game using some AI platforms then you don't own any of that copyright on a legal basis. If you were to ship that game anyone could use those assets and put them in another game and there'd be zero legal basis to stop them. The law will say, 'well, actually you didn't own copyright.'\"<br/>Some games studios are creating their own AI platforms to get around these issues, but that is time-consuming and expensive. For small games companies who might be drawn to open source AI tools, the risks outweigh the benefits at the moment, according to Dr Thompson.<br/>\"I think it is important that we step back and look at the larger implications of this,\" he says.<br/>\"It is not something that's going to get solved overnight. That isn't to say that generative AI tools aren't being used internally in studios in new and really interesting ways, but I don't think it's going to be the Nirvana that people are imagining.\"<br/>In a statement to the BBC, Daniel Wood, UKIE co-CEO, said: \"The video games industry is always at the cutting edge of technology so we are already using AI in many areas including production, art, interaction with in-game characters and community management to create even more exciting and engaging experiences for our players.<br/>\"Whilst UKIE and the wider industry will continue to look at topics such as copyright and the fast-changing skills needs of games businesses, the future possibilities of AI promise a lot of exciting opportunities for our sector.\"<br/>For more gaming stories listen to Press X to Continue on BBC Sounds.<br/>Zelda: Why Nintendo's latest game is so important<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fifa no more?

It has hundreds of signatories.<br/>AI lets a computer act and respond almost as if it were human.<br/>Computers can be fed huge amounts of information and trained to identify the patterns in it, in order to make predictions, solve problems, and even learn from their own mistakes.<br/>As well as data, AI relies on algorithms - lists of rules which must be followed in the correct order to complete a task.<br/>The Foundation was launched in 2018 and is a non-profit global group bringing together people working in tech and academia to look at the development of new technologies. <br/>Its questions for developers include how they will prevent an AI product from incorporating bias, and how they would deal with a situation in which the result generated by a tool results in law-breaking.<br/>This week shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said that the Labour Party would criminalise those who deliberately use AI tools for terrorist purposes.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has appointed Ian Hogarth, a tech entrepreneur and AI investor to lead an AI taskforce. Mr Hogarth told me this week he wanted \"to better understand the risks associated with these frontier AI systems\" and hold the companies who develop them accountable.<br/>Other considerations in the framework include the data protection laws of various territories, whether it is clear to a user that they are interacting with AI, and whether human workers who input or tag data used to train the product were treated fairly.<br/>The full list is divided into three chapters: questions for individual developers, questions for a team to consider together, and questions for people testing the product.<br/>Some of the 84 questions are as follows:<br/>\"We're in this Wild West stage, where it's just kind of: 'Chuck it out in the open and see how it goes'.\" said Vince Lynch, founder of the firm IV.AI and advisor to the World Ethical Data Foundation board. He came up with the idea for the framework.<br/>\"And now those cracks that are in the foundations are becoming more apparent, as people are having conversations about intellectual property, how human rights are considered in relation to AI and what they're doing.\"<br/>If, for example, a model has been trained using some data that is copyright protected, it's not an option to just strip it out - the entire model may have to be trained again.<br/>\"That can cost hundreds of millions of dollars sometimes. It is incredibly expensive to get it wrong,\" Mr Lynch said.<br/>Other voluntary frameworks for the safe development of AI have been proposed.<br/>Margarethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner, is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>Willo is a Glasgow-based recruitment platform which has recently launched an AI tool to go with its service. <br/>The firm said it took three years to collect sufficient data to build it.<br/>Co-founder Andrew Wood said at one point the firm chose to pause its development in response to ethical concerns raised by its customers.<br/>\"We're not using our AI capabilities to do any decision making. The decision making is solely left with the employer,\" he said.<br/>\"There are certain areas where AI is really applicable, for example, scheduling interviews... but making the decision on whether to move forward [with hiring a candidate] or not, that's always going to be left to the human as far as we're concerned.\"<br/>Co-founder Euan Cameron said that transparency to users was for him an important section of the Foundation framework.<br/>\"If anyone's using AI, you can't sneak it through the backdoor and pretend it was a human who created that content,\" he said.<br/>\"It needs to be clear it was done by AI technology.

But Labour's Lord Stevenson did not move the amendment to a vote, though he urged further discussion about the issue at a later stage of the bill.<br/>And Conservative peer Lord Moylan had proposed an amendment that would exempt encrypted services from scanning altogether. He argued the governments plans \"opened a hole\" in encryption and said the powers were a \"major assault on privacy\". But he did not move it to a vote anticipating that the house would vote against it.<br/>But Children's charity the NSPCC backed the powers in the bill, telling the BBC it set out \"a balanced settlement that should encourage companies to mitigate the risks of child sexual abuse when designing and rolling out features like end-to-end encryption\".<br/>Apple joins opposition to message app scanning<br/>WhatsApp and messaging apps against 'surveillance'<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The union has asked a taskforce to draft legal protections.<br/>The government said it was committed to improving and upholding worker rights.<br/>It comes as the boss of Octopus Energy told the BBC its customers prefer emails written by AI over his staff.<br/>Business leaders are hailing the potential of AI to spur innovation, productivity and improve customer service.<br/>But unions say they are \"deeply worried\" that UK employment law is not keeping pace with the AI revolution.<br/>Mary Towers, employment rights policy officer at the TUC, said: \"The types of decisions that are being made by AI are significant and life changing - for example, who should get a job, how work is carried out, where it's carried out.\"<br/>A lack of AI specific legislation meant the UK was being left behind, she said. \"For example, in the EU, they are in the process of passing an AI Act. In this country, we don't have any equivalent.\"<br/>At Octopus Energy, AI is used to read, interpret and answer customer service queries. Chief executive Greg Jackson said it was doing work that would otherwise need an extra 250 people. <br/>He said customers appeared to prefer dealing with the AI than with a human. <br/>\"An email written by our team members has a 65% satisfaction rating from customers,\" he said. \"An email written by AI has an 80 or 85% satisfaction rating. And so what the AI is doing is enabling our team to do a better job of serving customers at a time of great need.\" <br/>He added that a human commanding an AI to write an email \"saves a lot of tedious typing\".<br/>\"But we have to ensure this is all done responsibly. And we need governments and economists and businesses to be ensuring that we're doing this by enhancing and creating jobs, not replacing them.\" <br/>AI could lead to huge breakthroughs in science and medicine according to the boss of drug giant GSK. Emma Walmsley told the BBC that the speed with which AI could process data and see patterns would revolutionise drug development. <br/>\"Biopharma is difficult. It takes sometimes a decade, billions [of pounds], and it has a 90% failure rate,\" she said.<br/>\"But we are in the business of data at the heart of what we do. AI is helping us see things in this data faster.\"<br/>She said this meant drug and vaccine discovery and development should become \"more predictive and improve our probability of success\".<br/>And she said that could mean better health outcomes for hundreds of millions of people. <br/>\"One in three of us is going to be battling with dementia, there are still many cancers that don't have have solutions, infectious diseases are still causing one in six deaths in the world,\" she said.<br/>There was \"no doubt\" that AI would \"help us unlock better solutions to these challenges\", she said. \"And that's got to be something worth investing in with optimism whilst regulating responsibly.\" <br/>Ms Walmsley thinks improving productivity through the use of AI will create more jobs and \"change some jobs quite meaningfully\". <br/>\"I think some will need maybe some less headcount on but there'll be other spaces where we need a lot more,\" she said.<br/>It is sometimes assumed that the creative arts will be the least affected by AI as machine learning will struggle to replicate human creativity. <br/>But that's wrong according to actress and voice over artist Laurence Bouvard who said that AI is being used to sample, analyse and replicate human voices without paying the original artist. <br/>\"When we do a job, in order to get paid, we have to sign away all our rights,\" she said. \"And these AI companies are just taking it without asking who it belongs to.\"<br/>She said AI was a particular threat to the \"army\" of lesser known artists who voice cartoons, video games, dictionaries and other audio work who could see their careers totally destroyed. <br/>\"A writer and an artist and a photographer, even if their work is stolen, they can create new work. If my voice is stolen, if my career is over,\" she said.<br/>AI has great power and is already changing industries and the work place. Last week the OECD said the world was \"on the cusp of an AI revolution\". <br/>The Paris-based body said: \"Urgent action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy way in the workplace.\"<br/>With great power comes great responsibility - and it is not yet clear in the UK or internationally - who will or who should take on that responsibility.<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"AI is set to fuel growth and create new highly-paid jobs throughout the UK, while allowing us to carry out our existing jobs more efficiently and safely. <br/>\"That is why we are working with businesses and regulators to ensure AI is used safely and responsibility in business settings.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Why some celebrities are embracing AI deepfakes<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

I don't know. I hope not.\"<br/>Harry said he thought there was more to art than how it looked.<br/>\"At the end of the day I think that there's a bigger reason why people are invested in Ketnipz and I don't think it's just the mere aesthetics of it.<br/>\"I think there's a personality behind it that I don't think someone imitating can really tap into.\"<br/>Artist James Lewis, from Cardiff, creates videos of his painting technique for more than seven million followers on TikTok and Instagram. <br/>He has yet to find out if his work has been used by the tools, but said because AI has learned from billions of artworks, it would be hard to trace which artists' works have been used in each image.<br/>\"If there was a way to go back and figure out who inspired this style of image that was generated, I think it would be fair for that artist to receive some sort of compensation,\" he said.<br/>In the meantime he thinks artists should keep being creative.<br/>\"I do have hope that as much as AI art will develop and it'll get better, but it will never be able to capture that true human essence, that true creativity that we have as people,\" he said.<br/>\"You will still need your own creative ideas, your own initiative.\"<br/>For artist and human rights researcher Caroline Sinders, it is for AI companies to address the problem.<br/>She said: \"Part of the argument we hear from companies is, 'we have so much data, it would be impossible for us to tell, like searching for a needle in a haystack'.<br/>\"I would like to say, well, that's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. <br/>\"I have a copyright on the images and I plan to enact my copyright if my images are used without my consent.\"<br/>She said she was also worried about the bias that these tools created and how it meant AI art was not reflecting the real world.<br/>\"Let's say we ask an image generation AI system to generate a doctor assessing care to a family,\" she said.<br/>\"Most likely that doctor will be generated as male and probably as white, and the parent will probably be generated as female.<br/>\"And this is not an example I'm randomly making up. There have been tests done by asking these sort of blanket questions without gender being in the text prompt and, more often than not, it's reflecting these stereotypes.\"<br/>This extends to racial bias and also ableism, said Irene Fubara-Manuel, a lecturer at the University of Sussex.<br/>While they said they were excited about the possibilities provided by generative art, issues such as racial and gender biases in some images created were hard to overcome.<br/>\"I was trying to dye my hair over the summer, and I was just looking up 'people of colour, blonde locks',\" they said.<br/>\"What I got in response was this regal, I would say, fetishised image of black people. You know, chiselled jaw lines, their skin was iridescent.<br/>\"It's like, there are black people who are that beautiful, but the images that you see commonly in a lot of AI are very, very fetishised representations of people. <br/>\"You would not see people who are plus size, or people who have visible disabilities, for instance.\"<br/>Artists are now calling on regulators in the UK and worldwide to take more action to protect artists and the industry.<br/>Irene said artists were not against AI but, \"the argument is against exploitation\".<br/>\"But I'm hopeful that it will contribute to human creativity in general, just like how the creation of computers added more to creativity. I'm excited for its contribution,\" they said.<br/>Caroline said more regulation of the emerging AI industry in the UK would not \"stifle\" innovation.<br/>\"It makes things safer and that's why we have certain laws,\" she said.<br/>\"That's why right now we have seatbelts and airbags for cars and a lot of rules about them. When they were first invented, we didn't have any of that. <br/>\"So it's not at all out of step to sort of ask for, or to create, guardrails and protections.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Lola Mayor.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Elon Musk announces new AI start-up<br/>UK must be more open on use of AI, say campaigners<br/>Watch: What threats does AI pose?<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He added that the existential threat warnings issued by some AI experts relate to systems which don't yet exist.<br/>Meta's decision to make Llama 2 widely available for commercial businesses and researchers to use has divided the tech community. In some ways its hand has already been forced - the first generation, Llama, was leaked online within a week of its launch.<br/>Open-source is a well-trodden path in this sector - opening up your product for others to use gives you an enormous amount of free user testing data, identifying bugs, problems and improvements along the way. <br/>But the risk here is that this is a very powerful tool, whatever Sir Nick might say. <br/>We know previous iterations of chatbots have been manipulated to spout hate speech, generate false information and give harmful instructions. Are the guardrails strong enough for Llama 2 to prevent itself from being misused out in the wild, and what will Meta do if it is?<br/>Another interesting thing to note is Meta's decision to partner with Microsoft on this - Llama 2 will be available and usable via Microsoft platforms such as Azure - as Microsoft has also invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>This is a giant with its sights firmly set on AI, and the deep pockets to buy its way in with the key players. The risk is that the AI pool soon becomes full of a few very large fish - and is that healthy for competition in this still fairly young industry?<br/>Llama 2 marks a partnership between Microsoft and Meta.<br/>Unlike Llama 2, GPT-4 and fellow rival Palm - Google's LLM which powers the Bard chatbot - are not free to use for commercial or research purposes.<br/>It comes a week after US comedian Sarah Silverman announced she is suing both OpenAI and Meta, alleging that her copyright has been infringed in the training of the firms' AI systems.<br/>Dame Wendy Hall, Regents Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southampton, told the BBC that allowing AI to be open-sourced raised concerns around legislation.<br/>\"My worry about open-source is that is how we regulate them,\" she said.<br/>\"Can the industry be trusted to self-regulate, or will they work with the governments to regulate? It's a bit like giving people a template to build a nuclear bomb.\"<br/>Sir Nick said her comments were \"hyperbole\", and clarified that Meta's open-sourced system could not generate images, let alone \"build a bio weapon\".<br/>But he \"strongly agreed\" that AI needed to be regulated.<br/>\"Models are being open-sourced all the time already,\" he said. <br/>\"So it's not really whether open sourcing of these large language models is going to take place, the question is how can you do it as responsibly and safely as possible.<br/>\"I feel I can assert without any fear of contradiction, that the LLMs that we are open-sourcing are safer than any of the other AI LLMs which have been open-sourced.\"<br/>Sarah Silverman sues OpenAI and Meta<br/>AI image creator faces UK and US legal challenges<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This was a view echoed by film director Christopher Nolan, who told the BBC that AI leaders he spoke to saw the present time \"as their Oppenheimer moment\". J.Robert Oppenheimer played a key role in the development of the first atomic bomb, and is the subject of Mr Nolan's latest film.<br/>But the BCS sees the situation in a more positive light, while still supporting the need for rules around AI.<br/>Richard Carter is a signatory to the BCS letter. Mr Carter, who founded an AI-powered startup cybersecurity business, feels the dire warnings are unrealistic: \"Frankly, this notion that AI is an existential threat to humanity is too far-fetched. We're just not in any kind of a position where that's even feasible\".<br/>Signatories to the BCS letter come from a range of backgrounds - business, academia, public bodies and think tanks, though none are as well known as Elon Musk, or run major AI companies like OpenAI.<br/>Those the BBC has spoken to stress the positive uses of AI. Hema Purohit, who leads on digital health and social care for the BCS, said the technology was enabling new ways to spot serious illness, for example medical systems that detect signs of issues such as cardiac disease or diabetes when a patient goes for an eye test.<br/>She said AI could also help accelerate the testing of new drugs.<br/>Signatory Sarah Burnett, author of a book on AI and business, pointed to agricultural uses of the tech, from robots that use artificial intelligence to pollinate plants to those that \"identify weeds and spray or zap them with lasers, rather than having whole crops sprayed with weed killer\".<br/>The letter argues: \"The UK can help lead the way in setting professional and technical standards in AI roles, supported by a robust code of conduct, international collaboration and fully resourced regulation\".<br/>By doing so, it says Britain \"can become a global byword for high-quality, ethical, inclusive AI\".<br/>In the autumn UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will host a global summit on AI regulation. <br/>While the BCS may argue existential threats are sci-fi, some issues are just over the horizon or are already presenting problems.<br/>It has been predicted that the equivalent of up to 300 million jobs could be automated, and some companies have already said they will pause hiring in some roles as a result of AI.<br/>But Mr Carter thinks AI - rather than replacing humans - will boost their productivity. In his own work he says ChatGPT is useful, but he says he is wary of putting too much trust in it, comparing it to a \"very knowledgeable and a very excitable, 12-year-old\". <br/>He argues companies will always need to have humans involved in the workplace, to take responsibility if things go wrong: \"If you take the human completely out of the loop, how do you manage accountability for some sort of catastrophic event happening?\"<br/>He, like other signatories, believes regulation will be needed to avoid the misuse of AI. <br/>Ms Purohit says a motive for signing was the need for rules to \"make sure that we don't just run off and create lots and lots of things without paying attention to the testing and the governance, and the assurance that sits behind it\".<br/>AI warning: 'Inevitable' jobs will be more automated<br/>Elon Musk announces new AI start-up<br/>Advanced AI risk to humanity - technology leaders<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

But civil rights groups say the technology is a threat to civil liberties, as the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports.<br/>\"We are not China; we do not want to be Big Brother,\" says Fran\u00e7ois Mattens, whose Paris-based AI company is bidding for part of the Olympics video surveillance contract.<br/>Under a recent law, police will be able to use CCTV algorithms to pick up anomalies such as crowd rushes, fights or unattended bags.<br/>The law explicitly rules out using facial recognition technology, as adopted by China, for example, in order to trace \"suspicious\" individuals.  <br/>But opponents say it is a thin end of the wedge. Even though the experimental period allowed by the law ends in March 2025, they fear the French government's real aim is to make the new security provisions permanent.<br/>\"We've seen this before at previous Olympic Games like in Japan, Brazil and Greece. What were supposed to be special security arrangements for the special circumstances of the games, ended up being normalised,\" says No\u00e9mie Levain, of the digital rights campaign group La Quadrature du Net (Squaring the Web).<br/>A version of the new AI security system is already in place in some police stations around France. One of the pioneers is the southern Paris suburb of Massy.<br/>\"Around the town we have 250 security cameras - far too many for our team of four to monitor,\" says Massy's mayor Nicolas Samsoen.<br/>\"So the AI device monitors all the cameras. And when it sees something it's been told to look out for - like a sudden grouping of people - it raises an alert.<br/>\"It's then up to the humans - the police officers - to examine the situation and see what should be the appropriate action. Maybe it's something serious, maybe it's not.<br/>\"The important thing is that it's humans who make the ultimate decision about how to react - not the computer. The algorithm is empowering humans.<br/>As a test, we abandoned a piece of luggage on the street not far from the police station. Thirty seconds later the alarm was raised and CCTV footage of the suitcase popped up on the control room screen. <br/>Previously of course the algorithm has had to be taught what an abandoned piece of luggage looks like - which is where the AI comes in. The developers have fed the programme a massive bank of different images of lone bags on the street - a bank which continues to grow as more images accumulate.<br/>Crucially though, this \"learning\" process does not happen at the client interface but only in the \"back-office\" at the developers. Massy police station has bought a self-standing product which monitors the cameras, but cannot itself acquire new knowledge.  <br/>Detecting unattended luggage is a relatively easy task. Much harder might be spotting a person on the ground in a crowd; or seeing the lump in a person's clothes that is a concealed weapon; or differentiating between the beginning of a fight and an innocent temporary increase in crowd density. <br/>A French start-up specialising in computer vision software, the XXII group, is waiting for further specifications from the French government before fine-tuning their bid for part of the Olympics video surveillance contract.<br/>\"We expect the government to want the AI to be able to detect fire, fighting, people on the ground and abandoned luggage,\" says XXII's Fran\u00e7ois Mattens. \"But they need to get their act together. <br/>\"In theory the new systems are supposed to be in place for the Rugby World Cup [in France] in September. But that is absolutely out of the question. It is all going to take a lot of time to put in place.\"<br/>Fran\u00e7ois Mattens and other developers are alive to the criticism that they are enabling unacceptable levels of state surveillance. But they insist on the safeguards.<br/>\"We will not - and cannot by law - provide facial recognition, so this is a wholly different operation from what you see in China,\" he says.<br/>\"What makes us attractive is that we provide security, but within the framework of the law and ethics.\"<br/>But according to digital rights activist No\u00e9mie Levain, this is only a \"narrative\" that developers are using to sell their product - knowing full well that the government will almost certainly favour French companies over foreign firms when it comes to awarding the Olympics contracts.<br/>\"They say it makes all the difference that here there will be no facial recognition. We say it is essentially the same,\" she says.<br/>\"AI video monitoring is a surveillance tool which allows the state to analyse our bodies, our behaviour, and decide whether it is normal or suspicious. Even without facial recognition, it enables mass control.<br/>\"We see it as just as scary as what is happening in China. It's the same principle of losing the right to be anonymous, the right to act how we want to act in public, the right not to be watched.\"<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might think<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Police raid Paris 2024 Olympics organisers' office<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

In fact, she signed up for it.<br/>\"It's a bit like that Black Mirror episode with Salma Hayek,\" Ms Yeo jokes.<br/>She was speaking to the BBC the day after the release of the new series of Charlie Brooker's Netflix show. In the first episode, actress Salma Hayek, playing a fictionalised version of herself, signs away her image to a production company.<br/>The deal allows it to use an artificial intelligence or AI-generated deepfake version of the Hollywood A-lister to \"star\" in their new TV drama. What she says and does in the show is controlled by the computer.<br/>The consequences for Ms Hayek - without spoiling the story - are not good.<br/>Concerns about the impact of AI are partly behind the first Hollywood actors' strike in more than four decades, bringing the US movie and television business to a halt.<br/>It comes after Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against the misuse of AI for its members.<br/>The actors' union has warned that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" as it prepared to dig in over the issue.<br/>However, Ms Yeo is not worried. She is one of a growing number of celebrities embracing AI-generated advertising.<br/>The new technology is being met with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Singapore celeb Jamie Yeo has embraced AI deepfakes<br/>Ms Yeo has just agreed a deal with financial technology firm Hugosave, which allows it to use a digitally manipulated likeness of her to sell their content.<br/>The process is fairly simple. She spends a couple of hours in front of a green screen to capture her face and movements, then a couple more hours in a recording studio to capture her voice.<br/>An AI programme then synchronises the images with the audio to create a digital alter-ego capable of saying practically anything. The results are uncanny.<br/>\"I do understand the concern, but this technology is here to stay,\" she says. \"So even if you don't embrace it because you're scared, there will be other people who will embrace it.\"<br/>Some already have. As part of his deal with PepsiCo, superstar footballer Lionel Messi allowed it to use a deepfake version of himself to advertise Lay's crisps.<br/>Not only can online users create personalised video messages from \"Lionel Messi\", they can get him to say it in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish.<br/>Fellow football superstar David Beckham and Hollywood legend Bruce Willis have also dabbled with deepfake technology - though, unlike Ms Yeo, they have so far stopped short of signing away full image rights.<br/>\"I think deepfakes will just become part of normal practice in the advertising industry over the next few years,\" says Dr Kirk Plangger, a marketing expert at King's College London.<br/>\"It opens the door to all kinds of creative options. They're able to micro-target consumers and are often extremely persuasive.\"<br/>The efficiency of the process also makes it attractive from a commercial point of view.<br/>\"You're not doing that much work for the money you're charging,\" Ms Yeo says.<br/>\"It's also good for the client on a budget because they get so much more content than from a normal shoot. So it works for everyone.\" <br/>The client - in this case Singapore-based Hugosave - agrees. <br/>\"Having this technology available means we can literally produce hundreds of videos in a matter of days. Compare that to the months, if not years, that we'd need if we were filming the content in the traditional way,\" says Braham Djidjelli, Hugosave's co-founder and chief product officer.<br/>\"We're able to leverage the benefit of AI while also retaining the human touch of a trusted local face - in this case Jamie's.\"<br/>But, as analysts such as Dr Plangger point out, there is a \"dark side\" to the technology. <br/>\"It's not something we can put back into the box,\" he says. \"The advertising industry needs to wake up to the risks as well as the possibilities of artificial intelligence. It means stepping back, as a society, and thinking about what is the proper or ethical use of this technology.\"<br/>One of the things Dr Plangger is referring to is a looming \"crisis of trust\", where consumers cannot tell between what is real or fake. This is something already being exploited by vested interests online and can range from synthetically manipulated pornography to misinformation to political messaging.<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>But there are also more practical risks for the talent voluntarily signing up to be deepfaked. Currently, there are no clear laws relating to AI to ensure your image is properly protected.<br/>For example, what happens if a brand uses your digital avatar to endorse a product that may damage your image or your alter-ego makes a joke in poor taste?<br/>\"We are in uncharted territory when it comes to AI and deepfake technology,\" says Tng Sheng Rong, an intellectual property lawyer at Rajah and Tann in Singapore. <br/>\"Many, many issues can arise. Who owns the intellectual property? Who do you go to for legal recourse? The truth of the matter is that the existing laws don't provide a robust enough regulatory framework to guard against these issues.\"<br/>That may be the final hurdle for advertisers before they start buying rights to digital versions of Hollywood A-listers, for example.<br/>At this early stage, Ms Yeo says she is very mindful of the risks, but her decision was informed mainly by trust - both in Hugosave and in the way business is done in Singapore.<br/>But ultimately, she says, it is about staying ahead of the curve.<br/>\"If you want to still be in the game, then you've got to learn how to be in it.

Exactly what you're getting with each box is random. Some compare them to buying a Kinder Egg or a packet of football stickers. Others say it's like using a slot machine.<br/>The UK government has spent three years figuring out what to do about them - from threats to ban their use for under-18s in the UK, to an edict last summer that games companies must create new rules to protect children and young people.<br/>Are they a gateway to gambling addiction? Or just a fun mechanic that enhances players' gaming experiences?<br/>Some countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands, think the former and have banned them.<br/>Last July, then Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said that because the evidence about loot boxes was still emerging, \"direct government intervention may risk unintended consequences\".<br/>The games industry should come up with measures itself before any new laws are introduced, she said.<br/>It's taken nearly 12 months for those measures to be agreed upon. <br/>Ukie has published principles that it believes will allow the industry to self-regulate the use of loot boxes.<br/>The first is a commitment to make available technological controls to effectively restrict anyone under 18 from acquiring a loot box without the consent or knowledge of a parent or guardian. Many of these controls are already available on games platforms but aren't as widely used as they could be. The new principles set out best-practice for their use in an effort to increase take-up. <br/>The second is to drive awareness of those controls with a public information campaign. An expert panel will be set up to share best practices on age assurance issues.<br/>Ukie says games companies will disclose the presence of loot boxes before someone chooses to buy a title, and games will have to show clear probabilities before the purchase of a loot box.<br/>The plans include rules on how loot boxes should be presented and a commitment to more lenient refund policies. <br/>There is also a proposal to tackle the black market that surrounds these purchases and do more research about their impact and use.<br/>Progress will be reviewed in 12 months.<br/>Some content creators have built careers on making exciting and entertaining videos around the use of loot boxes, and many players enjoy buying them responsibly every day.<br/>These regulations are largely designed to protect children and young people. However, they're not the only people who can develop an unhealthy relationship with the in-game mechanic. For Dave Sproson, buying loot boxes became a problem as an adult. <br/>He first came across one in a mobile game based on his favourite anime show. Soon he was getting frustrated as his progress began to slow, and so started buying boxes as a \"short cut\" to level-up his character.<br/>He would justify the purchases to himself by saying he was spending money to save the time it would take to enhance his characters through gameplay alone. For Mr Sproson, buying a loot box was the \"same feeling as scoring a goal in football\".<br/>\"As with any addiction, there's kind of an invisible line that's hard to pinpoint when I actually crossed it,\" he said.<br/>\"I started to realise that it was getting out of control when I could no longer sustain buying loot boxes with my income. I had to resort to using credit cards, which I'd never had before. I used payday loans. Over a period of 12 months, I had 28 from various different lenders.\"<br/>After a \u00a310,000 loan, he was struggling to keep his problem hidden. \"I started defaulting on loans. I forged my partner's signature to get a guarantee for a new loan.\"<br/>Mr Sproson's partner found out about his financial troubles with their baby due in a matter of weeks. Money earmarked for a new house and pushchairs was spent on clearing up the debt.<br/>\"We had to go to family and tell them what had happened to ask for help,\" he said. \"All along this journey there were times I lay in bed at night and I cried. I knew I had a son coming, I knew my partner wanted us to go for a house and I knew my credit score was in the toilet and I knew I'd gone too far.<br/>\"I was disgusted with myself, I was terrified. I didn't know if I would be around my son when he was born, whether I would be allowed? Worse than how I was feeling was how it made her feel - this was someone who trusted me unconditionally with money, with love and everything else and I'd betrayed it all.\"<br/>The vast majority of people who buy loot boxes in games don't end up with a compulsion like this. For many it is a fun and frivolous element of their gaming experience.  However cases like it, accompanied with criticism that some games have become \"pay-to-win\" and concerns over the addictive nature of the mechanic, were the basis of the government wanting action.<br/>By 2025, loot boxes will be responsible for generating an estimated $16bn in revenue for games companies across the world.<br/>Getting the balance right between protecting vulnerable users and allowing games companies the freedom to flourish culturally and economically has clearly been difficult. Given the length of time it has taken for any action, it is clear that the industry and the government have had different ideas about what should be done. <br/>In a statement, John Whittingdale, minister for the creative industries, said: \"We've been clear the video games industry needs to do more to protect children and adults from the harms associated with loot boxes. <br/>\"These new principles are a big step forward to make sure players can enjoy video games responsibly and safely. I look forward to seeing games companies put the plans into action and will be watching their progress closely.\"<br/>Mr Sproson now works as head of safer gambling in a risk management company. He and his partner reconciled and are now married - they have strict rules to restrict his spending. He bought his last loot box in July 2014.<br/>\"I'm still a big gaming fan and I still play now - with my eight-year-old son. But I make sure we play games where I can disable purchases. In my opinion you need to classify loot boxes as gambling. If you look at a loot box and look at a slot machine, there's no real difference.\"<br/>For more gaming content, go to Press X to Continue, the BBC Sounds gaming Podcast.<br/>Government says loot boxes will not be regulated<br/>Report blasts \"manipulative\" video game loot boxes<br/>In-game loot boxes linked to problem gambling<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The price paid was not made public.<br/>DeepMind is developing a program called AlphaFold, which has the potential to advance the discovery of new medicines by predicting the structure of almost every protein in the human body.<br/>An earlier DeepMind product called AlphaGo beat the top human player of the Chinese strategy game Go, Lee Se-dol, 4-1 in a tournament held in 2016.<br/>He later retired from the game, saying \"there is an entity that cannot be defeated\". <br/>It was considered at the time to be a major breakthrough for artificial intelligence.<br/>Mustafa Suleyman's views represent one of the challenges facing Ian Hogarth, a British entrepreneur and investor who has been appointed to lead the UK's AI taskforce. <br/>He took up the position five weeks ago.<br/>In his first interview since getting the job, Mr Hogarth told the BBC that while the UK was a good place for start-ups, it should also be easier for them to grow.<br/>\"We've had some great [tech] companies and some of them got bought early, you know - Skype got bought by eBay, DeepMind got bought by Google.<br/>\"I think really our ecosystem needs to rise to the next level of the challenge.\"<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>It's a view I hear often from small tech firms - they aim to be bought up by a US tech giant, rather than become a giant themselves.<br/>Emma McClenaghan and her partner Matt run an award-winning AI start-up in Northern Ireland but they struggle to access the infrastructure they need to advance their product.<br/>The week Emma contacted me, she said Twitter owner Elon Musk had purchased 10,000 specialised chips called GPUs, needed to build and train AI tools - and she had been waiting five months for a grant to buy one.<br/>\"That's the difference between us and them because it's going to take us, you know, four to seven days to train a model and if he's [able to] do it in minutes, then you know, we're never going to catch up,\" she said.<br/>Ian Hogarth thinks perhaps a future solution is for countries, rather than companies, to own this infrastructure.<br/>\"It is going to be a fundamental building block for the next generation of innovation,\" he said.<br/>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

She was on the lookout - for sharks.<br/>A native of Southampton, New York, Ms Steidle grew up going to the beach, longing to learn more about what lived beneath the surface. Everything changed when she picked up a drone in 2015. <br/>Since then, she has filmed humpback whales emerging from the deep to engulf prey in their giant maws, and a fleet of ghostly rays swimming in formation with the aid of a drone that can soar as high as 400 feet, or hover over the surface of the water. The astonishing images have even caught the eye of National Geographic. <br/>The sharks, she said, are the most exciting. Several of her videos show these formidable predators hunting schools of fish like a pack of aquatic wolves.<br/>\"The way they move and the way they interact with the species around them is fascinating,\" she said. \"It's like they're sharing a big buffet.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Joanna Steidle's footage reveals an underwater world hidden just out of sight.<br/>In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. <br/>The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images - great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase.<br/>Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters.<br/>Humans are not on the menu. But this summer, some sharks are coming too close for comfort.<br/>The water around Long Island has warmed due to climate change, becoming more hospitable to sharks. New laws have protected the sharks' primary food source - bunker fish - by banning harmful fishing practices. <br/>This means more sharks are heading closer to the shoreline to hunt the now plentiful bunker fish, with the potential to mistakenly nibble on humans getting in their way. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Why we need sharks in our oceans<br/>Shark bites are incredibly rare. According to the International Shark Attack File, New York state had only 8 unprovoked bites in 2022 and none were fatal. <br/>But at least four shark encounters occurred on Long Island over the recent 4 July weekend. In one instance, 15-year-old surfer Peter Banculli suffered a suspected shark bite near Fire Island. (He assured a Long Island news station he would soon be ready to \"start shredding again\".)<br/>As a result, Governor Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed.<br/>But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface. <br/>Drone footage also has the potential to spark fears about a species humans have been swimming alongside for years, according to Frank Quevedo, the executive director of the South Fork Natural History Museum (SOFO) in Long Island. <br/>\"Everybody that's seeing a shark now is documenting it and can blast it onto the internet on social media and millions of people can see it,\" he said. \"So people demonise sharks saying, 'Oh, they're in our waters, they're going to kill people.'\"<br/>A least once this summer, a drone has sparked unnecessary worries on the shoreline.<br/>Earlier this month, one drone operator, who mistook a school of large fish for a swarm of 50 sharks, caused a closure at Robert Moses State Beach.<br/>\"It caused a panic,\" Mr Quevedo said. <br/>Sharks still loom large in the public imagination as deadly man-eaters, thanks to the 1975 blockbuster Jaws, in which a great white shark menaced swimmers off the coast of Massachusetts.<br/>It has taken decades of research and education to try to shift the public perception of sharks and stop the debilitating hunting of great white sharks in particular, Mr Quevedo said.<br/>Some amateur drone enthusiasts believe that by capturing images of sharks peacefully coexisting alongside us, they can help dispel myths. <br/>Carlos Gauna, who takes drone videos of California's Malibu coastline as a hobby, has captured numerous images of juvenile great white sharks floating just feet from surfers - and leaving them alone.<br/>He posts the videos on his YouTube channel, The Malibu Artist, in the hopes of showing viewers a different perspective.<br/>\"You have this perception of sharks that they're going to be aggressive and they're just this hungry monster all the time,\" Mr Gauna told the BBC.<br/>\"It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,\" he said. \"They're just chillin'\".<br/>Jon Dodd, founder of Atlantic Shark Institute, believes drones have become a useful tool for researching the animals. \"They don't alter the movements of these sharks, so you can really study what they're doing in a natural environment,\" he said. <br/>Almost 3,000 miles away in the Hamptons, Mr Quevedo and his colleagues have used drones to document their conservation efforts, which involve tagging sharks and collecting data such as their size, sex and oxygen levels. <br/>Rather than use footage of sharks to scare people from the water, Mr Quevedo said officials should focus on educating swimmers about how their sharp-toothed neighbours operate.<br/>Why Sharks Attack<br/>After three fatal shark attacks in Egypt, this film asks if shark behaviour is changing.<br/>Watch on iPlayer (only in UK)<br/>On a sunny day this week, residents at Cooper's Beach in the Hamptons had already seen police flying drones overhead.<br/>Southampton resident Suzanne Moore said they made her feel safer. \"They're monitoring and then they let all the other people know,\" said the 69-year-old who was sunning with her friends.<br/> \"If the police spot them with drones, they won't let anyone in,\" her friend, 70-year-old Jen Cerrato, chimed in.<br/>The beachgoers said the increased drone surveillance did not make them more afraid of sharks. <br/>Ms Steidle, the shark photographer, criticised drone tactics that stigmatise sharks. <br/>She told the BBC that she filmed the animals quite close to the Hamptons shore. In one video, her drone spotted 13 sharks, including a juvenile great white shark, swimming mere hundreds of feet from the beach. She had never seen one attack a human.<br/>The technology has instead helped her uncover the enormity of the Atlantic Ocean, and the beauty of the sharks and other marine creatures who call it home.<br/>\"We're not alone here,\" she said. \"We share the space.\"<br/>Seeing sharks through her drone's eye \"reminds me of my smallness,\" she added. \"I'm just this tiny little speck, on this huge planet.\"<br/>Humans hundreds of times 'deadlier' than sharks<br/>Drone shows great white sharks swimming under surfers<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

So all of that is air pollution, whether it smells good or bad,\" she says.<br/>\"Indoor air pollution is huge, and it's a relatively unknown frontier, because even my next-door neighbour's house has a different air pollution fingerprint than my house would have,\" Dr Hicks says.<br/>Indoor air pollution is highly complex, little regulated, and often beyond individual control. For instance, road traffic produces nitrogen dioxide, while moisture and structural issues in buildings can lead to mould.<br/>Air purifiers with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can help. But the initial cost plus the energy to run them can be out of reach for some households.<br/>This is one reason that it's so appealing to think of potted plants as passively, and inexpensively, cleaning the air. Essentially, plant leaves take in carbon dioxide and other pollutants, which are then used in various plant processes or broken down.<br/>Especially important here are the community of micro-organisms and the growing medium (such as soil or compost), which in many studies do more to absorb pollutants than the plant itself. <br/>An influential NASA study from 1989 found that indoor plants could remove formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air. But the study was unrealistic for real-world conditions.<br/>In essence, an indoor forest would be required to meaningfully reduce VOCs in a home. <br/>\"You need an awful lot of plants in very well-lit space to make any measurable impact on the removal of VOCs and many other gases,\" says Tijana Blanusa, the principal horticultural scientist for the Royal Horticultural Society, as well as a researcher at the University of Reading.<br/>Similarly, for carbon dioxide, \"you need very large numbers of plants to actually have measurable effects at room scale.\"<br/>So is scaling-up the answer?<br/>Some researchers, including Tijana Blanusa, have moved on from individual potted plants to active (living) green walls, which can concentrate more plants and also filter air more efficiently due to the way air can be moved through them.<br/>She explains that with active green walls: \"Air from the room is being pushed or encouraged through the root systems over and above the level which would happen naturally if you just had the plants sitting in a pot.\"<br/>However, such green walls are expensive to install and maintain.<br/>So people continue to experiment with plants.<br/>When building consultancy Cundall moved into their current London office in 2015, they filled one of the meeting rooms, known as the Green Lab, with plants.<br/>The aim was to monitor and record the plants' impact on indoor air quality. But it was challenging to look after them all.<br/>It also became clear that the plants weren't having the same effect on air quality as the mechanical ventilation and air purification systems.<br/>The room now has a few large plants in the corners, as well as a small rectangle of preserved reindeer moss on the wall. The spongy moss is lovely to touch and look at, but has no ability to absorb pollutants.<br/>When clients ask about plants for improving air quality, Kavita Kumari, the associate director of Cundall's London office, advises them on plants' advantages and limitations.<br/>She recommends plants that are relatively low-maintenance while being able to reduce some VOCs and produce oxygen, though she acknowledges that these effects are modest.<br/>One such plant is the snake plant (a common houseplant also sometimes known by the sexist moniker mother-in-law's tongue, due to its sharp shape).<br/>Ms Kumari says that while most plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the day, this plant\u202fis able to do so at night as well.<br/>She says that simply opening a window to allow the outflow of indoor air pollutants doesn't work in highly built-up areas, where outdoor pollutants can enter at the same time.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Scientists are working on a new generation of plants bioengineered to make them especially efficient at purifying air.<br/>Researchers at the University of Washington have genetically modified pothos plants with a synthetic version of a \"green liver\" protein found in rabbits, which can process chloroform and benzene.<br/>The company Neoplants has also tweaked genes in pothos plants to enable them to essentially recycle certain VOCs. As well, the company has produced beneficial bacteria that are especially effective at breaking down VOCs, which are delivered to the plants' root systems. It's this microbiome rather than the plant itself that produces most of the plants' air-cleaning effects.<br/>However, even improving on the NASA results 30-fold, as Neoplants claims to do, wouldn't make it feasible to rely on plants alone to clean the air. <br/>So for now, the actual air-purification benefits of indoor plants are limited. They can't compete with air purifiers.<br/>But plants have other clear benefits - for instance on mood, creativity and productivity.<br/>Ms Kumari advises clients on complying with the targets set out by the WELL Building Standard, a certification for buildings that promotes health and wellbeing. One of these targets is to have 1% of the indoor surface covered by plants.<br/>This target falls under the \"Mind\" category rather than \"Air\", suggesting that evidence of the benefits of indoor plants is stronger for the mental health benefits than the air quality ones. As Ms Kumari comments, \"plants do give you a sense of calm.\"<br/>Ultimately, air-quality experts remain in favour of indoor plants.

Big tech was going to supercharge agriculture, one of the oldest industries in the world, and the revolution would start with salad leaves.<br/>Warehouse-grown greens, flourishing in trays neatly stacked beneath row upon row of glowing LEDs. It was lettuce - but sci-fi.<br/>US-based AeroFarms considered itself to be one of the leaders in the industry.<br/>\"We are so far above everybody else in this technology,\" AeroFarms' chief executive David Rosenberg boasted to the New Yorker in 2017. \"It will take years for the rest of the world to catch up.\"<br/>Hard times caught up with AeroFarms instead. In June, the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Mr Rosenberg stepped down.<br/>It is all part of a \"reset\" or \"pivot\", insists co-founder and chief marketing officer Marc Oshima: \"We're growing product every day, we're shipping product every day.\"<br/>But lately, AeroFarms has struggled to find enough capital to fuel its soaring ambition. \"The money just has not been there,\" admits Mr Oshima, though he adds that the firm still has some investors who are supplying \"millions of dollars\". <br/>AeroFarms famously designed its own indoor growing systems. \"We think it has served us well, we have unique technology,\" adds Mr Oshima.<br/>When asked whether initiatives, such as one targeting low income communities in Jersey City, New Jersey, will continue, he adds that these are currently \"being evaluated\".<br/>A spokeswoman for Jersey City says, \"We do not anticipate our operations to be interrupted in any way.\"<br/>A long list of other vertical farms have run into trouble in recent months.<br/>French firm Agricool went into receivership earlier this year, Pennsylvania-based Fifth Season shut down in late 2022, Iron Ox of California has laid off nearly half its workforce and Infarm has closed its operations in Europe - making 500 staff redundant.<br/>\"Infarm has decided to shift its geographical focus from Europe to high-potential regions better suited for indoor farming, with low energy prices and healthy market demand,\" the company says in a statement.<br/>Besides the major economic challenges that have hampered many industries during the last few years, within vertical farming a debate rages over the extent to which some companies may have set themselves up for a fall.<br/>\"My opinion is that we'll continue to see failures. It is bad,\" says Andrew Lloyd, chief operating officer at Intelligent Growth Solutions, which makes equipment for vertical farms. \"Many people are growing the wrong crops, they're very heavily focused on leafy greens.\"<br/>He also argues that some have foolishly attempted to design and build their own technology - such as robots that tend to the baby plants as they develop. <br/>That might sound like too easy a riposte for someone who sells such technology himself but Mr Lloyd does make a good point, says Mark Lefsrud at McGill University in Canada, who consults for the industry.<br/>\"I've seen to the extreme where one company redeveloped their own pipe,\" he says. \"Literally just a plastic pipe to transfer water through.<br/>\"I was like, 'I think the pipe has been developed'.\"<br/>What people don't often hear about vertical farming, though, is how an ability to care for plants, regardless of what technology you use, really matters, adds Mr Lefsrud.<br/>He says he has occasionally been called in by firms fretting over copious trays of crops that have started to die.<br/>\"You need somebody who's going to be full-time,\" he has told them, explaining that farming means giving constant attention to living things - not just firing up a few gadgets and waiting for the profits to roll in argues Mr Lefsrud.<br/>\"You have to be growing them properly all the time. You can't go, 'I'm not gonna work this weekend because I want to have a party' - and all the plants die on you. Which I've seen repetitively,\" he says.<br/>The industry has been blighted by \"hubris\", argues Chris Davies, chief executive and founder of Harvest London, which plans to open a new vertical farm in Beddington next year. The firm grows salad for companies including HSBC and Google.<br/>Mr Davies says he and his colleagues are trying to be cautious. For one thing, their new facility will be built near to a power-generating waste incinerator so that they can take advantage of cheap energy when it is available.<br/>\"Let's say we know that an hour from now power pricing is going to go up, we can just turn out the lights,\" he says. <br/>The firm has also successfully grown tomatoes, cucumbers and strawberries at a small scale and hopes to diversify its product line in the near future with these potentially higher value crops.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>It can be tricky to expand beyond growing just a few varieties of easy leafy greens, says David Meszaros, founder of Smartkas, a Dutch agricultural technology firm that owns the largest vertical farm in the UK - a 27,000 sq m facility in Harlow, Essex dedicated to growing strawberries.<br/>Dr Meszaros stresses that Smartkas operates a range of growing environments, including greenhouses, meaning the firm has not put all its eggs in the vertical farming basket alone. <br/>His company has still faced plenty of headaches lately, though. \"The big challenge came with the chip shortage,\" says Dr Meszaros, explaining how growing at one newly built facility was delayed by many months because Smartkas could not obtain the chips it required for the safety systems in robots tasked with moving around trays of plants.<br/>Without those chips, the robots would not have been able to detect collisions in the warehouse or dangerous levels of water or humidity, for example. <br/>Despite pitfalls, vertical farming still has a future, say many observers - even those who are critical of some business models. <br/>Growing more food indoors, and in urban places, is a matter of \"security\" says Paul Myers, managing director at Farm Urban, which is based in Liverpool. He mentions the veg shortage that hit British supermarkets earlier this year.<br/>\"What that highlights is that, actually, the UK should be investing in long-term solutions,\" he says.<br/>Britain is \"exposed\" to supply issues, agrees Jessica Davies at Lancaster University. She and colleagues published a study last year that suggested urban farming, including vertical farming, could boost agricultural production.<br/>For Mark Lefsrud, the vertical farming businesses falling by the wayside do not represent a death knell. Rather, they are a sign that the industry is maturing as the truly hardy growers emerge.<br/>\"It's a pruning that's required,\" he says. \"We do it to plants, so it makes sense to do it with businesses, too.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

If a child successfully found a Pok\u00e9mon then a computerised animation of the creature would appear on their handset's screen, superimposed on top of the actual view through the phone's camera.<br/>It proved irresistible to millions and millions of young users. But are adults equally impressed by the use of AR?<br/>Since Pok\u00e9mon Go's success, a growing number of consumer brands are continuing to embrace AR, such as Coca-Cola and US whiskey Jack Daniels. You use your phone camera to scan a QR code on the can or bottle label, and an animation or video pops up on your screen.<br/>Does this use of AR remain a novelty, a gimmick that most people ignore, or does it actually increase consumer engagement and sales?<br/>In 2021, US soft drink firm Jones Soda introduced its first AR campaign, which it called Reel Labels. If you scan an image on the bottle labels then it transforms into a short video.<br/>To create the videos the firm partnered with an initial 15 so-called influencers, including a skateboarder, a breakdancer, and a BMX bike rider. Since then the firm's customers have been able to send in their own videos to be featured. <br/>And last year Jones Soda worked with music labels Sub Pop and Hardly Art to promote videos from more than a dozen new bands.<br/>\"A brand's packaging is so much more than a container for a product,\" says Bohb Blair, Jones Soda's chief marketing officer. \"It's now an opportunity to make a consumer's moment with your product special.<br/>\"Content is a great way to do that, and AR is a fun and convenient distribution vehicle.\"<br/>Another drinks business that has used AR to connect with the music industry is Estonian milk brand Tere Piim. In 2019 it joined with the Eurovision Song Contest to enable customers to see mini digital animations of that year's entrants perform on their kitchen counters and tables. All they had to do was scan a label on the milk cartons.<br/>The AR technology was provided by Latvian software firm Overly. \"Although you may doubt the compatibility at first glance, milk and a song contest make a good cross-marketing duo,\" says Overly's chief executive Ainars Klavins.<br/>\"In this instance, a traditional milk carton became a new medium for broadcasting Eurovision songs. It inspired consumers who may not be existing viewers to explore the contestant line-up and choose their favourites.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>He adds that consumers, especially younger ones, are ready to engage with brands \"in the augmented reality realm\".<br/>While you'd expect those involved in helping firms create AR to sing its praises, what do independent experts think?<br/>Stuart Duff is a leading business psychologist, who studies how firms can best connect with consumers. He says that AR can help products seem more \"interesting, engaging and memorable\".<br/>\"Research has highlighted that using AR not only captures our attention more quickly but also increases the likelihood of committing information to memory. So while AR may seem like a gimmick, it offers a genuine alternative approach to lodging brands in our psyche.\"<br/>Jenny Stanley is managing director of Appetite Creative, a Madrid-based tech and marketing firm that helps consumer businesses create AR labels.<br/>She says that a product's label is already an example of \"extremely targeted marketing\", whose effectiveness only increases further when AR content is added.<br/>\"It's not only impactful, but also cost effective. The average cost per digital advertising click is \u00a31.50, whereas a click or scan on packaging is technically free, giving brands a compelling reason to use connected packaging.\"<br/>Yet, as Mr Klavins of Overly cautions, content is key. And by that he means that what the AR offers has to be interesting and engaging.<br/>\"The key point here is that quality content for augmented reality is vital. I always say that AR content should either inspire, educate or entertain. It has to do at least one of those things to transform from a novelty tech into a strategic tool that drives business value.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

That creates a force - called the Lorentz force - which acts on the sea water and propels the craft along.<br/>Without propellers or a drive shaft churning up the water, a working MHD drive could provide fast and completely silent travel.<br/>Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades and the original concept dates back to the 1960s.<br/>In 1992, the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation built Yamato-1, a 30m-long ship that tested a MHD drive.<br/>However, the drive was so heavy that the Yamato-1 could only manage to plod along at a speed of 6.6 knots. It also used up a lot of energy.<br/>But researchers say the project proved such a drive could work and provided useful data.<br/>\"Authentic information on defects and weak points, together with what should be made... when we carry out a Yamato-2 in the future,\" says Hiromitsu Kitagawa, visiting research fellow at the Ocean Policy Research Institute, of which the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation is now part.<br/>The Yamato project showed that much more powerful magnets would be needed, plus more robust electrodes - the parts of the drive which make contact with the water.<br/>According to Ms Swithenbank, the first of these problems may well be easily solvable now, with a new generation of magnets, developed by the nuclear fusion industry.<br/>Fusion is the reaction which powers stars. But to make it happen here on earth often requires extremely powerful magnets to contain swirling clouds of burning hot plasma.<br/>The force generated by these new magnets has been likened to double the pressure at the bottom of the deepest ocean trench.<br/>While more powerful magnets are now available, the second problem, how to protect the electrodes, still needs work.<br/>Metal corrodes when placed in seawater and an electrical current accelerates that process. Some types of magnetic field have the same corrosive effect.<br/>On the Yamato-1 it was found that electrodes were losing around 3% of their mass per year.<br/>Jeffrey Long, a research chemist at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), is a battery specialist, and is expecting to take part in the Darpa programme, along with colleague Zachary Neale.<br/>\"If you have ever placed paper clips in a cup of salt water connected to a 9-volt battery, you'd notice the water turns colour because the metal is corroding,\" he says.<br/>\"Essentially, we want electrodes that don't corrode, while still supporting the high electrical current density required for effective operation.\"<br/>However, improvements in coatings by the fuel cell and battery industries in recent years mean this problem may well now be solvable.<br/>While these are important advances, other problems remain.<br/>Passing a current across seawater breaks the hydrogen-oxygen bond, creating gas bubbles on the electrodes which creates resistance and reduces the efficiency of the MHD.<br/>Potential solutions will have to be tested, including gas-diffusing electrodes created by the fuel cell industry. Other techniques sweep away the bubbles before they build up.<br/>Finally, there's the issue of erosion, with collapsing bubbles creating pitting. \"It's like having sandpaper on your electrode,\" says Ms Swithenbank. Here too, though, work in other industries is showing promise.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>If the Darpa team can overcome the problems, the advantages will be enormous.<br/>Without moving parts, MHD drives should need much less maintenance than existing propulsion systems.<br/>\"But the real reason everybody's interested in it is that, because there's no moving parts, it's also much quieter,\" says Ms Swithenbank. \"There's no question that for national defence, that's a huge advantage.\"<br/>A quiet system, without dangerous propellers thrashing around, could be better for wildlife as well.<br/>Work on the project will begin in earnest next spring, with a two-year programme to develop materials - in particular, electrode materials - followed by an 18-month period to design, manufacture and test the drive. <br/>The aim is to produce a prototype MHD drive that could propel a small ship, but that could be scaled up to propel a container ship or a military vessel. <br/>The drive would also have to demonstrate an energy efficiency that could match existing propeller systems.<br/>\"Do I see this being used in commercial ships in the next five years? No. But it's absolutely possible in the future,\" say Ms Swithenbank.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

However, the name of the service conjures up a rather different meaning to viewers who caught a seminal BBC drama aired almost 40 years ago.<br/>As families settled down in front of the TV on a Sunday evening in September 1984, little did they suspect the impact of the horror to come.<br/>At 9:30 the BBC aired the 112-minute film Threads.<br/>With only four channels to choose from, the harrowing post-apocalyptic Cold War drama found its way into millions of homes - and led to sleepless nights for many who saw the Sheffield-based dystopian drama unfold.<br/>Written by Kes author Barry Hines, the film showed the unrelenting impact of a thermonuclear blast on ordinary Britons - in graphic detail.<br/>Produced on a low budget and directed by documentary maker Mick Jackson, who would later go on to helm Hollywood blockbuster The Bodyguard, it managed to horrify people at a time when nuclear war seemed a very real possibility.<br/>From a kitchen sink drama focused around a young couple in a South Yorkshire, then riven by the Miners' Strike, Threads shows society breaking down as nuclear winter sets in.<br/>\"It never loses its power, ever. I have never seen anything so horrible and bleak in my life,\" said Stephen Brotherstone.<br/>He and David Lawrence are the authors of Scarred for Life - a series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.<br/>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it \"wrecked\" his head.<br/>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.<br/>\"I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much.\"<br/>Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had \"looked really special\" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.<br/>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama's impact.<br/>\"We said 'wow if we can pull this off it'll be great,' but I didn't have a clue that it held that much of a punch.\"<br/>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.<br/>\"There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room,\" the actor recalled.<br/>\"People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. <br/>\"People say it is the most scary thing they've ever seen in their life and remains so to this day.\"<br/>Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR.<br/>Lawrence and Brotherstone are currently working on a third volume of their series, which looks at the Cold War and includes a chapter on Threads.<br/>\"I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,\" said Lawrence.<br/>\"You've got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you've got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there's every nightmare you've ever had on screen.\"<br/>Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990.<br/>\"It wasn't a question of if they pressed the button, but when are they going to press the button,\" he said.<br/>Jimmy, played by Dinsdale, and Ruth, played by Karen Meagher, have just learnt that Ruth is expecting a baby as the film opens.<br/>The growing tensions between East and West appear on TV and newspapers as Sheffield's residents go about their daily lives, ignoring the looming threat.<br/>\"There's the build-up to war, but you don't see it you, just hear about it in the background as they are discussing what to have for tea,\" Lawrence said.<br/>\"They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think.\"<br/>For Dinsdale, it was a \"fantastic\" piece of writing by Hines.<br/>\"They are everyman and everywoman, they are just normal people with normal lives, there's nothing special about them and this very special event happens to them and it just draws you in.\"<br/>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.<br/>\"Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up,\" he said.<br/>\"It is very 70s, 80s Play for Today, but I think it works in its favour because it was so British.<br/>\"That was a house that looked like mine, there's Woolworths getting vaporised, it really struck home.\"<br/>The final parts of the film follow the characters as they struggle through the nuclear winter in the aftermath of the blasts.<br/>\"It is watching everyone die and it is watching society collapse forever. <br/>\"It makes the point we are never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other,\" Brotherstone said.<br/>For the actors and crew it was \"a ball\" to make, according to Dinsdale.<br/>\"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever.\"<br/>To him though, Threads remains a \"seminal\" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.<br/>\"It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created,\" he said.<br/>\"It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.<br/>\"I am very proud of it.\"<br/>Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Shells struck the house, she says.<br/>There's emotion in her voice as she explains what the building used to be like. <br/>An old photo she sends via WhatsApp shows a large property with balconies and a pond in the front garden. Images taken after the attack capture the soot-stained, crumbling walls left by the assault.<br/>But Mrs Pylypenko and her family now have a new home in the garden of their old one - a factory-made house that was assembled in just a few days last autumn.<br/>The building, a donation to the family, was one of the first homes of its kind built by Ukrainian firm HOMErs, which says its designs could benefit millions of refugees and people still in Ukraine who have lost their properties in the conflict. <br/>HOMErs, previously known as Tera Monada, has a range of modular houses, made from standardised factory-made units that slot together quickly to achieve the desired final design. <br/>Given the extent of damage in Ukraine, any reconstruction efforts will have to be both fast and cost-effective. In March, the World Bank estimated that it could take $411bn (\u00a3323bn) to rebuild the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has, in the past, put the figure at $1tn.<br/>\"There are about 200 destroyed houses in my community,\" says Mrs Pylypenko. \"Modular houses are absolutely important for us.\"<br/>Her new property is significantly smaller than her old one, she notes. But it is the only such building in her village and accommodates six, including Mrs Pylypenko's 10-month old granddaughter. Her daughter, who was pregnant at the time of the Russian attack on the village last year, was brought to Poland by volunteers where she gave birth.<br/>Lots of Ukrainians, sadly, know this predicament, says HOMErs co-founder Alex Stepura.<br/>\"In our own company, so many of our people lost their accommodations, their houses, their apartments,\" he says, pointing out how makeshift shipping container homes have become a common sight in the country during the past year or so.<br/>In order to provide a more appropriate solution, Mr Stepura and his colleagues have developed modular homes that are comprised of multiple three-by-three metre units. An entire house as well as furniture and white goods can be flat-packed and loaded on a single lorry, he says.<br/>To date, the company has supplied around 50 homes to families in Ukraine, a spokesman for HOMErs says. In a video shared by the firm, factory workers slot a wall section into a foundation piece and rotate a lever downwards, locking the two tightly together, demonstrating the ease of construction.<br/>HOMErs' Kyiv factory is currently producing around 10 homes per month, according to Mr Stepura's business partner Chris Baxter, a British investor. But the pair are hoping to raise roughly \u20ac5m (\u00a34.2m) to build a new factory in Slovakia, which would boost production to a couple of hundred homes per month, or so.<br/>Mr Stepura has decades of experience in engineering and robotics. His companies produce vending machines and drones, for example. Some of those drones are currently deployed on reconnaissance missions for the Ukrainian military, he adds.<br/>The modular homes should be high-tech but also intuitive and easy to use - the architectural equivalent of a new smartphone, he suggests.<br/>It must be said that there's nothing new about this idea. Modular homes been around for decades and many companies, including Ikea, have invested in the concept. Mr Baxter argues that the HOMErs modules will attain a good balance of quality and affordability. <br/>One grid-connected, fully furnished, three-module home costs $18,000 (\u00a314,000), with additional modules priced at $6,000. The designs might offer a good solution for Ukrainian refugees currently living abroad who hope one day to return home, suggests Mr Baxter.<br/>\"Those houses can be packed up and moved together with the people to repopulate the country as quickly as possible without having to wait for all of this construction to take place,\" he says.<br/>Such a thing is possible in theory, though \"little tested\" says Gemma Burgess at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research.<br/>That said, rebuilding towns and cities with modular properties could be a smart way to go, she adds.<br/>\"In Ukraine, if you're trying to build large volumes of housing, it might be a much cheaper, more efficient way to do it.\"<br/>There are other ventures in Ukraine using the latest technology to help communities rebuild after shelling or missile strikes. Take the 3D-printed school in Lviv, which is currently undergoing a second phase of construction. Or the prefabricated concrete building panels developed by Ukrainian firm Well-being ConTech.<br/>All such efforts ought to avoid repeating the rush to build properties - often of low standard - that followed the Second World War in countries including the UK, adds Dr Burgess: \"Quality and sustainability is going to be key.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Stepura emphasises his commitment to high quality design and accurate manufacturing. Mr Baxter is taking delivery of one of the modular homes himself, where he will live while his UK house is renovated in the coming months. He points out that his version will come with pre-installed solar panels on the roof. <br/>The modular homes also feature 200mm-thick insulation in their walls - roughly twice the UK standard.<br/>Mrs Pylypenko praises the facilities that came with her new house: an electric stove, a fridge, dishwasher and washing machine. And although the house is small - there are bunk beds for the adults, as well as a cot for the baby - it is a big step up from living in the damaged basement of her former house, a situation she had endured for months.<br/>\"We didn't know how to live,\" she says. Even now, life remains very hard. Every day, through the window of her modular house, Mrs Pylypenko sees the charred remnants of her old Ukrainian villa - a tattered ruin that was once her home.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

But Mr Namasivayasivam recently divulged his blunder to dozens of people at an event in Toronto, Canada.<br/>His mistake seven years ago involved his work trying to ensure that when bands and solo artists submitted 10-second long, looping videos to accompany their songs, they would play smoothly on people's mobile phones.<br/>At the time the videos were being trialled in Canada.<br/>They should have been streamed to users' handsets just the one time, but due to Mr Namasivayasivam's error they were constantly re-downloaded onto people's phones every 10 seconds.  <br/>For those not connected to wi-fi, it quickly used up all their data.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam only became aware of the mistake when he read complaints on an online forum. One person had written that it had \"killed his data\".<br/>Another said: \"I hate this feature so much. Whoever came up with this, should be fired and shot.\"<br/>While most of us might have wanted to keep such memories locked away, Mr Namasivayasivam revealed all into a microphone while standing on a stage in front of room full of strangers.<br/>The gathering was part of a global movement, with more than 250 cities now participating in public showcases of how entrepreneurs and other business leaders, mainly in the tech space, fail and then recover from their gaffes.<br/>The idea is that it is cathartic to talk about such things, and everyone in attendance can learn from the mistakes, and ask questions.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam told the crowd in Toronto: \"It was at this moment that I messed up, and this is where the feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety and shame came flooding in.\"<br/>He was one of three speakers at the event. Afterwards he told the BBC that it felt good to share his face-palm moment, \"and how someone can bounce back from that embarrassment\".<br/>Today Mr Namasivayasivam is the founder and chief executive of Skillify, a Toronto-based provider of software coding training.<br/>Bill Murray (not the famous actor), works for a software firm. He was in the audience watching Mr Namasivayasivam, and says that the story particularly resonated with him. <br/>\"If you've never made any mistakes as a coder, you probably weren't innovating enough,\" says Mr Murray.<br/>\"Most people want to hide their embarrassing moments or failures, but because the speakers open the floor with some of their toughest moments, it sets the stage for everyone attending to let their guard down and really get to know one another.\"<br/>Tech entrepreneurs shouldn't only celebrate their wins, Mr Murray adds. \"When you study someone's success, it's almost like asking them what lottery numbers they played to win.<br/>\"Of course you can learn lots from successful people, but to me the concept of openly talking about your failures felt like there was much more to learn from.\"<br/>Marsha Druker, who organises the regular failure talks in Toronto, says she looks for speakers willing to not just be open about their professional failure story.<br/>Instead she also wants them \"to tell audiences about what they learned about that mistake, now that they have had time to reflect on it\".<br/>She says a common theme to what tech entrepreneurs face when they fail is \"a story of resilience and coming out at the other side, and recognising that failure shouldn't be a taboo topic we don't talk about openly\".<br/>Venturing into that often off-limits topic is the reason why such celebrations of failure began in Mexico City in 2012, says Carlos Zimbr\u00f3n, a Mexican tech entrepreneur who first came up with the idea for the evenings.<br/>During a barbeque at home with other friends, Mr Zimbr\u00f3n says he expressed how boring it was to attend \"typical conference with keynote speakers talking about their successes, and how it was rare to hear the B-side of that story\".<br/>Soon after, he and his friends held the first failure talk in the same backyard space.<br/>As word spread about the Mexico City event, other entrepreneurs in cities in 80 countries around the world have since started their own parallel nights. They hold monthly talks, coupled with a Q&A session after each speaker.<br/>Mr Zimbron says that the talks, many of which are later uploaded to YouTube, \"can be inspiring for people who may have gone through the same problems\".<br/>He adds: \"When you can connect to someone else's mistakes, and can see how vulnerable they are in sharing that story, that's where you can connect with other entrepreneurs.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Leah Edwards, is both a director at US investment fund Lighter Capital, and a lecturer on leadership and innovation at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>She says she loves that these public talks about business failure are \"normalizing the fact that something is hard, and that it takes a number of at-bats [a baseball term for a batter's turn] in order to find the right combination of teams and market opportunity, and the right product or service\".<br/>Ms Edwards adds Silicon Valley has long had a high tolerance for start-ups not succeeding, and that it is good to see this spreading.<br/>\"There will always be entrepreneurs whose companies don't work out in the end, but they pick themselves back up and try again,\" she says. \"I'm excited to see this recognition of that kind of resilience spreading into other geographies and cultures.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

It rattled me, there was a lot of swearing and finger pointing. But it was very well done. It was uncomfortable in a good way.\" <br/>The play, called Smile, was about the life of legendary Dundee United manager Jim McLean. <br/>Ms Doyle had been expecting a conventional performance of a play featuring the blunt-spoken manager when she arrived at the Dundee Repertory earlier this year. <br/>Before the curtain rose she accepted an invite to a section of the foyer where VR headsets were on offer to curious theatre-goers.<br/>The intense preview sequence came from Box Office VR, a firm founded by Kelman and Gemma Greig-Kicks of Box Office VR.<br/>Having spent careers in film-making and touring theatre, the husband and wife team, hope that VR can extend the reach of theatre to untapped audiences.<br/>Anyone who wants to use the service would have to buy their own headset, but Box Office VR is designed to work on cheap systems like Google Cardboard VR Glasses. <br/>To watch a show the customer has to insert their phone into the VR device.<br/>Once the phone is place, the users strap the box, effectively a pair of cardboard goggles, around their head and plug in their own headphones. <br/>The app then streams a recorded performance to the phone, which the VR headset amplifies, taking the viewer into a 180 degree view of the stage and auditorium. <br/>It is aimed at anyone who might not think of visiting the theatre, or who cannot physically reach a venue. <br/>So far that's a small audience. Around a 100 people have downloaded a show through Box Office VR.<br/>Ms Greig-Kicks admits that Box Office VR is \"a passion project\" for her and her husband.<br/>Yet she says the potential is real. \"It means they can host shows that wouldn't otherwise be able to tour due to size or cost.\" <br/>Box Office VR has filmed other productions, including one for London's Sadler's Wells dance theatre which has a Digital Stage label for its own online repertoire. <br/>Other established names such as the York Theatre Royal have also experimented with making shows available via VR headsets.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While an interesting use case for virtual reality, it's not going to make much of a dent in the billions of dollars invested in VR by technology giants like Meta (the owner of Facebook) and more recently Apple, which launched its VR system in June.<br/>But for cash-strapped regional theatre any exposure or extra revenue is welcome. <br/>The technology is also an exciting way to introduce schoolchildren to theatre.<br/>Lisa Kilbride teaches drama at Monifieth High School in Dundee and has harnessed Box Office VR for her mission to spread a love of theatre. <br/>The school has a large rural catchment area, meaning some pupils have to travel in for nearly an hour by bus. So bolting on a trip to see a play in the evening creates problems for pupils with a far-flung home to return to. <br/>Her drama teaching covers much more than acting. Ms Kilbride's pupils are studying for Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) exams and picking up skills needed in theatre directing, lighting or sound. <br/>The VR headset sparked excitement in her 12 and 13 year old SQA students. No-one turned down the chance to pull on the simple goggles. <br/>She is sure they're a valuable addition to her teaching toolkit and uses them to lure reluctant theatre-goers into a whole new experience. <br/>\"It's easy to pause and rewind the action and all of the kids talked about the lighting, the sound, the set.\"<br/>Sharing the thrill of theatre means everything to Ms Kilbride. \"If one child says 'I want to go to the theatre' after using the headset then I'm happy.\"<br/>The action on stage unfolds in front of the viewer, but the VR goggles also let them look about the theatre. <br/>Ms Kilbride wanted her students to become familiar with a whole world surrounding the stage, one they had never visited.  <br/>When she asked her students why they were tilting their heads up and around they explained they were glancing at the theatre itself. They had never seen anything like the interior of the Dundee Rep before. <br/>Liam Sinclair, business manager at the Dundee Rep, knows about the impact an early encounter with theatre can have. He owes his career to \"a brilliant drama teacher at school\" who left him intrigued by the whole question of how theatre works. <br/>Mr Sinclair explains how Smile brought a new audience, who loved both football and the Dundee United team, to his venue. <br/>And Box Office VR made a huge impression on the late manager's living relatives. <br/>\"We did this film version of it with Box Office VR and created the sample sessions using VR goggles. Jim's family came to the press night of the show and got really involved, putting the googles on. When they watched the VR they teared up. It was really like Jim was present and in the room.\" <br/>He realised that in this case technology had triggered deeper emotions than a stage performance. \"VR is a very personal experience as opposed to theatre, which is communal.\" <br/>Ms Doyle confirms this take on her memorable night out. \"Once you're sworn at by Jim McLean you stay sworn at!\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Under laws known as \"permitted development rights\", more than 10,000 properties - such as former offices - were turned into homes in 2021-2022.<br/>The Local Government Association has warned that offices, shops and barns are not always suitable for housing, and could result in the creation of poor quality homes.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Anthony Browne: Cambridge is \"already growing incredibly rapidly\" but a lack of water means expansion plans are \"undeliverable\u201d.<br/>Mr Gove also wants to ease rules on building extensions to commercial buildings and repurposing agricultural buildings. <br/>In order to speed up big developments, the government will invest \u00a324m to train up planning authorities. Half of the funding is newly-allocated, while the other half will come from the department's existing budget. <br/>There will also be \u00a313.5m for what it calls a \"super squad\" of planners to unblock certain projects - a development in Cambridge will be the team's first task. Developers will be asked to pay higher fees to fund improvements to the planning system.<br/>However, in an early sign that Mr Gove's plans may attract criticism from the government's own backbenchers, Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire Anthony Browne has tweeted: \"I will do everything I can to stop the government's nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge, where all major developments are now blocked by the Environment Agency because we have quite literally run out of water.\"<br/>Asked about the criticism, Mr Sunak said: \"No one is doing mass house building in Cambridge, this is about adding a new urban quarter to Cambridge.\" <br/>He added that developments would be done \"in dialogue with local communities\" and that Westminster should not \"ride roughshod\" over their views. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Labour's Lisa Nandy claims the government is \"at war with itself\" over housing<br/>The issue of building more homes has been a tricky one for the government. While there is great demand for housing, particularly among younger voters struggling to get on the property ladder, new housing developments have proved unpopular in Conservative heartlands.<br/>The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said Mr Gove's policies were \"a positive start\" but \"nowhere near the scale or ambition that is needed\".<br/>The body's director of public impact, Rhys Moore, said the changes to the planning process were \"relatively piecemeal\" and called for more investment in social housing - homes available for lower rents.<br/>Polly Neate, head of housing charity Shelter, praised Mr Gove for being a minister who is \"not afraid to build\" but warned that plans to convert takeaways into homes risked creating \"poor quality, unsafe homes\".<br/>In May, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would give English councils more powers to build on green belt land, but added that new developments would not be permitted if they affected \"the beauty of our countryside\". <br/>He said he would take \"tough decisions\" and \"back the builders, not the blockers\".  <br/>Labour has also said it would reintroduce local housing targets and change the planning system to make it easier to build on brownfield sites. <br/>Housing targets to be diluted after Tory revolt<br/>What's happened to the government's housebuilding target?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

However, they can claim \u00a3342 for each day they attend the House. <br/>Members of the Lords play a role in shaping and scrutinising bills before the become law, as well as holding the government to account. <br/>In June, the government confirmed Mr Johnson had nominated seven people for life peerages in his resignation honours list. <br/>Others included Conservative London Assembly member and former mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey and other former advisers to Mr Johnson Ben Gascoigne and Ross Kempsell.<br/>The list was controversial, with some arguing Lord Bailey should decline his peerage over a lockdown party for his staff in December 2020, which is being reinvestigated by the Metropolitan Police. <br/>Key allies rewarded in Johnson resignation honours list<br/>Mayor defends Boris Johnson peerage<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

and I don't want to do anything to add to that, I want to make it easier,\" he added.<br/>\"We're going to make progress towards net zero, but we're going to do that in a proportionate and pragmatic way that doesn't unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their life.\"<br/>The comments come after other ministers suggested a change in approach on some green policies in recent weeks.<br/>On Sunday, Housing Secretary Michael Gove said the government should relax a deadline for landlords to achieve new energy efficiency targets, adding that ministers were \"asking too much too quickly\".<br/>Earlier this month, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he has ended government funding for low-traffic neighbourhoods, and called for councils to look again at unpopular zones in their areas.<br/>The Times has reported that ministers are considering cutting off councils' access to the national number plate database used to enforce the schemes.<br/>The newspaper also reported they are considering an \"Aston Martin exemption\" to the 2030 car sales deadline, under which smaller carmakers would be given longer to switch to electric vehicles. <br/>Mr Sunak's commitment to green policies was recently questioned by Lord Zac Goldsmith, who quit as a Foreign Office Minister last month and attacked the PM's \"apathy\" over climate change.<br/>Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Sunak said reaching net zero - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - was \"important to me\".<br/>He added that the UK should be proud of its record in this area, adding it was \"better than the vast majority of other countries that we're compared to\".<br/>Shadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy said the Uxbridge by-election had sent a \"very clear message\" to Labour that the cost of living was \"really biting for people\".<br/>She added that pressures on living costs had \"worsened\" since schemes such as Ulez were designed, adding: \"We will respond to that, and will reflect on that\".<br/>\"We're absolutely committed to cleaning up our air, but we've got to make sure we do this in a way that is helpful, and affordable for people who are currently are really struggling,\" she added.<br/>What does net zero mean?<br/>ULEZ expansion: Contested claims examined<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

But for the BBC to apologise, I'm very, very pleased,\" Mr Farage said.<br/>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Farage said he had had to publish a lot of material in order to clear up misinformation in the wake of the 4 July story.<br/>\"I had to go to very great lengths and great personal damage to undo the story,\" Mr Farage said. <br/>\"There is no fault or no blame on the BBC.

Therefore, I would like to apologise to Mr Farage,\" Mr Jack continued.<br/>Mr Farage later said:  \"Jack says, in the tweet, that his information came from a trusted and senior source. I would suggest that it may well have been a very senior source.\"<br/>On 21 July, the BBC updated its original article to say it had \"not been accurate\".  Mr Farage then asked for a formal apology from the BBC.<br/>On Monday, the BBC said on its Corrections and Clarifications website:  \"We acknowledge that the information we reported - that Coutts' decision on Mr Farage's account did not involve considerations about his political views - turned out not to be accurate and have apologised to Mr Farage.\"<br/>When Coutts decided to close Mr Farage's account, he said it did not give him a reason.<br/>Mr Farage subsequently obtained a document looking at his suitability as a Coutts customer.<br/>The 40-page document provided to Mr Farage included minutes from a meeting in November last year reviewing his account.<br/>The document flagged concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\", and also raised concerns about the reputational risk of having Mr Farage as a client.<br/>It said that to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts' \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".<br/>Mr Farage said the BBC had fallen for \"spin\" and he had been \"cancelled\" for his political views.<br/>The boss of NatWest Group, Dame Alison Rose, apologised on Thursday to Mr Farage for what she called the \"deeply inappropriate\" comments made in the document.<br/>She also said that she was commissioning a full review of Coutts' processes on bank account closures.<br/>Mr Farage has called for Dame Alison to be questioned by MPs.<br/>Speaking on GB News on Monday evening, Mr Farage said he had now submitted a subject access request (a request for a copy of information held about you) to NatWest and had raised his case with the Information Commissioner's Office.<br/>He also disclosed the contents of the letter sent to him on Monday by the BBC's Deborah Turness, in which she apologised, saying: \"I can understand why you feel this story has contributed to you being put through a considerable and humiliating amount of publicity.\"<br/>The Treasury has called a meeting with bank bosses over account closures, following the row between Mr Farage and NatWest.<br/>The BBC will hope its apology will draw a line under the story.  <br/>The fallout is an insight into a key tenet of journalism - sourcing stories.

Others changed from storage and industrial premises. <br/>The government is now planning to launch a new consultation on allowing commercial premises - such as a shop or a takeaway - to be changed into residential accommodation.<br/>However, former PM Boris Johnson announced similar plans back in 2020. There was also a consultation on supporting housing delivery in 2021, which looked at creating new permitted development rights. <br/>A commitment to build one million new homes in England by the end Parliament was also reaffirmed by Mr Gove.<br/>This would be in December 2024 - five years since the current Parliament first sat. The pledge was originally made in the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto - a set of promises set out by political parties ahead of an election. <br/>So how is the government doing?<br/>Between 2019 and 2022 (the latest available data), 687,390 additional homes were built in England. <br/>This means - in order to meet the one million target - more than 300,000 homes will need to be built in the next year and a half. <br/>In 2021-22, nearly 233,000 additional homes were built. This includes converted properties as well as new builds. <br/>The government also has a second target - to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. However, this one has never been met. <br/>The Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee has said the government is not on track to fulfil this pledge.<br/>Setting up the \"Office for Place\" was another of Mr Gove's proposals.<br/>Described as a \"new body\", the Office would ensure housing was designed to a high standard. It would also give local communities a say in the look of new developments. <br/>The government's press release said that the Office for Place \"will be launched today\".<br/>However, this may be a surprise to the former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, who gave a speech two years ago on 20 July 2021 launching the Office for Place. <br/>What has actually changed is that the Office for Place has gone from being a small team within Mr Gove's department to being a legally-constituted, arm's-length body.<br/>A \"new \u00a324 million Planning Skills Delivery Fund\" was also announced by Mr Gove.<br/>The money, the government says, will be used to speed up housing developments and improve planning capacity.<br/>But only half of the \u00a324m is new funding. The government told the BBC that while \u00a312m is new funding allocated to the Department, the other half would come from its existing budget. <br/>A great deal of Mr Gove's speech was given over to plans for large numbers of new homes and lab space in Cambridge. <br/>He announced the establishment of a Cambridge Delivery Group to work out how to do this - although it was only allocated \u00a35m to start work.<br/>These plans are new, although there has been significant local opposition in newspaper reports ahead of the announcement.<br/>The government's Levelling Up White Paper from February 2022 talked about how research funding was concentrated in Oxford, Cambridge and the South East of England.<br/>That same document also talked about the \u00a3500m City Deal with Greater Cambridge, investing in infrastructure, housing and skills.<br/>BBC Verify asked the Department for Levelling Up to set out which of the announcements were new.

Labour's Keir Mather, 25, won in Selby and Ainsty, North Yorkshire, overturning a 20,137 majority to become the youngest sitting MP.<br/>The Conservatives clung on narrowly in the third by-election, in Uxbridge, Boris Johnson's former seat, despite a big swing to Labour.<br/>Sir Keir said that while the by-election win in North Yorkshire should give Labour \"every reason to be confident\", the loss in Uxbridge showed there was \"still a long way to go\". <br/>The Conservative win in Uxbridge sparked debates about both parties' green policies. <br/>Sir Keir told the BBC the Ulez plan had cost Labour victory - but Mr Khan has defended the measure as the \"right one\".<br/>Speaking during a visit to Shefford in Nadine Dorries' constituency of Mid Bedfordshire, the Labour leader told journalists: \"I don't think there is any doubt that Ulez was the reason that we lost the election in Uxbridge.\"<br/>Sir Keir said he had spoken to the London mayor, adding: \"But we're not sitting back, we're not looking over our shoulder. We're pressing forward.\" <br/>Sources close to Mr Khan told the BBC he was in \"constructive listening mode\" but added that he had no plans to delay the scheme's expansion at the end of August.<br/>Asked whether Labour needs to rethink its climate polices, Sir Keir said: \"When it comes to green commitments, it's not a question of whether they should be done, of course it needs to be done - it's how they're done. <br/>\"So there's a discussion to be had about that.\"<br/>Mr Tuckwell, the winning candidate in Uxbridge, said the \"damaging and costly Ulez policy\" had cost Labour the chance of winning the seat.<br/>The Ulez is a \u00a312.50 daily charge for driving in London, applicable if the vehicle does not meet certain emission standards. It initially covered the same central area as the congestion charge before widening to the North and South Circular roads in 2021. <br/>A further expansion to cover all London boroughs is due to start on 29 August. <br/>On Friday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Uxbridge result showed that \"when you don't listen to voters, you don't win elections\".<br/>Cities need clean air, she said, but she warned that people who needed new vehicles must get \"proper compensation and support\" so that the policy does not come \"at the cost of working families\".<br/>Some on the right of the Conservative party say that pulling back from some green policies would prove popular with voters, at a time when families are feeling cost-of-living pressures.<br/>Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, chairman of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, has suggested delaying the ban on new diesel and petrol cars, pushing it back \"at least\" five years to 2035. <br/>Downing Street sources say there are no plans to change climate targets - but that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will try to set his party apart from Labour in the coming months.<br/>As the major parties digest the by-election results, ex-climate minister Lord Ian Duncan, a Conservative, warned that if Sir Keir and Rishi Sunak do not put politics aside and agree a common approach to climate change, people will face \"serious challenges\".<br/>Lord Duncan, who was the parliamentary under secretary for climate change from July 2019 to February 2020, said a \"bipartisan approach\" was needed from both parties to \"get behind\" common climate policies. <br/>The UK government's net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, said it would be an \"abdication\" of responsibility if ministers \"play politics\" with environmental policies.<br/>Mr Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood, said: \"The net zero review I chaired demonstrated that net zero isn't just an environmental policy, but a key economic driver of future growth and investment that can transform Britain for the better, but this requires all political parties not to play politics with safeguarding our futures.\"<br/>He urged politicians to prioritise \"the lives and health of the public and the opportunity for economic growth\" ahead of \"gamesmanship\".  <br/>\"It is also really bad politics, given that the environment and taking action on climate change consistently polls third in the issues that voters care about,\" he added. <br/>Labour debates its disagreements after mixed by-election results<br/>Starmer won't say whether he backs ULEZ expansion<br/>Khan backs Ulez after Starmer by-election criticism<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

It continued producing coal until 2008.<br/>She was Sir Tony's special envoy in Iraq and she campaigned on the NHS following the death of her husband Owen Roberts in 2012.<br/>Sir Tony called her a \"courageous, fearless, principled political campaigner\" who campaigned for the \"poor and oppressed\" throughout the world. <br/>\"She didn't flinch from speaking her mind, no matter what the personal or political cost,\" he said. <br/>\"She fought the case of those employed in the coal industry, persuading my government to correct the failure to compensate former miners for the ill health they suffered through mining.<br/>\"And having spent a large part of her life standing up against the brutal repression of the Kurdish people in Iraq, she supported the removal of Saddam Hussein, not only when it was relatively easy to do so, but when the going got tough.\"<br/>Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer also paid tribute, saying: \"Ann was a leading figure in the Labour Party, dedicating her life to our movement.\"<br/>First Minster Mark Drakeford said: \"She was a fearless campaigner, a defender of human rights and a trailblazer for female politicians, but above all of these - a long-term, dedicated servant of the people of Cynon Valley.\"<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She was one of a kind.\"<br/>Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd group leader, said he was \"saddened to hear of the passing of Ann Clwyd\". <br/>\"A formidable figure, she never shied away from fighting for her beliefs, standing on principle no matter who that may have upset,\" he tweeted.<br/>\"She was a passionate servant of the people of the Cynon Valley and will be deeply missed.\"<br/>Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said Ms Clwyd was a \"pioneer and the only political female role model for women in Wales over a long period\". <br/>\"She was a true radical and was inspired by her early years serving as a Euro MP before going on to make a significant impact in Westminster,\" she tweeted.<br/>Beth Winter, who took over Ms Clwyd as Labour MP for Cynon Valley, said her \"thoughts are with her family and friends at this difficult time\".<br/>\"Her work over so many years for women's rights, international justice and the miners will be remembered,\" she wrote.<br/>In a tweet, Carwyn Jones, former first minister and Member of the Senedd said: \"Ann served her constituency faithfully for so many years. My thoughts are very much with her family.\"<br/>And Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted that Ms Clwyd had been a \"determined voice for the people she represented\". <br/>\"She will be much missed. My condolences to her family,\" she added.<br/>Ms Clwyd died peacefully at home in Cardiff on Friday evening \"with her family and cats around her\". <br/>They don't make them like that any more.<br/>A conviction politician who managed to stand up for those close to home and those abroad, to rise to positions of seniority in her party, but not let that get in the way of what she thought was right. <br/>Despite the scrapes and the high-profile interests further afield, to someone with Cynon Valley heritage, home seemed closest to her heart.<br/>The reversed decision to stand down, the plunge into the darkness to save Tower and, when it really hurt, her heart-breaking desire to shine a light on the failings of the NHS. <br/>And on a personal level she was great fun to interview - woe betide you if you weren't completely on your game. <br/>Longest serving Welsh Labour MP to step down<br/>MP wins fight to defend her seat<br/>Obituary: Ann Clwyd<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

However, the legal requirement to provide one when someone has registered online is not within our remit to change.\"<br/>Pamela Bloomer, from Downpatrick, County Down, has multiple sclerosis - she said she re-registered on the electoral register in 2021 by post so did not receive a DRN. <br/>She submitted a postal vote application in March this year, alongside applications for her husband and her son, who has learning disabilities.<br/>Both men were successfully able to vote by post, although her husband was asked to resubmit his application with a DRN, which she said he asked the Electoral Office to send to him by email.<br/>Mrs Bloomer did not hear anything about her application until two weeks before the election when she was told it had been rejected as she had not included her DRN.<br/>The deadline for postal vote applications had already passed by this time, meaning she was unable to re-apply.<br/>\"Luckily I was able to ask a relative for a lift and managed to vote in person,\" Mrs Bloomer said.<br/>\"I'm fortunate; I'm in my 50s. But if I was older - in my 70s or 80s - there is no way I could have done that. I wouldn't have been able to vote.<br/>\"My local councillor said it had happened to a lot of people across his constituency. It seems farcical. <br/>\"If they are going to go down the digital road, they need to let everyone know what their number is. <br/>\"What's wrong with sending it out again when reminding people to vote?\"<br/>May Herron, from Castlewellan, County Down, asked one of her councillors to help with her postal vote application.<br/>Despite sending it ahead of the deadline, the 87-year-old received a letter the day before the election telling her it had been rejected due to a missing DRN.<br/>Relatives brought her to vote in person, only for her to be told by officials that she had already voted by post.<br/>Her daughter, Eileen Jones, said it caused her mother a lot of stress. <br/>\"The people at the voting desk asked her to fill in some paperwork so she could vote but Mum came away not knowing if she did or not. She was very upset,\" she said.<br/>\"We thought we were doing a good thing trying to get a postal vote so everything would be organised. <br/>\"I didn't want to take her to the voting station in case she tripped and fell.<br/>\"I don't even know what a DRN is. I have no idea what my number is and I re-registered for the electoral roll online.\"<br/>A report by the Electoral Commission, published in September, found the main reason for postal and proxy votes being rejected in the Northern Ireland Assembly election in May 2022 was due to the DRN not being provided.<br/>This accounted for more than 60% of the total 6,031 rejected applications to vote by post or proxy.<br/>The commission called on the UK government to review the DRN process \"to ensure it does not prevent people from accessing their vote\". <br/>A spokesman said: \"Ahead of the local council elections we ran a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the DRN, targeting groups who were more likely to need a postal or proxy vote. <br/>\"Despite this, it appears from early feedback that the DRN continues to be an issue.\" <br/>How does voting work in NI council elections?<br/>Sinn F\u00e9in now largest party in NI local government<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

to outer London.<br/>The winning Conservative candidate, Steve Tuckwell, said Sadiq Khan's \"damaging and costly Ulez policy\" had lost Labour the seat.<br/>Sir Keir Starmer said Labour's Mayor of London needed to \"reflect\" on the policy, but stopped short of saying it should be scrapped.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also attributed the Conservative win to voter anger over Ulez - and claimed the result showed the next general election was not a \"done deal\".<br/>Mr Sunak said: \"When people are confronted with a real choice, a choice on a matter of substance, they vote Conservative.<br/>\"That's what the general election is going to be about.\"<br/>But overall, the trio of by-election results show what the opinion polls have suggested for months - Mr Sunak faces a deep challenge at that election, which is expected to take place next year.<br/>Having three by-elections on the same night is unusual, especially for a prime minister less than a year into the job.<br/>The last time Labour secured a by-election swing as large as it did in Selby and Ainsty was in the 1990s - which ended with the Conservatives suffering a landslide defeat.<br/>Keir Mather, 25, is the first MP to be born after Labour's victory in 1997.<br/>He will also become the youngest MP in the House of Commons after overturning a 20,000 Conservative majority.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>We've got to double down and stick to our plan -

we didn't take it in 1997 when we had a landslide victory\".<br/>He said Ulez was \"the reason we didn't win there yesterday\", saying \"we've all got to reflect on that, including the mayor\".<br/>He declined to say whether he believed the Ulez expansion should be paused or scrapped, despite being repeatedly pressed by BBC Political Editor Chris Mason to say what he meant by \"reflect\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The Labour leader is pressed on what he means by the need to \"reflect\" on expanding London's Ulez zone.<br/>Sadiq Khan said he was disappointed Labour had not taken a constituency previously held by former prime minister Boris Johnson, but noted it had \"never been Labour in my lifetime\". <br/>He said clean air was \"a human right, not a privilege\", adding \"Londoners are struggling through this cost-of-living crisis, but Londoners are also suffering the consequences of air pollution\". <br/>He acknowledged that some people were worried about the costs of Ulez, but took a swipe at the government, saying it was \"a shame\" ministers had not offered \"a penny of support\" towards a scrappage scheme for polluting - generally older - vehicles. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>The Mayor of London defends the Ulez expansion which was a big issue in the Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election.<br/>Mr Khan has argued that making the clean-air zone three times larger from 29 August will improve London's air quality, but it has proved hugely contentious in outer London areas like Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>During the campaign, Labour's candidate Danny Beales said he wanted the expansion halted because of the cost-of-living crisis.<br/>In his victory speech, Mr Tuckwell said Mr Khan's \"damaging and costly Ulez policy\" had lost Labour the seat. <br/>\"This wasn't the campaign Labour expected and Keir Starmer and his mayor Sadiq Khan need to sit up and listen to the Uxbridge and South Ruislip residents,\" he  <br/>He later met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a cafe in Uxbridge, where Mr Sunak said that \"when confronted with the actual reality of the Labour Party, when there's an actual choice on a matter of substance at stake, people vote Conservative\".<br/>Earlier, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Uxbridge result was related to Ulez and showed that \"when you don't listen to voters, you don't win elections\". <br/>\"There is a concern that we have to make sure that whatever is implemented is not at the cost of working families,\" she told BBC Breakfast. <br/>Ms Rayner added that cities needed clean air, but people who had to replace polluting vehicles also needed \"proper compensation and support from the government\".<br/>Asked whether she would be urging Mr Khan to drop the policy, she said the party would be \"getting round the table\" and would continue to work with the London mayor \"to get a decent scrappage scheme\".<br/>An ultra low emission zone was initially proposed by then-Conservative mayor Boris Johnson in 2013 and introduced in central London in 2019, expanding a previous low-emission zone for larger vehicles like buses, lorries and coaches that was itself introduced in 2008.<br/>Under Mr Khan, it was extended to cover the area within the North and South Circular roads in 2021.<br/>The new expansion will see the zone's outer borders reach Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey.<br/>Drivers must pay \u00a312.50 per day if they drive a vehicle which doesn't meet modern emission standards: generally, diesel vehicles that are more than seven years old, or petrol vehicles that are more than 17 years old. If they do not pay, drivers face a maximum \u00a3180 fine.<br/>The by-election took place in Uxbridge and South Ruislip after Boris Johnson decided to step down as an MP last month.<br/>Despite its disappointment in failing to take the outer London constituency, Labour made history by overturning its biggest majority at a by-election since 1945 in Selby and Ainsty. <br/>The Liberal Democrats won the Somerton and Frome by-election by more than 11,000 votes. <br/>Starmer won't say whether he backs ULEZ expansion<br/>ULEZ expansion: Contested claims examined<br/>Labour MPs call for ULEZ scrappage scheme review<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

although he has not said this was why he quit.  <br/>In Somerton and Frome Lib Dem Sarah Dyke, a Somerset councillor with a farming background, secured a dramatic victory, winning 21,187 votes, while Conservative Faye Purbrick trailed in second with 10,179 votes. <br/>In her victory speech Ms Dyke thanked \"lifelong Conservative voters\" who had voted Lib Dem for the first time, as well as Labour and Green supporters who had \"lent\" their votes. <br/>She said the public had been \"let down and taken for granted for far too long\" by the Conservatives, with the government \"too busy being a circus of chaos\".  <br/>The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Tory MP David Warburton, following allegations of drug-taking and sexual misconduct. <br/>Mr Warburton, who had held Somerton and Frome since 2015, resigned as an MP last month, admitting he had taken cocaine but denying the claims of sexual harassment. <br/>Ms Dyke accused Mr Warburton, who was suspended from the Conservative parliamentary party last April, of being an \"absent\" MP and said people had been \"left without a voice in Parliament for far too long\". <br/>South-west England was a former stronghold for the Lib Dems until their near wipe-out in 2015 after they went into coalition with the Tories. <br/>However, last year they overturned a majority of more than 24,000 in the Tiverton and Honiton by-election to win the Devon seat, and they also took control of Somerset Council from the Tories.  <br/>Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the \"stunning victory shows the Liberal Democrats are firmly back in the West Country\" and that the public are \"fed up with Rishi Sunak's out-of-touch Conservative government\". <br/>It is the party's fourth by-election gain since 2019, although this has not translated into major advances in national polls. <br/>Deputy leader Daisy Cooper told the BBC there were around 15 seats with smaller majorities than Somerton and Frome in the West Country, which the Lib Dems would be targeting at the next general election. <br/>Pressed on whether the Lib Dems could still persuade Labour supporters to lend their votes in a general election, Ms Cooper said: \"It has been done in a general election [before] and we hope very much we can do at the next general election as well.\"<br/>Labour had hoped to deliver a triple by-election defeat for the Tories by taking the west London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which had a majority of 7,210. <br/>But Conservative Steve Tuckwell edged ahead in a closely fought contest which saw Conservative and Labour votes recounted. <br/>Mr Tuckwell, who opposed the Ulez expansion, made the issue central to his campaign, with activists saying it was raised frequently by voters on the the doorstep.<br/>Labour's Danny Beales, who came second with 13,470 votes compared to Mr Tuckwell's 13,965, had sought to distance himself from the policy, arguing it was not the right time to expand the charge amid a cost-of-living crisis. <br/>However, the Tories highlighted how the expansion of the daily charge for cars which fail to meet emissions standards to outer London was the policy of a Labour mayor. <br/>In his victory speech, new MP Mr Tuckwell said Mr Khan's \"damaging and costly Ulez policy\" lost Labour the seat. <br/>Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Uxbridge result was related to Ulez and showed that \"when you don't listen to voters you don't win elections\". <br/>\"There is a concern that we have to make sure that whatever is implemented is not at the cost of working families,\" she told BBC Breakfast. <br/>Ms Rayner added that cities needed clean air but people who had to replace polluting vehicles also needed \"proper compensation and support from the government\". <br/>Asked whether she would be urging Mr Khan to drop the policy she said the party would be \"getting round the table\" and would continue to work with the London mayor \"to get a decent scrappage scheme\". <br/>Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands accused Labour leader Sir Keir of a \"flip-flop approach to politics\", saying he initially backed the Ulez expansion before appearing to change his mind. Sir Keir refused to take a side on the issue in a BBC interview earlier this month. <br/>Mr Hands told the BBC his party had \"defied the odds\" by holding on to Uxbridge but blamed Tory voters staying at home for losses in Selby and Somerton, vowing to retake the seats at the next general election. <br/>The by-election in Uxbridge was triggered by Mr Johnson's resignation, after the former prime minister claimed he was \"forced out\" by an inquiry which found he misled Parliament over lockdown parties at Downing Street.<br/>Labour by-election win a cry for change, says Starmer<br/>Not a rout but still a bad set of results for Tories<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

That will not be possible come the next general election when 650 seats will be up for grabs.<br/>Liberal Democrats have also traditionally benefitted from by-elections, which some voters see as an opportunity \"send a message\" to the government of the day, by abandoning their usual party preferences in favour of the candidate most likely to beat the candidate of the ruling party.<br/>Seats won in by-elections aren't always easy to defend come the next general elections - as Sarah Olney found to her cost when she lost in Richmond Park in 2017 (although she won it back two years later). <br/>With a healthy 11,000 majority Ms Dyke will feel more confident of being able to hold on to Somerton and Frome come the next general election. <br/>The new MP, born in 1971, comes from what her party calls a \"Somerset farming family\" with links to the local area going back 250 years.<br/>She attended Warminster School in Wiltshire before going on to study agricultural and business studies at Harper Adams University in Shropshire. <br/>She owns 60 sheep - something evident from photos on her Instagram page - along with four dogs and one cat. <br/>Allow Instagram content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Instagram.

She also thanked Labour and Green supporters who \"lent\" her their votes. <br/>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"This stunning victory shows the Liberal Democrats are firmly back in the West Country.\"<br/>The by-election was triggered after David Warburton resigned as an MP. <br/>Mr Warburton had been sitting as an independent MP after being suspended from the Conservatives in April 2022, when claims of drug use and sexual misconduct were made against him. <br/>He admitted drug-taking but denies any sexual misconduct and an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations were withdrawn.<br/>Responding to his party's defeat, David Fothergill, leader of the Conservative group on Somerset Council, said: \"Clearly there's a national picture and we recognise what's happening in the polls but equally there's the local stuff as well and we've had an MP here who stood down 15 months ago with some really serious accusations against him.<br/>\"Some of which he has admitted to since and I think people are pretty grumpy about that.<br/>\"The circumstances here are very different because we had that local element of an MP really that went rogue.\"<br/>Dyke promises to be 'active' MP after Lib Dem win<br/>Not a rout but still a bad set of results for Tories<br/>Big defeats for Tories but party holds Uxbridge<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

That potentially leaves almost enough to meet the cost of that change to the benefits system.<br/>So the argument from some in Labour's ranks is not for uncosted policies - it is that more policies be agreed, and costed.<br/>The Left-wing group Momentum is running a campaign to lobby delegates to back more radical policies. <br/>These include rent controls. There may be  a compromise which would allow regional mayors to impose them. <br/>The group is also calling for the nationalisation of energy and water companies. It is a priority for Labour's biggest union funder, Unite, to bring energy into public ownership.<br/>Momentum also wants a commitment to a \u00a315 an hour minimum wage inscribed in Labour's official policy documents. They also want a commitment to reinstate the international development department, which has been folded into the foreign office, and to meet the aid target of 0.7% of GDP.<br/>Some amendments - mostly, though not entirely, from supporters of the leadership - have been agreed even before this weekend's meeting gets under way. <br/>These include making it clear a Labour government would scrap the Home Office's Rwanda policy, improve early years education and renationalise rail.<br/>However, if the leadership is defeated on any issues it will have two get-out clauses. <br/>First, the National Policy Forum draws up the Official Policy Programme. But this isn't the same as the manifesto.<br/>There is a further meeting to agree that and some policies won't make the cut.<br/>Second, there will be wording in the agreed policy documents which will say: \"Labour's fiscal rules are non-negotiable.<br/>\"They will apply to every decision taken by a Labour government - with no exceptions.\"<br/>So if shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves believes an agreed policy is unaffordable, it won't happen. <br/>But the more immediate priority will be to try to show united front, even though the \"hard choices\" on spending are proving uncomfortable for some party members and unions alike.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Let him write to me and tell me how to thank him.\"<br/>Mr Prystaiko said last week there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".<br/>\"We're not expecting anybody to fight for us, we only ask for equipment,\" he said, adding \"Ben can call me and tell me anything he wants,\" he told Sky News.<br/>He had been in his post in London since 2020 but on Friday Mr Zelensky issued a presidential decree announcing his sacking, saying he had also been removed as Ukraine's representative to the International Maritime Organization.<br/>Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he was \"sad to say goodbye\" to Mr Prystaiko, calling him \"a great Ukrainian ambassador and friend to this country\".<br/>In a separate development, the first road to be officially named after President Zelensky in the UK was unveiled in Harlow, a town just north of London.<br/>Mr Prystaiko was due to be at the event on Friday morning where Fifth Avenue was renamed Zelenskyy Avenue - but the ambassador was fired as he was in a car on the way to the Essex town, it is understood. The president's name is officially spelt with a double y, but the single y spelling is now widely used.<br/>Only last week Mr Prystaiko was spotted watching the Wimbledon tennis championship in the royal box, when Ukraine's Elina Svitolina was knocked out in the ladies' singles semi-final.<br/>President Zelensky has fired ambassadors before, dismissing five at once a year ago in what was seen as a reshuffle.<br/>But it was the controversial ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, whose sacking was particularly notable. <br/>Known for his outspoken social media presence, he had become a familiar face in Germany with repeated appeals for military aid to Ukraine.<br/>However, he was seen to have stepped out of line when he accused Chancellor Olaf Scholz of acting like a \"sulky liver sausage\" when the German leader was slow to take up a presidential invitation to visit Kyiv.<br/>\"This is about the most brutal war of extermination since the Nazi invasion of Ukraine, it's not kindergarten,\" complained Mr Melnyk, who is now Ukraine's deputy foreign minister.<br/>Nato shows Ukraine it can't get everything it wants<br/>Nato refuses to give Ukraine membership timeframe<br/>Zelensky admits slow progress in Ukraine offensive<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Coutts, a private bank, is owned by the NatWest Group.<br/>In the letter to Mr Farage she said she believed \"very strongly that freedom of expression and access to banking are fundamental to our society and it is absolutely not our policy to exit a customer on the basis of legally held political and personal views\".<br/>Mr Farage had put in a request to the bank to see documents relating to the decision to close his Coutts account. <br/>The BBC had previously reported that it had been told that Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold required to hold an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.<br/>The 40-page document given to Mr Farage, published by the Daily Mail, included minutes from a meeting in November last year reviewing his suitability as a client.<br/>It stated continuing to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts's \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".<br/>It mentioned Mr Farage's retweet of a Ricky Gervais joke about trans women and his friendship with tennis player Novak Djokovic, who is opposed to Covid vaccinations. <br/>It gave several examples, including his comparing Black Lives Matter protesters to the Taliban, and his characterisation of the RNLI as a \"taxi-service\" for illegal immigrants, to flag concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\".<br/>On Thursday Dame Alison also reiterated her offer to Mr Farage of alternative banking arrangements with NatWest and said she wanted to ensure they provide \"a better, more transparent experience for all our customers in the future.\"<br/>Following her apology, Mr Farage was asked if he thought that she should now resign.<br/>\"I think what needs to happen is the Treasury select committee needs to reconvene, come out of recess, and let's give her the opportunity to tell us the truth,\" he told reporters.<br/>Mr Farage also said the Telegraph had reported how the BBC's business editor Simon Jack had sat next to Dame Alison at a dinner on 3 July and the next day he had then been called by Mr Jack and told \"the reason my bank account had been closed was that I had insufficient funds in the account.\"<br/>He said: \"I want to know, did Alison Rose breach my client confidentiality? Did she break GDPR rules?\"<br/>Parliament is now in recess until September.<br/>Asked whether it would reconvene in the meantime to discuss the issue, a spokesman for the Treasury Select Committee said it will be calling on \"relevant people as witnesses and keep our programme under constant review at our regular meetings\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Ros Atkins examines Nigel Farage and Coutts bank account closure dispute<br/>The apology to Mr Farage came after the Treasury announced plans to subject UK banks to stricter rules over closing customer accounts.<br/>Banks will have to explain why they are closing accounts and they will have to give a notice period of 90 days before closing an account, to allow people more time to appeal against the decision.<br/>The new rules are likely to be brought in after the summer, the BBC understands.<br/>The changes will not take away a bank's right to close accounts of people deemed to be a reputational or political risk.<br/>Instead, it will boost transparency for customers, the Treasury said.<br/>Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said: \"Banks occupy a privileged place in society and it is right that we fairly balance the rights of banks to act in their commercial interest with the right for everyone to express themselves freely.\"<br/>Dame Alison said she welcomed the plans and would implement the recommendations.<br/>The Treasury began looking at the issue in January after PayPal temporarily suspended several accounts last year.<br/>On Wednesday  Rishi Sunak warned it \"wouldn't be right if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech\".<br/>The bank boss caught up in the Nigel Farage row<br/>Banks face threat to licences over Farage account row<br/>Farage launches fresh attack over Coutts bank closure<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The two countries fought a war over the issue, after Argentine forces invaded the islands in 1982. <br/>Earlier this year, Argentina pulled out of a co-operation deal signed in 2016 and has been pushing for talks on sovereignty.<br/>The reference to \"Islas Malvinas\" came in an EU statement issued following a Brussels summit with CELAC, a group of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries that includes Argentina. <br/>It is the first summit the organisation has held with CELAC since the UK left the EU in early 2020.<br/>It read: \"Regarding the question of sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas/Falkland Islands, the European Union took note of CELAC's historical position based on the importance of dialogue and respect for international law in the peaceful solution of disputes\".<br/>Asked by British reporters about the use of \"Malvinas\", Mr Sunak's spokesman replied: \"The prime minister's view is that it would have been entirely unacceptable for the EU to question the Falkland Islanders' right to decide their own future.<br/>\"To be clear, the Falkland Islands are British, that was the choice of the islanders themselves,\" he said, noting the results of a 2013 referendum where they voted overwhelmingly to remain a UK territory.<br/>\"The EU has rightly now clarified that their position on the Falklands has not changed after their regrettable choice of words,\" he added.<br/>In a tweet, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Argentina and the EU should \"listen to\" the \"democratic choice\" of Falkland Islanders. <br/>The Argentine foreign ministry has celebrated the reference to the sovereignty issue as a \"triumph of Argentine diplomacy\", a sentiment echoed in some Argentine media reports.<br/>But unlike media in the UK, neither the country's media nor its government has honed in on the name used for the contested territory in the summit's final declaration. <br/>They have instead focused on the fact that the \"Malvinas question\" was included at all as the Falklands dispute was not mentioned in statements after the last full EU-CELAC summit in 2015, or the inaugural summit in 2013. <br/>There are reports that the UK mounted a diplomatic effort to dissuade the EU from mentioning the dispute in the final statement. <br/>However, the EU has insisted it has not changed its position on the dispute.<br/>Foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano added it was not able to \"express any position\" because its 27 member states had not adopted a collective view on the matter.<br/>\"The EU is always ready to listen to the position of our partners and take note of that,\" he added.<br/>\"In that spirit, the EU has taken note of the interest shown by Argentina and the CELAC states in addressing the question of the Falklands/Islas Malvinas.\"<br/>In a press release, the Falklands Islands government said it was \"hugely disappointed\" by the language used in the EU's statement.<br/>Teslyn Barkman, deputy chair of the territory's Legislative Assembly, urged EU countries to \"respect the wishes of the Falkland Islanders and refer to us by our proper name\".<br/>The Falklands were the subject of a brief but bitter war between Britain and Argentina in 1982, after Argentine forces landed on the islands to stake a territorial claim.<br/>The conflict lasted 74 days - with 655 Argentinian, 255 British and three Falkland Islander deaths - before British forces regained full control on 14 June 1982.<br/>Falkland Islands profile<br/>Falklands vote to stay UK territory<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

I wish the Treasury all the best for the times ahead, and I will be cheering on from the sidelines.\"<br/>Throughout her campaign to be Tory leader, Ms Truss blamed \"Treasury orthodoxy\" for slow economic growth over recent years.<br/>Ms Truss, a former Treasury minister, accused her old department of promoting an \"abacus economics\" and insisted there needed to be a greater focus on stimulating economic growth.<br/>She promised to boost the economy through \"bold\" tax cuts - a move that her leadership rival and successor as prime minister, Mr Sunak, predicted would stoke further inflation.<br/>Ms Truss was ultimately forced to ditch her economic plan and quit as as prime minister after a Tory revolt sapped her of authority.<br/>Truss criticised over Treasury boss sacking<br/>The rise and fall of Liz Truss<br/>Top Tory MP reveals chaos of vote that sank Truss<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This is due to start on 29 August 2023.<br/>The mayor's office said it was needed to tackle air pollution, congestion and the climate emergency.<br/>Some other UK cities have their own, different clean air zones.<br/>Low emission zones have been introduced to clean up the air, with the aim of making people healthier and reducing the burden on the NHS. <br/>Petrol and diesel vehicles emit the CO2 that warms our planet, but this scheme is principally aimed not at fighting climate change but reducing levels of two key air pollutants - nitrogen dioxide (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). <br/>Those pollutants have been blamed for causing thousands of premature deaths and stunting the growth of children's lungs. <br/>For the Ulez expansion, \u00a3110m has been set aside for a scrappage scheme, for people on low incomes or disability benefits, some very small businesses and London-based charities.<br/>Eligible drivers can get up to \u00a32,000 for scrapping a car. The amount of money on offer differs for vans and motorbikes.<br/>Changes to the scheme's criteria were made in June.<br/>There is also a grace period for small businesses and charities who have already ordered a new compliant van or minibus, or booked retro-fitting.<br/>The latest expansion of Ulez has proved divisive. Clean air campaigners support it. <br/>However, some residents, businesses and politicians have expressed serious concerns. They include the financial impact during a cost of living squeeze, and the nine month-long notice period.<br/>Some people affected say the scrappage scheme won't help them. The cost of second-hand Ulez-compliant cars has also risen.<br/>Five Conservative-run councils launched legal action over the decision to expand Ulez. There have also been public protests.<br/>The mayor has defended the plan, arguing it is necessary to help prevent health conditions related to air pollution and even excess deaths. Preparations such as installing cameras have continued.<br/>The number of older polluting vehicles that have entered the Ulez has fallen dramatically with 97% now meeting the cleaner standards. <br/>Within that area it is estimated that NOx emissions have fallen by 26% since 2019 with PM2.5 emissions falling by 19% over the same period.  <br/>Air quality has improved as a result but all Londoners still live in areas exceeding World Health Organization guidelines for both pollutants.<br/>There are low emission zones in a number of European countries, and they vary by vehicle type and emissions.<br/>Italy has the most zones in Europe - some of them permanent, many seasonal - followed by Germany, according to the Urban Access Regulations website.<br/>In Paris, a zero emission zone is planned for 2030.<br/>Khan backs Ulez after Starmer by-election criticism<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

It's a name rich in Labour history: Keir Hardie was the party's first leader.<br/>If Labour won on this scale nationally, they would be in government with a colossal majority.<br/>But hang on a minute.<br/>The party that has campaigned so fruitfully for so long on the perceived failings of Boris Johnson has failed to take Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the very seat he used to represent.<br/>Just days ago, the Conservatives were ready to blame what they described privately as \"Long Boris\" to explain away their losses.<br/>In other words, don't blame us, blame the prime minister before last.<br/>But now they have won where he was the MP, and lost in two places where he wasn't. <br/>Downing Street had not anticipated a photo opportunity where smiles would feature today.<br/>But before some of us had reached for the breakfast cereal Rishi Sunak was beaming in Uxbridge.<br/>And his message is one we will keep hearing, I suspect: the general election is not a done deal, and where voters see what he will claim is the \"reality of Labour\" they vote Conservative.<br/>To hear Conservatives this morning talking about Uxbridge was to hear those swimming through the roughest of rough political seas, and then seeing an unlikely raft upon which to climb, and breathe a brief sigh of relief.<br/>Labour are disappointed to lose in Uxbridge.<br/>Publicly, and more candidly in private, they blame the expansion of London's Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez), a policy idea blamed by many voters on the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.<br/>\"If you run on a ticket about the cost of living but you are blamed for adding 90 quid a week to the cost of living for some, it's going to be difficult,\" acknowledged one party figure.<br/>The Ulez daily charge is \u00a312.50 a day. If a driver fails to pay the charge, or broke the penalty charge rules, the bill could be higher.<br/>Labour's failure to take Uxbridge presents three niggles for the party, as they look to the general election: <br/>Equally, if you are one of the innumerable Labour figures desperate to not sound complacent, losing in Uxbridge rather helps. <br/>And what about the Liberal Democrats?<br/>Their win in Somerton and Frome was huge.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The Lib Dem leader stages a cannon stunt to celebrate his party winning the Somerton and Frome by-election<br/>They hope it is proof of a revival in the West Country, a former heartland for the party before the near oblivion that followed their years in coalition at Westminster.<br/>And there is plenty of evidence of that revival: last year's by-election win in nearby Tiverton and Honiton and their control of Somerset Council for starters.<br/>But: they are a small party with limited resources.<br/>They threw everything at Somerton and Frome, managing to knock on 15,000 doors on polling day alone.<br/> That kind of operation is much harder to do at a general election - when they are likely to be trying to throw everything at around 30 seats, not just one.<br/>Privately, party figures acknowledge that this by-election campaign was helped hugely by former Conservative cabinet minister Nadine Dorries having not yet resigned her seat in Mid Bedfordshire, another Lib Dem target.<br/>Had that contest happened on Thursday too, it would have split their resources in half. At a general election, the demands on staffing would be even more brutal. <br/>But the party does now have ample evidence that they have overcome the paralysing hangover of the coalition years, and are competitive again - and dangerous, particularly to the Tories.<br/>Overall, the scope for Conservative comfort anywhere after these results is very slender. <br/>But not as slender as it might have been. <br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Never say never... he's 25 and he's done all of this!\"<br/>Labour leader Keir Starmer said the new MP would be a \"fantastic MP who'll deliver the fresh start that Selby and Ainsty deserves\". <br/>Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the result in Selby and Ainsty as a \"historic win\", adding she was \"pretty certain [Mr Mather]... understands some of the challenges his generation faces\". <br/>Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Rayner said: \"Being 25, he's of that generation that is looking at insecure work, looking at not being able to ever own their own home - and looking at the challenges that they face with cost of living now, that leaves them in this spiral of not being able to get on in life.\"<br/>Although Mr Mather's victory sees him become Westminster's current youngest MP, he is not the youngest person to be elected to the House of Commons. <br/>Prior to Thursday's by-election, Labour's Nadia Whittome, 26, was the youngest MP. She was elected in 2019, at the age of 23.<br/>And SNP MP Mhairi Black was aged just 20 when she was elected in 2015, becoming Westminster's youngest MP since 1832.

That was well below the 15% swing to the party in the latest national polls. <br/>It was also less than the average swing of 11% Labour had previously secured in by-elections in three safe seats that have taken place since the demise of former PM Liz Truss. <br/>Yet the party fell a little short of what was needed.<br/>Nevertheless, at the same time Labour captured Selby and Ainsty on a 23.7% swing, the second biggest ever swing from Conservative to Labour in a post-war parliamentary election. <br/>Indeed, Labour have not previously secured a by-election win in a seat that was previously so safe for the Conservatives. The last time Labour secured swings of over 20% was in the 1992-7 parliament, which, of course, concluded with the Conservatives being ejected from office.<br/>Meanwhile, in Somerton and Frome the Liberal Democrats secured as much as a 29% swing from the Conservatives. <br/>That was slightly less than the swing the Liberal Democrats enjoyed in their previous by-election victories in North Shropshire and in Tiverton and Honiton - yet it still represented the fifth biggest swing from Conservative to Liberal Democrat in any post-war by-election. <br/>The Liberal Democrats have been making the spectacular seem routine.<br/>But what broader lessons, if any, can be discerned from such a contrasting set of results?<br/>Both the Conservatives and Labour agree that a local issue - London mayor Sadiq Khan's proposed extension of London's low emission zone to the capital's outer boroughs - played an important role in helping shore up the Conservative vote. <br/>Indeed, the newly elected Conservative MP himself suggested the issue was crucial - and did not give Rishi Sunak and his government any credit for his success.<br/>Together with the heavy scale of the party's losses in Somerton (a fall of nearly 30%) and in Selby (a drop of 26 points), it would seem unwise for Tory MPs to draw any conclusion other than that their party is still in deep electoral trouble.<br/>Meanwhile, as in previous by-elections over the last couple of years, voters registered their dissatisfaction with the Conservatives by switching to whichever opposition party appeared best able to defeat the local Conservative candidate. <br/>In Uxbridge and in Selby, the already low Liberal Democrat vote was badly squeezed, while in Somerton, Labour were pushed into fifth place. In a general election such a pattern of tactical voting could seriously accentuate the scale of Conservative losses.<br/>Yet at the same time, Labour's failure to take Uxbridge will raise questions about the effectiveness of Sir Keir Starmer's electoral strategy. Characterised as it is by few promises and a focus on the centre ground, his critics may well argue that Labour's appeal proved too brittle when confronted by a difficult local issue.  <br/>Of course, Sir Keir himself may well feel the outcome illustrates the risk of promoting radical policy options.<br/>The Liberal Democrat leader, Sr Ed Davey, will be delighted with his party's fourth by-election gain in this parliament - the party has not taken so many Tory scalps since the 1992-7 parliament (again a bad omen for the Conservatives). But whereas Labour is riding high in the national polls, the Liberal Democrats have still made little advance nationally.<br/>The Liberal Democrat leader still has to find a way of turning his by-elections successes into a springboard for a wider revival for his party.<br/>But it is Rishi Sunak who has the biggest headache. The coalition of Leave supporters that delivered Boris Johnson his majority in 2019 has collapsed - nearly half are no longer supporting the party, while Brexit itself has lost its allure for some voters.<br/>The Tory leader needs to find a new tune for his party. But with living standards falling, the economy faltering, and public services struggling, enticing voters back into the Tory fold still looks far from easy. <br/>John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Research Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.<br/>What is your reaction to the results?

(It uses the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure, which tracks the price of a typical basket of goods).<br/>At the time the PM stated his intentions - in January, many experts already expected inflation in the UK to drop. <br/>But prices have continued to increase since the pledge, and inflation did not drop as predicted between April and May, remaining at 8.7%.<br/>However, in June, it fell to 7.9%, its lowest level in more than a year.<br/>Analysts remain divided about whether the PM's goal will be achieved.<br/>When will we know? Inflation figures for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 17 January 2024.<br/>Downing Street said the pledge to \"grow the economy\" will be met if the economy is bigger in October-December 2023 than it was during the previous quarter (July-September).<br/>It is using GDP (or Gross Domestic Product), a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals.<br/>This would not normally be seen as a difficult pledge, because the UK's economy is usually growing.<br/>But there has not been a lot of growth recently, and the UK economy is still smaller than it was before the pandemic.<br/>The pledge to grow the economy is made more difficult by the government's promise to halve inflation.<br/>The Bank of England has been putting up interest rates in an attempt to reduce spending and stop prices rising so quickly.<br/>However, this slows economic growth.<br/>When will we know? GDP for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 13 February 2024.<br/>When governments talk about debt falling, they almost always mean as a proportion of GDP.<br/>The idea is that debt is falling if it is growing more slowly than the economy.<br/>But debt rose above 100% of GDP for the first time since 1961.<br/>And if Mr Sunak does not achieve his second priority of growing the economy, then cutting debt becomes even harder.<br/>The deadline for this pledge is not clear.<br/>In the Budget in March, the government claimed to be on track because the independent Office for Budget Responsibility - which checks the health of the economy - forecast that debt as a proportion of GDP would fall in 2027-28.<br/>But what it actually said was that it would rise from 88.9% in 2022 to 94.8% in 2026-27, before falling slightly to 94.6% in 2027-28. And it issued some stark warnings about the sustainability of UK debt.<br/>When will we know? The next debt forecasts will be published alongside the 2023 Autumn Statement. <br/>Mr Sunak said: \"NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly.\"<br/>His pledge only refers to waiting lists in England, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own health systems.<br/>However, the overall number of patients waiting for treatment in England rose from 7.42 million in April, to 7.47 million in May.<br/>Mr Sunak has claimed that he is cutting waiting lists, but that is only true of certain lists. <br/>The number of people waiting more than 18 months, for example, fell between April and May.<br/>The NHS target is to see people within 18 weeks for non-urgent consultant-led treatment.<br/>We asked Downing Street when the prime minister aims to have waiting lists falling. <br/>It pointed us towards the plan for tackling the backlog of elective care (care planned in advance), which said the overall waiting list was expected to be falling by about March 2024.  <br/>When will we know?: Waiting list figures are usually published on the second Thursday of each month. <br/>The final priority was to stop the small boats which bring people across the English Channel, after 45,755 migrants crossed over from France in 2022. <br/>The prime minister proposed to do this through new legislation.

The incumbent, John Masefield, had died after 37 years in the post.<br/>It was the middle of the so-called \"swinging '60s\" and the idea of a poet laureate seemed archaic to many.<br/>But poetry was increasingly popular, thanks to the work of a new generation of writers, like Allen Ginsberg in the US, and the Liverpool poets in Britain.<br/>Harold Wilson, the prime minister, was in no rush to make a decision. John Hewitt, who was appointments secretary at Number 10, was told to investigate potential candidates.<br/>Other stories from the National Archives:<br/>He approached leading figures in the arts, as well as dons at Oxford and Cambridge. Dame Helen Gardner, Merton Professor of English at Oxford, had some \"fairly caustic\" comments about the \"present quality of poetry\" and the \"lack of any outstanding talent\", the papers reveal. <br/>Auden was excluded because he was an American citizen. John Betjeman was one of the most popular poets. But Dame Helen described him as \"a lightweight, amusing but rather trivial\". He had \"critical views about the establishment\", she said, which were deemed to be not appropriate.<br/>Robert Graves was \"probably the best poet available\", she added, but his \"manner of life must surely rule him out\". Graves had criticised the role and spent most of his time in Majorca.<br/>The popular poet Stevie Smith she dismissed as \"absurd\". She \"wrote 'little girl poetry' about herself mostly.\" Cecil Day-Lewis was \"a possible\" - he produced \"run of the mill poetry but nothing particularly outstanding\".<br/>That view was echoed by the chair of the Poetry Society, Geoffrey Handley-Taylor. He told Hewitt that Graves was \"too peculiar\" and \"too anti-establishment\". Betjeman, he said, \"called himself a poetic hack and there was some truth to this\".<br/>He described Smith as \"unstable\". By contrast Day-Lewis was \"a good administrative poet\" and \"a safe bet\".<br/>As the months passed, more names were put forward. Some nominated themselves. Allen Ginsberg proposed the singer Donovan, just 21, whose work \"Sunshine Superman\" and \"Mellow Yellow\" had topped the charts. In August, Ginsberg sent a hand drawn \"flower card\" to Number 10 with the words \"Donovan for Laureate\".  Officials did not respond.<br/>On September 14, 1967, Hewitt wrote to the prime minister proposing Day-Lewis. The alternative, Betjeman, would be a \"backward-looking choice\", he said. He had been described as \"the songster of tennis lawns and cathedral cloisters\". <br/>Harold Wilson agreed, but he wanted Hewitt to explore the possibility of appointing additional poets laureate for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. That was not pursued, and in January 1968, the announcement was made. <br/>But four years later, the search began again, after Day-Lewis died. <br/>Auden was again under consideration, according to newspaper reports, and apparently the bookies' favourite.<br/>Number 10 was warned by Ross McWhirter - of the Guinness Book of Records - that Auden was said to be the author of a \"pornographic\" poem entitled \"The Gobble\", published in an underground magazine. <br/>McWhirter worried that if Auden were selected this could \"bring disgrace upon the appointment\" and this would reflect on the Queen herself. The now-Sir John Hewitt told him Auden wasn't on the shortlist.<br/>This time Philip Larkin was under serious consideration - described by Hewitt as \"a first-rate craftsman\". But the critic Jon Stallworthy warned Larkin disliked public speaking. Officials were advised he was a \"reserved\" man who would not be an ambassador for poetry.<br/>The so-called \"poets' conference\", representing younger writers, suggested Adrian Mitchell and George MacBeth - but they didn't make it into the final selection.<br/>Then Prime Minister Ted Heath, picked Betjeman - who accepted, writing that he was \"honoured and delighted and at the same time humbled\".<br/>In 1984, a new laureate was needed, following Betjeman's death. There is no discussion of merit in the file. <br/>Mrs Thatcher's officials put together a list of names and recommendations. Larkin was the most popular choice, but one unnamed figure objected. <br/>Ted Hughes was picked, even though only two people proposed him - and no explanation was given.<br/>The trial of selecting a new laureate following the death of the previous one is now a thing of the past. Whereas it used to be a lifetime post, since 1999 the appointment has been for a fixed term of 10 years. Current incumbent Simon Armitage's tenure runs until 2029.<br/>Reacting to the newly declassified files, Mark Ford, Professor of English at University College London, said: \"The laureateship is such a peculiar role that finding a suitable candidate is not easy - 1967 was clearly a particularly trying year.\" <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Blair was warned of 'appalling' UK attack after 9/11<br/>Blair was urged to back Ukraine's EU dream - records<br/>Poet laureate marks 100 years of the BBC<br/>Simon Armitage to be next Poet Laureate<br/>Zephaniah rules out being poet laureate<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He also called for the UK to re-engage with the Taliban government and for Kabul's British embassy to reopen.<br/>He put out a tweet with a video saying that security was vastly improved, corruption reduced and the opium trade \"ended\".<br/>Some social media users criticised the comments, pointing out the massive curtailment of rights for women and girls under the Taliban government. <br/>Taliban chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, shared the video but erroneously described the Bournemouth East MP as \"a British reporter\".<br/>In his tweet, Mr Elwood wrote that the \"opium trade ended\" (although in the accompanying video he qualified it by saying the trade had \"all but disappeared\").<br/>However, this claim is incorrect.<br/>Opium cultivation in 2022 was up by 32% compared with 2021, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).<br/>The Taliban government took over in August 2021 and announced a ban on opium cultivation the following April. A BBC investigation this year found that this was beginning to have an effect with a huge fall in poppy production in major opium-growing provinces.<br/>However, the ban on production doesn't mean the end of the opium trade. Experts says that while production has significantly reduced in poppy-growing areas, the opium trade out of Afghanistan has not stopped.<br/>\"Given that prices have unsurprisingly increased and farmers or traders are stockpiling their inventories, it seems very unlikely that trading will or can be stopped,\" says Prof Jonathan Goodhand, an Afghanistan expert at SOAS University of London.<br/>Mr Ellwood told the BBC he was basing his claim on a visit to Helmand and Kandahar provinces, as well as his time in the capital, Kabul.<br/>He said: \"I'm sure it's still grown, but as a 'mass trade' the locals reported it is no longer there.\"<br/>Mr Ellwood also claimed corruption is down.<br/>He clarified to the BBC his observation was based on conversations with locals.<br/>Corruption in Afghanistan has fallen slightly in 2022, according to the Berlin-based group, Transparency International. It tracks public sector corruption using World Bank and World Economic Forum data.<br/>Last year, it placed Afghanistan at 150 out of the 180 countries included in its survey, up slightly from its 2021 ranking of 174, but still very low.<br/>Experts say this slight improvement might be because the massive inflows of military assistance and foreign aid spending have stopped, which some believe were fuelling local corruption.<br/>Prof Goodhand says the Taliban does have a \"commitment to tackle 'immoral' behaviour,\" but also warns that it may not last as petty corruption continues in the country.<br/>Jan Koehler, a researcher on Afghanistan at SOAS says there's evidence of other forms of corruption.<br/>He says this includes the \"misuse of power to get people into jobs, and personal ties enabling access to the Taliban very much improving ones chances to get one's way in land, water or other resource conflicts\". <br/>Mr Ellwood also claimed Afghanistan's security situation had \"vastly improved\".<br/>The number of casualties recorded since the Taliban government took over are well below figures from previous years, when foreign forces were still in the country.<br/>Between August 2021 and May 2023, total civilian casualties stood at 3,774, according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.<br/>In the years before the takeover, levels of violence were much higher, with civilian casualties peaking in 2016 at over 11,000.<br/>But rebel groups like the local Islamic State group (which opposes the Taliban government) continue to target both Taliban members and civilians.<br/>The UN says that there has been a \"rise in attacks on places of worship and against minority groups\" by such groups.<br/>It also highlights violence directed by some Taliban members against civilian and military officials associated with the former Afghan government.<br/>As for women's safety, a survey conducted earlier this year by UN showed that 68% women believed their physical safety was \"very bad\" or \"bad\".<br/>The Taliban government has also imposed increasing restrictions on women and girls' ability to work, attend school and university or freely move in public spaces.<br/>What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Green New Deal,\" it read.<br/>Sir Keir assured the activists he would meet them to discuss their demands, as they were hastily ushered off stage.<br/>More than a week on, the meeting still has not happened and now activists from the group are lining up fresh attempts to grab his attention.<br/>On Friday, activists staged sit-outs outside the constituency offices of Sir Keir, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and deputy leader Angela Rayner. They plan to continue these protests until Labour's annual party conference in October, and are not ruling out further disruption - including interrupting speeches - if Sir Keir fails to meet their demands.<br/>\"We're escalating our campaign against Labour now, because we want to influence their manifesto,\" says Hannah Martin, co-director of Green New Deal Rising.<br/>\"We want what they offer to voters to be something bold.\"<br/>Labour says it is already offering voters something bold - a plan to turn Britain into a \"clean energy superpower\".<br/>The plan involves creating a publicly owned energy company, insulating millions of homes, and using a national wealth fund to build green industries.<br/>\"Labour is the only party with a long-term mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower to cut bills, create jobs, provide energy security, and tackle the climate emergency,\" a Labour spokesperson said.<br/>The BBC has been told Green New Deal Rising has been offered a meeting with party officials, but has shown no interest.<br/>Instead, the group appears to have its sights set on Sir Keir and those at the top of the party.

It harks back to the New Deal economic programme of 1930s US president Franklin D Roosevelt, and more recently, it's an idea that's been revived and modernised by Democratic politicians in the United States.<br/>It's been fiercely opposed by Republicans there. Donald Trump cast the Green New Deal as a socialist \"takeover\" when he was in the White House. <br/>Back in the UK, the idea has been floating around for more than a decade, with campaign groups and left-wing MPs - including Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband - calling for different flavours of a green new deal.<br/>For the Conservatives, what they see as the economic dangers of funding such green policies through borrowing have been deployed as a political attack line against Labour.<br/>By the time Green New Deal Rising emerged in 2021, the notion of an economic approach centred on clean energy had entered the political mainstream.<br/>Even so, since its launch, the group of about 500 organisers and young climate activists has been lobbying Labour and claims its campaigning has influenced the party's energy policies.<br/>Now it is trying to push Labour to go even further.<br/>\"Part of why we took action last week was that we want to see a future government that's committed to the green new deal,\" says Ms Martin. \"We're not going to be silent.\"<br/>In a campaign targeted at Labour, Green New Deal Rising has put five demands to the party. One Labour source argues that two of the five demands - \"expand public ownership\" and \"tax wealth now\" - are not related to green policies.<br/>The other three demands include creating more green jobs, setting up a national nature service, and making polluting companies pay.<br/>\"What they're asking for isn't radical,\" says Labour MP Clive Lewis. \"If you look at the science, and what that's showing us on climate change, then their asks are quite mild.\"<br/>He describes recent briefings against activists as \"attempts by some close to the [Labour] leadership to put some distance between them and the climate movement\".<br/>With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accusing Sir Keir of being in the pocket of \"eco-zealots\", some senior Labour figures have begun lashing out at climate protesters, with the Labour leader himself branding Just Stop Oil \"arrogant\".<br/>Mr Lewis says he hopes activists from Green New Deal Rising have \"done everything to engage with Labour MPs\" before resorting to disruptive tactics.<br/>\"If they feel they have no option but to do this, then that's their prerogative,\" he says. \"The danger is that this pushes politicians into a corner where they might react in a negative way. Politicians are human.\"<br/>If disruptive tactics became more commonplace, it's possible a more antagonistic relationship could develop between Labour and climate activists. <br/>That could risk alienating some younger voters, as Ms Coningham explains.<br/>\"I think Labour has to earn my vote and that means signing up to our demands,\" she says. \"Labour need to stop taking young people's votes for granted.\"<br/>Voters from younger generations who care about the climate are a big constituency and one that Labour will want to win over. As things stands, a more radical Labour plan on energy and climate seems unlikely, given the financial discipline the party has been signalling.<br/>But with the Labour manifesto yet to be completed, there is still time for minds to be changed - and a meeting or two perhaps.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Why has Labour U-turned on its green pledge?<br/>Sir Keir Starmer sets out Labour's green energy strategy<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

They will also discuss providing more weapons and ammunition. <br/>On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved. <br/>But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war. <br/>Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said no final decision had been made on the language of the final communiqu\u00e9, but added: \"I am absolutely certain that we will have unity and a strong message on Ukraine.\"<br/>But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join Nato. The news was welcomed by the US and Germany, as well as Sweden itself.<br/>Turkey had spent months blocking Stockholm's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's \"legitimate security concerns\".<br/>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.<br/>Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. <br/>And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target. <br/>Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. <br/>The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine. <br/>Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West. <br/>As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy. <br/>So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors. <br/>The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. \"The right to consult is not insignificant,\" said one official.<br/>But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance. <br/>Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine \"will\" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022. <br/>Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.<br/>Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.<br/>Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.  <br/>One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades. <br/>But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance. <br/>The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership. <br/>Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: \"The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.\"<br/>But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military. <br/>Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining. <br/>Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is Nato and when will Ukraine join?<br/>Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons?<br/>Poland strengthens Belarus border over Wagner fears<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The Deposit Return Scheme has been sent for recycling.<br/>A ban on alcohol advertising has been scotched; Highly Protected Marine Areas have sunk beneath the waves.<br/>In quite a few of these cases, Mr Yousaf may have been left with little choice.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Five things to know about Scotland's new first minister Humza Yousaf<br/>Questions abounded over how the care service would work and be paid for; the recycling plans were beset with issues including a stand-off with the UK government. <br/>The no-fishing zones had prompted a backbench rebellion spearheaded by Ms Forbes and former minister Fergus Ewing, who acted out the fury of coastal communities by shredding a consultation document in the chamber.<br/>But Mr Yousaf will also feel he has acted decisively to rip up the more controversial items left in his in-tray by Ms Sturgeon. <br/>Comprehensive changes have been made to the government's agenda in a short space of time.<br/>He has also moved to reset a number of relationships with groups which felt neglected by the previous administration.<br/>The first was with business groups, in part via the reboot on alcohol advertising and recycling. There is talk of reforming business rates, and a \"new deal\" with the private sector.<br/>He also signed a new pact with local government which is known as the Verity House Agreement.<br/>Although there is always furious spin around the figures, councils have borne the brunt of budget cuts in recent years.<br/>Mr Yousaf has promised a new \"fiscal framework\" between town halls and the administration in Edinburgh, along with \"improved engagement on budgetary matters\".<br/>Fine words - but they will need to be backed up with hard cash if that relationship is to truly improve.<br/>Has Mr Yousaf also reset relations between the SNP and its leadership?<br/>He has certainly tried to run his government out of a bigger tent. <br/>Ms Sturgeon was famous for keeping a very tight circle of advisors who micromanaged most aspects of policy.<br/>Mr Yousaf meanwhile has actively sought to push decisions and responsibility out to his ministers.<br/>His initial policy prospectus featured each cabinet secretary outlining their goals and duties in their own words, introduced with the words \"I commit that by 2026, I will have...\".<br/>That may give them more autonomy to make decisions to deliver on these targets, but on the flip side it likely means they will have to carry the can for any issues in their portfolio.<br/>The departure of several of Ms Sturgeon's top team from government means there is now an assortment of big names with big views on the back benches - which range along a spectrum of loyalty.<br/>The likes of John Swinney can be relied upon for unswerving support, while Fergus Ewing has ranged off into almost outright rebellion.<br/>MSPs with views differing from those of the leadership tended to be quite shy about airing them publicly when Ms Sturgeon was in charge, but that is no longer the case.<br/>A broader debate over the SNP's core policy - independence - has also flourished under Mr Yousaf.<br/>He has sought to establish himself as the \"first activist\", getting out on the doorsteps regularly - but he also carried responsibility for setting the course of the main pro-independence party.<br/>Ms Sturgeon generally sought to keep the membership marching along to the beat of a strategy she herself had drawn up.<br/>By contrast, Mr Yousaf's big speech to the SNP's independence convention last month instead embraced just about every possible plan.<br/>There are elements within the party which variously favour a gradual build-up of support; continued efforts to secure a referendum; forcing the issue via an election result; and doubling down on public events like marches.<br/>Mr Yousaf's approach is to encourage all of them. Perhaps that will serve to keep them all happy for now, but he may need to swing firmly behind one particular strategy come the party's autumn conference - which unlike the convention is a decision-making event where members get a vote.<br/>Ms Sturgeon kept the SNP together as an election-winning machine by corralling pro-independence figures from right across the political spectrum behind one tightly-controlled central vision.<br/>It remains to be seen whether her successor's more relaxed approach encourages healthy debate - or furious infighting.<br/>Looking ahead, one thing Mr Yousaf has retained from the Sturgeon era is her deal with the Greens.<br/>That was underlined when he stood up in the chamber to defend Green minister Lorna Slater from a confidence vote tabled by the Tories.<br/>That may have helped smooth over the fact that several totems of the Bute House Agreement - like HMPAs - have been ditched.<br/>The Greens will also hope to wield influence from within the big tent as Mr Yousaf draws up his own policy plans.<br/>He will spend the summer recess preparing his own Programme for Government - the things he is actually doing, rather than cancelling.<br/>However, budgets remain tight. New finance secretary Shona Robison has already warned of a \u00a31bn shortfall next year, and that could double within four years.<br/>So he may need to be pragmatic and cut his cloth. There is already talk of a retreat from \"universalism\", in particular when it comes to free school meals in secondary schools.<br/>Beyond that, a September court date has been set for the first round of the showdown with the UK government over their move to block Holyrood's gender reforms.<br/>Whoever loses will likely appeal to the Inner House, and eventually to the Supreme Court, so an issue which the government had hoped to put to bed by passing reforms could well follow Mr Yousaf right up to the next set of elections.<br/>And there is the small matter of that SNP conference, where Mr Yousaf has promised to bring forward the results of a party governance review as well as a finalised independence strategy.<br/>Yousaf confirmed as Scotland's new first minister<br/>Who is Scotland's new first minister, Humza Yousaf?

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Three former offenders who have turned their lives around delivered some home truths to the peers this week.<br/>\"You can't tell someone to stop having a drink, if you have never had a drink. The problem is there are a lot of people in probation who have not been drug dealers, have never been in front of a magistrate.\"<br/>DeQeon credits the transformation that has taken place in his life to a probation officer, a woman he describes as his \"guardian angel\", who saw potential in him and went the extra mile to help him realise it.<br/>\"My other probation officers after Louise were not as good. I feel like a lot of them had no life experience. They are academics, they have not been in the real world,\" he told the committee.<br/>They had a \"tick box\" mentality, he explained, and did not \"get\" the challenges someone from a tough background like his faced. <br/>It was a message echoed by Caroline and Ayesha, who were also giving evidence about their experiences of the probation service.<br/>DeQeon told the peers: \"People like me need to be in probation because it would change the system. It would make the system a lot better. We wouldn't be sitting here talking about the situation if there was people like us being probation officers.\"<br/>But why stop at the probation service?<br/>\"Not a lot of people sitting on this panel have been on the other side of the system, have they?\" asked DeQeon. <br/>\"The problem is that if we had, we wouldn't be here,\" replied Labour peer and former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett.<br/>\"You could be... you've got to have life experience!\" DeQeon responded.<br/>The three witnesses had all served community sentences, where low-level offenders are ordered to do unpaid work and have drug, alcohol or mental health treatment instead of going to prison.<br/>They are now \"lived experience\" advisers with charity Revolving Doors, which campaigns for more community sentences and an end to prison sentences of 12 months or less in England and Wales, like in Scotland.<br/>The probation service - which has struggled with its workload in recent months - is key to making community sentences work.<br/>Last month, Kim Thornden-Edwards, head of the service in England, told the Lords committee new investment going into alcohol and drug treatment programmes was a potential \"game changer\". <br/>She also acknowledged problems with pre-sentence reports - the all-important advice given to judges and magistrates on how to deal with offenders. A new, simpler form was about to be rolled out, she told the peers. Individually-tailored treatment orders were also coming down the track, she said.<br/>The three former offenders told the committee pre-sentence reports were often out of date and did not have any input from the offenders themselves - and that some of the court-ordered programmes did not make a lot of sense.<br/>Ayesha, a recovering addict, suggested drug treatment orders should be dropped in favour of a more \"holistic\" approach. She said she had gone into a treatment centre only after her community sentence had ended, with little input from probation. <br/>She also spoke movingly of her ambition to go to university to study criminology, and her fear that despite all her efforts her criminal record would still be held against her.<br/>The Ministry of Justice says it is keen to set an example to other employers when it comes to giving a chance to ex-offenders. <br/>A spokesperson said: \"We know finding work is one of the surest ways for prison leavers to stay on the straight and narrow, which is why our Going Forward into Employment (GFIE) scheme provides employment opportunities for ex-offenders - helping to cut crime and protect the public.\"<br/>People with criminal records can apply for jobs with the probation service - and the wider Ministry of Justice - through the GFIE scheme.<br/>But the scheme does not include the role of probation officer.<br/>There is nothing to stop people with criminal convictions applying to be a probation officer \"in the usual way\", the MoJ says, and having a conviction will not necessarily count against them.<br/>But those with experience of the system say they will face a lengthy vetting process and there is no record of how many ex-offenders, if any, have ever been successful.<br/>Some ex-offenders work as volunteer \"peer mentors\", using their own experience of the criminal justice system to offer guidance and support to those struggling to cope with it.<br/>Caroline, who overcame problems with alcohol and mental health, told the Lords committee about her work with the NHS Liaison and Diversion service, which supports vulnerable people when they first come into contact with the criminal justice system.<br/>She said she was keen to work for the probation service in a similar role.<br/>\"However, due to my criminal record I have been pushed back several times. And it's so frustrating because I have come such a long, long way, but because of something that happened years ago when I wasn't very well, they are like 'nah'.

He was adopted by Eric Blair - better known by his pen name of George Orwell. <br/>Orwell's novel 1984 was the origin of the popular understanding of \"Big Brother\" and \"Room 101\".<br/>Mr Blair told BBC Politics East: \"He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>With Russia calling the war in Ukraine a \"special military operation\" and with many supporters of former US president Donald Trump believing his falsehood that he won the last election, many people see 1984 as more relevant than ever, Mr Taylor said.<br/>Asked about how his father would react if he came back today, Mr Blair said: \"Has it changed from the world of 1984 and Animal Farm? It's been the same for a millennia. I suppose it will be the same in another 100 years' time.<br/>\"He would have a certain sense of deja vu. He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>He added: \"My father was a great patriot. A great defender of his country and he was also a critic of both sides of the political debate. He would criticise both left and right.\" <br/>Prof Jean Seaton, official historian of the BBC, said Orwell was still incredibly important.<br/>\"We live in a world with surveillance, facial recognition. 1984 is about the capacity of authoritarian regimes like Russia, China, to make you believe what is not true,\" she said.<br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>An award-winning writer and critic, Mr Taylor's new biography \"Orwell: The New Life\" is the first to reveal insights about Orwell from newly uncovered letters to Eleanor Collings and Brenda Salkend, who had become part of his life when he lived in Southwold, Suffolk.<br/>\"These two caches of new material, letters he'd written to Suffolk girlfriends in the 1930s, don't just tell us about the relationship with the two women, they tell us about all kinds of things,\" said Mr Taylor.<br/>\"They tell us about what he was reading, his politics and where he was, geographical information.\"<br/>He added: \"In terms of improving our understanding of Orwell's work, I suspect his letters to Eleanor reminiscing about their country walks at Southwold may have inspired similar passages describing Winston's affair with Julia in 1984.\"<br/>While in Southwold, Orwell wrote the 1935 novel A Clergyman's Daughter, which is set in a fictionalised version of the town.<br/>Mr Taylor said: \"I think Southwold and its ambience and its values were an awful lot of the things Orwell felt he was rebelling against.<br/>\"On the other side, he had a very traditional nature. Somebody said of him, he was a conservative in everything but politics.<br/>\"I have a feeling there were certain aspects of Southwold he found very congenial.\"<br/>The newly discovered letters were bought by Mr Blair and donated to the Orwell Archive at University College London.<br/>Mr Blair said: \"I thought I better make an offer to secure the letters for posterity.<br/>\"I was interested that my father maintained his correspondence with Brenda Salkend for a great number of years. He always seemed to hold out a candle for all his girlfriends, certainly these two, as far as I can see.\"<br/>BBC Politics East will broadcast on Sunday, 2 July at 10:00 BST on BBC One andavailable after broadcast on BBC iPlayer.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

That decision could itself be challenged at the Supreme Court.<br/>The five-year trial - announced in April 2022 - would see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there.<br/>They may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda. If not, they can apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\". <br/>The government says the plan will deter people arriving in the UK through \"illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods\", such as on small boats which cross the English Channel.  <br/>More than 45,700 people used this route to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.<br/>Small-boat crossings decreased slightly in the first few months of 2023 but numbers could rise again in the summer. <br/>No asylum seeker has actually been sent to Rwanda so far. The first flight was scheduled to go in June 2022, but was cancelled after legal challenges.<br/>In June 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned an earlier ruling by the High Court that the Rwanda plan was lawful.<br/>The judges ruled that the east African nation is not a safe third country because of \"deficiencies\" in its asylum system which mean that some claimants could be sent back to their home countries, where they might face persecution. <br/>It said that \"unless and until\" those deficiencies are corrected, removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful.<br/>The ruling also said that the Rwanda policy breaches Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment. <br/>It was not a unanimous decision. Two judges agreed to reverse the High Court decision but a third did not. <br/>The judges said their decision does not imply a view about the \"political merits\" of the policy. <br/>Asylum Aid, the charity which brought the case against the government, said the judgement was a \"vindication of the importance of the rule of law and basic fairness when fundamental rights are at stake\". <br/>The UN's refugee agency, which advised the court on matters of international refugee law during the appeal, also welcomed the ruling, and urged the UK government to \"pursue other measures\" instead.<br/>But Home Secretary Suella Braverman called the judgment \"disappointing\", and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the government will seek permission to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.<br/>While legal proceedings continue, flights still cannot take off for Rwanda. <br/>The UK government previously said \"anyone entering the UK illegally\" after 1 January 2022 could be sent, with no limit on numbers.<br/>Rwanda says it can process 1,000 asylum seekers during the trial period, but has capacity for more. <br/>Under the deal, Rwanda can also ask the UK to take in some of its most vulnerable refugees.  <br/>But in October 2022, Privilege Style - the airline which was scheduled to take asylum seekers to Rwanda - withdrew from its Home Office contract, after a campaign by refugee charities. <br/>At the time the Guardian reported that two other airlines which had previously conducted deportation flights had also ruled out participation in the Rwanda scheme. <br/>So far the UK has paid the Rwandan government \u00a3140m for the scheme but it has not provided an overall cost. <br/>An economic-impact assessment prepared for the government's Illegal Migration Bill estimated that removing each individual to a third country, such as Rwanda, would cost \u00a363,000 more than keeping them in the UK. <br/>That figure is the difference between the total cost of removing an individual - estimated to be \u00a3169,000 - and the \u00a3106,000 spent on housing support if they remain in the UK.<br/>The \u00a3169,000 total includes a payment to the third country of around \u00a3105,000 per person, as well as \u00a322,000 for flights.<br/>The Home Office said no cost would be incurred if the policy deterred an individual from entering the UK illegally. <br/>But it said it was \"uncertain\" how many people would be deterred because the policy was \"novel and untested\".<br/>The UK's asylum system costs \u00a33bn a year. Almost \u00a37m a day is spent on hotel accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. <br/>Critics say the daily cost is so high because of the time taken to decide on applications, and a ban on asylum seekers working while waiting for confirmation of their status.<br/>The UN Refugee Agency defines an asylum seeker as someone who has applied for shelter and protection in another country. <br/>A refugee is a person who has fled conflict or persecution in their own country. <br/>The legal rights of refugees are protected by international law. However, it is up to host countries to decide whether an asylum seeker is granted refugee status. <br/>In 2022, the UK received more than 89,000 asylum applications, the highest number for 20 years. Of these, more than 23,800 people and their dependants were granted a form of protection. <br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

If people spend less in businesses, what does that mean for jobs? If people end up out of work, what does that mean for the government's welfare bill? And, therefore, for that third priority of the prime minister's: reducing national debt.  <br/>The increased cost of borrowing from high interest rates can also disincentivise investment in business, which can also lead to lower economic growth. <br/>The tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse.<br/>So what is in the government's power?<br/>One quick lever the government can pull is taxes. <br/>Raising taxes is another way to stop groups of people from spending more. <br/>But that's an unpalatable political choice too. <br/>Mr Sunak has previously made it clear, and pledged in the past, that he wants to cut - not raise - taxes before the next election. <br/>Some Tory MPs have been repeatedly calling for tax cuts. <br/>Governments can also reduce spending. <br/>While we do hear ministers talk about making \"efficiencies\", departments talking about making cuts is - again - an unpalatable narrative ahead of an election. <br/>Mr Sunak has said, for now, that he wants to make sure government is \"responsible\" with borrowing. <br/>Another quick lever would be price controls - the government setting limits on price increases. <br/>Mr Sunak says ministers are \"looking at\" supermarkets to make sure they are behaving responsibly, for example. <br/>But Number 10 have been clear they are not introducing price caps and any such schemes would be at retailers' discretion. <br/>The governor of the Bank of England has suggested workers shouldn't ask for excessive pay rises. <br/>The government has also been very reluctant to hike public sector wages, especially if funded by more borrowing. <br/>Both argue giving people more money in their pockets could fuel inflation: if people's wages keep up with rising prices, they can buy the same things, so demand (and prices) remain similar. <br/>In blunter terms - their strategy of reducing inflation by reducing demand means people need to be able to afford less.  <br/>This argument has led to strikes in multiple sectors, with unions arguing this is unfair for workers. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Sunak makes five pledges on the NHS, economy and migrants<br/>This is also a tricky balancing act here for the economy. <br/>If people can afford less: what does that mean for growing the economy? And jobs? <br/>Potentially putting people out of work has a government price tag too. <br/>So what about pushing supply up, rather than demand down, to lower prices? <br/>Supply-side reforms are, in simple terms, decisions that could make industries more productive to increase the supply of goods and services - and grow the economy too. <br/>Free-market examples include things like cutting business taxes, regulation, red tape, or even certain worker protections or welfare benefits. Or increasing migration for certain sectors. <br/>State-intervention examples could be building more houses, investing in infrastructure, or investing in homegrown energy supplies like nuclear power or renewables.  <br/>Clearly, any of these involve political choices too. <br/>But they also take time to come into effect. <br/>The government - and Labour - have ruled out direct support to help people with mortgages, saying this would fuel inflation - and instead point to existing benefits for the most vulnerable.<br/>Ministers are continuing to point to interest rates as the solution, though most are reluctant to admit that involves a lot of pain for it to work. <br/>It's important to remember when the government says it can't do something that what they're usually referring to is a choice. <br/>Each choice comes with its own shade of political thorniness, and potentially means trading the prime minister's priorities off against each other.<br/>UK inflation shock: This is really grim<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

As the party in government, the Conservatives bear the most responsibility for this.<br/>The Greens aren't entirely off the hook, though. Their decisions to oppose some solar farms shape our energy system, and give the impression that local objections have more weight than national missions.<br/>Frank Adlington-Stringer is one Green councillor who has opposed a solar farm in the past.<br/>In 2021, before he was elected to North East Derbyshire Council, Mr Adlington-Stringer wrote an article explaining why he could not support a solar farm in the county.<br/>He said \"the loss of green space\" and the restriction of \"already limited habitats\" were among his main concerns.<br/>In the end, the application was rejected by government planning inspectors. At the time, one local Green councillor said \"younger generations are very concerned about the effects of climate change, and might see things differently\".<br/>In this case, at least, Mr Adlington-Stringer, 25, did not. He says while he is open to solar farms, he believes such projects should not be a \"priority\".<br/>\"We shouldn't be exchanging green energy for green spaces,\" he says.<br/>Julia Hilton is another Green councillor who campaigned against a solar farm in Hastings, before she was elected in 2021.<br/>Although it didn't have any councillors at the time, the local Green Party rallied against proposed solar panels within agricultural fields in Hastings Country Park.<br/>The Labour-led council then abandoned the project after the government's environmental adviser, Natural England, said the scheme \"would result in significant landscape and visual impacts\".<br/>The label of NIMBY - an acronym for \"not in my backyard\" - is sometimes applied to those do not want something visually unappealing to be built near their home.<br/>Ms Hilton, now the Green group leader on Hastings Borough Council, bristles at the suggestion of the \"NIMBY argument\" in these circumstances.<br/>The proposed site, she says, was \"not compatible with a solar farm, which would industrialise this very precious landscape habitat\".<br/>Whatever the merits of individual solar proposals, the optics of Green politicians objecting to renewable energy have thrown up awkward questions for the party's leadership.<br/>Green Party of England and Wales co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, insists Greens \"see an important role for solar farms as part of the mix\".<br/>\"It's not about being ideological,\" he tells the BBC. \"The [solar] application has to be considered on its merits.\"<br/>He denies solar farms are a political problem for his party, and says there are Greens supporting them in Oxfordshire, Lancaster and Kent.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's a plea we hear a lot from the Green Party, which has been campaigning to make solar panels mandatory on the roofs of all suitable new homes.<br/>But will rooftops alone really fill our solar-shaped hole?<br/>Simon Evans, the deputy editor of Carbon Brief, says \"restricting cheap, utility-scale solar\" would make the challenge of net zero \"even more difficult\".<br/>The government's energy security strategy talks of expanding UK solar capacity to 70GW by 2035. \"It would not be possible to build that much solar capacity on the UK's rooftops,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>In a report, the government's climate adviser estimated a maximum potential of 37GW on rooftops. \"Even if it were possible to reach 70GW of solar on the UK's rooftops, it would be significantly more expensive to do so,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>This kind of assessment has not stopped some Greens and other parties standing in the way of solar farms in Suffolk.<br/>Earlier this year, two Green councillors sided with four Tories on Mid-Suffolk Council to block a solar farm near Somersham. And on the Suffolk-Cambridgeshire border, a plan to build one of Europe's largest solar farms - with the potential to power 172,000 homes - has been met with fierce resistance.<br/>Andrew Stringer - the first Green district councillor to be elected in Suffolk in 2003 - says the proposed Sunnica Energy Farm is a \"symptom of a wider problem\".<br/>He blames the Conservatives for failing to legislate to put more solar on roofs. A solar farm has to \"make sense\", he says, adding if it doesn't, and a Green councillor can't reconcile their opposition with their party's national policy, \"we embrace that\".<br/>\"It's called democracy,\" he says.<br/>Democracy served the party well in May's local elections, with the Greens making records gains, notably in some rural areas with a history of voting Conservative. This pivot to the countryside has expanded the party's base beyond its core voters in urban areas.<br/>The party has built \"a potentially unstable coalition, requiring some degree of hypocrisy, like their NIMBY stance\", said Dr James Dennison, a political scientist.<br/>On solar farms, the Greens \"are in danger of letting this narrative of hypocrisy spread and more so than for other parties given their environmental ideology,\" said Dr James Dennison, an expert on the party.<br/>\"This would hurt their national performance more than local.\"<br/>As the Greens seek to add parliamentary seats to their council ones, is there a temptation to a focus on wooing the type of rural voters who dislike the idea of solar farms?<br/>\"We put across our values for the local elections just gone and people came behind them very strongly, including in Suffolk and many rural areas around the country,\" says Mr Ramsay, who's eyeing up a seat in the Suffolk countryside.<br/>\"It will be the same at the general election.\"<br/>How UK Greens are learning from overseas allies<br/>Too late to save planet, says Green Party founder<br/>Labour hints at solar panel policy for new builds<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

In one of the windows sits a flashing neon sign bearing the words \"Brexit has failed\".<br/>\"We have had so many people, complete strangers, call at the front door and say thank you for flying the flag,\" said Janet.<br/>The city narrowly voted to stay within the EU, the results declared live as the clock struck midnight: 50.7% remain, 49.3% leave. <br/>\"I had a bet on the result and I won,\" said James.<br/>\"There was a lot of disquiet with Europe but really it was disquiet with Westminster and what was going on there.<br/>\"Most of my life I've lived in Europe, I'm a European person, we've travelled in Europe and it seemed good for us and good for the country.<br/>\"I couldn't understand why people would want to leave. Well I could, but I didn't agree with the reasons.\"<br/>Janet voted remain so the UK did not become \"alone and isolated\".<br/>\"I thought it was awful the way that the Brexit vote made people who had been working here, living here, contributing here for many, many years - we made them feel unwanted and unwelcome,\" she said.<br/>\"And we've sent so many of them back to Europe. So many doctors and nurses. We don't have enough vegetable and fruit pickers in our fields we don't have enough HGV drivers. It's really damaged the economy and I cannot think of a single good reasons for leaving the EU.\" <br/>The couple take a long pause when asked if they feel there have been any positives to Brexit.<br/>\"No,\" said Janet.<br/>\"I'm trying hard to think about it,\" said James.<br/>He highlights the many new friends the couple have made who have come together for \"a common cause\".<br/>\"We can't continue as a little island on our own doing trade with people the other side of the world,\" he added.<br/>\"We're not going away and we won't go away until we rejoin the EU.\"<br/>Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

We were disrespected and manipulated.\" <br/>Like Ms Msezane, he was recruited last year by an agent in his home country via an advertisement on social media, and had to pay for his own airfare and visa before being put to work on fruit farms in the south of England.<br/>Ms Msezane, who is from Johannesburg, is now a care worker for an English local authority.<br/>She told the BBC she was treated with respect in her new role, in sharp contrast to her experience last year as a seasonal agricultural worker, picking and packing strawberries for British supermarkets.<br/>\"I could not have thought that the conditions I found in 2022, in the United Kingdom, were what I found. It was beyond shocking.<br/>\"I'd spent close to, almost, \u00a32,500 equivalent. There is no way I am going home at that point. I am here to make money. That's essentially it. So you get to work.\"<br/>She had to pay rent to live in a caravan with six people of different nationalities, both men and women, who had a single shower and fridge between them.<br/>\"My country is going through a lot economically. People need work. So I would never say to people not to come on the seasonal worker visa,\" she told the BBC.<br/>\"Everyone who was on the scheme with me was able to support their families in different ways.\"<br/>But she added: \"You need to be aware that you are coming into a country where you don't have as many rights as a worker as you do in South Africa. So that can be challenging.\"<br/>Vadim Sardov, from Kazakhstan, said conditions on his farm were so bad several people had decided to leave and work illegally instead.<br/>Seasonal workers were not asking for \"five star hotels\", he told the committee, but \"employers must provide proper living and working conditions\".<br/>Emiliano Mellino, a journalist for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, who has written a series of articles on the treatment of migrant workers, told the Lords committee some workers had been subjected to bullying and abuse.<br/>He said many take out loans to cover the costs of coming to the UK, and they also had to pay rent of up to \u00a380 a week for their accommodation, which meant they were reluctant to speak out for fear of losing their job.<br/>The government's official policy is to train British workers to fill the 50,000 seasonal jobs on British farms currently carried out by migrant workers.<br/>Before the UK left EU, most of these casual workers came from Europe.<br/>When the current seasonal workers visa scheme was launched in 2019, it had a quota of just 2,500 places a year, with most coming from Russia and Ukraine.<br/>It was expanded to 38,000 visas in 2022, following pressure from the farming industry, who had been forced to leave crops unpicked.<br/>The net was cast to a wider range of nationalities, including South Africa and central Asian countries like Kazakhstan.<br/>The scheme is due to run until 2024, with debate raging in government over whether it should be expanded to keep food costs down and help tame inflation.<br/>The government has authorised only a small number of recruitment companies, known as \"scheme operators\", to arrange seasonal worker visas. <br/>Farmers must hire their overseas workers through those companies and must demonstrate that they are actively trying to recruit UK-based workers as well. <br/>Scheme operators also have explicit duties to look after workers' welfare and make sure they are paid properly.<br/>At an earlier committee hearing, in April this year, farmer Mike Newey said it was a \"myth\" that seasonal fruit picking was a low skilled, poorly paid job with bad accommodation.<br/>\"Our seasonal workers are paid a minimum of \u00a310.42, the national living wage, and often earn \u00a315 to \u00a320 an hour when they are on piece-work rates. It is good pay. They have subsidised accommodation on the farm.\"<br/>He added: \"We should be proud of giving people from other countries a leg up. That is what we are doing.\"<br/>Ali Capper, of the West Sussex Growers' Association, said: \"To have staff, we need to accommodate them, and ensure their welfare and that they are very well looked after.\"<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He stresses that he's as dedicated to independence as anyone in the SNP, but he believes that patience is required.<br/>He's urged fellow members to focus on convincing more undecided voters to support independence, which he believes will create \"overwhelming\" pressure on the UK government to grant a second referendum.<br/>But others feel another referendum won't happen, and that brings us to option two. This involves using elections to secure independence.<br/>It's a tactic that's gained prominence in SNP circles in recent years. <br/>Towards the end of her leadership, Nicola Sturgeon floated the idea of running an election as a \"de facto\" referendum.<br/>The concept is fairly simple: the SNP would contest an election (or elections) insisting that a vote for them is a vote for independence. This could be stated in the opening line of a manifesto.<br/>Ash Regan, who ran to replace Nicola Sturgeon earlier this year, backs this approach.<br/>She believes the SNP could even team up with other pro-independence parties, meaning that more than 50% of the vote combined would lead to independence.<br/>She thinks it's time to move away from relying on the referendum path, saying \"we've been thinking of it as the gold standard, but in fact it's the ballot box that's the gold standard route\".<br/>But there are potential weaknesses with this option.<br/>Why would the UK government agree to this? Would the international community recognise it? <br/>Most advocates of such a Plan B feel that Westminster intransigence on a second referendum means that a radical alternative is needed.<br/>But others fear it won't deliver independence and would alienate the middle-ground of Scottish politics.<br/>Option three involves taking to the streets - mass demonstrations calling for independence. <br/>Perhaps this option should be seen as complementing others, rather than being a route to independence in itself. <br/>The cross-party All Under One Banner movement will march from Stirling to Bannockburn at the very same time the SNP gathers in Dundee.<br/>As a party member, Patrick McCarthy could have attended the convention. But he worries the SNP is simply \"talking to themselves\" . <br/>He'll be \"speaking to the mass movement\" by organising the march instead.<br/>He says \"the hearts and minds and belief in independence is the thing that's going to get us over the line\".<br/>The first minister will set out his preferred route to independence at Saturday's convention.<br/>Humza Yousaf wants to drive up overall support, but he's also said that elections must be used to advance the cause of independence.<br/>This convention won't rubber-stamp any strategy. That would have to come at the SNP's autumn conference.<br/>There are political risks for Humza Yousaf in this weekend's convention.<br/>It could highlight splits within his party. And it exposes him to accusations that he's prioritising the constitution over day-to-day problems.<br/>But, given that independence is his party's fundamental aim, it's important for him to show party members that he's formulating a plan to achieve the ultimate goal.<br/>The SNP may emerge closer to defining their strategy on independence, but making that a reality feels a harder task for the party right now.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Two years before the Brexit referendum, Clacton-on-Sea saw its MP defect to Brexit-supporting UKIP. How do people in the resort feel about it all now?<br/>The Tendring area of Essex - which includes the seaside town of Clacton - recorded one of the highest leave votes in England in the 2016 referendum. Almost 70% of people voted out - and turnout was 74.5%.<br/>Clacton was considered by many to be the beating heart of Brexit after its Conservative MP Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP in 2014. In 2015, 22 UKIP councillors were elected on to the district council.<br/>But what do people in the resort feel about Brexit today?<br/>\"I voted to leave, but I wish I hadn't,\" says Clacton resident Jill Ayling, 76. <br/>\"We didn't know the whole truth, did we? We were supposed to get money for the National Health Service, but to my mind it hasn't happened.  <br/>\"If I had to vote again, I'd vote to stay.\"<br/>She believes people were swayed by the political arguments at the time but it will have a lasting effect on younger generations. <br/>\"For younger people, it has altered dramatically for them. Things have changed,\" she says.<br/>Billy Ball, 42, the managing director of Clacton Pier, did not want to reveal how he voted in the 2016 referendum.<br/>\"The biggest challenge for hospitality and the seaside as a whole - and Clacton Pier - has been how the Eastern European labour took the decision to move home,\" he says.<br/>\"We've never really recovered from that. The British don't see hospitality as a long-term career path.<br/>\"It is an older demographic in Clacton and perhaps there's some idealism, with people thinking standing on our own two feet was a good thing. <br/>\"We were one of the country's only UKIP areas but it was probably all a bit of a flash in the pan. <br/>\"People tend to have forgotten why the resulting problems exist.\" <br/>Jason Smedley, 53, has lived in Clacton for 15 years and owns a number of businesses, including the Royal Hotel.<br/>He did not vote in the referendum.<br/>\"In all of my businesses, I can't see any difference,\" he says. \"Covid is the only thing that's had an impact here and around the country.\"<br/>He says he took the strong Brexit sentiment in Clacton with \"a pinch of salt\".<br/>\"I had a look at the main points and how it would affect me as a business and thought - actually, it doesn't - either way,\" he says.<br/>\"I was waiting to see this catastrophic failure of everything in the country.\"<br/>His view is echoed by the hotel's general manager, Victoria Hart. The 23-year-old was too young to vote in the 2016 ballot. <br/>\"It hasn't affected us at all,\" she says, \"especially people my age and my friends here in Clacton, we don't talk about it. <br/>\"Covid is the only thing that has severely impacted my life.\" <br/>Ryan Richards, 22, says he feels \"left out\" as he too was unable to vote in the referendum.<br/>\"We should have stayed with the EU,\" he says. <br/>\"With the trade routes and the way prices are going up now, it's becoming impossible for people my age even to get a home, let alone anything else - I blame Brexit for that.<br/>\"When it all happened we were under the age - I couldn't vote. <br/>\"I can understand why they want to make their their own trade routes without having to rely on someone, but they should have at least gone to young people, who are going or be majorly affected by it all. <br/>\"I feel left out.\"<br/>\"I don't think you can tell if it has worked, because of the pandemic and the trouble we've had with the government keeping changing, there hasn't been a time when you can say there's been a smooth period,\" says Ronald Oudnie.<br/>The 74-year-old voted for Brexit.<br/>\"You've got to wait until you've got a government that's been in for a few years, that it's been stable and able to sort things out.   <br/>\"I can remember when we actually joined the EU. We didn't sign up to a lot of things then that they brought in after, it was more like an economic thing. <br/>\"But they implemented laws on us when we should be implementing our own laws, it's as simple as that.\"<br/>Peter Lenard, 79, voted to stay in the EU.<br/>\"It's been a disaster, Brexit,\" he says.<br/>\"We were all promised we were going to put so much money into the NHS and I honestly think if you were to ask a lot of people today who voted out, I think a lot would change their mind.\"<br/>He says there is an element of \"I told you so\".  <br/>\"All my friends say the same,\" he says.<br/>\"I voted out because of Brussels, I was fed up of having to answer to them for every single thing, no for any other reason,\" says Beverley Banks.   <br/>\"I was hoping a lot of Europe was going to do the same and then we could form again and do it differently. <br/>\"It didn't happen. The Ukraine war didn't help, but everything is so much more expensive.\"<br/>Her friend Rosalie Pope says: \"I knew it was a bad idea, and it was.<br/>\"I travel internationally for business all the time and didn't want the rigmarole - so I voted 'in'.\" <br/>Small business owner Neil Stock, 55, is a former Conservative leader of Tendring District Council. <br/>\"How you judge whether that's been a success or a failure, or good or bad, or wrong or right, is down to your own independent view of the world,\" he says. <br/>\"If you were going to and from Europe on a regular basis I should imagine it's been quite irksome. <br/>\"But for most people it hasn't even touched the sides. I don't regret voting leave at all. If you reran the referendum, despite the opinion polls you'd get a very similar result. <br/>\"People who never vote came out and wielded the pencil in the ballot box and said 'I want to leave'. The decision was made on a whole raft of emotions, including sovereignty.<br/>\"We live in a post-Brexit world. It doesn't mean the world ended in 2016.\"<br/>The government has previously said it was \"making the most of Brexit freedoms\".<br/>\"The government is making the most of our Brexit freedoms to grow the economy, including ambitious financial services sector reforms which will unlock over \u00a3100bn of investment, and we are reviewing EU-derived rules in other critical growth sectors this year,\" said a spokesperson.<br/>Question Time is hosting a special debate from Clacton on BBC One from 22:40 BST.<br/>Photography by Martin Giles<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.  <br/>Some, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.<br/>Singling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills. <br/>More than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU. <br/>Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit. <br/>But the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.<br/>Most of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes. <br/>But in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.<br/>So while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.<br/>But here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU. <br/>And official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.<br/>However, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.  <br/>The remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic. <br/>The government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.<br/>But meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros. <br/>Every consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343. <br/>The changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.<br/>Meanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform. <br/>That is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages. <br/>Such employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers. <br/>Then there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum. <br/>Economists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.  <br/>But with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost. But that takes time. <br/>The current inflation shock is truly global. But those escalating bills in the UK may come with a Brexit surcharge on top - just when households and businesses feel they can least cope. <br/>Bread to loo roll: UK prices compared to Europe<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

However, food inflation in Germany, Sweden and Portugal has fallen significantly since March - while the figure for the UK has remained stubbornly high.<br/>In fact, the UK's food inflation in April was higher than the European Union average of 16.4% and higher than all the major European economies.<br/>It was exceeded by Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Hungary.<br/>BBC Verify asked Mr Stride's department which figures he was referring to. We we were told he was talking about the first three months of 2023, when UK food price inflation was 18% and Sweden, Germany and Portugal were all over 20%.<br/>The reason UK food inflation is so high has been the focus of a recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis. The ONS is responsible for calculating the UK's inflation figures.<br/>It identified three main reasons behind the price rises:<br/>The good news is that global wholesale food prices (that's the amount producers charge for their produce) have been falling. However, it generally takes time for that to feed through to supermarket prices, so customers have to wait before their bills stop rising.<br/>The ONS says one reason the UK's prices have been rising faster for longer could be down to a reliance on food imports. This suggests European countries that grow more of their own food have seen smaller food prices increases.<br/>The next set of UK inflation figures - covering the year to May - will be published on Wednesday.<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one. All MPs will vote on the suggested sanction next week. <br/>He will also remain a member of the Privy Council, the body that meets around once a month to get the monarch's formal approval for government orders approved by ministers.<br/>There are several hundred privy councillors, although only current members of the government are involved in day-to-day business.<br/>All cabinet ministers, including prime ministers, are appointed for life.<br/>The only prime minister to have been removed from the list of privy councillors was short-lived premier William Cavendish, who was struck off by King George III when he suspected him of plotting against him. <br/>What happens for Boris Johnson now he's resigned?<br/>Calls for Truss not to take yearly \u00a3115,000 as ex-PM<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rachel Reeves says Labour will now \"ramp up\" its plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on green industries<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years. Last year, voters elected a Conservative mayor - even though the council itself is Labour.<br/>Commissioners have reported good progress at Sandwell and are \"optimistic\" about Liverpool - both areas where the incumbent party's vote has held up.<br/>Progress at Slough on the other hand has \"been very slow\", according to the commissioners, while Thurrock had another commissioner appointed in March after the government said it was \"continuing to fail in its best value duty\".<br/>So perhaps we can conclude that voters do pay attention to local issues - and are prepared to punish failed administrations at the ballot box.<br/>The people paying the price for a bankrupt council<br/>Commissioners will oversee troubled council<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Let me explain. <br/>The inquiry's chair Baroness Hallett is demanding unredacted WhatsApp messages and notebooks from Boris Johnson.<br/>They cover the period of the pandemic when he was prime minister and making key decisions.<br/>She is adamant that it is her job to decide what is and isn't relevant to her inquiry.<br/>The government disagrees - and speaking to people close to the process, I don't think they're going to back down. <br/>They argue that they need to protect the privacy of ministers and others. They say they will not send information that is \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry.<br/>Insiders have told the BBC they will send relevant messages - for example, WhatsApp conversations that led to a policy decision. They would not send messages involving personal conversations. <br/>But they think that decision is for the government - and its lawyers - to make.<br/>So who is going to win?<br/>The more likely answer seems to be the Covid inquiry.<br/>It has legal powers to compel people to produce documents. It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. It's his job is to look at constitutional issues like this. <br/>He told me: \"If the inquiry requests documents and info - then whoever it has asked should comply.\"<br/>He said this included the government.                             <br/>Caroline Nokes - another select committee chair - said Baroness Hallett was unlikely to roll over and there would be \"less pain for the government if they hand [the messages] over quickly\".<br/>Former Conservative health secretary Matt Hancock is among those who have made clear they are happy to share unredacted messages in full.<br/>Boris Johnson's allies have also made clear he is happy to send more information - and he says he has given his WhatsApp messages and notebooks in full to the Cabinet Office.<br/>He has also said he will bypass the Cabinet Office by providing WhatsApps dating from April 2021 onwards directly to the inquiry. <br/>So where does this leave the government? <br/>Potentially in a tricky place. <br/>It has now launched a legal battle with the inquiry looking into how it functioned during a public health crisis that changed all of our lives. <br/>If it loses, that would be an embarrassing defeat. Questions would be asked about using public money to fight the case. <br/>If it wins, it's quite possible the Covid inquiry will be seriously undermined. <br/>Will bereaved families who have demanded full transparency accept this? Where would such a ruling leave inquiry chair Baroness Hallett, who has made her position clear? <br/>Cabinet minister Mel Stride has questioned the need for \"irrelevant\" documents to be provided to the inquiry - saying they would not add value.<br/>He told the BBC the government would be \"robust and open and candid\" in its dealings with the inquiry.<br/>But he drew a distinction with information that was \"unambiguously, entirely irrelevant\".<br/>He added: \"It seems to me to request lots and lots of that kind of data is not something which is adding any value\". <br/>With the government and the inquiry now locked in a legal battle, this row looks set to drag on.<br/>Covid inquiry demands release of Johnson WhatsApps<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

There's obviously going to be one or two things, but I think there's every reason to be confident.\"<br/>Surprisingly, Scottish Labour Party member Amy Lee Fraoli agrees with Luke in some ways.<br/>But she thinks Ms Sturgeon leaving gives her party a big chance to get more voters.<br/>Speaking to Newsbeat down the coast from Dundee at Edinburgh's Portobello Beach, she says there's been \"this sort of scrabble for the next big personality\".<br/>\"I think it's an opportunity to say no this isn't about personality, this is about what you want to do with the country and your values,\" she says.<br/>\"We've not been focusing on what's behind the scenes and the state of our health system and education system and things like that.\"<br/>And 24-year-old Amy thinks young voters like her are now starting to think about issues other than independence now Ms Sturgeon has left.<br/>\"Just before she'd left the conversation was dominated by independence but I think young people are now asking 'how do things affect me?'<br/>\"What's my chance of getting into uni or what experience have I had at school, is independence the answer to that or is there another way we could go about that?\"<br/>Amy, who lives in West Lothian, thinks it's time for a change after 16 years of SNP government.<br/>\"People in the area I'm from aren't better off, the education system's not better off, in some places it's actually worse than it was when the SNP came to office in 2007.\"<br/>Scottish Conservatives member Euan Blockley says the independence referendum was the first time he was able to vote.<br/>\"It's what sort of got me into politics. And then there was this wave of nationalism and Nicola Sturgeon,\" the 25-year-old says.<br/>Euan, who lives in Glasgow, says he's \"delighted\" Ms Sturgeon has left and believes voters are motivated to remove a \"very bad SNP government\".<br/>\"Some people did have a soft spot for Nicola Sturgeon,\" he says.<br/>\"But now you look at the opinion poll ratings of Humza Yousaf, they certainly don't feel that way about him.<br/>\"I think that's going to motivate people to go out and vote for unionist parties and particularly the Scottish Conservatives.\"<br/>But how does Euan think the Scottish Tories will appeal to young voters, a group they haven't always been associated with?<br/>\"I think we've got a big task, I'm not going to pretend lots and lots of young people are voting Scottish Conservative,\" he says. <br/>\"But I think it's why we've got to direct policies to young people that will benefit them. <br/>\"We need to build more houses, all of my friends are struggling to get on the housing ladder.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled.<br/>Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration<br/>Legal migration is too high, says Rishi Sunak<br/>Who is allowed to come to live in the UK?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

For MPs from the party, the data on voting intention highlights their thin support among younger generations.<br/>A YouGov poll found only 21% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they voted Conservative at the last general election in 2019, compared to 67% in the over-70s category.<br/>In recent polling, done at this month's local elections, only 8% of the 18 to 24 group said they would vote Conservative.<br/>\"For the 29 to 49-year-olds, that figure was 10%,\" Mr Hancock tells the event.<br/>That 10% figure, Mr Hancock says, \"is catastrophic for the electability of the Conservative Party, not just now, but for a decade\".<br/>\"We need to have credible policies that address the issues that younger people care about,\" he says.<br/>As a TikTok enthusiast with 184,000 followers on the platform, Mr Hancock claims to have an antenna for what young people are looking for in politics.<br/>Curbing climate change, providing more affordable housing, and technological innovation are what young people care about - not some \"divisive culture war\", Mr Hancock says.<br/>Even though he's been suspended as a Tory MP over his appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity, Mr Hancock is well received here.<br/>But does his analysis really reflect the hopes and fears of younger generations?<br/>At the event, we speak to five people under the age of 30, and tellingly, all of them say housing is their biggest worry.<br/>Eve Redmond, a 23-year-old renter who recently moved to London, says: \"I don't think I'll get on the property ladder in the next 10 to 15 years.<br/>\"I do think housing is a particularly important political issue for young people under the age of 30, millennials like me.\"<br/>Joe Lynch, the 18-year-old chairman of Romford Young Conservatives, agrees.<br/>\"We need more affordable housing,\" he says. \"If we can do that as a party, more young people can flock to us.\"<br/>He says the creeping Americanisation of British politics has damaged the Conservative brand.<br/>Some young people, he says, \"think we're all Make American Great Again lunatics, but that's not the case at all\".<br/>The perception among young people of being \"the nasty party\" troubles Nathan Stone, 20.<br/>He says the war against woke - a term that has come to symbolise conservative resistance to social changes - has been \"taken to the extremes\" lately.<br/>He says some of the ideas expressed at this week's National Conservatism Conference - an event organised by a right-wing American think tank - are \"not really going to appeal to younger people\".<br/>In his comments, Mr Hancock savages the \"Conservative Corbynistas\" in his party, who \"preach the same sort of cancel culture and virtue signalling that they say that they abhor on the left\".<br/>\"Looking at what's going on at other conferences, sometimes it felt like 'I'm a Conservative get me out of here',\" he says.<br/>With Mr Hancock standing down as an MP at the next election, he soon will be out of there. And yet, he still believes the liberal wing of his party has the answers to today's political questions.<br/>They will need answers if they are to bridge the generational gulfs exposed at recent general elections. In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now.

<br/>The Commons standards committee recommended in March that the MP - who was elected for the SNP but had been sitting as an independent - should be suspended for 30 days.<br/>Ms Ferrier appealed the judgement, but it was later upheld when MPs voted by 185 to 40 in favour of the suspension on 6 June. <br/>Any MP suspended for more than 10 days will face a recall petition.<br/>If the petition is signed by more than 10% of eligible voters in the constituency within six weeks, the MP is removed from their seat and a by-election called.<br/>South Lanarkshire Council has confirmed the Margaret Ferrier recall petition will be open from 09:00 on Tuesday 20 June to 17:00 on Monday 31 July 2023.<br/>Constituents can sign the document at seven council sites across the area.<br/>Applications to participate by post or by proxy can be organised by contacting the Electoral Registration Office.<br/>The council has also confirmed that the number of Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituents entitled to sign the petition is 81,124 - so 8,113 people would have to sign to remove Ms Ferrier.<br/>If this is successful, it is likely a by-election will not happen until the autumn.<br/>Labour had already selected a candidate for a by-election before the Commons had even voted to suspend her, with the party quietly confident of winning the seat and adding momentum to its campaign ahead of next year's general election. <br/>The recall procedure for MPs was introduced in 2015 in response to the MPs' expenses scandal in the run up to the 2010 general election.<br/>MPs can be recalled under three circumstances:<br/>A petition officer then arranges for the petition to be open for six weeks. <br/>According to House of Commons Library, electors can sign it in person at a signing station or by post or proxy.<br/>If the 10% threshold is reached the petition officer informs the Speaker of the House of Commons - the seat becomes vacant when this notice is given.<br/>Two MPs have been recalled through this process both in 2019 - Labour's Fiona Onasanya of Peterborough and Conservative Chris Davies of Brecon and Radnorshire.<br/>Ms Onasanya, who lied to police over a speeding ticket, had been jailed for three months for perverting the course of justice.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Davies had pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false expenses claim.<br/>A recall petition was held in North Antrim in September 2018 over the DUP's Ian Paisley, but failed to get enough signatures.<br/>The Commons had voted to suspend him for failing to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government and lobbying on its behalf.<br/>This will be the first recall petition held in Scotland.<br/>People can campaign for or against recall petitions and the Electoral Commission has rules in place for spending and donations on such campaigns.<br/>Voters who want to sign the recall petition will need voter ID because of new rules introduced by the UK government.<br/>It had been suggested that some Conservative MPs might vote against the motion to ban Ms Ferrier as they are concerned about the precedent it would set in the case of Boris Johnson.<br/>The former PM's behaviour is being looked at by Westminster's Privileges Committee over whether he misled parliament.<br/>Of the 40 MPs who ultimately opposed her suspension, 32 were Conservatives, two were DUP, two were Alba - Neale Hanvey and Kenny MacAskill - and one was Reclaim.<br/>The Conservatives who backed her included former ministers David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and party grandees Sir Bill Cash and Sir Edward Leigh.<br/>Ferrier was accompanied in the Commons for the vote by Conservative former minister Andrew Selous and SNP MP Carol Monaghan. <br/>At one point, Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski was seen walking to the opposition benches to shake her hand.<br/>Many of her former SNP colleagues had been calling for her to quit as an MP since her lockdown breach first came to light. <br/>Covid train trip MP loses appeal over Commons ban<br/>Figures show voters turned away due to no photo ID<br/>Who is Margaret Ferrier?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods and companies pay tax on their profits.<br/>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens.<br/>But if it can't, it needs to either raise taxes, cut spending or borrow. <br/>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.<br/>So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which they hope will help the economy.<br/>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.<br/>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. <br/>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.<br/>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. <br/>The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called \"quantitative easing\".<br/>The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. <br/>For instance, when people submit tax returns in January, they often pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, so the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. <br/>So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date.<br/>In the 2022-23 financial year, the government borrowed \u00a3134.1bn. That was about \u00a312bn higher than the previous year.<br/>In May, the government borrowed \u00a320bn, which was the second-highest borrowing figure for May since records began in 1993.<br/>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about \u00a32.57tn.<br/>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.<br/>That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. <br/>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level.<br/>But in relation to the size of the economy, today's debt is still low compared with much of the last century, as shown above, and also compared with some other leading economies. <br/>The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. <br/>That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s. But it is more noticeable now that interest rates have been rising. <br/>Two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: \u00a320bn in June and \u00a318bn in December. The third largest amount came in April 2023, when interest payments hit \u00a39.8bn.<br/>In May 2023, debt interest was \u00a37.7bn.<br/>During the last financial year, the government spent \u00a3111bn on debt interest - more than it spent on education. <br/>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  <br/>Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.<br/>The government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. <br/>In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. <br/>The OBR says debt could rise to more than 300% of GDP by 2070. <br/>It also says climate change poses a \"significant\" risk to government finances. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?<br/>Responding to the OBR report, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government would take \"difficult but responsible\" decisions on the public finances.<br/>He previously blamed the \"twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine\" for driving up government costs.<br/>The chancellor has set a target of getting underlying debt to fall in five years' time.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises.<br/>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.<br/>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. <br/>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. <br/>It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  <br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

El Ni\u00f1o normally doesn't really have a global impact until five or six months into the phase,\" Dr Smith says.<br/>El Ni\u00f1o is the world's most powerful naturally occurring climate fluctuation. It brings warmer water to the surface in the tropical Pacific, pushing warmer air into the atmosphere. It normally increases global air temperatures.<br/>The average global temperature in June this year was 1.47C above the typical June in the pre-industrial period. Humans started pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when the Industrial Revolution started around 1800.<br/>Asked if summer 2023 is what he would have forecasted a decade ago, Dr Smith says that climate models are good at predicting long-term trends but less good at forecasting the next 10 years.<br/>\"Models from the 1990s pretty much put us where we are today. But to have an idea about what the next 10 years would look like exactly would be very difficult,\" he says.<br/>\"Things aren't going to cool down,\" he adds.<br/>The average global ocean temperature has smashed records for May, June and July. It is approaching the highest sea surface temperature ever recorded, which was in 2016.<br/>But it is extreme heat in the North Atlantic ocean that is particularly alarming scientists.<br/>\"We've never ever had a marine heatwave in this part of Atlantic. I had not expected this,\" says Daniela Schmidt, Prof of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.<br/>Press play to see the map animated.<br/>In June temperatures off the west coast of Ireland were between 4C and 5C above average, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classified as a category 5 heatwave, or \"beyond extreme\".<br/>Directly attributing this heatwave to climate change is complex, but that work is ongoing, Prof Schmidt says.<br/>What is clear is that the world has warmed and the oceans have absorbed most of that heat from the atmosphere, she explains.<br/>\"Our models have natural variability in them, and there are still things appearing that we had not envisaged, or at least not yet,\" she adds.<br/>She emphasises the impact of this heat on marine ecosystems, which produce 50% of the world's oxygen.<br/>\"People tend to think about trees and grasses dying when we talk about heatwaves. The Atlantic is 5C warmer than it should be - that means organisms need 50% more food just to function as normal,\" she says.<br/>The area covered by sea-ice in the Antarctic is at record lows for July. There is an area around 10 times the size of the UK missing, compared with the 1981-2010 average.<br/>Alarm bells are ringing for scientists as they try to unpick the exact link to climate change.<br/>A warming world could reduce levels of Antarctic sea-ice, but the current dramatic reduction could also be due to local weather conditions or ocean currents, explains Dr Caroline Holmes at the British Antarctic Survey.<br/>She emphasises it is not just a record being broken - it is being smashed by a long way.<br/>\"This is nothing like anything we've seen before in July. It's 10% lower than the previous low, which is huge.\"<br/>She calls it \"another sign that we don't really understand the pace of change\".<br/>Scientists believed that global warming would affect Antarctic sea-ice at some point, but until 2015 it bucked the global trend for other oceans, Dr Holmes says.<br/>\"You can say that we've fallen off a cliff, but we don't know what's at the bottom of the cliff here,\" she says.<br/>\"I think this has taken us by surprise in terms of the speed of which has happened. It's definitely not the best case scenario that we were looking at - it's closer to the worst case,\" she says.<br/>We can certainly expect more and more of these records to break as the year goes on and we enter 2024, scientists say.<br/>But it would be wrong to call what is happening a \"climate collapse\" or \"runaway warming\", cautions Dr Otto.<br/>We are in a new era, but \"we still have time to secure a liveable future for many\", she explains.<br/>Additional reporting by Mark Poynting and Becky Dale<br/>World will miss 1.5C warming limit - top UK expert<br/>Nearly all major Italian cities on red heat alert<br/>Heatwaves are new normal as 50C hits US and China - UN<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

She was on the lookout - for sharks.<br/>A native of Southampton, New York, Ms Steidle grew up going to the beach, longing to learn more about what lived beneath the surface. Everything changed when she picked up a drone in 2015. <br/>Since then, she has filmed humpback whales emerging from the deep to engulf prey in their giant maws, and a fleet of ghostly rays swimming in formation with the aid of a drone that can soar as high as 400 feet, or hover over the surface of the water. The astonishing images have even caught the eye of National Geographic. <br/>The sharks, she said, are the most exciting. Several of her videos show these formidable predators hunting schools of fish like a pack of aquatic wolves.<br/>\"The way they move and the way they interact with the species around them is fascinating,\" she said. \"It's like they're sharing a big buffet.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Joanna Steidle's footage reveals an underwater world hidden just out of sight.<br/>In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. <br/>The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images - great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase.<br/>Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters.<br/>Humans are not on the menu. But this summer, some sharks are coming too close for comfort.<br/>The water around Long Island has warmed due to climate change, becoming more hospitable to sharks. New laws have protected the sharks' primary food source - bunker fish - by banning harmful fishing practices. <br/>This means more sharks are heading closer to the shoreline to hunt the now plentiful bunker fish, with the potential to mistakenly nibble on humans getting in their way. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Why we need sharks in our oceans<br/>Shark bites are incredibly rare. According to the International Shark Attack File, New York state had only 8 unprovoked bites in 2022 and none were fatal. <br/>But at least four shark encounters occurred on Long Island over the recent 4 July weekend. In one instance, 15-year-old surfer Peter Banculli suffered a suspected shark bite near Fire Island. (He assured a Long Island news station he would soon be ready to \"start shredding again\".)<br/>As a result, Governor Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed.<br/>But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface. <br/>Drone footage also has the potential to spark fears about a species humans have been swimming alongside for years, according to Frank Quevedo, the executive director of the South Fork Natural History Museum (SOFO) in Long Island. <br/>\"Everybody that's seeing a shark now is documenting it and can blast it onto the internet on social media and millions of people can see it,\" he said. \"So people demonise sharks saying, 'Oh, they're in our waters, they're going to kill people.'\"<br/>A least once this summer, a drone has sparked unnecessary worries on the shoreline.<br/>Earlier this month, one drone operator, who mistook a school of large fish for a swarm of 50 sharks, caused a closure at Robert Moses State Beach.<br/>\"It caused a panic,\" Mr Quevedo said. <br/>Sharks still loom large in the public imagination as deadly man-eaters, thanks to the 1975 blockbuster Jaws, in which a great white shark menaced swimmers off the coast of Massachusetts.<br/>It has taken decades of research and education to try to shift the public perception of sharks and stop the debilitating hunting of great white sharks in particular, Mr Quevedo said.<br/>Some amateur drone enthusiasts believe that by capturing images of sharks peacefully coexisting alongside us, they can help dispel myths. <br/>Carlos Gauna, who takes drone videos of California's Malibu coastline as a hobby, has captured numerous images of juvenile great white sharks floating just feet from surfers - and leaving them alone.<br/>He posts the videos on his YouTube channel, The Malibu Artist, in the hopes of showing viewers a different perspective.<br/>\"You have this perception of sharks that they're going to be aggressive and they're just this hungry monster all the time,\" Mr Gauna told the BBC.<br/>\"It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,\" he said. \"They're just chillin'\".<br/>Jon Dodd, founder of Atlantic Shark Institute, believes drones have become a useful tool for researching the animals. \"They don't alter the movements of these sharks, so you can really study what they're doing in a natural environment,\" he said. <br/>Almost 3,000 miles away in the Hamptons, Mr Quevedo and his colleagues have used drones to document their conservation efforts, which involve tagging sharks and collecting data such as their size, sex and oxygen levels. <br/>Rather than use footage of sharks to scare people from the water, Mr Quevedo said officials should focus on educating swimmers about how their sharp-toothed neighbours operate.<br/>Why Sharks Attack<br/>After three fatal shark attacks in Egypt, this film asks if shark behaviour is changing.<br/>Watch on iPlayer (only in UK)<br/>On a sunny day this week, residents at Cooper's Beach in the Hamptons had already seen police flying drones overhead.<br/>Southampton resident Suzanne Moore said they made her feel safer. \"They're monitoring and then they let all the other people know,\" said the 69-year-old who was sunning with her friends.<br/> \"If the police spot them with drones, they won't let anyone in,\" her friend, 70-year-old Jen Cerrato, chimed in.<br/>The beachgoers said the increased drone surveillance did not make them more afraid of sharks. <br/>Ms Steidle, the shark photographer, criticised drone tactics that stigmatise sharks. <br/>She told the BBC that she filmed the animals quite close to the Hamptons shore. In one video, her drone spotted 13 sharks, including a juvenile great white shark, swimming mere hundreds of feet from the beach. She had never seen one attack a human.<br/>The technology has instead helped her uncover the enormity of the Atlantic Ocean, and the beauty of the sharks and other marine creatures who call it home.<br/>\"We're not alone here,\" she said. \"We share the space.\"<br/>Seeing sharks through her drone's eye \"reminds me of my smallness,\" she added. \"I'm just this tiny little speck, on this huge planet.\"<br/>Humans hundreds of times 'deadlier' than sharks<br/>Drone shows great white sharks swimming under surfers<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It meant that if prices were low, the companies would get a subsidy. If prices rise, the gains must be paid back.<br/>But Vattenfall said it had seen its costs, driven by inflation, supply issues and rising wages, soar by 40%.<br/>The money the government had agreed to pay them, the firm said, would not cover these increased costs.<br/>Chief executive Anna Borg said: \"Conditions are extremely challenging across the whole industry right now, with a supply chain squeeze, increasing prices and cost of capital, and fiscal frameworks not reflecting current market realities.\"<br/>The company said two other Norfolk sites - known as Vanguard East and Vanguard West - will be reviewed.<br/>Vattenfall said it remained committed to the region and was \"evaluating the best way forward for all three projects in the Norfolk Zone\".<br/>\"We have attractive wind power projects in the pipeline, and investment decisions will always be based on profitability,\" the company said.<br/>Norfolk County Council said while it was \"naturally disappointed\" the development had been \"paused\" the company had \"reassured\" it the rest of the Norfolk offshore plan would still go ahead.<br/>A spokesman said it remained \"optimistic\" about the future.<br/>Robert Bush, from the East of England Energy Group, said the impact \"will be felt on the local supply chain\" which includes about 1,000 companies.<br/>\"They have other projects to work on but this will be felt,\" he said.<br/>Orbis Energy, a Lowestoft-based clean energy hub for about 40 businesses, said the decision was \"disappointing\" but claimed there were \"opportunities and solutions that can bring it back on track\".<br/>Business development manager, Ian Pease, said the government needed to support developers.<br/>He said it was \"not just about subsidies\" but about how we can \"work smartly and reduce costs\" in order \"to make it the most cost-effective region for offshore wind in the world\".  <br/>Professor Aled Jones, director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, said rising costs meant the \"government needs to consider what role the private sector has in powering the future of Britain\".<br/>He said while renewable energy offered \"significant returns on investment\" those returns came over periods of time longer than the private sector is \"currently willing to tolerate\".<br/>\"The case for a UK-led renewable energy developer, backed by the UK public which can benefit from the returns over the next few decades, has just become stronger,\" he said.<br/>Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the government needed to take account of rising costs when awarding contracts.<br/>\"If the government gets the policy wrong on the current round of renewables auctions and doesn't keep pace with increasing costs,\" he said, \"the UK could end up even more reliant on foreign gas, leaving households on the hook with higher bills.\"<br/>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said CfDs offered developers burdened with high initial costs \"direct protection from volatile wholesale prices\".<br/>A government spokesman said: \"We understand there are supply chain pressures for the sector globally, not just in the UK, and we are listening to companies' concerns.\"<br/>Duncan Baker, Conservative MP for North Norfolk, said one of the reasons construction costs were high was the lack of a shared offshore ring main, which meant windfarms needed to run separate cables to onshore substations.<br/>\"The system and infrastructure for delivery is completely outdated, we have been saying this for many years and now it's come back to bite us,\" he said.<br/>George Freeman, MP for Mid Norfolk, said he was \"not too worried\" it would undermine the government's long term commitment to net zero.<br/>The Conservative MP for Waveney in North Suffolk, Peter Aldous, said there was \"a concern that the CfD mechanism\" needed to be reviewed. <br/>\"I think this can be resolved... I think all roads lead to the chancellor's autumn statement,\" he said.<br/>Among MPs, councillors and industry experts there is real disappointment.<br/>There is also frustration because I'm told that in private, the energy companies have been telling local MPs and ministers about their concerns for some time. High inflation, supply shortages and rising wages made it inevitable that an energy company would reconsider its plans.  Among MPs there's a feeling the government will have to come up with more money (which will probably end up on our electricity bills) and reform its contract with the energy companies. <br/>But I'm told there are other grumbles too: windfall taxes, delays in granting planning permission and public anger over pylons which one MP claims, makes energy companies feel unwelcome. <br/>The onshore work is still going ahead. There is a feeling that this will be resolved \"because there is no alternative\" as one expert put it. <br/>But this is a delay which the industry and arguably our climate could have done without.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

So all of that is air pollution, whether it smells good or bad,\" she says.<br/>\"Indoor air pollution is huge, and it's a relatively unknown frontier, because even my next-door neighbour's house has a different air pollution fingerprint than my house would have,\" Dr Hicks says.<br/>Indoor air pollution is highly complex, little regulated, and often beyond individual control. For instance, road traffic produces nitrogen dioxide, while moisture and structural issues in buildings can lead to mould.<br/>Air purifiers with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can help. But the initial cost plus the energy to run them can be out of reach for some households.<br/>This is one reason that it's so appealing to think of potted plants as passively, and inexpensively, cleaning the air. Essentially, plant leaves take in carbon dioxide and other pollutants, which are then used in various plant processes or broken down.<br/>Especially important here are the community of micro-organisms and the growing medium (such as soil or compost), which in many studies do more to absorb pollutants than the plant itself. <br/>An influential NASA study from 1989 found that indoor plants could remove formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air. But the study was unrealistic for real-world conditions.<br/>In essence, an indoor forest would be required to meaningfully reduce VOCs in a home. <br/>\"You need an awful lot of plants in very well-lit space to make any measurable impact on the removal of VOCs and many other gases,\" says Tijana Blanusa, the principal horticultural scientist for the Royal Horticultural Society, as well as a researcher at the University of Reading.<br/>Similarly, for carbon dioxide, \"you need very large numbers of plants to actually have measurable effects at room scale.\"<br/>So is scaling-up the answer?<br/>Some researchers, including Tijana Blanusa, have moved on from individual potted plants to active (living) green walls, which can concentrate more plants and also filter air more efficiently due to the way air can be moved through them.<br/>She explains that with active green walls: \"Air from the room is being pushed or encouraged through the root systems over and above the level which would happen naturally if you just had the plants sitting in a pot.\"<br/>However, such green walls are expensive to install and maintain.<br/>So people continue to experiment with plants.<br/>When building consultancy Cundall moved into their current London office in 2015, they filled one of the meeting rooms, known as the Green Lab, with plants.<br/>The aim was to monitor and record the plants' impact on indoor air quality. But it was challenging to look after them all.<br/>It also became clear that the plants weren't having the same effect on air quality as the mechanical ventilation and air purification systems.<br/>The room now has a few large plants in the corners, as well as a small rectangle of preserved reindeer moss on the wall. The spongy moss is lovely to touch and look at, but has no ability to absorb pollutants.<br/>When clients ask about plants for improving air quality, Kavita Kumari, the associate director of Cundall's London office, advises them on plants' advantages and limitations.<br/>She recommends plants that are relatively low-maintenance while being able to reduce some VOCs and produce oxygen, though she acknowledges that these effects are modest.<br/>One such plant is the snake plant (a common houseplant also sometimes known by the sexist moniker mother-in-law's tongue, due to its sharp shape).<br/>Ms Kumari says that while most plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the day, this plant\u202fis able to do so at night as well.<br/>She says that simply opening a window to allow the outflow of indoor air pollutants doesn't work in highly built-up areas, where outdoor pollutants can enter at the same time.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Scientists are working on a new generation of plants bioengineered to make them especially efficient at purifying air.<br/>Researchers at the University of Washington have genetically modified pothos plants with a synthetic version of a \"green liver\" protein found in rabbits, which can process chloroform and benzene.<br/>The company Neoplants has also tweaked genes in pothos plants to enable them to essentially recycle certain VOCs. As well, the company has produced beneficial bacteria that are especially effective at breaking down VOCs, which are delivered to the plants' root systems. It's this microbiome rather than the plant itself that produces most of the plants' air-cleaning effects.<br/>However, even improving on the NASA results 30-fold, as Neoplants claims to do, wouldn't make it feasible to rely on plants alone to clean the air. <br/>So for now, the actual air-purification benefits of indoor plants are limited. They can't compete with air purifiers.<br/>But plants have other clear benefits - for instance on mood, creativity and productivity.<br/>Ms Kumari advises clients on complying with the targets set out by the WELL Building Standard, a certification for buildings that promotes health and wellbeing. One of these targets is to have 1% of the indoor surface covered by plants.<br/>This target falls under the \"Mind\" category rather than \"Air\", suggesting that evidence of the benefits of indoor plants is stronger for the mental health benefits than the air quality ones. As Ms Kumari comments, \"plants do give you a sense of calm.\"<br/>Ultimately, air-quality experts remain in favour of indoor plants.

That target has become the centrepiece of global efforts to tackle climate change.<br/>Climate scientists have been warning governments for years that they are not cutting their countries' emissions quickly enough to keep within this target. <br/>But it is surprising for someone as senior and well respected as the former head of the UN climate science body the IPCC to be so frank that he believes it will be missed.<br/>Professor Sir Bob Watson is currently Emeritus Professor of the UK's Tyndall Centre for Climate Research - having previously worked at the UN, Nasa, UK's Department of Environment and the US White House - and is perhaps one of the foremost climate scientists in the world.<br/>In the interview aired on Thursday he said: \"I think most people fear that if we give up on the 1.5 [Celsius limit] which I do not believe we will achieve, in fact I'm very pessimistic about achieving even 2C, that if we allow the target to become looser and looser, higher and higher, governments will do even less in the future.\"<br/>His comments although candid were supported by Lord Stern, Chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, later on Thursday during an interview with BBC's WATO programme.<br/>He said: \"I think 1.5 is probably out of reach even if we accelerate quickly now, but we could bring it back if we start to bring down the cost of negative emissions and get better at negative emissions. Negative emissions means direct air capture of carbon dioxide.\"<br/>Based on current government commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, Climate Action Tracker predicts that global temperatures will rise to 2.7C.<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long-term global average - and even slight changes can have significant impacts. <br/>The UN climate body, the IPCC, has said keeping temperature rises below 1.5C, rather than 2C, would mean:<br/>Prof Sir Bob Watson said that the world was struggling to prevent temperature rises as we are not reducing emissions fast enough. <br/>\"The big issue is we need to reduce greenhouse gases now to even be on the pathway to be close to 1.5C or 2C. We need to reduce current emissions by at least 50% by 2030. The trouble is the emissions are still going up, they are not going down,\" he said.<br/>He told the Today programme that setting targets was not enough and countries needed to back these up with action: \"We need to try and hold governments to start to act sensibly now and reduce emissions, but even governments with a really good target like the United Kingdom don't have the policies in place, don't have the financing in place to reach those goals.\"<br/>In March the UK's watchdog on climate change, the UKCCC, said the UK had lost its leadership on climate issues. It said the government's backing of new oil and coal projects, airport expansion plans and slow progress on heat pumps showed a lack of urgency.<br/>In response to comments from Lord Stern and Professor Sir Bob Watson, a government spokesperson said: \"The UK is a world-leader on net zero, cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country and has attracted billions of investment into renewables, which now account for 40% of our electricity.\"<br/>But Lord Deben, who until last month was chair of the UKCCC, said the government was \"entirely wrong\". Talking to BBC's WATO programme he said that other countries like the US and China were moving much faster, and that the UK was setting \"the worst possible example to the rest of the world\".<br/>World likely to warm beyond key 1.5C limit by 2027<br/>What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

She was not involved in the research.<br/>\"What makes this assessment different is that it takes real people's diets and is based on the various production methods we have at the moment,\" she said. \"The researchers have assessed at a much more granular level than has been done before the environmental footprint of what they are eating.\"<br/>The research shows that a big meat-eater's diet produces an average of 10.24 kg of planet-warming greenhouse gasses each day. A low meat-eater produces almost half that at 5.37 kg per day. And for vegan diets - it's halved again to 2.47 kg a day.<br/>The analysis is the first to look at the detailed impact of diets on other environmental measures all together. These are land use, water use, water pollution and loss of species, usually caused by loss of habitat because of expansion of farming. In all cases high meat-eaters had a significantly higher adverse impact than other groups.<br/>Britain has some of the most sustainable methods of meat production. And the sector employs nearly 100,000 people making \u00a39.5bn a year for the UK. <br/>Nick Allen, CEO of the British Meat Processors Association says that such assessments were incomplete.<br/>''One of the frustrations with a report like this is that it looks just at the emissions from livestock production. It doesn't take into account that carbon gets absorbed into the grassland, trees and hedgerows [on farms]. If they took those sums into account you would probably have a different picture,'' he said.<br/>In response Prof Scarborough said that a number of studies, including this one, had concluded that the taking up of CO2 by grasslands only have a ''modest impact''.<br/>A separate study also published in Nature Food in 2021 concluded that food production was responsible for a third of all global greenhouse gas emissions. And an independent review for the Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) called for a 30% reduction in meat consumption by 2032 in order to meet the UK's net zero target.<br/>But according to Prof Jebb, little has been done to achieve this aim.<br/>\"In the UK it is still not accepted that we are eating an amount of meat which is inconsistent with our environmental goals. At the moment, the conversation is not how we are going to do this, but whether it is really necessary,\" she said.<br/>\"In the case of obesity people know they shouldn't be eating confectionary cakes and biscuits. They may not want to hear it, but they know it to be true. With meat they are not wholly convinced.\"<br/>She adds that as well as encouraging people to change their diets, the government also needs to support farmers through the transition, by protecting their livelihoods.<br/>\"Our farmers are trying pretty hard to be sustainable, more so than in many other countries, and yet we in the UK are putting... more pressure on our farmers to change, and that is pretty tough if you are a farmer,\" she said. <br/>In response a Defra spokesperson said ''people should make their own decisions around the food they eat\".<br/>\"Achieving the net zero target is a priority for this government, and whilst food choices can have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, well-managed livestock also provide environmental benefits such as supporting biodiversity, protecting the character of the countryside and generating important income for rural communities.\"<br/>The study has been published in Nature Food<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Science breakthrough for food eco-labelling<br/>What's your diet's carbon footprint?<br/>LEAP<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

We are at the stage where promising further action is not enough.<br/>\"The scale of the climate impacts we are seeing make clear that resilience to climate change should be a much greater national priority.\"<br/>The UKCCC noted almost all the measures are re-announcements of existing commitments from other plans like the Environment Act. <br/>Trudy Harrison, minister for climate adaptation, said: \"We are absolutely serious across government. What we have set out today is billions of pounds of investment to protect the most vulnerable communities.\"<br/>She said the government had taken on board the climate change committee's comments.<br/>\"There's always more to do. This is a five-year plan,\" she said.<br/>New proposals in the plan from government include: <br/>As global temperatures continue to rise the risk of extreme events in the UK such as high heat, winter flooding and storm surge increases.<br/>Last year, during the most intense heat wave the country has ever faced, there were 25,000 wildfires from the moorlands of greater Manchester to the gardens of east London. Hospitals struggled to cope - around 3,000 more deaths in the over-65s than usual and 20% of operations were cancelled. <br/>Alongside flooding, overheating is one of the biggest risks the UK population face from climate change. <br/>Dr Chloe Brimicombe, researcher in heatwaves at University Graz,  told the BBC: \"The reason that it's a massive risk is that it causes significant health issues especially for vulnerable groups. It causes health issues like dehydration, heat stress which they might need to go to hospital for.\"<br/>The government wants contractors who build new schools and hospitals to implement cooling measures like shaded windows, green roofs and more open spaces. But there is no new legislation or funding for updates to existing homes to make sure they are protected.<br/>Under a scenario where global temperatures rise by 2C all homes in England and Wales are at risk of overheating according to energy consultants Arup.<br/>In dense urban areas like London, Manchester and Birmingham populations are particularly at risk. <br/>Rezina Chowdhury, Labour deputy leader of Lambeth council in south London told the BBC: \"Our communities feel the effects disproportionately with poorer households... and our residents live in flats without outside space.\"<br/>But she said that there is no secure funding: \"It is like Hunger Games where people are having to fight for pots of money to do the work we should all be doing.\"<br/>Local authorities are being offered advice and information from a new climate advice service to help them tailor their response. <br/>This move has been welcomed by Linda Taylor, environment spokesperson for the Local Government Association, the national body for authorities in England and Wales.<br/>\"But while access to Local Authority Climate Data could provide some good learning and understanding for councils, they crucially need the resources and money to take action on their findings,\" she said. <br/>The UK is not just vulnerable to heat at home but also abroad. The UK only produces 16% of its fruit and 50% of its vegetables domestically, relying on imports, mostly from Europe, to fulfil the shortfall. Therefore any extreme weather events in Europe could effect the supply here. <br/>Earlier this year the UK experienced shortages of cucumber, tomatoes and other popular vegetables after poor weather in Spain, and now the same region is baking under an intense heatwave. which could further damage crops.<br/>The UKCCC recommended in March that the government require, by law, all large food companies to assess the climate risks to their supply chains. <br/>The government did not propose this in the NAP. It said that a new Food Security Strategy would be produced for next year but industry was best placed to deal with the issue. <br/>Flooding and storms are the other major risk the UK currently faces. Memorable events such as Storm Arwen wreaked havoc with UK homes and key infrastructure. In November 2021, it left one million British properties without power and internet supply.<br/>There are no targets in the plan for improving the strength of the communications sector, which was a key ask of the UKCCC in March - but said Ofcom would look at issuing new guidance to companies to prepare for climate change.<br/>\u2018It\u2019s like an oven\u2019: Life in Britain\u2019s hottest areas<br/>UK heat deaths to triple without action on housing<br/>Why is there a shortage of tomatoes in the UK?<br/>UK Committee on Climate Change<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Very hot. And temperatures show no signs of easing.<br/>Nearly a third of Americans - over 113 million people - are under some form of heat advisory, the US National Weather Service said. <br/>Across the US, temperatures are shattering decades-long record highs. In El Paso, Texas, temperatures have soared to above 37C - triple-digits Fahrenheit - for 27 consecutive days, overtaking a record last set in 1994.  <br/>In the UK, the June heat didn't just break all-time records, it smashed them. It was 0.9C hotter than the previous record, set back in 1940. That is a huge margin.<br/>There is a similar story of unprecedented hot weather in North Africa, the Middle East and Asia.<br/>No surprise, then, that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather forecasts said that globally, June was the hottest on record.<br/>And the heat has not eased. The three hottest days ever recorded were in the past week, according to the EU climate and weather service, Copernicus.<br/>The average world temperature hit 16.89C on Monday 3 July and topped 17C for the first time on 4 July, with an average global temperature of 17.04C. <br/>Provisional figures suggest that was exceeded on 5 July when temperatures reached 17.05C.<br/>These highs are in line with what climate models predicted, says Prof Richard Betts, climate scientist at the Met Office and University of Exeter.<br/>\"We should not be at all surprised with the high global temperatures,\" he says. \"This is all a stark reminder of what we've known for a long time, and we will see ever more extremes until we stop building up more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\"<br/>When we think about how hot it is, we tend to think about the air temperature, because that's what we experience in our daily lives.   <br/>But most of the heat stored near the surface of the Earth is not in the atmosphere, but in the oceans. And we've been seeing some record ocean temperatures this spring and summer.  <br/>The North Atlantic, for example, is currently experiencing the highest surface water temperatures ever recorded.<br/>That marine heatwave has been particularly pronounced around the coasts of the UK, where some areas have experienced temperatures as much as 5C above what you would normally expect for this time of year.<br/>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has labelled it a Category 4 heatwave. The designation is rarely used outside of the tropics and denotes \"extreme\" heat.<br/>\"Such anomalous temperatures in this part of the North Atlantic are unheard of,\" says Daniela Schmidt, a professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.<br/>At the same time, an El Ni\u00f1o is developing in the tropical Pacific.  <br/>El Ni\u00f1o is a recurring weather pattern caused when warm waters rise to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean.<br/>With both the Atlantic and the Pacific experiencing heatwaves, it is perhaps not surprising that global sea surface temperatures for both April and May were the highest ever recorded in Met Office data that goes all the way back to 1850.<br/>If the seas are warmer than usual, you can expect higher air temperatures too, says Tim Lenton, professor of climate change at Exeter University.<br/>Most of the extra heat trapped by the build-up of greenhouse gases has gone into warming the surface ocean, he explains. That extra heat tends to get mixed downwards towards the deeper ocean, but movements in oceans currents - like El Ni\u00f1o - can bring it back to the surface.<br/>\"When that happens, a lot of that heat gets released into the atmosphere,\" says Prof Lenton, \"driving up air temperatures.\"<br/>It's easy to think of this exceptionally hot weather as unusual, but the depressing truth is that climate change means it is now normal to experience record-breaking temperatures.  <br/>Greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase year on year. The rate of growth has slowed slightly, but energy-related CO2 emissions were still up almost 1% last year, according to the International Energy Agency, a global energy watchdog.<br/>And the higher the global temperature, the higher the risk of heatwaves, says Friederike Otto, a climatologist at the Grantham Institute of Climate Change at Imperial College London.<br/>\"These heatwaves are not only more frequent, but also hotter and longer than they would have been without global warming,\" she says.<br/>Experts are already predicting that the developing El Ni\u00f1o is likely to make 2023 the world's hottest year.<br/>They fear it is likely to temporarily push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>And that is just the start. Unless we make dramatic reductions to greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures will continue to rise.<br/>The Met Office said this week that record June temperatures this year were made twice as likely because of man-made climate change. <br/>These rising temperatures are already driving fundamental and almost certainly irreversible changes in ecosystems across the world.<br/>The record June temperatures in the UK helped cause unprecedented deaths of fish in rivers and canals, for example.  <br/>We cannot know what impact the current marine heatwave will have on the UK, cautions Prof Schmidt of the University of Bristol, because we have never seen one this intense before. <br/>\"In other regions, around Australia, in the Mediterranean, entire ecosystems changed, kelp forests disappeared, and seabirds and whales starved,\" she says.<br/>The world is effectively in a race. <br/>It is clear we are speeding towards an ever hotter and more chaotic climate future, but we do have the technologies and tools to cut our emissions.<br/>The question now is whether we can do so rapidly enough to slow the climate juggernaut and keep the impacts of global warming within manageable boundaries.<br/>What do you want to know about these heatwaves?

This means that additional heat is now welling up to the surface of the Pacific ocean, pushing up the global temperature. <br/>\"The average global surface air temperature reaching 17C for the first time since we have reliable records available is a significant symbolic milestone in our warming world,\" said climate researcher Leon Simons.<br/>\"Now that the warmer phase of El Ni\u00f1o is starting we can expect a lot more daily, monthly and annual records breaking in the next 1.5 years.\"<br/>Monday's record temperature comes as the month of June was also confirmed as the hottest June in the global record. <br/>Average temperatures across the planet were 1.46C above the average in the period between 1850 and 1900.<br/>The impact of high temperatures is also being felt at the world's extremes. In Antarctica, the July temperature record was recently broken with a reading of 8.7C taken at Ukraine's Vernadsky Research base. <br/>With El Ni\u00f1o likely to strengthen over the coming months, it's likely that more records will be shattered as the northern hemisphere summer goes on.<br/>\"Chances are that July will be the warmest ever, and with it the hottest month ever: 'ever' meaning since the Eemian which is some 120,000 years ago,\" said Karsten Haustein, from the University of Leipzig.<br/>\"While southern hemisphere temperatures will drop a bit in the next few days, chances are that July and August will see even warmer days yet given that El Ni\u00f1o is now pretty much in full swing\".<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. <br/>These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.<br/>Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.<br/>Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100. <br/>To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.<br/>However, the UN now wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called \"the growing climate disaster\".<br/>Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as \"offsetting\".<br/>Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.<br/>One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.<br/>Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.<br/>To help reach net zero by 2050, the UK has made a series of ambitious pledges including:<br/>The government released an updated net zero strategy in March, but many climate experts criticised the announcement for lacking significant new policies or extra investment. <br/>The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards net zero by 2050. <br/>But despite the new strategy, the government's independent climate advisers now say they are \"markedly\" less confident than a year ago that the UK will meet the 2050 target. <br/>While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.<br/>This could include:<br/>Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.<br/>China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - aims for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions aren't fully developed, but its renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly.<br/>The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies. <br/>The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.<br/>India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.<br/>There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.<br/>For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself. <br/>But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. <br/>There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. <br/>But some climate scientists worry this could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their fossil fuel usage, by taking advantage of a switch to cleaner fuels in poorer countries which may have happened anyway.<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

But a BBC investigation tracked one video that has been viewed millions of times - and found the company is struggling to stop false climate information from spreading across the platform.<br/>If you searched for \"climate change\" on TikTok in recent months, you might have come across a video featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a, a self-styled \"business success coach\" with thousands of followers on social media.<br/>The video, shot during the 2017 London premiere of a documentary film about Mr Pe\u00f1a, shows a heated exchange between the American businessman and a member of the audience.<br/>Asked what \"the people with the money\" will do about climate change, he replies: \"The financial institutions and the banks know [climate change] is not going to happen.\"<br/>He adds, without providing any credible evidence: \"It's the greatest fraud that has been perpetrated on mankind this century.\" <br/>Contacted by the BBC, Mr Pe\u00f1a stood by these comments, saying climate change was actually a \"historical norm\" over thousands of years and \"not new\".  He questioned whether it was a \"genuine threat\" as well as the effectiveness of measures proposed by climate change activists in the face of growing emissions from China.  <br/>The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence has found that world temperatures are rising because of human activity, leading to rapid climate change and threatening every aspect of human life.<br/>But while Mr Pe\u00f1a's statements conflict with that scientific evidence, this clip appears to have been edited and re-uploaded by other users from different TikTok accounts dozens of times, racking up more than nine million views in the process. <br/>Under new community guidelines unveiled by TikTok last April, content that \"undermines well-established scientific consensus\" on climate change will not be allowed on the platform. <br/>And yet, the clip depicting Mr Pe\u00f1a is far from an isolated occurrence: the BBC identified 365 different videos in English denying the existence of man-made climate change.  <br/>TikTok itself deems climate change denial to be \"harmful misinformation\". Using tools available to any TikTok user, we reported those videos to the platform under that category. We then waited for at least a day to find out whether they would be taken down. <br/>The company did not remove almost 95% of the posts we flagged up - videos that, having been watched almost 30 million times, appeared to be attracting significant attention. <br/>In a statement to the BBC, TikTok said it is working \"to empower informed climate discussions\", and that it is working with fact-checkers to tackle misinformation. <br/>The company also pointed out that, when users search for videos about climate change, they are being shown a link to a United Nations website on the topic. <br/>But the video of Mr Pe\u00f1a demonstrates how \"bad arguments can spread really fast on TikTok\", says Roshan Salgado D'Arcy, a science communicator who uses social media to debunk viral videos that contain false claims about climate change. <br/>\"There are no real checks and balances to make sure that the information is accurate.\"<br/>The problem is not exclusive to English-speaking TikTok either: BBC Monitoring found dozens of other climate change-denying videos in Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian. <br/>\"As a member of the public on social media, it must be very easy to get the wrong idea about how certain we are about climate change,\" says Dr Doug McNeall, a scientist from the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.<br/>\"Misinformation can really damage our discussion about what to do about climate change.\" <br/>TikTok is aware of the problem - which is why, to mark Earth month in April, it announced it would begin actively removing content that contradicts basic climate science. <br/>In a blog post published at the time, it listed as examples of rule-breaking content posts \"denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it\". <br/>But the reach of videos like those featuring Mr Pe\u00f1a raises questions about how successfully this new policy is being enforced. <br/>\"Rules become irrelevant, if they're not applied consistently, accurately and fairly,\" says Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a UK counter-extremism think tank.<br/>Ms King said this emboldens people to try \"to game the system even more, because they know they can ultimately act with impunity\". <br/>Paul Scully MP, the minister for technology and the digital economy, told the BBC that the government's proposed Online Safety Bill would guarantee that the responsibility of social media platforms to tackle disinformation was \"taken seriously\".<br/>After we shared the findings of our investigation with TikTok, 65 accounts that had been posting wrong information about climate change in breach of the platform's guidelines were permanently removed.  <br/>The company also removed most of the remaining videos that were still online - including several that featured Dan Pe\u00f1a's 2017 talk.  <br/>However, at the time of writing, several copies of the clip featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a describing climate change as the \"greatest fraud\" can still be found on the app. <br/>At the Met Office, Dr McNeall welcomes TikTok's efforts against misinformation, but he questions whether this is a battle the company can win. <br/>\"As a scientist I'm happy to be challenged,\" he says. <br/>\"Maybe we should focus on promoting good climate science information, rather than just removing the content that we perhaps don't like.\"  <br/>The 'ninjas' fighting climate denial on Twitter<br/>A band of volunteers is keeping climate denial off Wikipedia<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\"<br/>Warning of 'very high' wildfire risk for Scotland<br/>Caution urged over countryside fire risks<br/>Fire service warning over disposable barbecues<br/>Highland wildfire could be largest ever in UK<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Now astronomers may soon be able to watch it happen.<br/>These distortions are happening all the time, all across the Universe.<br/>One of the groups that made the discovery is the European Pulsar Timing Array Consortium (EPTA), led by Prof Michael Kramer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn. <br/>He told BBC News that the discovery had the potential to change astronomers' ideas about the cosmos forever.<br/>\"It could tell us if Einstein's theory of gravity is wrong; it may tell us about what dark matter and dark energy, the mysterious stuff that makes up the bulk of the Universe, really is; and it could give us a new window into new theories of physics.\"<br/>Further study might give new insights into the role supermassive black holes play in the evolution of all galaxies.<br/>Dr Rebecca Bowler, of Manchester University, told BBC News that researchers believe there to be gigantic black holes at the heart of all galaxies and that that they grow over billions of years. But so far that has all been theoretical.<br/>\"We know supermassive black holes are there, we just don't know how they got there. One possibility is that smaller black holes merge, but there has been little observational evidence for this. <br/>\"But with these new observations we could see such a merger for the first time. And that directly will tell us how the most massive black holes form,\" she said.<br/>The observations were made by studying signals from dead stars called pulsars. These rotate and send out bursts of radio signals at extremely precise intervals. <br/>But researchers, which include astronomers from the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire and from Birmingham University, have found that these signals are reaching Earth ever so slightly faster or slower than they should be. And they say the time distortion is consistent with gravitational waves created by the merger of supermassive black holes across the Universe.<br/>Dr Stanislav Babak from Laboratory APC at CNRS, France, said  gravitational waves carried information about ''some of the best-kept secrets of the Universe\".<br/>The newly found gravitational waves are different to the ones detected to date. Those earlier waves are caused by much smaller, star-sized black holes crashing into each other. <br/>The type described in the latest research are thought to be from black holes that are hundreds of millions of times more massive, spiralling in on each other as they get ever closer.<br/>Their gravitational upheaval is so powerful that it distorts time and space - a process that can continue for billions of years until the supermassive black holes finally merge.<br/>The gravitational waves scientists have discovered previously can be thought of as brief rumbles, whereas the new ones are akin to  a background hum that is around us all the time. <br/>Their next step is to take more readings and combine observations. As further progress is made, another goal is to be able to uncover individual pairs of supermassive black holes - assuming they are the source.<br/>It's possible the gravitational waves could also be caused by other exciting phenomena, such as the very first black holes ever created, or exotic structures called cosmic strings, both of which can be thought of as seeds from which the Universe grew.<br/>Gravity is a constant force in our everyday lives. If you let go of a cup it falls and smashes on the ground each time you do so. But in space gravity does not stay the same. It can change if there is a sudden and catastrophic event - such as the collision of black holes.<br/>The event is so cataclysmic that space and time itself is distorted and ripples are sent across the Universe - as happens when a pebble is dropped in a pond. <br/>In the case of gravitational waves, everything in the Universe - the stars, planets and even us - are the water. Everything gets squeezed and stretched and then squashed and flattened ever so slightly as the ripples pass over us. And just like in a pond, the ripples quickly get smaller and disappear. <br/>Gravitational waves from the merger of star-sized black holes were directly detected for the first time in 2015. Very sensitive laser systems measured the ripples produced in the end moments before the collision.<br/>For the type of waves coming from the spiralling supermassive black holes, the pulsar approach is picking up the ripples produced in the billions of years before the final union. <br/>This is akin to a continuous stream of pebbles being thrown into the pond. And because the mergers are happening all across space, the signal comes across as a cacophony.<br/>The EPTA has combined results with a consortium in India (InPTA) and published their study results in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. <br/>Three other separate, competing research groups, from North America (NANOGrav), Australia (PPTA) and China (CPTA), have published similar assessments, sparking huge excitement across the physics and astronomy community. <br/>Scientists must first confirm their observations. None of the research groups have data that passes the gold standard of less than one in a million chance of error, which is generally required for conclusive proof - although combined, the various teams' results are certainly compelling. <br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

The dam acted as a flood defence to places downstream, mainly to the south and south-west.<br/>BBC Verify monitored the four canal entrances using satellite imagery, and by 15 June, all had become disconnected as the reservoir water level kept dropping.<br/>Further images reveal the reservoir, which previously held 18 cubic kilometres of water, had dried up significantly.<br/>Shallower parts of the reservoir were exposed first, revealing some of the original shape of the Dnipro River prior to the dam's construction in 1956.<br/>Images show the canals still contain water further away from the reservoir. It is unclear how long it will take for them to run dry.<br/>Before the war, about 5,840 sq km (2,255 sq miles) of cropland on both sides of the Dnipro river could potentially be serviced by the canals, with more than half the area reliant on irrigation systems. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>These areas yielded about two million tonnes of grain and oil seeds in 2021, according to the Ukrainian government.<br/>Many areas downstream of the reservoir were initially flooded after the dam was destroyed, but the long-term issue facing food production will be the loss of water supply due to extensive canal systems drying up, according to Inbal Becker-Reshef, program director at NASA Harvest, a consortium researching global food security.<br/>\"[The canals] primarily irrigate summer planted crops\u2026 like corn, soy beans, some sunflower. But they also irrigate some wheat, which is a winter crop, and then a lot of vegetables and fruit like melons,\" she said. <br/>While some crops can be fed by rain alone, a dry canal system can leave farmland vulnerable to drought. This also has consequences for drinking water.<br/>Dr Becker-Reshef said canals can start to fill in with silt if left dry, reducing their effectiveness, and the longer they are left in this condition, the worse they will become.<br/>Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator for the UN, previously told the BBC there would be a \"huge impact on global food security\" as a result of the destruction of the dam, describing the area as \"a breadbasket not only for Ukraine but also for the world\".<br/>Ukraine is a major exporter of sunflower, maize, wheat and barley. The war has caused global supply issues, particularly threatened in Middle Eastern and African countries, which rely heavily on Ukrainian grain.<br/>Rebuilding the dam seems to be one of the only long-term solutions to restore water security to the area.<br/>\"Now the water level has dropped, the water simply does not reach the [canal] systems. To raise it, we need to rebuild the dam,\" according to Mykola Solskyi, Ukraine's Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.<br/>Experts warn the area is at greater risk of both drought and flooding, because the dam helped regulate extreme highs and lows in water levels.<br/>\"There's now a whole downstream catchment of the river that is not controlled,\" said Jaap Flikweert, a flood and coastal management advisor at engineering consultancy Royal HaskoningDHV. \"In the wetter periods flood waves will just come through.\"<br/>Unless the dam is repaired, or extensive flood defences put in place, Mr Flikweert said some areas may prove unsuitable for settlement because they lie so close to river level.<br/>\"I expect those tens of thousands of people who were evacuated will have to stay away for a while as long as those solutions are not in place.

We are thinking of his family at this time.<br/>\"He was more than just an outstanding journalist, audiences could sense his kindness, empathy and wonderful humanity.

We loved him here at BBC News, and I loved him as a mentor, colleague and friend.\"<br/>Fellow journalists including LBC's Sangita Myska, the Guardian's Pippa Crerar and Mark Austin of Sky News were among those to also pay tribute.<br/>Austin tweeted: \"This breaks my heart. A good man, a rival on the foreign correspondent beat but above all a friend. If good journalism is about empathy, and it often is, George Alagiah had it in spades.\"<br/>Myska noted Alagiah's influence on British Asian reporters.<br/>\"Growing up, when the BBC's George Alagiah was on TV my dad would shout \"George is on!\". We'd run to watch the man who inspired a generation of British Asian journalists. That scene was replicated across the UK. We thank you, George. RIP xx\"<br/>Former BBC North American editor Jon Sopel wrote: \"Tributes will rightly be paid to a fantastic journalist and brilliant broadcaster - but George was the most decent, principled, kindest, most honourable man I have ever worked with. What a loss.\"<br/>BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner recalled Alagiah visiting him in hospital after he was shot and critically injured in an al-Qaeda attack in Saudia Arabia in 2004.<br/>\"He brought me his book A Passage to Africa, and we talked for hours about the continent he loved and spent so much of his career covering. A true journalist and a great author.\"<br/>Alagiah won awards for reports on the famine and war in Somalia in the early 1990s, and was nominated for a Bafta in 1994 for covering Saddam Hussein's genocidal campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq. <br/>He was also named Amnesty International's journalist of the year in 1994, for reporting on the civil war in Burundi, and was the first BBC journalist to report on the genocide in Rwanda.<br/>George Maxwell Alagiah was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka, before moving to Ghana and then England in childhood.<br/>His main childhood memory of Sri Lanka was leaving it. His parents were Christian Tamils; the country, then called Ceylon, mired in ethnic violence. <br/>His father, Donald, was an engineer specialising in water distribution and irrigation. Feeling unwelcome and unsafe in his own land, he took his young family to Africa in search of a new and better life.<br/>The family initially prospered in Ghana but Alagiah's parents decided to educate their children in England. At the age of 11, his father dropped him off at boarding school in Portsmouth; they both had to hold back the tears. <br/>His childhood of change and assimilation helped shape his personality and informed his professional judgement.   <br/>There was some racism. He was almost the only boy of colour; there were \"Bongo Bongo land\" taunts in the showers. He gave up asking people to say his name correctly (his family pronounced it, \"Uller-hiya\").  <br/>\"In those days,\" he reflected \"you were almost apologetic if you had a 'funny name'.\" The alternative was to stick out like an \"exotic cactus in a bed of spring meadow plants\".<br/>But, in some ways, his school in England - St John's College - was a closed and unreal society, which sealed him off from the huge social changes going on outside its walls. The anti-immigrant sentiment in many parts of the country was something that largely passed him by. <br/>As he grew up, he became, he believed, the \"right sort\" of foreigner in a land where \"class trumps race every time\".<br/>Later, he attended Durham University, where he met, and later married, Frances Robathan.<br/>After graduating, he spent seven years at South Magazine, proud of its editorial line which painted an unequal world as an unstable one. <br/>He joined the BBC as a foreign affairs correspondent in 1989 and then became Africa correspondent, the continent of his childhood.<br/>It was often a depressing experience. He interviewed child soldiers in Liberia, victims of mass rape in Uganda and witnessed hunger and disease almost everywhere.<br/>\"There is a new generation in Africa\", he wrote, \"my generation, freedom's children, born and educated in those years of euphoria after independence, we have had a chance. We didn't do much with it.\"<br/>One of his proudest professional moments came when he broadcast some of the first pictures of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo in 1999, he said.<br/>Other stories he covered in news reports and documentaries included the trade in human organs in India, street children in Brazil, civil war in Afghanistan and human rights violations in Ethiopia.<br/>He interviewed figures including South African President Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.<br/>Moving to news presenting, he fronted the BBC One O'Clock News, Nine O'Clock News and BBC Four News, before being made one of the main presenters of the Six O'Clock News in 2003.<br/>He anchored news programmes from Sri Lanka following the December 2004 tsunami, as well as reporting from New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and from Pakistan following the South Asian earthquake in 2005.<br/>He was appointed an OBE for services to journalism in 2008.<br/>After Alagiah's initial cancer diagnosis in 2014, the disease spread to his liver and lymph nodes, which needed chemotherapy and several operations, including one to remove most of his liver.<br/>He said he was a \"richer person\" for the experience upon returning to presenting in 2015, and said working in the newsroom was \"such an important part of keeping energised and motivated\".<br/>He had to take several further breaks from work to have treatment, and in January 2022 said he thought the cancer would \"probably get me in the end\", but that he still felt \"very lucky\".<br/>Speaking on the Desperately Seeking Wisdom podcast in 2022, he said that when his cancer was first discovered, it took a while for him to understand what he \"needed to do\".<br/>\"I had to stop and say, 'Hang on a minute. If the full stop came now, would my life have been a failure?'<br/>\"And actually, when I look back and I looked at my journey... the family I had, the opportunities my family had, the great good fortune to bump into [Frances Robathan], who's now been my wife and lover for all these years, the kids that we brought up... it didn't feel like a failure.\"<br/>Alagiah had two children with Frances.<br/>Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer, but the NHS advice is to see your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms and they have persisted for more than four weeks.<br/>And if you, or someone you know, have been affected by cancer, information and support is available on the BBC's Action Line page.<br/>Allan Little: Empathy was George\u2019s great strength<br/>Tributes paid to much-loved BBC journalist Alagiah<br/>Watch: Tributes to George Alagiah<br/>George Alagiah takes TV break after cancer spreads<br/>Cancer will probably get me, says George Alagiah<br/>Alagiah takes break from TV for cancer treatment<br/>BBC's Alagiah on living with coronavirus and cancer<br/>Alagiah 'overwhelmed' by viewers' support<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

What a loss.\"<br/>While the corporation's security correspondent Frank Gardner recalled one of his \"fondest memories\" of Alagiah being when his colleague had visited him in hospital back in 2004. \"He brought me his book, A Passage to Africa, and we talked for hours about the continent he loved and spent so much of his career covering.\" <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: A look back at George Alagiah's extraordinary career at the BBC<br/>Away from journalism, Alagiah's debut novel, The Burning Land - a thriller about corruption and killing in South Africa - was nominated in 2020 for a Society of Authors award recognising the best new writers over 60.<br/>Fellow writer Sarfraz Mansoor called him \"the kindest, bravest and most inspiring people I have ever been privileged to know\".<br/>\"Never complained about his fate and always curious about the world. We are all poorer without him.\"<br/>BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera noted how the phrase \"never meet your heroes\" had not applied to him working with Alagiah.<br/>\"He was an inspiration and a role model as a journalist,\" he tweeted. \"And when I was lucky enough to work with him, I found him the most kind and generous colleague.\"<br/>In an interview with BBC Newscast last year, Alagiah was asked if he felt any responsibility to be a role model for other non-white people like him wishing to become journalists.<br/>\"Well, it's a slightly embarrassing episode in my professional role actually,\" he replied. \"Because when I started off in - dare I say it 1989, I think I was the BBC's first kind of fully fledged foreign correspondent and person of colour...\"<br/>\"I just wanted to be a really good journalist, and I didn't want to be the best black or brown journalist,\" he added, about once nearly declining an award.<br/>\"And somebody took me aside and said, 'you idiot, you think it's about you, don't you? These awards are about all the people who look at you and think, you know, if that bloke Alagiah can do that I can certainly do it.'\"<br/>Paying tribute, LBC's Sangita Myska stressed the significance the success of the Sri Lanka-born Alagiah had on other Asian journalists. <br/>\"Growing up, when the BBC's George Alagiah was on TV my dad would shout, 'George is on!'. We'd run to watch the man who inspired a generation of British Asian journalists. That scene was replicated across the UK. We thank you, George. RIP xx.\"<br/>A tearful Naga Munchetty interrupted the sports news on BBC Radio 5 Live on Monday to break the news of the death. \"Apologies for the emotion in my voice,\" she said. \"He was so loved in the newsroom.\"<br/>She added: \"He was someone I looked up to greatly because it wasn't his ego, it was never his ego that reassured me, it was the way he obviously cared about what he was reporting. <br/>\"You almost felt, as a news presenter, he broke down those barriers.\"<br/>Chris Bryant MP highlighted how much Alagiah had done to raise awareness of the symptoms of bowel cancer. <br/>\"Everyone who has had cancer, or being touched by it, will know the sadness that this moment brings,\" he said. \"And the gratitude, for amazing doctors.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>BBC newsreader George Alagiah on living with coronavirus and cancer<br/>Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, added that he never \"shied away from talking about it\", and how \"that will have helped countless other people living with bowel cancer and will probably have prompted people to go and see their doctors maybe with symptoms that they've been worrying about.\"<br/>Sky News presenter Mark Austin wrote: \"A good man, a rival on the foreign correspondent begat but above all a friend.<br/>\"If good journalism is about empathy, and it often is, George Alagiah had it in spades. He understood injustice and the power of good reporting to highlight it, if not correct it...\"<br/>Ex-BBC broadcaster and journalist Sheila Fogarty called Alagiah \"a gentleman and a brilliant reporter\".<br/>Former BBC royal correspondent Jenny Bond, who also worked alongside Alagiah, said he was \"one of the most delightful, talented and charming men I could ever have wished to know.\"<br/>Sophie Raworth: I will miss George terribly<br/>Watch: George Alagiah's extraordinary career.

But for the BBC to apologise, I'm very, very pleased,\" Mr Farage said.<br/>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Farage said he had had to publish a lot of material in order to clear up misinformation in the wake of the 4 July story.<br/>\"I had to go to very great lengths and great personal damage to undo the story,\" Mr Farage said. <br/>\"There is no fault or no blame on the BBC. This now goes right back to the Natwest Banking Group [owners of Coutts].<br/>\"Someone in that group decided it was appropriate, legal and ethical to leak details of my personal financial situation. <br/>\"That, I think, is wrong on every level - and that is where the spotlight should be and it will.\"<br/>Mr Jack, who tweeted his apology, said his story had been \"from a trusted and senior source\".<br/>\"However, the information turned out to be incomplete and inaccurate. Therefore, I would like to apologise to Mr Farage,\" Mr Jack continued.<br/>Mr Farage later said:  \"Jack says, in the tweet, that his information came from a trusted and senior source. I would suggest that it may well have been a very senior source.\"<br/>On 21 July, the BBC updated its original article to say it had \"not been accurate\".  Mr Farage then asked for a formal apology from the BBC.<br/>On Monday, the BBC said on its Corrections and Clarifications website:  \"We acknowledge that the information we reported - that Coutts' decision on Mr Farage's account did not involve considerations about his political views - turned out not to be accurate and have apologised to Mr Farage.\"<br/>When Coutts decided to close Mr Farage's account, he said it did not give him a reason.<br/>Mr Farage subsequently obtained a document looking at his suitability as a Coutts customer.<br/>The 40-page document provided to Mr Farage included minutes from a meeting in November last year reviewing his account.<br/>The document flagged concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\", and also raised concerns about the reputational risk of having Mr Farage as a client.<br/>It said that to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts' \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".<br/>Mr Farage said the BBC had fallen for \"spin\" and he had been \"cancelled\" for his political views.<br/>The boss of NatWest Group, Dame Alison Rose, apologised on Thursday to Mr Farage for what she called the \"deeply inappropriate\" comments made in the document.<br/>She also said that she was commissioning a full review of Coutts' processes on bank account closures.<br/>Mr Farage has called for Dame Alison to be questioned by MPs.<br/>Speaking on GB News on Monday evening, Mr Farage said he had now submitted a subject access request (a request for a copy of information held about you) to NatWest and had raised his case with the Information Commissioner's Office.<br/>He also disclosed the contents of the letter sent to him on Monday by the BBC's Deborah Turness, in which she apologised, saying: \"I can understand why you feel this story has contributed to you being put through a considerable and humiliating amount of publicity.\"<br/>The Treasury has called a meeting with bank bosses over account closures, following the row between Mr Farage and NatWest.<br/>The BBC will hope its apology will draw a line under the story.  <br/>The fallout is an insight into a key tenet of journalism - sourcing stories.

The singer told the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"<br/>On Saturday, the festival's organisers announced that the remaining line-up for the festival had been cancelled.<br/>The decision was made after an \"immediate cancellation directive\" from Malaysia's Ministry of Communications and Digital as part of its \"unwavering stance against any parties that challenge, ridicule or contravene Malaysian laws\", a statement said.<br/>Malaysian drag queen Carmen Rose said Healy's attack on anti-LGBT laws was \"performative\" and \"unruly\". <br/>Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour, Rose said: \"It is giving white saviour complex and he [Matty Healy] wasn't doing it for our community.\"<br/>\"If he was doing it for our community,\" she added, \"he would know what consequences we would have to go through.\"<br/>As state elections in Malaysia loom ahead, Rose said politicians would use the event as a \"scapegoat\".<br/>\"It gives them [conservative politicians] more ammo to further their homophobic agenda to gain votes,\" she added.<br/>Asked about life in Malaysia as part of the LGBT community, Rose said \"the government is not on our side\" and she cannot pursue her profession as a drag artist freely in the country - travelling to Singapore for performances instead.  <br/>Rose said the LGBT community's mental health had been badly affected by constant scrutiny and criticism from the government and society.<br/>\"Matty has a long-time record of advocating for the LGBTQ+ community and the band wanted to stand up for their LGBTQ+ fans and community,\" a source close to The 1975 said Friday night.<br/>Healy has previously used appearances on stage to highlight anti-LGBT laws. <br/>Back in 2019, he invited a male fan on stage during a gig in Dubai. The incident attracted criticism in the country, where homosexuality is punishable by 10 years' imprisonment. <br/>Posting on Twitter after the show, Healy said: \"Thank you Dubai, you were so amazing. I don't think we'll be allowed back due to my 'behaviour' but know that I love you and I wouldn't have done anything differently given the chance again.\"<br/>Festival axed as 1975 singer attacks Malaysian LGBT laws<br/>The 1975 frontman defies Dubai gay laws with kiss<br/>Taiwan legalises same-sex marriage<br/>Strict anti-gay laws begin in Aceh<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

His was a unique voice that made the transition from the era of Jazz into the age of Pop. <br/>\"I will always be grateful for his outstanding contribution to the art of contemporary music. He was a joy to work with. His energy and enthusiasm for the material he was performing was infectious. He was also one of the nicest human beings I've ever known.\"<br/>Director Martin Scorsese added: \"Tony Bennett was a consummate artist. All you have to do is listen to any one of his hundreds of recordings to recognise that. <br/>\"Very early on, his music quietly wove itself into the fabric of our lives. His voice felt as familiar and as close as the voices of our loved ones. I know that this was true for millions of people around the world.\"<br/>Born Anthony Dominick Benedetto, to a family of Italian immigrants, Bennett was just nine years old when his father died, plunging the family further into poverty.<br/>As a teenager he became a singing waiter before enrolling to study music and painting at New York's School of Industrial Art.<br/>He was drafted into the US army in 1944 to fight in France and Germany towards the end of World War Two. \"It's legalised murder,\" he said of the scarring experience in an interview with the Guardian in 2013.<br/>After returning home, his singing career continued - first under the name Joe Bari - and his breakthrough came in 1951 the song Because of You, which gave him first number one.<br/>He changed his name to the Americanised Tony Bennett on the say so of fellow entertainer Bob Hope.<br/>Bennett soon became a teenage icon, releasing his first album in 1952. The same year his wedding was besieged by female fans in mourning.<br/>He went on to chart in the US in every subsequent decade of his life, building a reputation for making timeless swinging jazz-inflected pop hits - like Blue Velvet and Rags to Riches - and, later, show tunes and big band numbers.<br/>His 1962 version of a song from the previous decade, I Left My Heart in San Francisco, sent his star into an even bigger orbit, winning him two Grammys.<br/>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs about his love of the excitement of jazz he said: \"Jazz artists live for the moment.\"<br/>Bennett was a supporter of the civil rights movement and took part in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches while also refusing to perform in apartheid-era South Africa.<br/>However, with the arrival of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones into the US, as the decade rolled on his relevance faded.<br/>Personal problems followed, including the end of two marriages and drug addiction.<br/>He performed through the pain, recording two records with pianist Bill Evans.<br/>After hiring his son Danny to become his manager and reuniting with his pianist and musical director Ralph Sharon, his fortunes began to change.<br/>He enjoyed a revival in the 1980s and 1990s, when Grammy awards flooded in for the star, then in his sixties.<br/>His 1986 comeback album, The Art of Excellence, got the ball rolling again for the star who had returned to New York from Las Vegas. <br/>He followed it with the chart-topping Perfectly Frank, a tribute to his musical hero Sinatra, before 1994's MTV Unplugged saw Bennett win the Grammy for album of the year. <br/>In an interview with the Independent in 2008, Bennett said he had not been surprised by his renewed success.<br/>\"Good music is good music,\" he said. \"I'm not concerned with whether someone who listens to me is old or young. In fact, in many ways, I'm not interested in the young at all.<br/>\"I'm interested in age. People learn to live properly when they get of an age, you know? The late Duke Ellington once said to me that he was really offended by the word category.<br/>\"Music has no category; it's either good or it isn't, and I sing good songs, great songs, written by the best songwriters. It's that kind of quality that makes them last. Trust me, people will be singing these songs forever.\"<br/>Bennett remained perpetually cool enough to win over new legions of fans. <br/>Allow YouTube content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

He also founded the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in his hometown Queens.<br/>He is survived by four children: Danny, Dae, Joanna and Antonia, as well as his wife Susan Crow.<br/>Paying tribute to the singer, musician Nile Rogers said \"My most heartfelt condolences go out to Tony Bennett's family and friends.\"<br/>Singer Ozzy Osbourne said he was \"very sad to hear about Tony Bennett's passing,\" while Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards posted a 2015 photo of himself with the singer and wrote: \"May you Rest in Peace, Tony Bennett.\"<br/>Tony Bennett: 'The best singer in the business'<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Being a friend and colleague of the award-winning foreign correspondent was a privilege - writes Allan Little.<br/>George and I were thrown together when we shared an office in Johannesburg in the Mandela years. So when I think of him I see him not in a television studio in London but on some red dust road, bathed in the light of Africa.   <br/>Empathy was his great strength. He radiated it. It was rooted in the deepest respect for the people whose lives and - often - misfortunes he was reporting on. He could talk to anyone - from heads of state to children in a refugee camp on the edge of a war zone. And everyone wanted to talk to him. You saw him winning their trust, responding to his effortless warmth. He wanted to do well by all of them - to be true and honest and fair.<br/>Once we sheltered in a stairwell, after three mortar bombs landed close to the hotel we were staying in Central Africa. A colleague reported that heavy shelling had, as they put it, rocked the city centre. Later, George said to me quietly \"Allan don't say that. Heavy shelling didn't rock anything tonight. Three bombs fell close to where we happened to be and gave us a fright. Keep it in proportion.\" And I thought, not for the first time, \"My name is George Alagiah and I'm here to calm you down.\" George didn't want to be dramatic. He wanted to be true. <br/>I came to understand that I was learning from him at a time when I was still trying to find my own distinctive broadcasting voice. What did I learn? That good reporting, honest and true, is rooted in respect for others. That the best reporters have almost no ego. That they are never the story, but the means by which the voices of others can be heard. I hoped that the values he embodied and lived would rub off on me.<br/>George wasn't just a good reporter; he was a good man. He was completely without malice. He carried his profound decency very lightly without a hint of sanctimony. He seemed unaware of his own instinct for kindness. When we worked in dangerous and morally troubling places, I looked to him for guidance. I loved his unflappability, his calm authority, his extraordinary wisdom. I thought of him as something like an older brother - someone I quietly looked up to, whose success I could admire and celebrate without envy. I'm not ashamed to say that I felt looked after by him. I thought when I was with George nothing bad could happen to me. <br/>I am aware I am in danger of making him sound a bit saintly - he wasn't. He was great fun. He could be a witty and sometimes hilarious raconteur - with a gift for sometimes merciless mimicry. And like all of us, he enjoyed a bit of intrigue and gossip. <br/>There is a word in the Nguni languages of Southern Africa that was, I think, George's lodestar. He spoke about it at a party to celebrate his 60th birthday in 2015: Ubuntu. It expresses the idea that human beings are bound together in a shared responsibility for each other. <br/>George and I both interviewed Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who'd helped end South Africa's racist system of white-minority rule. He defined Ubuntu like this: \"I am me because you are you. I can never be free while you are enslaved. I can never be rich while you are poor. We two are connected.\" <br/>George had been a migrant twice by the age of 11. Born in Sri Lanka, moved to Ghana and then to a boarding school in England. <br/>Adapting to new cultures and thriving were formative experiences. And it planted in him something that was also key to his talent: he could see how the world looked from the point of view of the Global South - the view from Africa and Asia especially - and convey that perspective to the living rooms of the globally prosperous.<br/>George would never have made such a claim for himself. Off screen he was funny, clever, entertaining, a generous friend and confidant. I told him once that the pan in companion came from the Latin word for bread, that the word carried in it the ingrained human desire to break bread with those we love and care about. He laughed and said, \"How do you know these ridiculous things?\" But I have had some of the richest experiences of companionability and conviviality at George's table, breaking bread. <br/>For George was also full of a kind of energetic hope. There was something infectious about his optimism. You always walked away from time with George liking the human race more, feeling better about the world.<br/>He brought that cheerful disposition to his cancer diagnosis. I rang him when I heard the news. \"It's much worse than the public statement implies, Allan,\" he confided. \"But I have great doctors.\"<br/>Years later, when the cancer had returned and we knew it would never go away, I sat with him in the garden of the London home he shared with Frances, his wife of 40 years. \"I'm not afraid to die,\" he said. \"There's no point in that. The only thing I find unbearably painful is the idea of Frances being left here on her own.\"<br/>Always that in George. Others before self. I saw him one last time shortly before he died. He was very weak. \"Is it wrong to say that there is something positive in all this?\" he said. \"I've had the time to reflect on my life and make sense of it. Time to say to people the things I want them to know. Not everybody is lucky enough to get that\u2026<br/>And the next word he used pierced me - and I still feel the sting of it: \"Not everybody is lucky enough to get that luxury.\" And he added in a moment of self-doubt: \"Is it bad, is it taboo, to say that about cancer?\" <br/>I was guided by him, taught by him, at a key time in my own life. I think I will be guided by him all my days. Becoming his friend, being exposed to his abundant affection, has been one of the greatest privileges of my life.<br/>Ubuntu: I watched George close up while working in Africa. I marvelled at the way he engaged with people, and the way they reciprocated with their trust. <br/>For in George's reporting there was an outstretched hand - the outstretched hand of a shared humanity, of solidarity. <br/>Sophie Raworth: I will miss George terribly<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

But if you speak to people who've worked on both you might be surprised.<br/>No, we're not talking about warp pipes or a battle royale in the Queen Vic. <br/>But we are talking about what it's like to act on a big-budget game.<br/>For most actors, getting a long-running, steady gig can be difficult, but soaps can provide one.<br/>Jennifer English and Devora Wilde tell BBC Newsbeat that working on fantasy role-playing game Baldur's Gate 3 gave them the same sort of stability. <br/>The long-awaited title is set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, and Jennifer plays Shadowheart - a half-elf cleric.<br/>It's not her first time acting in a game, but this is the longest project she's worked on. <br/>That's not too surprising - Baldur's Gate 3 is a huge title, reported to have 17,000 possible variations to its ending, <br/>Jennifer first found out she'd got the role in 2019. Since then, she's spent hours and hours recording lines and full-body motion capture sequences.<br/>\"I didn't realise before starting this is how hard it is, creating this entire universe,\" she says.<br/>\"It's not like an everyday kitchen sink drama, there's a lot going on. And you have to create that in your imagination on your own.\"<br/>Acting for video games presents challenges you wouldn't find on a traditional TV or film set.<br/>For example, actors recording motion capture have to picture their surroundings in their heads before they're added on a computer later on.<br/>And Baldur's Gate 3, with its branching storylines, presented some new and unique elements.<br/>In the game, players can make choices that influence the story, which means the actors need to record multiple versions of a scene with small tweaks to the script each time.<br/>It leads to a lot of work and studio time, which means stable employment.<br/>\"When do you get to play characters for that long unless you're doing a soap?\" says Jennifer.<br/>Jennifer's cast mate Devora Wilde plays githyanki warrior Lae'zel. She's previously appeared in long-running UK soap Hollyoaks. <br/>She says getting into character can quickly become second nature, even when you're playing a mythical creature with green skin and pointy ears.<br/>\"At one point I was in recording every single day,\" she says.<br/>\"By the end, you can just slip into the character. It's become so much a part of you.\"<br/>Jennifer also revealed that parts of the script were altered during recording, with actors and directors workshopping changes as they went along.<br/>\"At the start of recording, Shadowheart was very different,\" she says.<br/>\"We've played and created, and we've made a character that's really nuanced. That comes from conversation and collaboration,\" she says.<br/>That's why Jennifer isn't convinced AI will be coming for her job any time soon - despite concerns about the technology.<br/>\"AI is terrifying for us, but can it get the depths of human emotion that actors bring and the surprising creativity we bring?\"<br/>Speaking of human emotions, love, lust and romance are a key part of Baldur's Gate 3, which allows players to flirt and build relationships with female or male companions.<br/>This included Jennifer and Devora's characters, and it meant acting out some potentially awkward love scenes.<br/>Devora says she was pleased game developer Larian employed specially trained intimacy co-ordinators to make sure actors feel comfortable during romantic scenes.<br/>While common in film production, Baldur's Gate 3 maker Larian believes they're one of the first to use them on a traditional video game, and say they hope others will follow their lead.<br/>Jennifer admits there was some weirdness during recording but the game's story never took things too far.<br/>\"I never felt 'yuck' in a recording session at all. And I've got quite a low 'yuck' threshold,\" she says.<br/>The game's romance angle also throws up another challenge that you probably wouldn't find on the set of Hollyoaks.<br/>You might've seen viral posts about a love scene involving a human character that shapeshifts into a bear.<br/>Larian says a reveal of the scene on TikTok got them temporarily banned from the platform.<br/>But Devora thinks it's hilarious. <br/>\"It just shows you how crazy in the best possible way this game is.\" <br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Warcraft fans trick AI article bot with Glorbo hoax<br/>Has Diablo IV completed its quest for inclusivity?<br/>Metal Gear Solid 3 actors not told about remake<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

They live in their own space. That's what we were trying to do.\"<br/>It was almost as if they needed something to aspire to, says Massaquoi.<br/>\"If you train yourself to run a mile in under five minutes, you notice over the months that you have more energy and you can run further. Whereas, with music and creativity, it's hard to gauge when you've improved.\"<br/>They decided to rely on their instincts. <br/>Allow YouTube content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

If one person made a mistake, the other two would roll with it, folding the chaos into the creative process.<br/>\"We hardly even talk,\" says Massaquoi. \"A lot of it is instinctual.\"<br/>In the end, they recorded over four album's worth of material - a patchwork of group vocals, free-flowing percussion, politically-charged hip-hop and African melodies.<br/>But, betraying their origins as a \"weird kind of boyband\" (their words), they edited that music down to a ruthlessly efficient 32 minutes.<br/>\"As people that love a pop song, we're pretty brutal with ourselves,\" says Hastings, recalling how direct the studio conversations could be: \"Just take that out. Get to the point. This is the best it.\"<br/>\"We like short songs and hooks and sweet things,\" he explains.<br/>The reviews were effusive, even for a band that's used to critical acclaim. <br/>\"Heavy Heavy pulls in the listener with an empathetic lust for life that never wavers,\" wrote AllMusic's Andy Kellman.<br/>\"From the opening woody drag of the bassline on Rice to the chug and claps of Holy Moly, Heavy Heavy bursts with overwhelming momentum, as if to say, 'Keep up, if you can,'\" added Will Pritchard in Pitchfork.<br/>\"Succinct and underpinned by a catchy melodic structure, it further cements Young Fathers' as one of the more unique acts to exist today,\" concluded the NME's Dhruva Balram.<br/>The album is already being tipped for a nomination at this year's Mercury Prize (they previously won with their debut, Dead, in 2014) and it's success has seen them rise to the top of this summer's festival bills.<br/>But even though they're a semi-mainstream prospect in 2023, they've never felt fully embraced by the industry.<br/>The trio met at a high school youth club and were signed at the age of 15 to what they've previously called, \"a nasty, horrible production deal\".<br/>After a series of false starts, they landed on their unique sound over two mixtapes, Tape One and Tape Two, the second of which won them the Scottish Music Prize.<br/>\"When we were young, we were outsiders in Scotland,\" says Hastings. \"We were outsiders at hip-hop nights, we were outsiders at any night.\"<br/>\"None of our friends used to come to the gigs,\" adds Massaquoi. \"Some of them didn't like the music - although I like that. That's honest.\"<br/>Despite, or perhaps because of, those challenges, they maintain an enormous sense of self-belief.<br/>\"We're one of these bands that comes about every 15 or 20 years,\" says Massaquoi, referencing that list of iconoclasts that Hastings drew up in the studio. <br/>\"In the end, people will realise that, but you have to hold onto the vision and say, 'people will get it eventually'.<br/>\"It's frustrating while it's happening but the world doesn't owe you any favours. All you can do is put in the time and the effort and increase your chances of the luck happening.\"<br/>The band hit the headlines with their Glastonbury performance last month, after they dedicated Shame to Home Secretary Suella Braverman, leading the audience in a chant of: \"Say it loud and say it clear, refugees are welcome here\". <br/>As with everything they do, Young Fathers' protest came from experience. Massaquoi came to the UK when he was four years old, as his parent fled the civil war in Liberia.<br/>He doesn't remember much of the transition - but what sticks is hearing Maxi Priest's version of Wild World in a refugee camp in Ghana.<br/>The song's message of hope amidst the sadness of leaving home resonates with him to this day. <br/>He wants Young Fathers' music to have the same impact on their fans - and being outside pop's inner circle makes that easier, they argue.<br/>\"Historically, a lot of bands get worse over time,\" observes Hastings. <br/>\"But when you get a bit more comfortable and things get a bit easier and there's a bit of budget from the record label, you start to realise why the music can take second place to the lifestyle... Not that I'm living a mad lifestyle, but you can see the seeds of it happening.<br/>\"But because we can work on our own - the three of us in a room, no windows, pretty spartan - I hope that makes us a bit foolproof.\"<br/>\"We're a working class band at a time when there's a lack of them, and that's a completely different mind-set to have,\" adds Massaquoi.<br/>\"We come from a place where if we're not doing this, we have to get a job.\"<br/>Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Davis called back five minutes later, and learned Quintin had taken his own life.<br/>But messages from Roland and his other brother, Beric, encouraged Davis to continue the day.<br/>Davis told his guests: \"We've just had some news. My father died. But I don't want you to be alarmed. He was very elderly and it was definitely time.<br/>\"There's actually nothing we can do. So I'm going to propose that we carry on.\"<br/>It was at work the next day when his colleagues asked how his wedding was, Davis said he \"burst into tears\".<br/>Davis said Quintin had emailed his three sons the previous year informing them of his intention to kill himself.<br/>But speaking to Sunday Times journalist Decca Aitkenhead with his family's consent, he said he would never know why his father chose his wedding day to do it.<br/>He said: \"We've all speculated on what the hell was going on in his head... there's no good day, is there? And I know he didn't do it to spoil our day.\"<br/>Several notes were discovered alongside Quintin's body. <br/>He wrote a note for his wife, Davis's mother Hazel, who was in a care home, telling her how much he loved her, and three identical notes for his sons.<br/>Another handwritten note read: \"To all my family, I am so sorry - so, so sorry - to spring this on you. But it is the best outcome. <br/>\"My system is closing down and I am on the verge of a mental breakdown - ie, I am going mad and physically falling apart. I really have no alternative. Thank you all for being such a wonderful family.\"<br/>Quintin separately left a note pointing out he had \"at no time been helped in any way in deciding to take my own life\", and that he \"perform(ed) this action because I wish to maintain my autonomy\".<br/>He left a bag of fresh clothes for his wife, \"so she could be topped up at the care home\", and cash for the gardener's weekly wages.<br/>Davis's father and his mother, originally from South Africa, came to the UK after meeting at university, and had been together for 65 years. <br/>When his mother was admitted to a care home during the Covid-19 pandemic after she started to show signs of dementia, Davis said he noticed his dad had also started to deteriorate. <br/>Quintin was diagnosed with bowel cancer, and his heart was failing. <br/>Davis said his dad had \"felt very bad\" that he could not look after his wife. <br/>He said: \"Having been together for 65 years, suddenly being on his own at home was a big deal...

Who needs fireworks when Jarvis is here? (We get fireworks too, though that comes later).<br/>Pulp come to Latitude towards the end of a summer-long reunion tour, 22 years after their last record, and a decade after they last played live.<br/>\"This is what we do for an encore,\" the video screens announce before they take the stage. But if time has moved on, the songs sound remarkably fresh.<br/>Disco 2000 is essentially a British Abba song, all suburban disappointment and thumping disco beats; Babies is a voyeur's manifesto and Mis-shapes is the soundtrack to the revenge of the outcasts. <br/>Those hits prompt mass sing-alongs - not just from the adults who saw them first time around, but from their kids as well. <br/>Cocker, meanwhile, is just as dry and mischievous as ever. \"Feeling ok? We'll soon see about that,\" he intones ominously as the show begins.<br/>But really, he's in a party mood. The band have been soaking up the festival all day and before long he's laughing at people who've stapled underwear to their flag poles, and throwing chocolates into the crowd. \"My doctor's here tonight so he wouldn't agree with this,\" he observes.<br/>Cocker even tells the story of his girlfriend visiting one of the festival's many stalls and trying on a dragon's tail, \"which I found strangely exciting, actually\".<br/>There's always been a curious innocence to his vice, which amount to things like glimpsing a bra strap (Underwear) or imagining the shape of someone's breasts (F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.) <br/>Even the provocatively-titled This Is Hardcore is really about the seedy parallels between the porn industry and the music business. Guess which one comes off worse?<br/>Revisiting the songs, the band have never sounded better. <br/>Spread across a grand Hollywood musical staircase, and augmented by the Elysian\u00a0Collective sting section, they bring a new cinematic grandeur to Misfits, and a swirling, hypnotic energy to Do You Remember The First Time?<br/>A poignant Something Changed is dedicated to bass guitarist Steve Mackey, who died earlier this year at the age of 56; and Sunrise, which Cocker performs in front of a dazzling, white-hot globe of lightbulbs, is a stirring end to the main set.<br/>That said, some of the more obscure tracks don't go down so well. Like A Friend, a rarity from the soundtrack to 1998's Great Expectations, feels like a particularly odd choice for a festival set, especially when they omit the fan favourite Razzmatazz.<br/>But the band know everyone's waiting for one song in particular.<br/>\"Have we forgotten something?\" asks Cocker, pretending the set has ended. \"Haven't we played David's Last Summer?\"<br/>Then, with a nod and a wink, they rev up an extended, blood-quickening version of Common People.<br/>If anything, the song's scathing tale of poverty tourism has gained even more bite as it approaches 30, and the gap between rich and poor widens even further. <br/>Cocker snarls his way through it, standing astride two monitors, his fist pumping the air as the crowd sing along, before it ends in a flurry of pyrotechnics and confetti.<br/>As with Blur's Wembley Stadium shows a fortnight ago, it's a reminder that Britpop wasn't all about beers and blokes. Some of the acts were simply in a Different Class.<br/>Pulp's set came at the end of the first day of the Latitude Festival, held in the leafy grounds of Suffolk's Henham Park.<br/>Malian band Tinariwen were first on the bill, easing everyone into the festival vibe with a feast of traditional desert blues on the main stage.<br/>Over in The Sunrise Arena, indie newcomers The Last Dinner Party were one of the day's buzziest bands, drawing a huge audience despite only having two singles to their name.<br/>\"Christ there are a lot of you,\" gasped singer Abigail Morris, before justifying everyone's interest with a barrage of catchy, baroque pop anthems.<br/>The six-piece switch from delicate beauty to righteous fury at the flip of a switch, and Morris is an eminently watchable front woman, punctuating every beat with a balletic swirl or a hair-flailing headbang. <br/>They'll graduate to a bigger stage before long.<br/>As the afternoon turned to evening, the main stage was handed over to a trio of left-field pop acts, with Georgia's sun-kissed dance beats followed by Confidence Man's high-camp electro pop; and Metronomy's bouncy keyboard riffs.<br/>The few festivalgoers who decided not to watch Pulp were treated to a raucously rowdy set from Yard Act on the BBC Sounds stage; while folk-pop supergroup Fizz gave fans an early glimpse of their debut album, The Secret To Life, at the Sunrise Arena.<br/>Driven by the combined talents of Orla Gartland, Dodie, Greta Isaac and Martin Luke Brown, their infectiously joyous set left everyone with mile-wide smiles as they went into the night.<br/>The festival continues on Saturday with Paolo Nutini, James and The Lightning Seeds on the main stage, with Young Fathers headlining the BBC Sounds stage.<br/>Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

For many women this happens at home, with little support or pain relief. <br/>Jessica Wharton, 28, an English tutor from Wythenshawe, had two early pregnancy losses last year.<br/>She says the lack of acknowledgement of her losses left her feeling heartbroken. <br/>She said: \"Apart from us as a couple and our friends and family, no-one really acknowledged our loss. <br/>\"When I asked the hospital for something to acknowledge them they said they couldn't do that.<br/>\"We felt the baby was part of us and we had tried for a long time. This was still our child.\"<br/>She said her experiences would have been improved by staff being more empathetic, more available to listen to her and to tell her what to expect.<br/>\"A year later it is still very raw. We are trying to take each day as it comes and hold them in our hearts.\" <br/>While babies born after 24 weeks gestation are official recorded as stillbirths, there is currently no formal way to mark losses before this time.<br/>The government says a voluntary certificate would be made available from October, and while not a legal document, would help \"provide comfort and help parents validate their loss\". <br/>Commitments include:<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Natasha Necati from Essex suffered eight miscarriages<br/>The independent review said early loss was commonly viewed as a \"clinical episode\" with some healthcare professionals not taking individuals' emotional and physical care seriously.<br/>The co-lead of the review, Zoe Clark-Coates, who is also a baby loss charity founder, said that after losing five babies herself she saw that proper support did not exist.<br/>\"I want to see people stopping having to hit Google to find out 'what care should I be receiving, where should I be going for support' - this support should be easily available to every single person,\" she said.<br/>She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that changing the language around baby loss was essential. \"I absolutely will always call miscarriages baby losses\u2026 it's really important to acknowledge that,\" she said.<br/>She added that baby loss affected whole families and was not just a women's issue. \"Nobody is left untouched by the tragedy,\" she said.<br/>Other recommendations in the review include:<br/>Ms Caulfield, minister for women's health, said: \"We will keep working and investing so girls and women across the country can benefit from the world-class healthcare they deserve.\"<br/>She told Sky News that the government wanted to end the \"three miscarriage rule\", under which women are referred for help and advice only after they have lost three babies during pregnancy.<br/>A pilot project in Birmingham will give women testing and advice following the loss of a first, second, or third baby during pregnancy - and the government will evaluate the outcomes of the pilot at the end of the year.<br/>The BBC Action line has more details of organisations offering advice and support.<br/>Additional reporting by Charley Adams.<br/>'We had to put our baby\u2019s remains in the fridge'<br/>Miscarriage: 'I was in pain - they did not listen'<br/>Naga reveals womb disorder makes her scream in pain<br/>Woman who had eight miscarriages felt ignored at times.

This is on top of an award of at least \u00a31,400 for full-time staff the year before, and a 5% pay rise for 2023/24.<br/>One staff nurse, from Liverpool, has started a petition asking the government to ensure all NHS bank staff in England receive the non-consolidated payments.<br/>Bank staff are not employed on the national Agenda for Change contract other nurses and healthcare staff fall under.<br/>The bank allows NHS staff at a trust to work extra shifts - but some health workers work only for the bank, taking whatever shifts are offered, and some of these have found they did not qualify for the one-off payment, even though all their work is for the NHS.<br/>Some bank workers are paid the same rates as staff at the same employer, with some holiday and sick pay.  <br/>But others, in exchange for flexibility over hours, can be paid more per hour though without the same employment protection. <br/>Arrangements vary trust by trust.<br/>Daniel Cartwright works as an NHS 111 call handler in a centre run by Yorkshire Ambulance Service. He is on a bank contract with no holiday or sick pay, but often does 30 hours a week on the same money as staff.<br/>\"I moved to the bank contract as I wanted more flexibility and to suit my personal lifestyle,\" he says.  <br/>\"I did not want to commit to a set rota pattern and can choose my hours. I was shocked to hear I would not get the one off payment - it was not a nice feeling, especially as I was working more hours than some trust staff.\"<br/>After support from his union UNITE, Daniel has now received the payment: \"I am so much happier to have got it.\"<br/>An official said: \"Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust reviewed the contracts of its bank-only staff and determined that they should receive the one-off payment as per contractual obligations.\"<br/>Northumbria Healthcare which runs hospitals in the North East has done the same.<br/>But the trusts that have chosen to have to do this from their own resources.<br/>Other employers have chosen not to and are being pressed by health unions to change their policies.<br/>Unite says the government should extend funding made available for trusts to make the payments to staff, to allow them to include bank workers. <br/>General secretary Sharon Graham said: \"The cynical ploy of saying that NHS bank staff - or any other NHS staff - should get a pay increase on the one hand, but then refuse to fund it on the other, is yet another case of ministers robbing Peter to pay Paul. <br/>\"Telling local trusts that they must find cash out of existing funds means one thing and one thing only - more cuts to a health service already on its knees. <br/>\"More cuts means more overworked and demoralised staff walking away and on it goes.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the union Unison said: \"The union is running multiple campaigns urging trusts to give bank staff the lump sum and do more to persuade bank workers to become NHS employees. Then staff would receive every job benefit enjoyed by their directly-employed colleagues.\"<br/>Health staff at other organisations, deemed \"non-statutory\", for example in nursing homes and GP services, have also missed out on the payments. <br/>The NHS Confederation has called on ministers to intervene, warning there is a danger of a two-tier system being created.<br/>The Agenda for Change pay deal covers most NHS staff, except doctors and dentists, who are on a different contract. <br/>It was reached after a series of strikes by workers over concerns about rising inflation outstripping pay awards.  <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Desperate NHS pays up to \u00a32,500 for nursing shifts<br/>NHS pay deal signed off for one million staff<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

That has been game changing.\"<br/>After trials in the US, Sweden and at an NHS hospital in Oxford, Prof Rupert McShane, of Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, backed the calls for the NHS to use ketamine to treat drug resistant depression, rather than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which he says many patients are \"too frightened\" to have. <br/>He said 30% of depression patients who took ketamine remained well after one year without it, compared to 5% of those on other antidepressants. <br/>\"I think if we were to get a license for intravenous ketamine as an alternative for people who have been considered for ECT, it would without doubt be a game changer,\" he said. <br/>\"Ketamine in low doses works in a different way to conventional antidepressants. <br/>\"And what is really exciting is that there is new data which suggests that it is as good as the best treatment for depression that we've got, which is ECT.\"<br/>A Royal College of Psychiatrists spokesperson said early research indicated that ketamine may be effective in treating some people with severe mental illnesses, who have not responded to other forms of treatment.<br/>\"However, we still need more research on its potential effectiveness in clinical settings and also what safeguards might need to be put in place should it be deemed appropriate for use in this group of patients,\" they said. <br/>If you're affected by the issues in this piece, you can find support from BBC Action Line.<br/>Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

They have called into question the journal's editorial independence.<br/>The 2011 paper is a systematic review conducted by US psychologist, Prof Priscilla Coleman. It concludes that women who've had an abortion have an 81% increased risk of developing mental health problems.<br/>Prof Coleman worked for 20 years as a Professor of Human Development and Family Studies, at Bowling Green State University, in Ohio. Her research appeared in a brief submitted to the US Supreme Court as part of successful efforts to overturn the historic Roe v Wade judgment, which guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion in the US. <br/>In April, the paper was also cited by a judge in Texas, when concluding one of the two main drugs used for medical abortion in the US, Mifepristone, should have its approval suspended. The case is ongoing.  <br/>When Prof Coleman's paper was first published in 2011, 10 letters were sent to the British Journal of Psychiatry criticising the quality of the research. Two called for its retraction.<br/>\"We don't believe that the results are reliable or credible\", said one signatory, Prof Julia Littell, an expert at Bryn Mawr College. She argued it did not meet best practice standards of the time. <br/>\"I've never called for the retraction of a paper before,\" she has since told the BBC. \"This is a very serious lapse of scientific integrity.\" <br/>A review published three months later in December 2011, co-authored by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, also found that methodological problems brought into question the paper's results and conclusions. <br/>In 2022, with the research influencing women's healthcare in the US, some of the same scientists wrote again to request the work be retracted. <br/>The British Journal of Psychiatry then formed an independent panel, which spent four months assessing the complaints. The panel questioned the methodology used in the research - one concern was the data had been combined in a way that saw women counted multiple times.<br/>Ultimately the panel recommended the paper should be retracted. However, that never happened.<br/>\"Our recommendation basically disappears into the ether,\" panel member and Harvard psychiatrist, Dr Alex Tsai, told the BBC. <br/>\"At some point we receive a letter from the communications director at the Royal College of Psychiatrists saying that the case is closed and the retraction is not going to be implemented.\"<br/>Fellow panel member Dr Aileen O'Brien said intervention by the Royal College was \"concerning\". \"Usually you would have expected that to be an editorial decision,\" she said.<br/>Some panel members have expressed concern that legal threats may have influenced the College's actions. <br/>When the British Journal of Psychiatry told Prof Coleman they wanted to put a notice on her article to raise awareness about a possible problem, her lawyers responded that any such notice would cause \"serious harm and direct damage to her reputation\". <br/>The letter, seen as part of an investigation by Newsnight and the BMJ, said Prof Coleman would take \"any and all legal options available\".<br/>A second legal letter, sent a month later, repeated the threat, if the journal was to retract the paper. Ultimately no notice of concern was placed on the work. <br/>Prof Coleman has started legal action against another journal, Frontiers in Psychology, after it retracted one of her earlier papers. So far those actions have been rejected by a Swiss court. <br/>Dr Tsai said the row risked undermining confidence in the journal's ability to \"police the content that it publishes\", adding: \"[A] journal that does not uphold editorial independence is probably not long for this world.\" <br/>Newsnight approached Prof Coleman for comment. In reply, she supplied details of her career qualifications, as well as material that she said supported her research.<br/>Prof Coleman said she had published 63 peer-reviewed journal articles, with the majority related to the psychology of abortion. Based on this, she often serves as an expert in civil cases involving abortion.  <br/>She said her career had spanned three decades with publications in highly reputable academic journals and that criticism of her work was driven by the political nature of the topic.<br/>A spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists did not address questions about whether the threat of legal action had influenced its decision. <br/>They said: \"After careful consideration, given the distance in time since the original article was published, the widely available public debate on the paper - including the letters of complaint already available alongside the article online, and the fact that the article has already been subject to a full investigation - it has been decided to reject the request for the article to be retracted.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Four ways the end of Roe v Wade has changed America<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He and his family spoke exclusively with the BBC. <br/>Mike gets an infusion each month at a clinic in London and says he is \"one of the luckiest people you'll ever meet\".<br/>Mike and his family noticed he was having problems with memory and decision-making, not long before he started on the trial.  <br/>His son, Mark, said it was very hard to watch at the beginning: \"Seeing him struggle with processing information and solving problems was very hard. But I think the decline is reaching a plateau now.\"<br/>Mike, who is from Kent, said: \"I feel more confident every day.\"<br/>Donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, works in the same way as lecanemab - developed by companies Eisai and Biogen - which created headlines around the world when it was proven to slow the disease.<br/>Although extremely promising, these drugs are not risk-free treatments. <br/>Brain swelling was a common side-effect in up to a third of patients in the donanemab trial. For most, this resolved without causing symptoms. However, two volunteers, and possibly a third, died as a result of dangerous swelling in the brain.<br/>Another antibody Alzheimer's drug, called aducanumab, was recently rejected by European regulators over safety concerns and a lack of evidence that it was effective enough for patients. <br/>In the donanemab trial, researchers examined 1,736 people aged 60 to 85 with early-stage Alzheimer's.<br/>Half of them received a monthly infusion of the treatment and the other half were given a dummy drug, also known as a placebo, over 18 months.<br/>The findings show:<br/>Amyloid is just one part of the complex picture of Alzheimer's, and it is unclear if the treatment will continue to make more difference over a longer period, experts caution. <br/>The drug's effects may be modest, but the results provide further confirmation that removing amyloid from the brain may change the course of Alzheimer's, and help people affected by this devastating disease if they're treated at the right time, they say. <br/>Prof Giles Hardingham from the UK Dementia Research Institute said: \"It is terrific to see these results published in full today. <br/>\"We have waited a long time for Alzheimer's treatments, so it's really encouraging to see tangible progress continuing to gather pace in the field.\" <br/>Dr Susan Kohlhaas, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Today's announcement marks another milestone. <br/>\"Thanks to decades of research, the outlook for dementia and its impact on people and society is finally changing, and we're entering a new era where Alzheimer's disease could become treatable.\"<br/>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, former Prime Minister David Cameron said resources should be put towards further research into what he called a \"statin for the brain\". <br/>\"We want a pill that people who have the build-up of these proteins in the brain can take every day or every week in order to clear those proteins out of the brain and therefore reduce your chances of getting a disease that causes dementia,\" he said.<br/>Asked if the government were prepared to invest where needed to roll out new treatments, Mr Cameron said there was a real incentive to do so: \"We're a country of sixty million people, with a million people with dementia, many of them in very expensive residential care settings and so there is a lot of savings to be had from effectively treating people\u2026.I'm hopeful that our system can deliver.\"<br/>Lecanemab costs around $27,500 (\u00a321,000) in the US, where it is licensed. <br/>It is not clear how much donanemab may cost and how long it might take to get approval in the UK, but Alzheimer's experts said having two drugs would help promote competition on price. <br/>The UK's drug's watchdog NICE says it has already started work on its appraisal of donanemab for treating mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease.<br/>\"Our aim is to produce recommendations on its use in the NHS as close as possible to it receiving its UK licence,\" said a spokesperson.<br/>Mike Colley turned 80 in April. At his birthday party, he surprised his family by singing My Way in front of 40 guests. <br/>He told BBC News: \"That's the confidence I have now. I'd never have done that even 12 months ago.\"   <br/>His son Mark added: \"I never thought I would see my dad so full of life again. It was an incredible moment.\"<br/>Dr Emer MacSweeney, consultant neuroradiologist and medical director at Re:Cognition Health, led the trials of donanemab in the UK.<br/>She said: \"This is really significant and one of the biggest breakthroughs.\"<br/>The Alzheimer's Society said: \"This is truly a turning point in the fight against Alzheimer's and science is proving that it is possible to slow down the disease.\" <br/>Around 720,000 people in the UK might potentially benefit from these emerging new Alzheimer's disease treatments if they're approved for use, but the Alzheimer's Society said the NHS is \"simply not ready to deliver them\". <br/>Kate Lee, CEO for the charity, said: \"Timely, accurate diagnosis is key, and currently only 2% of people in England and Wales receive their diagnosis through the specialist investigations needed to be eligible for these treatments.<br/>\"Alongside this, these emerging Alzheimer's disease drugs require regular infusions and monitoring, and the NHS is not yet equipped to do this at scale.\"<br/>I've got dementia - dementia hasn't got me<br/>Fiona Phillips: How common is early Alzheimer's?<br/>JAMA<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

This decision largely centres on three studies suggesting a connection to a type of liver cancer. <br/>However, the \"possibly\" refers only to the strength of scientific evidence. If the evidence was strong, then aspartame would be in a higher category.<br/>Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said the \"evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough\" and \"this is really more a call to the research community\" to study the sweetener more. <br/>The cancer classifications frequently lead to misleading headlines. Alcohol and plutonium are in the same category (both are proven to cause cancer), but one is seriously more dangerous than the other. <br/>So a separate body - the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives - has the job of working out safe doses.<br/>It analysed the cancer risk as well as other issues such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but found \"no sufficient reason\" to alter the advice it has had since 1981.<br/>So the safe limits remain at 40 milligrams per kilogram of your body weight, per day. <br/>These aren't targets, they're the upper safety limits. But as the advice is based on body weight, it is easier for children to get close to the limit.<br/>Dr Branca said it was \"not a good practice\" to have a bottle of sweet fizzy drink on the table at family dinner time, as children risked being set up with a sweet tooth for life. <br/>He also stressed that large reviews of the evidence show sweeteners do not help people lose weight.<br/>So his advice is for everyone to shift to a less sweet diet - cutting both sugar and sweeteners - and for companies to produce foods that are less sweet, but still tasty.<br/>One of the big outstanding research questions is how might aspartame result in cancer (if indeed it does). The WHO reports show that aspartame itself is rapidly broken down in the gut into three other substances - phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol.<br/>But these are also the product of digesting a wide variety of other foods that are not linked with cancer. And the researchers concluded that aspartame is not directly making cancerous mutations in people's DNA. Raising levels of inflammation in the body is one possibility. <br/>Frances Hunt-Wood, secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association, said the work had \"once again reaffirmed aspartame's safety\".<br/>She added: \"Aspartame, like all low/no calorie sweeteners, when used as part of a balanced diet, provides consumers with choice to reduce sugar intake, a critical public health objective.\"<br/>There are some people who cannot safely consume aspartame. These are people with an inherited disease called phenylketonuria or PKU, who are born unable to metabolise the phenylalanine that is released as aspartame is broken down. <br/>Follow Jameson Twitter.<br/>Aspartame - is it a possible cause of cancer?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Ambulance workers, nurses, physiotherapists and porters will also get a one-off sum of at least \u00a31,655. <br/>The prime minister ruled out funding the increases through extra borrowing or increasing taxes. <br/>Mr Sunak said pay awards in the education department would be fully funded, but did not set out how this would be achieved.<br/>Schools minister Nick Gibb promised there would be no cuts in \"front-line services\" in schools or colleges.  <br/>Rising prices have prompted industrial action across much of the public sector, with workers calling for pay rises matching or exceeding the rate of inflation which currently stands at 8.7%. <br/>But with the education unions welcoming the government's offer, parents and pupils could see an end to strikes which have impacted schools across England over the past year. <br/>On Thursday, junior doctors in England began a five day walkout, after their calls for a 35% pay increase were rejected.<br/>The government has been resistant to offering above-inflation pay rises warning it would further fuel inflation. <br/>Responding to Mr Sunak's announcement, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"By accepting the pay review body recommendations and then not funding them the government is putting its departments between a rock and hard place - they now have to choose between paying workers a half-decent salary or cutting services in already underfunded public services.\"<br/>TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said union members would take \"comfort\" from the fact that the prime minister had accepted the pay review bodies' recommendations. <br/>\"The question will be - is he able to deliver pay rises in a way that won't have a negative impact on services. Our members will have a long look at that - they won't want to see Peter robbed to pay Paul.<br/>Mr Sunak said his offer was \"final\" and further industrial action would not change that decision, stressing: \"There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year's settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.\"<br/>Speaking at the Unite union's policy conference in Brighton, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the pay offers would be \"subject to negotiation\" and he would \"not wade into that\".<br/>He said there was no \"magic wand that could wave away the need for economic stability\", but added: \"If Labour can not break the suffocating hold of low wages we will have failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Visa application fees and the immigration health surcharge are going up \"significantly\" to raise money, Rishi Sunak says.<br/>Almost half of public sector workers are covered by pay review bodies, including police and prison officers, the armed forces, doctors, dentists and teachers.<br/>The pay review bodies are made up of economists and experts in human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector, and are appointed by the relevant government department.<br/>Their recommendations are not legally binding, meaning the government can choose to reject or partially ignore the advice, but it is usually accepted.<br/>What do you think about the Prime Minister's announcement on public sector pay?

Wegovy is not yet available in the UK - but the prime minister has said GPs in England may soon start offering it to some patients, as well as specialist weight-management clinics.<br/>Ozempic is for people with diabetes to help control blood sugar as well as weight but contains a lower dose of the same medicine, semaglutide, as Wegovy.

whose daughter Harriet was stillborn at the trust in 2016 - said the commitment to transparency was \"massive\".<br/>\"It's a bit of a shock to the system to be honest,\" Ms Hawkins said.<br/>\"For seven and a half years we have just been fighting to be heard.<br/>\"So for them to say they are going to take an open and honest approach is incredible really.<br/>\"Whether that happens is yet to be seen but it is certainly a step in the right direction.\"<br/>In a statement, the group representing parents said: \"We welcome today's pledge from the trust for a 'new honest and transparent relationship' with a sense of relief and optimism. <br/>\"For too long we have been fighting to be not just heard, but for action to be taken, and for there to be accountability. <br/>\"We deserve to learn who knew what and when, why it was allowed to continue; and how the trust avoided scrutiny for so long.\"<br/>Ms Ockenden's previous review in Shrewsbury and Telford, which also used the \"opt-out\" approach, included more than 95% of affected families. <br/>The Nottingham trust wrote to 1,377 families at the end of November and the end of January.<br/>The letters went to families who had experienced stillbirth, neonatal deaths, brain damage to the baby, harm to mothers or relatives of mothers who died.<br/>But only 360 families responded to these letters.<br/>In total, 28% of white women contacted responded, while for black and Asian women, the figures were 10% and 5% respectively.<br/>In Nottingham, only about 25% of families known to be affected have been included in the review.<br/>Ms Ockenden said: \"As it stands, with our 674 families who have joined the review, I can't say as the chair we have anywhere near a representative sample of the rich diversity that we know exists in Nottingham.<br/>\"There is significantly more work to do.\"<br/>Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

so many consequences followed from that,\" he said.<br/>Typically, health authorities do not try to contain seasonal flu - instead relying on antiviral drugs and the flu jab, which could be adjusted to tackle a new pandemic form of the virus.<br/>Other witnesses, including Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), appeared to contradict Mr Cameron, describing the government's flu plan as \"actually pretty good\". <br/>Matt Hancock, former health secretary, meanwhile, said the bigger, more damaging mistake was the widespread assumption that Covid could not be stopped or contained when it started to spread. <br/>He said authorities were too narrowly focused on planning for the fallout, such as \"can we buy enough body bags?\".<br/>\"That was completely wrong,\" he added.<br/>Other countries managed more effectively to suppress the initial wave of Covid than the UK, reducing the number of deaths and - in some cases - avoiding strict lockdowns. <br/>Witnesses, including former health secretary and current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, told the inquiry that the UK did not learn lessons from Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, which had seen earlier outbreaks of two other coronaviruses - Sars and Mers. <br/>In those countries, faster contact-tracing and quarantine policies were subsequently deployed to promptly isolate cases and clamp down when Covid first emerged.<br/>In the UK, the civil service had previously run a mock-up training day - codenamed Exercise Alice - in 2016, in preparation for a major outbreak of the Mers virus.<br/>But the inquiry heard many of its recommendations, including advice to scale up testing capacity and examine different options for isolation, were not followed through. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Prof Dame Sally Davies tells the Covid inquiry \"it wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died\".<br/>Another major theme was the strength - or resilience - of the healthcare system when Covid emerged in 2020. <br/>England's former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, was heavily critical of the state of the NHS at the time of the outbreak, saying it had been \"divested\" - with fewer doctors, nurses, beds and ventilators than similar countries.<br/>Academics Sir Michael Marmot and Clare Bambra produced a report stating that poorer regions and ethnic minority groups were disproportionally affected by a decade of austerity policies, with the UK entering the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services and rising inequality.<br/>Giving his evidence, George Osborne, who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016, said he \"completely rejected\" that description. <br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path, then Britain might have experienced a financial crisis [and] would not have had the fiscal space to deal with coronavirus when it hit,\" he argued.<br/>From 2018, government departments were being asked to step up planning for a so-called 'no-deal Brexit', under the codename Operation Yellowhammer. <br/>According to documents seen by the inquiry, a number of internal 'workstreams' in the Department of Health related to pandemic planning were therefore paused, or slowed, as staff were moved and other tasks prioritised.<br/>That paused work included plans to better prepare the adult social care sector for a severe influenza pandemic.<br/>The Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, a cross-government body made up of civil servants from across Whitehall, did not meet for a whole year up to November 2019 because their work was \"reprioritised\" to plan for leaving the EU without a trade deal. <br/>Scotland's former first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told the inquiry that the Scottish government was \"not at all happy\" about having to divert \"time, energy and resources\" in this way. <br/>But Conservative cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Oliver Dowden, both said that no-deal planning had increased staffing, compelled departments to work more closely together and secured supply chains for medical supplies. <br/>Additionally, Matt Hancock claimed that work on a no-deal exit was instrumental in preventing the UK running out of some intensive care drugs at the peak of the first wave of Covid.<br/>The inquiry also heard moving evidence from the families of some of those who lost their lives to Covid.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their sense of loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees's father, Ian, contracted the virus while being treated in hospital in Abergavenny for a gall bladder infection.<br/>Jane Morrison spoke about the loss of her wife, Jacky, who died in hospital in Dundee after being admitted for another unrelated condition - jaundice.<br/>Groups representing bereaved family members said poor infection control was a \"glaring flaw\" in hospital planning. <br/>They also described the handling of funerals - and how they were conducted during the pandemic - as traumatic, with relatives often unable to say a proper goodbye to loved ones. <br/>Witnesses described national lockdowns as the most \"extraordinary\" policy of the pandemic. <br/>The political decisions which led to nationwide lockdowns will be explored in detail during the inquiry's second phase in October. <br/>Already though, we know a strict lockdown - with widespread school and business closures - was never planned for in advance.<br/>Matt Hancock said there was \"no prep for how to do one, no work on how best to lock down with the least damage\". <br/>England's chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, suggested it would have been near impossible for scientific advisers to plan in advance for something so radical without being asked to by a senior politician.<br/>The inquiry team will try to answer why - given it is the government's job to consider these things - the longer term impacts of lockdown were not properly thought through before 2020.<br/>You can follow Jim on twitter and threads.<br/>Covid Inquiry: Were We Prepared<br/>Watch on iPlayer: Jim Reed looks at the key moments from the first part of the Covid inquiry.<br/>Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)<br/>Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Personally, everyone gave their all but the system was not fit for purpose, was it?\"<br/>Mr Hancock replied: \"That's absolutely right.\"<br/>The former health secretary added: \"I bear responsibility for all the things that happened, not only in my department, but also the agencies that reported to me as secretary of state.\"<br/>The inquiry also heard from the former health secretary that medicines for intensive care were \"within hours\" of running out at the peak of the pandemic. <br/>He added that the only reason they did not was because of work done in 2019 in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.<br/>Mr Hancock said he had to overrule initial advice not to quarantine people being brought back from Wuhan early in the pandemic, and that everybody in the Western world missed that lockdowns would be necessary.<br/>He also criticised the World Health Organization (WHO) for giving advice which \"stated that we should not have lockdowns\".<br/>He said it was \"madness\" but he had to \"overrule\" initial advice not to quarantine people coming in from China. <br/>He also blamed the WHO for having \"written into the international health regulations that you shouldn't close borders\".<br/>Because there was \"no such thing\" as mass contact tracing systems as the pandemic took hold, Mr Hancock said the inability to test people in large numbers was \"terrible\".<br/>He also used the word terrible to describe the government having no idea whether care homes had the right protections in place. <br/>He said the government didn't even know how many care home residents there were at the start of the pandemic.<br/>However, he said the responsibility for ensuring the social care sector was prepared for a pandemic fell to local authorities, and he \"didn't have the levers to act\". <br/>The former health secretary was also repeatedly asked about the recommendations from Exercise Cygnus, a three-day test run in October 2016 to find out how prepared the UK was for a influenza pandemic. <br/>It concluded that the UK's plan was not sufficient to \"cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic\".<br/>The inquiry has seen evidence that only eight of the 22 recommendations made after that exercise had been fully addressed by the time Covid hit, with work on the other 14, including preparing the social care sector, still ongoing. <br/>He described Exercise Cygnus as \"flawed in its central assumption\" that a pandemic was a disaster that needed to be \"cleaned up\" rather than something that needed to be stopped or contained in the first place. <br/>He said: \"The doctrinal flaw was the biggest by a long way because if we'd had a flu pandemic, we still would have had the problem of no plan in place for lockdown, no prep for how to do one, no work on what, how best to lock down with the least damage.<br/>\"I understand deeply the consequences of lockdown and the negative consequences for many, many people - many of which persist to this day.\"<br/>Mr Hancock said that some of that work on the Exercise Cygnus had been paused because of the need to prepare the country for a no-deal Brexit. <br/>But he said that he was \"not convinced\" that, even if all those recommendations had been addressed, the country would have been in a better place to deal with Covid. <br/>As a result, the UK was \"better prepared in terms of supply chains,\" but the \"overall impact\" was hard to judge.<br/>\"I'm afraid it's impossible to know,\" he added. <br/>When Mr Hancock first arrived at the inquiry, a widow showed him images of her husband, who died from Covid.<br/>Lorelei King, 69, was holding two A4 posters, which she showed to the former health secretary as he stepped out of a black Jaguar.<br/>One poster displayed an image of Mr Hancock with Mrs King's husband, Vincent Marzello, who died in a care home in March 2020, aged 72.<br/>\"You shook my husband's hand for your photo op,\" the photo was captioned. The other picture showed Mr Marzello's coffin.<br/>Mr Hancock didn't respond as he walked in to the building.<br/>Mrs King told journalists: \"Care homes became charnel houses because there was no testing, there was insufficient PPE, but, most disastrously, it's because they discharged people from hospitals without testing them.\"<br/>She called on Mr Hancock to \"tell the truth\" to the inquiry, adding: \"The bereaved families deserve that much.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-medical officer close to tears over Covid deaths<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

and asked for the protocol to be changed.<br/>He added that he didn't feel comfortable that someone \"a long way from front line\" could make such a decision, which would be better made by people closer to the situation on the ground, he added. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

He is due to give evidence on Thursday along with Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic.  <br/>At the same hearing, George Osborne said his spending cuts meant the UK was better able to cope with the pandemic. <br/>The former chancellor argued that without austerity Britain would have been \"more exposed\" and rejected claims his approach left the health and social care \"depleted\" ahead of the Covid pandemic. <br/>Last week Sir Michael Marmot, a professor of epidemiology at University College London told the inquiry that the UK had entered the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services. <br/>Asked by inquiry lawyer Kate Blackwell KC if he agreed with the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"Most certainly not, I completely reject that.\"<br/>He accepted more money could have been spent on the NHS, but said as chancellor he had to balance demands for resources from other public services.<br/>\"You can't just say we like public spending to be higher without explaining where you get money from,\" he told the inquiry.<br/>He said the public had elected the Conservatives to government in 2010 and 2015 knowing the party was planning to cut public spending. <br/>During the period, cuts were introduced in welfare spending, school building programs, local government, police, courts and prisons. There was also an overall squeeze on health spending. <br/>Mr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.<br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\" <br/>The British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\". <br/>On Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid. <br/>During the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown. <br/>He said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".<br/>\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.<br/>\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans. <br/>\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"<br/>Earlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics. <br/>He also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.<br/>Labour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-PM Cameron admits mistake over pandemic planning<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Covid inquiry criticises government evidence<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

both epidemiologists - said a coronavirus had already jumped to humans on a significant scale twice in the 21st Century, in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).<br/>And it had been \"a reasonable bet\", before 2020, another one might follow, infectious-diseases expert and former professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth said.<br/>By mid-January 2020, people in the international public-health community had been aware the Covid-19 outbreak had been \"out of the ordinary\", he said.<br/>\"It wasn't going to die away - it was something bigger than that,\" Mr Whitworth said.<br/>And by end of January, people in public health had been very clear it had been \"an impending wave that was coming to UK\".<br/>\"For those of us who had memories of Sars, the parallels were something that gave us shivers\", Mr Whitworth added.<br/>Asked about the dangers of a virus being leaked, deliberately or accidentally, from a laboratory, Cambridge University fellow in emerging infectious diseases Dr Charlotte Hammer said she was aware of four incidents involving the Sars virus. <br/>But when it came to controlling an outbreak once it had started to infect thousands of people, the virus's origins mattered \"very little\".<br/>What is the UK Covid-19 inquiry?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss, in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe, in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered -

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me.

I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said. <br/>He added that the decision had been considered carefully for some time and made on the basis of careful analysis of data.<br/>But he warned the removal of the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. <br/>\"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.<br/>The World Health Organization first declared Covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in January 2020. <br/>This signalled the need for coordinated global action to protect people from the new virus. <br/>It will now be up to individual countries to continue to manage Covid in the way they think best.<br/>Vaccines were one of the major turning points in the pandemic.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Israel passes reform law despite mass protests<br/>Heatwave to spread east across huge parts of US<br/>Rhodes wildfires are 'like a biblical catastrophe'<br/>Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal<br/>Indian princess who fought for women to vote in UK<br/>'I gave birth and kept walking to escape Sudan terror'<br/>The nuclear waste 'graveyard' that will last 100,000 years.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>\n                        Percent of people fully vaccinated\n                    <br/>\n                            Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive\n                        <br/>\n                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.<br/>The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.
