It has also tightened control over people's lives, our interviewees say.  <br/>Pyongyang told the BBC it has always prioritised its citizens' interests. <br/>The BBC has secretly interviewed three ordinary people in North Korea, with the help of the organisation Daily NK which operates a network of sources in the country. They told us that since the border closure, they are afraid they will either starve to death or be executed for flouting the rules. It is extremely rare to hear from people living in North Korea. <br/>The interviews reveal a \"devastating tragedy is unfolding\" in the country, said Sokeel Park from Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), which supports North Korean escapees. <br/>One woman living in the capital Pyongyang told us she knew a family of three who had starved to death at home. \"We knocked on their door to give them water, but nobody answered,\" Ji Yeon said. When the authorities went inside, they found them dead, she said. Ji Yeon's name has been changed to protect her, along with those of the others we interviewed. <br/>A construction worker who lives near the Chinese border, whom we have called Chan Ho, told us food supplies were so low that five people in his village had already died from starvation. <br/>\"At first, I was afraid of dying from Covid, but then I began to worry about starving to death,\" he said. <br/>North Korea has never been able to produce enough food for its 26 million people. When it shut its border in January 2020, authorities stopped importing grain from China, as well as the fertilisers and machinery needed to grow food. <br/>Meanwhile, they have fortified the border with fences, while reportedly ordering guards to shoot anyone trying to cross. This has made it nearly impossible for people to smuggle in food to sell at the unofficial markets, where most North Koreans shop. <br/>A market trader from the north of the country, whom we have named Myong Suk, told us that almost three quarters of the products in her local market used to come from China, but that it was \"empty now\".  <br/>She, like others who make their living selling goods smuggled across the border, has seen most of her income disappear. She told us her family has never had so little to eat, and that recently people had been knocking on her door asking for food because they were so hungry. <br/>From Pyongyang, Ji Yeon told us she had heard of people who had killed themselves at home or disappeared into the mountains to die, because they could no longer make a living. <br/>She was struggling to feed her children, she said. Once, she went two days without eating and thought she was going to die in her sleep. <br/>In the late 1990s, North Korea experienced a devastating famine which killed as many as three million people. Recent rumours of starvation, which these interviews corroborate, have prompted fears the country could be on the brink of another catastrophe.  <br/>\"That normal, middle-class people are seeing starvation in their neighbourhoods, is very concerning,\" said the North Korea economist Peter Ward. \"We are not talking about full-scale societal collapse and mass starvation yet, but this does not look good.\" <br/>Hanna Song, the director of NKDB, which documents human rights violations in North Korea, agreed. \"For the past 10-15 years we have rarely heard of cases of starvation. This takes us back to the most difficult time in North Korean history.\" <br/>Even the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has hinted at the seriousness of the situation - at one point referring openly to a \"food crisis\", while making various attempts to boost agricultural production. Despite this, he has prioritised funding his nuclear weapons programme, testing a record 63 ballistic missiles in 2022. One estimate puts the total cost of these tests at more than $500m (\u00a3398m) - more than the amount needed to make up for North Korea's annual grain shortfall.<br/>Our interviewees also revealed how the government has used the past three years to increase its control over people's lives, by strengthening punishments and passing new laws.  <br/>Before the pandemic, more than 1,000 people would flee the country each year, crossing the Yalu River into China, according to numbers released by the South Korean government. The market trader Myong Suk told us it had become impossible to escape. \"If you even approach the river now you will be given a harsh punishment, so almost nobody is crossing,\" she said. <br/>The construction worker Chan Ho said his friend's son had recently witnessed several closed-door executions. In each one, three to four people had been killed for attempting to escape. \"Every day it gets harder to live,\" he told us. \"One wrong move and you are facing execution.\" <br/>\"We are stuck here waiting to die.\" <br/>North Korea: The Insiders<br/>For more than three years, North Korea has sealed its borders. People are banned from leaving or entering the country. Almost every foreigner who was inside has packed up and left. The world's most secretive and tyrannical state is now an information black hole. For months, three people inside North Korea have risked their lives to tell the BBC what is happening. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or at 19:00 BST on BBC Two in the UK<br/>We put our findings to the North Korean government, which told us it \"has always prioritised the interests of the people, even at difficult times\". <br/>\"The people's well-being is our foremost priority, even in the face of trials and challenges,\" said a representative from the North Korean embassy in London.  <br/>They also said the information was \"not entirely factual\", claiming it had been \"derived from fabricated testimonies from anti-DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] forces\".   <br/>But Sokeel Park, from LiNK, said these interviews reveal a \"triple whammy\" of hardship. \"The food situation has become more difficult, people have less freedom to fend for themselves, and it has become pretty much impossible to escape.\" They support the theory, he said, that \"North Korea is now more repressive than it has ever been before.\" <br/>In Pyongyang, Ji Yeon said the surveillance and crackdowns were now so ruthless that people did not trust each other. She was taken in for questioning under a new law, passed in December 2020, which bans people from sharing and consuming foreign films, TV shows and songs. Under this Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act, aimed at rooting out foreign information, those caught distributing South Korean content can be executed. <br/>A former North Korean diplomat, who defected in 2019, said he was shocked by how extreme the crackdown on foreign influence had become. \"Kim Jong Un is afraid that if people understand the situation they are in, and how wealthy South Korea is, they will start hating him and rise up,\" explained Ryu Hyun Woo. <br/>Our interviews suggest that some people's loyalty has waned over the past three years. <br/>\"Before Covid, people viewed Kim Jong Un positively,\" Myong Suk said. \"Now almost everyone is full of discontent.\" <br/>More findings from the BBC's investigation into daily life in North Korea will be published on Thursday 15 June"}, {"_id": "6489ffb351ac3319f5477d94", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-65906687?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "England", "subCategories": "Regions,Nottingham", "title": "Nottingham attacks: CCTV shows suspect outside homeless hostel", "lead": "Footage appears to show the suspect shortly before he allegedly killed a third person.", "author": "By Greig Watson", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:11.800270", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14BFC/production/_130088948_ec3cf6c9-a8fa-48a4-81b9-d78fddb82869.jpg", "body": "CCTV footage has emerged that shows a man said to be the suspect in the fatal Nottingham attacks.<br/>Students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and school caretaker Ian Coates, were stabbed to death in the city in the early hours of Tuesday. <br/>Three others were injured when a stolen van was driven into pedestrians.<br/>Inquiries revealed a man matching the suspect's description tried to get into a homeless hostel - an incident not reported to police at the time. <br/>University of Nottingham students Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, were attacked with a knife in Ilkeston Road, with police receiving a call at 04:04 BST.<br/>In an update on the sequence of events, Nottinghamshire Police said investigations had found a man matching the suspect's description had attempted to gain entry to a supporting living complex in Mapperley Road, but had been denied entry.<br/>CCTV footage seen by the BBC shows a figure in a black hoodie being pushed away from a window and then confronted, before walking off.<br/>The force believes the suspect then attacked 65-year-old Mr Coates - who was found dead from knife injuries in Magdala Road - and stole his van, which was then used to hit pedestrians in Milton Street, leaving one critically injured. <br/>A 31-year-old man was Tasered by officers before being arrested on suspicion of murder.<br/>East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EMAS) has given more details of its involvement in the emergency.<br/>A spokesman said it received an initial call to Ilkeston Road at 04:05, then a second call at 05:25 to Milton Street.<br/>It did not get a call to Magdala Road until 05:39, where CPR was being performed on a victim by police.<br/>Police have now formally identified the three victims.<br/>Mr Webber, from Taunton, Somerset, was a history student at Nottingham, with a particular interest in US and China geopolitics.<br/>He was a \"key member\" of Bishops Hull Cricket Club and had been selected for the university team.

Cases have fallen by more than 99% since the late 1980s and about 20 million people who would have been paralysed can walk thanks to vaccines. <br/>The original or \"wild\" poliovirus is now contained to small pockets of Afghanistan and Pakistan and the oral vaccines play a pivotal role in the attempt to rid the world of polio. <br/>\"The issue is they're genetically unstable,\" Dr Andrew Macadam, from the UK's National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, told BBC News.<br/>It takes only one mutation to turn the safe polio vaccine back into a virus that can move out of a child's stomach, invade their nervous system and cause paralysis. <br/>And if those viruses spread from an immunised child - through their contaminated faeces - there is a risk of infecting the unvaccinated and triggering an outbreak. <br/>There are now more cases of \"vaccine-derived polio\" than of the wild poliovirus and the polio detected in London's sewers last year was connected to the oral vaccine. <br/>So the researchers have genetically altered the weakened virus even further to make it much harder for it to start causing paralysis again. <br/>\"By genetically modifying this part of the virus, we could modify this region so it couldn't revert and this I think has been remarkably successful,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Prof Raul Andino, from University of California San Francisco, said he was \"super-proud\" of the scientific effort showing the vaccine was \"50 to 100 times more stable\".<br/>In March 2021, the World Health Organization made the researchers' vaccine against type-two polio available for emergency use. Since then, it has been used more than 650 million times. <br/>Now, in the journal Nature, the researchers have detailed the creation of stable vaccines against polio types one and three. <br/>The first-stage human trials of the upgraded vaccines have already been conducted - and, the researchers say, the data, which is still being analysed, is \"very promising\". <br/>The trio represent the first new polio vaccines in 50 years. <br/>\"I don't think there's any question that they're helpful, the new vaccines address the instability question, but it doesn't address the coverage issue,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Tackling the last 1% of polio cases has proven stubborn. The original goal was to completely eradicate polio by the year 2000 - but delivering vaccines to some of the poorest and most conflict-ridden parts of the world has been a challenge. <br/>Prof Alan Barrett, from the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences, at the University of Texas, called the \"super-engineered\" vaccines a feat of \"impressive science\".<br/>\"[But] will it lead the endgame to the finish line? That is a big question,\" he added.<br/>Joseph Swan, from the World Health Organization and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, said more stable vaccines were a \"significant part\" of the plan for a polio-free world.<br/>But, he said: \"Simply having these new and better tools will not get us over the finish line - vaccination, not just vaccines, is what will end polio.\"<br/>There was now a \"unique opportunity\" to eradicate wild poliovirus - but vaccine-derived polio outbreaks were causing problems in places facing \"complex humanitarian emergencies\", in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Yemen. <br/>Follow Jameson Twitter.

I was anxious, I was on edge, my confidence was at an all-time low.\"<br/>Ms Wightman became a subject of tabloid stories again in 2000 when she broke up with Mr Whitehouse, who had an affair with a costume designer he had been working with. <br/>She alleged that her mobile voicemail messages to and from Mr Whitehouse were listened to by journalists and private investigators. <br/>They remained friends with shared children despite the break-up and continued to leave each other voicemail messages, to which she alleges journalists and private investigators listened.<br/>In her witness statement, she said: \"I was young, I had ovarian cancer, and the prognosis for ovarian cancer then was awful. I was dealing with infertility. <br/>\"My husband had an affair. It sounds like a tragedy. I am not a tragedy, but I was dealing with such incredibly difficult, painful things.\"<br/>\"For someone to have listened to my messages and thought 'there is a great story here' is just awful.\" <br/>The Mirror papers never published a story about Ms Wightman's cancer, but they did write about Paul Whitehouse's affair.<br/>Concluding her evidence, Ms Wightman said she had been \"really anxious\" about giving evidence. <br/>She said: \"I've had to discuss some of the most personal things I have had to go through. Most difficult times in my life. The most challenging times. Ironically, it can now be reported. At the time, I chose not to discuss any of it.\"<br/>In his statement, Mr Whitehouse, who currently stars in BBC Two series Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing, said: \"It is called a private life for a reason.\"<br/>\"MGN's journalists overstepped the mark. And it was not just my life they were investigating, it was Fiona's, our daughters' and her parents' lives.<br/>\"It makes us both feel very angry and there was zero reason for them to get involved,\" he added. <br/>Ms Wightman's claims have been chosen as one of three test cases in this legal action, with many other well-known people also preparing to sue MGM.<br/>Prince Harry has refused to settle his claim against the newspapers, and gave evidence last week. <br/>MGN apologised in 2015 for using \"unlawful information gathering\" techniques but denies the majority of Ms Wightman's claims. <br/>It said her allegation that private investigators were accessing credit agencies to get her personal information were false, arguing that journalists were paying for searches on the Electoral Roll. <br/>The publisher also says her case should be rejected because she failed to take legal action at the time. Victims of privacy breaches usually have a six-year time limit to sue."}, {"_id": "6489ffb651ac3319f5477d99", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-65907380?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "England", "subCategories": "Regions", "title": "Georgia Bilham: Woman who posed as man convicted of assault over kiss", "lead": "Georgia Bilham denied deceiving a young woman by posing as a man from Birmingham.", "author": "By PA Media & Caroline Gall", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:14.235652", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/09E4/production/_130023520_gb.png", "body": "A woman accused of posing as a man to prey on a 19-year-old has been found guilty of sexual assault by kissing and cleared of 16 other sexual offences.<br/>Georgia Bilham, 21, of Cheshire, denied deceiving the short-sighted woman while posing as George Parry, a man from Birmingham.<br/>Jurors heard she wore a hood while with the woman, saying she was paranoid because of connections to gangsters.<br/>Bilham will be sentenced at Chester Crown Court on 19 July.<br/>Giving evidence during her trial, Bilham admitted getting caught up in a \"web of lies\", but said she thought the teenager believed she really was a woman after they met.<br/>The court heard Bilham created \"George\" on Snapchat, claiming he always had to wear a hood over his head while with the 19-year-old, even in bed, because of paranoia about his involvement with Albanian gangsters.<br/>The mother of the woman told jurors her daughter had seemed \"really happy\" and had a \"spark in her eye\" after meeting \"George\" but had found it strange he kept his hood up whenever they met.<br/>Bilham's identity was only revealed following a car crash.<br/>The pair had gone for a drive together on 11 May 2021, but Bilham crashed her mother's car into a hedge and when police asked for her licence it showed her real name.<br/>She said from that point she believed the teenager knew she was really a woman.<br/>Bilham, of Bunbury Road, Alpraham, admitted to the court that she had always been a bit of a tomboy.<br/>She said she had never wanted to change her gender, but had questioned her sexuality, telling the jury her mother would \"not be happy\" if she was in a same-sex relationship.<br/>Bilham was convicted on Wednesday of sexually assaulting the girl by kissing her on the evening of the crash.<br/>Adjourning the case for sentencing, Judge Michael Leeming said: \"You have been convicted of count one, an allegation of sexual assault.<br/>\"I'm going to adjourn sentencing for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.<br/>\"It should not be taken by you as an indication of a non-custodial sentence - all options are open.\"<br/>Bilham had denied nine sexual assaults and eight counts of assault by penetration.<br/>Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The gangs then send videos of the abuse to the families of migrants being held hostage, demanding a ransom for their release. <br/>Warning: this article contains descriptions of violence and sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing <br/>Shackled together on a mountain-top with padlocks around their necks, a group of Afghan migrants beg for their release. <br/>\"Whoever watches this video, I was kidnapped yesterday, they are demanding $4,000 (\u00a33,200) for each one of us. They beat us day and night non-stop,\" says one man, with a bloodied lip, his face caked in dust. <br/>Another video shows a group of men fully naked, crawling in the snow as someone whips them from behind. <br/>\"I have family, don't do this to me; I have a wife and children, have mercy, please,\" one man cries in another, shortly before he is filmed being sexually abused at knifepoint by one of the gangs. <br/>These disturbing videos are evidence of a growing criminal enterprise, in which gangs in Iran kidnap mainly Afghan migrants trying to make their way to Europe. <br/>The migration route from Afghanistan to Iran, then across the border into Turkey and onto the rest of Europe, has been used for decades. In fact, I took part of the same journey myself 12 years ago when fleeing Iran for the UK, where I was granted asylum.<br/>But the route is now more dangerous than ever.<br/>Those trying to cross from Iran into Turkey walk for hours over dry, mountainous terrain with no trees to provide shade, making it harder to avoid security forces who patrol the area. <br/>As hundreds of thousands have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, gangs have seen an opportunity to profit from the huge increase in the number of people making the journey.  <br/>Often in collaboration with the smugglers, they are kidnapping people on the Iranian side of the border, extorting money from vulnerable groups who have often already paid large sums in order to ensure safe passage. <br/>The BBC team heard stories of torture from at least 10 locations along the border. One activist who has been documenting the abuse for the past three years told us he received as many as two or three videos of torture a day at its peak. <br/>In an apartment in Turkey's commercial capital Istanbul, we meet Amina. <br/>She had a successful career as a police officer in Afghanistan, but fled the country when she realised the Taliban were going to retake power, having received threats before from the group. <br/>Softly-spoken and wearing a purple headscarf, she told me about her experience on the border when she and her family were taken hostage by a gang.<br/>\"I was very scared, I was terrified, because I was pregnant and there was no doctor. We had heard many stories of young boys being raped.\"<br/>Her father Haji told us the gang sent him a video showing the torture of an unknown Afghan man after they had kidnapped Amina and other members of his family.<br/>\"This was the situation I was in. By sending these videos they were warning me. If you don't pay the ransom we will kill your daughters and your son-in-law,\" he says.<br/>Haji sold his house in Afghanistan to pay the gang and get his family released. They then tried again to get into Turkey, this time successfully.<br/>But the eight-day ordeal on the border was too much for Amina. <br/>She lost her baby. <br/>Aside from the gangs, Amina and others face another major obstacle along their route: The wall. <br/>Snaking more than half the length of the Turkish-Iranian border, it stands three metres high and is fortified with barbed wire and electronic sensors, as well as watch-towers funded by the European Union (EU). <br/>Turkey began building the wall in 2017 in order to stop migrants crossing into the country, but they are still coming. <br/>Amina and several others told us they fell into the hands of violent gangs on the Iranian side after Turkish authorities had pushed them back over the border at night, allegations which have also been documented by international rights groups. <br/>Mahmut Kagan, a Turkish human rights lawyer who represents asylum seekers, insists this practice, which is illegal under international law, is helping the gangs to exploit people.<br/>\"It's very much related to the pushbacks - those violations - because it creates a fragile group open to all forms of abuses,\" he says. <br/>Turkish authorities did not respond to the BBC's request for comment about these allegations. But in the face of similar accusations from human rights groups the government has denied pushbacks, saying any activities to prevent illegal entry into Turkey are carried out within the scope of border management.<br/>Before the wall was built, many locals used to make a living by smuggling goods across the border. That trade has largely vanished now, meaning some have switched to kidnapping or trafficking migrants instead. <br/>In Van, the closest Turkish city to the Iranian border and a hub for migrant trafficking, we met a young Afghan man called Ahmed in a stable repurposed as a safehouse, as he negotiated the next leg of his journey with smugglers. <br/>Ahmed's brother was kidnapped on the Iranian side of the border with his extended family when they tried to flee the Taliban last year. <br/>It was Ahmed, then still in Afghanistan, who received the calls from the gang demanding a ransom. <br/>\"I said we don't have money, the kidnapper was beating my brother. We could hear it down the line,\" he says. <br/>Ahmed sold his family's belongings to pay for their release. But the experience wasn't enough to stop him trying the same journey himself six months later, desperate to make a living after the economic crisis that followed the Taliban takeover. <br/>In the Afghan capital Kabul, we met Said, back where he started after six failed attempts to escape Afghanistan and make it to Turkey.<br/>He had been promised a fake document that would allow him to cross to Turkey. Instead he says he was betrayed by his contact and sold to a gang, who tortured him and demanded a $10,000 (\u00a37,990) ransom. <br/>\"I was very scared. They could do anything to me.

most of which is under Russian control after the longest and possibly bloodiest battle in the war.<br/>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that there was \"movement forward\" and thanked Ukrainian troops for \"every step and every metre of Ukrainian land that is being liberated from Russian evil\".<br/>However, Russia's President Vladimir Putin insisted Ukraine had not succeeded \"in any of the sectors\" and that Ukraine had suffered \"catastrophic\" losses - although he did not offer any evidence.<br/>Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said that while it was still \"early days\", progress was being made in repelling Russian troops.<br/>Analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have also concluded that Ukraine has continued to make \"limited territorial gains\".<br/>In anticipation of Ukraine's counter-offensive Russia stepped up missile and drone attacks in recent weeks and those have continued.<br/>Twelve people have died after missile strikes on Kryvyi Rih - President Zelensky's home city - on 13 June and a further three people were killed on 14 June in a rare attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa, which is vital to Ukraine's grain exports.<br/>Kyiv has also been targeted again in recent weeks, leading to several deaths including that of an 11-year-old girl on 1 June, although Ukraine says many of the attacks on its capital and other regions have been prevented - or at least limited - by its air defences.<br/>Vladimir Putin's latest statements on the progress of the war did include one admission - that authorities in Moscow could have better anticipated recent cross-border attacks into Russia from Ukraine.<br/>Russia blamed the deaths of two women in the village of Maslova Pristan in the border region of Belgorod on 2 June on shelling by Ukrainian forces and said others had been injured.<br/>The shelling came nearly two weeks after Moscow said 70 attackers who crossed the border from Ukraine had been killed, adding that they were Ukrainian fighters.<br/>Kyiv denied involvement and two Russian paramilitary groups have said they were behind the incursion.<br/>The claims by the warring sides have not been independently verified, but any assaults on Russian soil make Nato leaders nervous, and the development could prove a mixed blessing for Ukraine.<br/>Meanwhile, humanitarian efforts continue to help people affected by severe flooding in southern Ukraine, following 6 June's major breach of the Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River.<br/>Several towns and villages along the banks - and the city of Kherson which had a population of more than 270,000 before the war - were among those hit, with tens of thousands of people told to leave their homes.<br/>However, the UN says Russia \"is yet to provide the safety guarantees we need to cross the front line to the left bank of the Dnipro River\".<br/>UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown adds it is engaging with both Ukrainian and Russian governments to reach anyone who may \"urgently require life-saving assistance\".<br/>The death toll from the flooding in the Russian controlled areas of the Kherson region reached 17 on 13 Jan, according to the head of the Moscow-installed government there.<br/>Ukraine said on 12 June that 10 people had been killed in areas it controlled and another 42 were missing. <br/>Each side has blamed the other for the destruction of the dam in Russian-controlled territory, but BBC correspondent Paul Adams says the evidence overwhelmingly suggests it was Russia's doing.<br/>There are also concerns that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been affected - or has the potential to be affected - by the dam breach downstream.<br/>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate nuclear safety risk and it was monitoring the situation -

Little known until recently, his popularity now rivals that of President Volodymyr Zelensky.<br/>Gen Zaluzhny, or \"our Valera\" as friends and old classmates like to call him, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military in July 2021. <br/>Those who know him well say the appointment, pushed through personally by President Zelensky, came as a surprise to the general and many others too as his  promotion involved climbing several steps on the career ladder. <br/>Zaluzhny was already known as an ambitious and modern commander, but also an unpretentious man who liked to joke with his subordinates and didn't put on airs. <br/>Within seven months he was leading Ukraine's defence against full-scale invasion. <br/>By 26 February 2022 it was clear that Russian troops were failing to \"take Kyiv in three days\", which had initially seemed a likely outcome. <br/>But the reality remained grim and Ukrainian authorities were calling on the public not to panic. Russian troops were advancing in the north, east and south of Ukraine and posed a considerable threat to the capital.<br/>One idea floating among Ukraine's top officials was to start blowing up bridges near Kyiv over the vast Dnipro river, to prevent the Russians crossing from the eastern left bank to the western right bank, where, among other strategic objects, the government quarter was situated. <br/>They phoned Gen Zaluzhny for his view. \"Under no circumstances are we to do that,\" he is reported to have replied, at the time sitting in a smoke-filled bunker with other top brass. <br/>\"This will be a betrayal of both civilians and the military remaining on the eastern bank.\" <br/>The BBC has heard matching accounts from two sources involved in the episode that indicate this is what happened.<br/>Many other crucial decisions followed and by early April 2022 Ukrainian troops pushed the Russian army back to the north and east of Kyiv.<br/>Born into the family of a Soviet serviceman, Valery Zaluzhny once said he was always committed to distancing himself from the excessive hierarchy of the Soviet Army. <br/>By the time he went to military school in the mid-1990s Ukraine was already an independent state. <br/>While his textbooks at military college may have dated back to the Soviet era, he learnt about the reality of war first-hand. In 2014 he was appointed a deputy commander in an area of eastern Ukraine where the conflict with separatists, backed by the Russian army, was getting under way.<br/>Colleagues we spoke to say that from the onset of his career he was keen on building relationships of trust with his subordinates as well as delegating command decisions.<br/>Zaluzhny's former aide who was by his side in the first days of the Russian invasion, Lyudmyla Dolhonovska, told the BBC he barely slept and kept in touch with military staff on the frontline. <br/>\"He spoke on the phone to his generals a lot, but the conversations were always focused and calm,\" she said.<br/>Analysts say the flexibility shown by Ukrainian units with junior officers able to make decisions on the battlefield gave them a considerable advantage over the top-heavy decision-making structures of the Russian army. <br/>Some sources in the Ukrainian military even go as far as to say that it is the decisive commanders on the ground who are collectively responsible for Ukraine's successes, while Gen Zaluzhny should only be credited with leaving them with the freedom to operate.<br/>As the war ground on, President Zelensky played a key role in maintaining the morale of the Ukrainian public through his nightly addresses. <br/>He pushed an image of strong governance while exerting pressure on foreign partners for financial and military support. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny's focus was on getting military strategy right.<br/>After successful advances in late summer and early autumn, Ukrainian troops liberated large swathes of the Ukrainian territory in the east and south.<br/>The commander-in-chief became a national hero, despite being rarely seen in public and even more rarely agreeing to interviews.<br/>His name became synonymous with bravery and determination, and his reputation spawned anecdotes and turns of phrase.<br/>\"When Zaluzhny walks into an unlit room, he doesn't switch on the light, he switches off the darkness,\" one such phrase went.<br/>His popularity ratings drew level with Zelensky's, and conspiracy theorists began speculating on a possible rift between them.<br/>There was talk of Zelensky replacing Zaluzhny as military chief or even of Zaluzhny challenging the president's political leadership.<br/> So far, neither has happened.<br/>A source in the presidential administration told the BBC that \"President Zelensky simply has no time for such jealousy as he is 102% preoccupied with getting military support for Ukraine from its partners\".<br/>The two men appear quite happy to let each other get with their jobs. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny told Time magazine last June that he did not bother to explain to Mr Zelensky all the minute details of military strategy.<br/>\"He doesn't need to understand military affairs any more than he needs to know about medicine or bridge-building.\" <br/>Political analysts and sociologists have told the BBC that Zaluzhny's popularity is natural in the current situation where Ukrainians need ways to boost morale. They also highlight his human touch. <br/>Once he turned up at a wedding of a soldier forced to delay the ceremony because he had been sent to the front line at Bakhmut. Eventually the soldier was given a short period of leave to get the chance to marry his fianc\u00e9e.<br/>As talk of a forthcoming Ukrainian offensive intensified, Russian military bloggers began circulating rumours in mid-May that Gen Zaluzhny had been critically wounded or even killed. <br/>This was picked up by Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin who said: \"Naturally, we have all information about the state of health of the commander of the Ukrainian Army but we will not disclose it.\"<br/>Col Anatoly Shtefan, who is close to Gen Zaluzhny, said that while Ukraine's top brass poked fun at the rumours -  which they described as the \"height of Russian propaganda madness\" - it was clear that Ukrainians were starting to worry too. <br/>At the beginning of June, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence published several photos of Gen Zaluzhny attending a military ceremony in Kyiv. <br/>For now Valery Zaluzhny's hero status among Ukrainians is secure, but with so many pinning their hopes on the commander-in-chief the future is likely to be complicated. <br/>Even if the defence of Ukraine ultimately succeeds, Ukraine will face a harsh reality, warns sociologist Oleksiy Antypovych, and Zaluzhny may choose to steer clear of politics.<br/>\"It is highly likely that after the war Ukraine will face a severe economic crisis, if not a complete collapse. It will be a completely different ball game.\"<br/>Political analyst Mykola Davydiuk believes that if the military chief were to move into politics, he might succeed. <br/>\"While Zelensky is a leader who didn't abandon Ukrainians, Zaluzhny was the one who defended them. It's an organic narrative for him and there is a demand for it in our society.\"<br/>The BBC asked Gen Zaluzhny for an interview. He declined our request."}, {"_id": "6489ffb951ac3319f5477da2", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-63512342?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Newsbeat", "subCategories": "", "title": "Tory Lanez: How the Megan Thee Stallion shooting trial played out", "lead": "Rapper Tory Lanez will be sentenced in August for shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the feet.", "author": "By Riyah Collins", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:17.124307", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11211/production/_127516107_gettyimages-1428717480.jpg", "body": "Rapper Tory Lanez's sentencing for shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the feet has been delayed until August.<br/>A jury in the US found him guilty of firing at the Savage singer in the Hollywood Hills during an argument.<br/>Almost three years have passed since the 2020 shooting, and a lot has happened inside - and outside - court.<br/>It's a case that's divided fans and spilled out into the wider hip-hop world, with Drake being accused of taking sides at one point.<br/>When the trial finally got going in Los Angeles late last year, after months of delays, Megan got to take the stand and give her version of events under oath.<br/>\"I can't believe I have to come here and do this,\" was how Megan started her testimony in the LA courtroom.<br/>She told the jury it all began at the party hosted by Kylie Jenner in the Hollywood Hills on 12 July 2020.<br/>Megan, real name Megan Pete, and Tory Lanez, real name Daystar Peterson, got into an argument as they drove away from the event.<br/>She told the trial the row started when she mocked Lanez' musical talents.<br/>According to Megan, she demanded to be let out of the car and heard . <br/>He then opened fire with a handgun. <br/>The jury heard how she left a trail of blood at the scene and minutes after the shooting a friend messaged her security saying: \"Help... Tory shot Meg.\"<br/>Megan told the courtroom Lanez had offered her $1m to keep quiet about what happened, and called her afterwards to apologise, claiming he was \"just too drunk\".<br/>Through tears, she said she had regrets about coming forward, saying speaking out had been \"torture\".<br/>Lanez was convicted in December of three charges: assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.<br/>Prosecutors are seeking a 13-year prison sentence and the 30-year-old faces deportation to his native Canada.<br/>But he still hasn't been sentenced.<br/>On 13 June, a judge accepted his lawyer's request to delay the sentencing until 7 August to give them more time to prepare their recommendations.<br/>During the brief court hearing, Lanez - wearing an orange jail outfit and black cap - mostly kept his head down and barely made eye contact with anyone.<br/>Outside the court, Lanez' supporters stood opposite crowds of fans carrying \"We stand with Megan\" signs.<br/>And as Megan arrived at the building, his side heckled her by shouting: \"Why are you lying on that boy?\"<br/>Accusations of lying have dogged the Grammy-winning rapper throughout the case, because her story changed early on.<br/>She initially told police she'd been hurt by stepping on broken glass.<br/>It wasn't until later, on Instagram, when she first said that Tory had shot her. <br/>She then told an interviewer she'd needed surgery to remove bullets from her feet which had missed her bones and tendons.<br/>Megan, 27, said she lied to officers at the time because she didn't want to \"get in more trouble\". <br/>It sparked a long war of words between her and Lanez - they both released tracks about the case.<br/>In his song Money Over Fallout, Lanez accused Megan of trying to frame him, while Megan said she was the one \"speakin' facts\" in her track Shots Fired.<br/>The dispute spilled out into the wider hip-hop world, with artists like 50 Cent and even Drake getting involved.<br/>Megan frequently defended herself on Twitter and said she'd been painted as aggressive and a \"snitch\".<br/>She suggested misogynoir - misogyny against black women - could be why she was targeted.<br/>Megan criticised Drake when he released Circo Loco, a collab with 21 Savage that appeared to reference the shooting case.<br/>But she did receive support from fellow artists, like JoJo and Kehlani. <br/>And a group of prominent black women, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, released an open letter backing Megan.<br/>In Da Club rapper Fiddy eventually apologised for sharing memes casting doubt on Megan's version of events.<br/>He said he'd changed his mind after hearing evidence from the trial.<br/>Lanez has always denied the charges against him, he's filed various appeals and his lawyers could launch other motions after his sentence.<br/>Since the guilty verdict, Megan has tried to reclaim the narrative around the shooting, and spoken about the effect \"false narratives\" and \"conspiracy theories\" had on her.<br/>In an Elle Magazine feature, she said the guilty verdict \"was a victory for every woman who has ever been shamed, dismissed, and blamed for a violent crime committed against them\".<br/>\"We can't control what others think, especially when the lies are juicier than the truth,\" she said.<br/>\"But as a society, we must create safer environments for women to come forward about violent behaviour without fear of retaliation.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

A love of music has shaped both her life and her approach to design, she says.<br/>\"This morning I went up to my design studio and they were playing heavy rock. I looked up at the girls and said, 'Soz, I'm changing it.'\"<br/>Choosing the right music to create the right \"buzz\" for clients who come to visit her west London studio is of the utmost importance to Kelly Hoppen.<br/>Music sets the mood for them, but it also helps her get creative. \"It has to be a certain music for me to get into the zone to design,\" she explains.<br/>In fact, it's often through discussion of music that the decisive creative breakthroughs with clients are made.<br/>\"I say to them, 'If you wanted your room to sound like a piece of music, what would it be?'\" she says. \"Some don't understand the question, but others say, 'Oh, 100%, Say A Little Prayer for You by Burt Bacharach.' And I get that! <br/>\"I can't explain why, but music is design to me.\"<br/>In a career that spans five decades, Hoppen, 63, has established herself as one of the UK's best-known interior designers. She is famed for her neutral palette, Zen-like greys which are meant to create a relaxing ambience. <br/>Many of her celebrity customers have been musicians, including Victoria Beckham, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and, most recently, Boy George.<br/>Her job is to figure out what they really want, which isn't always straightforward. Boy George visited her home and explained the decor he was after.<br/>\"I said, 'I'm absolutely convinced you don't [want that],\" recalls Hoppen.<br/>But by speaking to him she found out the deeper feelings he was looking for, which gave her clues on how to express his personality in home decor - which is very different to his flamboyant stage persona, she points out.<br/>It's the part of the job she loves, getting into a client's head like a psychologist, she says.<br/>The language of music is part of her method for \"getting the information\" she needs.<br/>Hoppen was born in South Africa, where her mother is from, but with her British father the family moved to London when she was two.<br/>They went back to visit her grandparents during holidays, and her grandmother's elegant home was another design inspiration for her.<br/>In the mid-1970s, aged 16, she decided to \"run away\" back to South Africa on her own. <br/>Her parents had divorced and she was living with her father after falling out with her mother. When her father died unexpectedly at the age of 48, the huge shock was the trigger for her to go.<br/>Back in apartheid South Africa she befriended the musical group The Pacific Express and toured with them. The group contained both black and Indian members. She was breaking apartheid laws by mixing with them, and found herself in jail on one occasion as a result.<br/>She had known the risks, but the music drew her in.<br/>The experience left her \"heartbroken and disgusted\" at what South Africa was like under apartheid so she did not go back.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Instead, she channelled her passion for music into interior design, starting her company in her teens without qualifications, and growing it organically, one client at a time.<br/>Hoppen's understated look for interiors has appealed to clients who specialise in luxury environments, whether it is boutique hotels, cruise ships or airlines looking to please first-class customers. <br/>She says it's a reputation she has played along with, though she's not averse to a splash of colour. (\"But in my own home? Nope.\") <br/>Apart from her design consultancy, her business empire also includes her best-selling books, which explain some of her design secrets.<br/>The jobs that come into her studio tend to be from high net-worth clients, or companies that cater to them. Her customers have not been particularly affected by the cost of living crisis, she says.<br/>She is aware of \"the divide\" that exists between her clientele's design needs, and the day-to-day concerns of most people.<br/>But she is equally passionate about improving home design for those on smaller budgets, she says, and has built a large following on Instagram, sharing ideas about how to do it.<br/>Interior design doesn't have to involve spending money, she says.

Hungarian leader Viktor Orban and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, were among the few figures from the world stage.<br/>\"To be happy means to love parties, to enjoy life to the fullest, and to have a sense of humour,\" said Archbishop Mario Delpini in a homily that encapsulated the four-time prime minister's flamboyant life.<br/>Berlusconi was a divisive figure for Italians, and renowned abroad for his crude jokes and so-called bunga-bunga parties.<br/>In the front row of the cathedral were his five children, who have been catapulted into the limelight, as part of an inevitable succession story. <br/>During his lifetime, Berlusconi amassed a vast empire that spanned media, real estate, finance, cinema and sport - as well as a powerful political party that is part of Italy's current government.  <br/>He was one of Italy's richest men. According to Forbes, his business assets are worth about \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.15bn). <br/>But he never publicly indicated who should lead his business empire after his death and there are also big questions over the future of the Forza Italia party he created.<br/>Berlusconi has two children from his first marriage and three from his second. All of them have stakes in Fininvest, his holding company.  <br/>The future of his business interests will likely depend on how he has chosen to distribute the 61% stake he had in Fininvest. <br/>Will there be equal shares for all, or more for the two eldest children, Marina and Pier Silvio, who have held management roles in the empire since the early 1990s? <br/>Other valuable assets are undoubtedly Berlusconi's numerous luxurious villas. They could be tricky to pass on to his offspring in an equal way.<br/>His Villa San Martino in Arcore, north-east of Milan, covers 3,500 sq m and dates back to the 18th Century. He also has homes at Lake Maggiore, in Rome, Cannes, the Caribbean and elsewhere.<br/>The jewel in Berlusconi's crown of properties is Villa Certosa, a mansion in Sardinia that he bought in the 1970s. <br/>He hosted world leaders there, from Vladimir Putin to George W. Bush. It has 126 rooms and looks like a theme park - including a fake volcano that erupts lava. Its value is estimated at \u20ac259m.<br/>People close to the family have described Berlusconi as \"the glue\" who kept his children united.<br/>There has been no dispute so far over who takes over the empire - that is expected to fall to his oldest child Marina, 56, considered closest of the five to her father.<br/>The big question is whether that family unity can be maintained now that Berlusconi has gone, and what impact that might have on the future of his business empire. <br/>His death could prove disastrous for the future of his political party. Can Forza Italia survive without its charismatic creator - or could it fall apart in a matter of months?<br/>He was the ultimate populist leader, and unsurprisingly, the party he created was entirely shaped around his persona.  <br/>His right-hand man, foreign minister Antonio Tajani, has categorically denied its future is at risk: \"It's unthinkable that the party would disappear.\"<br/>But Forza Italia's share of the vote had already slipped to 8% in last September's general election. <br/>Many Italians who backed the party did so because they were Berlusconi loyalists and it will be tricky to appoint a successor they will warm to. <br/>In reality, party members will probably look to the Berlusconi family to make a decision.<br/>Will the two eldest, Marina and Pier Silvio, want to keep investing in their father's political creation, or will they turn off the financial tap and cut their losses?<br/>Without their financial support, Forza Italia has no chance of surviving. Berlusconi heavily funded his party - reportedly injecting it with nearly \u20ac100m. <br/>There is some speculation that Marina could succeed him as leader, but for now this remains a rumour. She is seen as more of a behind-the-scenes operator. <br/>Another unknown is Berlusconi's partner Marta Fascina, who is 53 years his junior. She's an MP in his party and has said several times that \"her passion is politics and she grew up with the myth of Silvio Berlusconi\".<br/>Berlusconi's eldest daughter reportedly blocked his plan to marry her last year. So there is a cloud over Ms Fascina's future role in her late partner's party.<br/>One thing is certain: if Forza Italia does fracture, it would be a big problem for the other members of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition government.<br/>Political instability looms after Wednesday's day of national mourning.<br/>In a country so well-known for regular political crises, a government collapse triggered by the disintegration of one of the coalition partners does not seem such an unlikely scenario.<br/>Until now, Berlusconi's children have avoided the limelight. But his death might force them to emerge from the shadows to take the reins of his empire.<br/>Berlusconi had health problem for years so it is likely he and his children had thought all of this through.<br/>They might opt for an easy transition heralded by their eldest sister Marina, rather than get into a succession battle which could go wrong."}, {"_id": "6489ffba51ac3319f5477da5", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65904441?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "PMQs: Keir Starmer attacks Rishi Sunak over Boris Johnson honours list", "lead": "The Labour leader accuses Rishi Sunak of failing to stand up to his predecessor over controversial peerages.", "author": "By Brian Wheeler", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:18.431013", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10C46/production/_130087686_mediaitem130087685.jpg", "body": "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak of being \"too weak\" to block Boris Johnson's honours list.<br/>The former PM handed out awards to some of his closest aides from the Covid era in a list published last week.<br/>\"That means that those who threw a Downing Street party the night before the late Queen sat alone at her husband's funeral will now receive awards from the King,\" Sir Keir said.<br/>Mr Sunak insisted he had acted \"in line with established conventions\".<br/>And - in a jibe at Sir Keir's own title - he said: \"I'd expect a knight like him to understand that.\"<br/>The list of Mr Johnson's nominees included his former head of operations, Shelley Williams-Walker, who was reportedly the DJ at a Downing Street gathering on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral.

Because we had no evidence, no-one brought us anything tangible, either on the production floor or from the outside... there was only hearsay and rumour and speculation.\"<br/>She continued: \"Nobody would be turning a blind eye to something. Nobody here on the management board would ever turn a blind eye to something as serious as this.\"<br/>Schofield suggested in an interview with the BBC earlier this month that the controversy had left him feeling suicidal. Dame Carolyn said ITV was now paying for his counselling.<br/>She said she spoke to the presenter the day before he stood down from This Morning because she knew it was a \"pretty major thing in his life\".<br/>\"Phillip is receiving counselling, which ITV are funding. He asked for that, and we're very happy to do that,\" she said.<br/>She added they were also \"extremely concerned\" about the young man - who met Schofield aged 15 and received help getting into the TV industry - because \"the level of intrusion in his life is unbelievably awful\".<br/>She said ITV was providing him with \"a whole series of duty of care [provisions] all the way through, even though he left the company in 2021\".<br/>Dame Carolyn also confirmed there was \"no gagging order or NDA [non-disclosure agreement]\" to stop the unidentified man, now in his late 20s, from speaking out about the situation.<br/>ITV also said he had not effectively received a pay-off in exchange for his silence.<br/>In his recent BBC interview, Schofield, 61, said he understood why people thought there had been an abuse of power, but that it \"didn't feel like that at the time\".<br/>The network has instructed a lawyer to carry out an external review to establish the facts about how it handled its own review of rumours of the affair in 2020.<br/>During Wednesday's session, the ITV executives also denied accusations from some previous contributors of a \"toxic\" culture at the programme.<br/>Dame Carolyn said that suggestion \"deeply disappoints me\" and \"we do not recognise that in This Morning\".<br/>She added. \"We've had two complaints in five years about that issue [and] both of them taken very seriously.\"<br/>One of those was from Dr Ranj Singh, who appeared on This Morning for 10 years and said issues \"go far beyond\" Schofield.<br/>ITV has previously said that after Dr Ranj's complaint, an external review \"found no evidence of bullying or discrimination\".<br/>But SNP MP John Nicolson said he and other committee members had received \"so many messages from folk at ITV, who talk about the bullying culture of ITV\".<br/>The former ITV and BBC news presenter read a selection of anonymous messages. One referred to a boss who used to \"shout and belittle staff\", while another called ITV a \"terrible place to work\".<br/>The committee's chair Dame Caroline Dinenage concluded by telling the executives there was \"clearly some work for ITV to do here to rebuild trust with with us, but more importantly with its staff and with its viewers that it's a safe and welcoming workplace.\"<br/>She added: \"We want to be confident that ITV is not letting star power and favouritism damage the lives and careers of people working there - and, more importantly than that, we want to be confident that when mistakes have been made, ITV will be making changes rather than making jokes about aubergines.\"<br/>That was a reference to a recent remark made by This Morning editor Martin Frizell when he was asked by a Sky News reporter whether his programme had a toxic workplace. \"I'll tell you what's toxic and I've always found it toxic. Aubergine,\" he replied.<br/>Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter<br/>ITV bosses did as much as they could in their attempt to reassure MPs, viewers and advertisers that they had no knowledge of the affair when it was happening, and that their duty of care policies are robust.<br/>We also got some key information from Wednesday's session - perhaps most significantly, confirmation from ITV bosses that they did not reach a financial settlement with the young man in exchange for his silence.<br/>This story may have cooled in the past week or so, but it is not over. The independent investigation being carried out by Jane Mulcahy KC is ongoing and many will be reading its findings closely when they are published.<br/>There are also a few outstanding questions for This Morning. Schofield's replacement as Holly Willoughby's permanent co-host has still not yet been announced. Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary are the frontrunners.<br/>For now, ITV bosses will hope their answers during the two-hour grilling from MPs have done enough to reduce the intense pressure the broadcast network has faced in recent weeks."}, {"_id": "6489ffba51ac3319f5477da7", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-65900089?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Asia", "subCategories": "China,India", "title": "Jocelyn Chia: US comedian calls Malaysia's reaction to MH370 joke 'ridiculous'", "lead": "Jocelyn Chia tells the BBC she is not making fun of victims, after Malaysia asked Interpol to locate her.", "author": "By Kelly Ng", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:18.938877", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9341/production/_130079673_gettyimages-1388529297.jpg", "body": "A US comedian who offended Malaysian authorities with a joke about missing flight MH370 says the reaction from officials has been \"overblown\".<br/>Jocelyn Chia told the BBC she was \"not making fun of tragedy\" and victims, but was trying to find humour in tragedy.<br/>Malaysian police said they would ask Interpol to locate Ms Chia, as they investigate her for incitement and offensive online content.<br/>Ms Chia - who grew up in Singapore - called involving Interpol \"ridiculous\".<br/>Interpol told the BBC it had not received a request for assistance in the case from Malaysian police. <br/>Ms Chia had joked in a viral video that Malaysian jets \"cannot fly\", referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared in 2014 - a sensitive topic in the country.<br/>She said her joke had been \"taken out of context when consumed on social media\". <br/>\"I have [performed this routine] hundreds of times and even did a shorter version of it in Singapore.

Consequently, they will buy fewer things which should slow the rate of rising prices.<br/>An increase in interest rates means higher monthly mortgage, credit card and loan payments for some people. But higher rates should benefit savers - if banks pass them on to their customers. <br/>Asked if he was following former chancellor John Major's dictum in 1989 that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working\", Mr Hunt said: \"In the end there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity.\"<br/>The government has no say over interest rates since the Bank of England was granted independence in 1997.<br/>The UK economy expanded in April after shrinking by 0.3% in the previous month. For the three months to April, it grew marginally by 0.1%. <br/>The ONS said strong trade in bars and pubs boosted growth, but added the construction sector had faltered as rising interest rates and mortgage costs made house buyers more cautious.<br/>As interest rates have risen and more people are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals, some lenders have been withdrawing certain mortgages from the market. <br/>First-time buyers are being met with higher rates, leaving some priced out, and renters are also facing higher costs due to landlords selling up.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, HSBC, a major UK mortgage lender, temporarily withdrew new residential mortgages supplied through brokers.<br/>\"Over recent days cost of funds has increased and, like other banks, we have had to reflect that in our mortgage rates,\" an HSBC spokesperson said.<br/>Hiking rates is meant to persuade consumers to spend less - as their cost of borrowing rises or rates on savings accounts increase - giving businesses less scope to raise prices. <br/>But that mechanism may have become less effective over time.<br/>Take mortgages. In the early 2000s, more than seven out of 10 residential mortgages were on variable or tracker rates, immediately impacted by rate hikes. Today, it's 15% of homeowners. Even adding in the 1.8 million who are re-mortgaging this year, means it's still, contrary to a couple of decades ago, the minority of mortgage holders who will be affected. <br/>The impact of rate hikes is less widespread and may be taking longer to filter through.<br/>Equally, banks and building societies have been particularly reluctant to pass on rate hikes to savers this time, as the Bank of England and outraged customers have noted. This may in part reflect savings institutions rebuilding margins after a period of ultra-low interest rates - but gives customers less of an incentive to stash spare cash. <br/>Higher interest rates also should mean businesses have less scope to give workers inflation-matching pay rises than in the past - but a shortage of workers makes this less likely this time. <br/>Even if, as some economists fear, interest rate rises are less effective this time, they remain the main tool for fighting inflation.<br/>Ian Burns, who runs Cameron Homes, a housebuilder in Staffordshire, said people were being \"very cautious\" and were \"taking longer to make decisions\".<br/>\"Over the past three or four weeks, we've seen a slowdown in reservations,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money.<br/>\"We can't just continue to build houses if we don't have customers for them.\"<br/>Stronger-than-expected wage growth for workers in the three months to April has raised the prospect that the Bank could raise rates close to 6% by the end of the year in its bid to reduce inflation.<br/>On Monday, two-year government borrowing costs rose to levels higher than during the aftermath of last September's mini-budget. <br/>When asked if this showed his plan was not working, Mr Hunt said: \"We are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn. The IMF, the international commentators, think the British economy is on the right track.\"<br/>But the New Economics Foundation, a think tank promoting social and economic justice, said the Bank should hold off on raising rates further and wait to see the impact of its previous increases.<br/>Its economist Lukasz Krebel said that while UK wages were rising, they were still not keeping up with inflation, meaning people were poorer in real terms. <br/>He added that rising prices were mainly due to supply side issues, such as worker shortages and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sending energy prices soaring.<br/>\"The UK government and the Bank should look to address underlying weaknesses that expose the UK to such inflation shocks - notably by supporting investment in clean energy and building retrofits to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil gas,\" he said.<br/>Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figures represented \"another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government\".<br/>\"The facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we're lagging behind on the global stage.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Raphael Sheridan"}, {"_id": "6489ffbb51ac3319f5477daa", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65842845?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Vodafone Three deal to create UK's largest mobile firm", "lead": "The deal is yet to be approved by regulators, which will look at whether it will push up customer prices.", "author": "By Tom Espiner & Vishala Sri-Pathma ", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:19.740700", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/04EA/production/_130085210_phone-gettyimages-1094975398.jpg", "body": "A deal to create the UK's biggest mobile phone operator has been struck by Vodafone and the owner of Three UK.<br/>The firms plan to merge their UK-based operations, giving them around 27 million customers and making it the biggest mobile network in the UK.<br/>The deal is yet to be approved by regulators, which will look at whether it will push up customer prices.<br/>The Vodafone and Three merger will take their combined market share past Virgin Media O2's.<br/>Virgin Media O2 has around 24 million mobile customers while EE, which is owned by BT Group, has 20 million users.<br/>Vodafone and Three UK are the country's third and fourth largest mobile firms.

I need a fresh start. So I moved away,\" he said. <br/>\"The week I moved down to England I got signed to Patrick Topping's [Trick] label and my career just kind of went from there.<br/>\"But I've never forgotten where I come from. I go on about Ayr as much as I can.\"<br/>McVicar's music finally hit the big time in 2021 when his version of Rufus and Chaka Khan's 1974 US hit Tell Me Something Good spent 13 weeks in the Top 40. <br/>\"I was working in a cold storage warehouse over lockdown while I was in the charts,\" he said. <br/>\"That was just a mad experience because folk on the shop floor were listening to my tune while I was working there.\"<br/>Despite moving away, he still had a deep affection for his hometown, even naming an EP Heather Park after the Kincaidston street where he grew up. <br/>Th DJ's father was murdered before he was born, but he has a strong bond with his mother and younger brothers - and is driven to succeed.<br/>The genesis of his career was formed as a teenager, watching rave documentaries with his friends. He now tries to emulate the \"soulful and raw\" 90s sound of that scene. <br/>In April his two great passions - dance music and Ayr - finally collided when he staged the Pavilion Festival in his home town. <br/>With the help of STREETrave, which was responsible for some legendary club nights in Ayr in the 80s and 90s, they brought 7,500 ravers to Ayr for the inaugural festival.<br/>He said it was \"biblical\" to work with the experienced promoters, who were returning to the Ayrshire coast for the first time in 30 years.<br/>\"I had no idea how to run a festival. I just had an idea in my head,\" he said. <br/>\"I can always picture stuff like that but you never know how it's going to turn out until you have the people there and it's all set up. I just never thought it was going to happen.\"<br/>McVicar headlined the two-day event alongside acts like Skream, Kettama, Karen Dunbar and Optimo Espacio.<br/>\"It's all about celebrating being Scottish and having a good time,\" the DJ said. <br/>His house rules were: \"Don't be a dafty\". <br/>\"It worked,\" he said. \"Everyone was so lovely and it was a credit to the punters that came to Pavilion.<br/>\"I've put faith in my hometown and they've given that back to me tenfold.\"<br/>He said he wanted to give a boost to a town which had seen a downturn in fortunes since he left. <br/>\"I want folk to have belief and see a different part of Scotland which doesn't normally get talked about,\" he said. <br/>The event was a huge success - and now the leader of South Ayrshire Council has backed plans for the festival to be held annually over the next five years. <br/>But McVicar is being secretive about his future plans for Pavilion. <br/>\"All we're focusing on is making the experience as good as it can be on the site and hopefully we'll increase the capacity a little bit - just a little bit every year.\"<br/>Although he can now add \"successful festival organiser\" to his CV, he is not letting it distract from his music. <br/>He's working on a new album and a collaboration with one of the world's most famous DJs and record producers. <br/>\"I'm writing an album right now and me and Calvin Harris have got a track on it right now... that's an exclusive, by the way, I've not told anyone that,\" he said. <br/>They're both Scottish - Harris is from Dumfries - but they're from \"different realms\", according to McVicar. <br/>\"We both play different music but the amount of respect I have for him, for everything he's done and the fact he's Scottish as well is just insane.<br/>\"And then when he saw me he was like: 'Its good to finally meet you.' He's lovely\u2026 what a lovely guy he is.<br/>\"I'm looking to release the album next year and I think it's going to be a huge turning point in me going from Ewan McVicar, the wee happy DJ, to actually folk taking me a bit more seriously. <br/>\"It's not just fun anymore.

This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it.

The latest wave included a relatively rare strike on the Black Sea port city of Odesa.<br/>Kyiv's much-anticipated advance has been long in the making, and Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of increasing strikes in recent weeks to deflect attention from the offensive. <br/>The Ukrainians say their troops have recaptured seven settlements and at least 90 sq km (35 sq miles) since starting their counter-offensive. <br/>Ms Maliar wrote on Telegram that Ukrainian troops had advanced around the city of Bakhmut, long the centre of a grinding and bloody street-by-street battle with Russian forces. <br/>She said soldiers advanced by 200m to 500m towards the city, as well as advancing 300m to 500m in the southern Zaporizhzhia province. The BBC cannot independently verify these claims. <br/>But she conceded that the counter-offensive had already led to some \"extremely fierce battles\", as Ukrainian forces try to break through well established Russian defensive lines. <br/>Senior Western officials have warned against the idea that Russian forces will simply \"melt away\" in the face of Ukrainian attacks, adding that Kyiv's gains had already been \"costly\". <br/>\"Russian forces have generally put up a good defence from their well-prepared, defended positions and had been falling back between tactical lines,\" the sources said. <br/>\"This 'manoeuvre defence approach' is proving challenging for the Ukrainians and also costly to attacking forces. Hence, the advance at the moment has been slow,\" they observed, adding that it was too soon to say how effective Ukraine's offensive has been. <br/>But they emphasised that heavy losses were to be expected, given Russia has had months to prepare defensive lines. <br/>\"This was never going to be without risk,\" they said. \"What we're seeing is not unexpected. It's difficult, and it is going to be challenging for Ukrainians. What we have seen, though, is they've continued to push through where they have had losses, and then continued to advance. So overall is going in the right direction.\"<br/>Both sides have reported mounting casualties among their opponents which cannot be independently verified. <br/>Wednesday night's strikes on the Black Sea port city of Odesa killed at east three people, Ukrainian officials have said. <br/>Another 13 people were injured in the early morning attacks, which targeted a warehouse and damaged shops. <br/>The south-western city is vital to Ukraine's grain exports through the Black Sea and has come under infrequent missile fire during the war. <br/>Military commanders said Russia fired 10 missiles and 10 drones overnight, most of which were shot down by air defences. <br/>They added that three of four KH-22 missiles launched from a Russian warship in the Black Sea were shot down, with the final one managing to hit Odesa. <br/>Oleg Kiper, the head of the region's military administration, said the three dead were workers in the warehouse, which was being used as a food storage centre. <br/>\"There may be people under the rubble,\" he added. More civilians were injured after the blast and \"air combat\" damaged shops, restaurants - including a McDonald's - and residential areas, Mr Kiper wrote on Telegram.<br/>Elsewhere, strikes on the eastern cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka killed a further three people and destroyed dozens of residential houses, Ukrainian authorities said. <br/>And six people - including four forestry workers - were killed after Russia shelled a a van in north-eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Ukrainian prosecutors said the attack occurred near the village of Seredyna-Buda, close to the Russian border. <br/>The director of the UN's nuclear watchdog has postponed a planned trip the the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. <br/>Senior Ukrainian officials said Rafael Grossi had agreed to delay his trip until it was safer to travel. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief said on Tuesday that he was \"very concerned\" that the plant could be caught in the crossfire of Ukraine's counter-offensive. <br/>His officials have also stressed their need to access a site near the plant to check water levels, after the nearby reservoir supplying cooling pools for the plant was hit by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam.<br/>Meanwhile, in Moscow the state Duma [parliament] has approved a new bill allowing the defence ministry to sign contracts with convicted criminals to fight in Ukraine. <br/>The new law will allow anyone who is being investigated for committing a crime, having their case heard in court or who has been convicted but before the verdict takes legal effect, to sign up to the army. <br/>People accused of sexual offences, treason, terrorism or extremism will be excluded from the law. <br/>The move - widely seen as the latest attempt by Russian to avoid moving to full conscription - seeks to fill gaps left by mounting casualties.

It has also tightened control over people's lives, our interviewees say.  <br/>Pyongyang told the BBC it has always prioritised its citizens' interests. <br/>The BBC has secretly interviewed three ordinary people in North Korea, with the help of the organisation Daily NK which operates a network of sources in the country. They told us that since the border closure, they are afraid they will either starve to death or be executed for flouting the rules. It is extremely rare to hear from people living in North Korea. <br/>The interviews reveal a \"devastating tragedy is unfolding\" in the country, said Sokeel Park from Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), which supports North Korean escapees. <br/>One woman living in the capital Pyongyang told us she knew a family of three who had starved to death at home. \"We knocked on their door to give them water, but nobody answered,\" Ji Yeon said. When the authorities went inside, they found them dead, she said. Ji Yeon's name has been changed to protect her, along with those of the others we interviewed. <br/>A construction worker who lives near the Chinese border, whom we have called Chan Ho, told us food supplies were so low that five people in his village had already died from starvation. <br/>\"At first, I was afraid of dying from Covid, but then I began to worry about starving to death,\" he said. <br/>North Korea has never been able to produce enough food for its 26 million people. When it shut its border in January 2020, authorities stopped importing grain from China, as well as the fertilisers and machinery needed to grow food. <br/>Meanwhile, they have fortified the border with fences, while reportedly ordering guards to shoot anyone trying to cross. This has made it nearly impossible for people to smuggle in food to sell at the unofficial markets, where most North Koreans shop. <br/>A market trader from the north of the country, whom we have named Myong Suk, told us that almost three quarters of the products in her local market used to come from China, but that it was \"empty now\".  <br/>She, like others who make their living selling goods smuggled across the border, has seen most of her income disappear. She told us her family has never had so little to eat, and that recently people had been knocking on her door asking for food because they were so hungry. <br/>From Pyongyang, Ji Yeon told us she had heard of people who had killed themselves at home or disappeared into the mountains to die, because they could no longer make a living. <br/>She was struggling to feed her children, she said. Once, she went two days without eating and thought she was going to die in her sleep. <br/>In the late 1990s, North Korea experienced a devastating famine which killed as many as three million people. Recent rumours of starvation, which these interviews corroborate, have prompted fears the country could be on the brink of another catastrophe.  <br/>\"That normal, middle-class people are seeing starvation in their neighbourhoods, is very concerning,\" said the North Korea economist Peter Ward. \"We are not talking about full-scale societal collapse and mass starvation yet, but this does not look good.\" <br/>Hanna Song, the director of NKDB, which documents human rights violations in North Korea, agreed. \"For the past 10-15 years we have rarely heard of cases of starvation. This takes us back to the most difficult time in North Korean history.\" <br/>Even the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has hinted at the seriousness of the situation - at one point referring openly to a \"food crisis\", while making various attempts to boost agricultural production. Despite this, he has prioritised funding his nuclear weapons programme, testing a record 63 ballistic missiles in 2022. One estimate puts the total cost of these tests at more than $500m (\u00a3398m) - more than the amount needed to make up for North Korea's annual grain shortfall.<br/>Our interviewees also revealed how the government has used the past three years to increase its control over people's lives, by strengthening punishments and passing new laws.  <br/>Before the pandemic, more than 1,000 people would flee the country each year, crossing the Yalu River into China, according to numbers released by the South Korean government. The market trader Myong Suk told us it had become impossible to escape. \"If you even approach the river now you will be given a harsh punishment, so almost nobody is crossing,\" she said. <br/>The construction worker Chan Ho said his friend's son had recently witnessed several closed-door executions. In each one, three to four people had been killed for attempting to escape. \"Every day it gets harder to live,\" he told us. \"One wrong move and you are facing execution.\" <br/>\"We are stuck here waiting to die.\" <br/>North Korea: The Insiders<br/>For more than three years, North Korea has sealed its borders. People are banned from leaving or entering the country. Almost every foreigner who was inside has packed up and left. The world's most secretive and tyrannical state is now an information black hole. For months, three people inside North Korea have risked their lives to tell the BBC what is happening. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or at 19:00 BST on BBC Two in the UK<br/>We put our findings to the North Korean government, which told us it \"has always prioritised the interests of the people, even at difficult times\". <br/>\"The people's well-being is our foremost priority, even in the face of trials and challenges,\" said a representative from the North Korean embassy in London.  <br/>They also said the information was \"not entirely factual\", claiming it had been \"derived from fabricated testimonies from anti-DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] forces\".   <br/>But Sokeel Park, from LiNK, said these interviews reveal a \"triple whammy\" of hardship. \"The food situation has become more difficult, people have less freedom to fend for themselves, and it has become pretty much impossible to escape.\" They support the theory, he said, that \"North Korea is now more repressive than it has ever been before.\" <br/>In Pyongyang, Ji Yeon said the surveillance and crackdowns were now so ruthless that people did not trust each other. She was taken in for questioning under a new law, passed in December 2020, which bans people from sharing and consuming foreign films, TV shows and songs. Under this Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act, aimed at rooting out foreign information, those caught distributing South Korean content can be executed. <br/>A former North Korean diplomat, who defected in 2019, said he was shocked by how extreme the crackdown on foreign influence had become. \"Kim Jong Un is afraid that if people understand the situation they are in, and how wealthy South Korea is, they will start hating him and rise up,\" explained Ryu Hyun Woo. <br/>Our interviews suggest that some people's loyalty has waned over the past three years. <br/>\"Before Covid, people viewed Kim Jong Un positively,\" Myong Suk said. \"Now almost everyone is full of discontent.\" <br/>More findings from the BBC's investigation into daily life in North Korea will be published on Thursday 15 June"}, {"_id": "6489ffe151ac3319f5477db9", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65901005?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Greece migrants: Hundreds feared missing as boat sinks", "lead": "At least 79 people have died after their fishing vessel capsized off the coast of southern Greece.", "author": "By George Wright", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:57.169810", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C4A3/production/_130093305_fd52450a7713b5140f4221b45d7651c4cd397de20_313_1125_6321000x563.jpg", "body": "At least 79 people have died and more than 100 have been rescued after their fishing vessel capsized off the coast of southern Greece. <br/>But Greek officials and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) say that hundreds more migrants may have been on board.<br/>The shipwreck is the deadliest off Greece this year.<br/>The boat went down about 50 miles (80 km) south-west of Pylos after the coastguard said it had refused help.<br/>The coastguard said the boat had been spotted in international waters late on Tuesday by an aircraft belonging to EU border agency Frontex.

According to Forbes, his business assets are worth about \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.15bn). <br/>But he never publicly indicated who should lead his business empire after his death and there are also big questions over the future of the Forza Italia party he created.<br/>Berlusconi has two children from his first marriage and three from his second. All of them have stakes in Fininvest, his holding company.  <br/>The future of his business interests will likely depend on how he has chosen to distribute the 61% stake he had in Fininvest. <br/>Will there be equal shares for all, or more for the two eldest children, Marina and Pier Silvio, who have held management roles in the empire since the early 1990s? <br/>Other valuable assets are undoubtedly Berlusconi's numerous luxurious villas. They could be tricky to pass on to his offspring in an equal way.<br/>His Villa San Martino in Arcore, north-east of Milan, covers 3,500 sq m and dates back to the 18th Century. He also has homes at Lake Maggiore, in Rome, Cannes, the Caribbean and elsewhere.<br/>The jewel in Berlusconi's crown of properties is Villa Certosa, a mansion in Sardinia that he bought in the 1970s. <br/>He hosted world leaders there, from Vladimir Putin to George W. Bush. It has 126 rooms and looks like a theme park - including a fake volcano that erupts lava. Its value is estimated at \u20ac259m.<br/>People close to the family have described Berlusconi as \"the glue\" who kept his children united.<br/>There has been no dispute so far over who takes over the empire - that is expected to fall to his oldest child Marina, 56, considered closest of the five to her father.<br/>The big question is whether that family unity can be maintained now that Berlusconi has gone, and what impact that might have on the future of his business empire. <br/>His death could prove disastrous for the future of his political party. Can Forza Italia survive without its charismatic creator - or could it fall apart in a matter of months?<br/>He was the ultimate populist leader, and unsurprisingly, the party he created was entirely shaped around his persona.  <br/>His right-hand man, foreign minister Antonio Tajani, has categorically denied its future is at risk: \"It's unthinkable that the party would disappear.\"<br/>But Forza Italia's share of the vote had already slipped to 8% in last September's general election. <br/>Many Italians who backed the party did so because they were Berlusconi loyalists and it will be tricky to appoint a successor they will warm to. <br/>In reality, party members will probably look to the Berlusconi family to make a decision.<br/>Will the two eldest, Marina and Pier Silvio, want to keep investing in their father's political creation, or will they turn off the financial tap and cut their losses?<br/>Without their financial support, Forza Italia has no chance of surviving. Berlusconi heavily funded his party - reportedly injecting it with nearly \u20ac100m. <br/>There is some speculation that Marina could succeed him as leader, but for now this remains a rumour. She is seen as more of a behind-the-scenes operator. <br/>Another unknown is Berlusconi's partner Marta Fascina, who is 53 years his junior.

Little known until recently, his popularity now rivals that of President Volodymyr Zelensky.<br/>Gen Zaluzhny, or \"our Valera\" as friends and old classmates like to call him, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military in July 2021. <br/>Those who know him well say the appointment, pushed through personally by President Zelensky, came as a surprise to the general and many others too as his  promotion involved climbing several steps on the career ladder. <br/>Zaluzhny was already known as an ambitious and modern commander, but also an unpretentious man who liked to joke with his subordinates and didn't put on airs. <br/>Within seven months he was leading Ukraine's defence against full-scale invasion. <br/>By 26 February 2022 it was clear that Russian troops were failing to \"take Kyiv in three days\", which had initially seemed a likely outcome. <br/>But the reality remained grim and Ukrainian authorities were calling on the public not to panic. Russian troops were advancing in the north, east and south of Ukraine and posed a considerable threat to the capital.<br/>One idea floating among Ukraine's top officials was to start blowing up bridges near Kyiv over the vast Dnipro river, to prevent the Russians crossing from the eastern left bank to the western right bank, where, among other strategic objects, the government quarter was situated. <br/>They phoned Gen Zaluzhny for his view. \"Under no circumstances are we to do that,\" he is reported to have replied, at the time sitting in a smoke-filled bunker with other top brass. <br/>\"This will be a betrayal of both civilians and the military remaining on the eastern bank.\" <br/>The BBC has heard matching accounts from two sources involved in the episode that indicate this is what happened.<br/>Many other crucial decisions followed and by early April 2022 Ukrainian troops pushed the Russian army back to the north and east of Kyiv.<br/>Born into the family of a Soviet serviceman, Valery Zaluzhny once said he was always committed to distancing himself from the excessive hierarchy of the Soviet Army. <br/>By the time he went to military school in the mid-1990s Ukraine was already an independent state. <br/>While his textbooks at military college may have dated back to the Soviet era, he learnt about the reality of war first-hand. In 2014 he was appointed a deputy commander in an area of eastern Ukraine where the conflict with separatists, backed by the Russian army, was getting under way.<br/>Colleagues we spoke to say that from the onset of his career he was keen on building relationships of trust with his subordinates as well as delegating command decisions.<br/>Zaluzhny's former aide who was by his side in the first days of the Russian invasion, Lyudmyla Dolhonovska, told the BBC he barely slept and kept in touch with military staff on the frontline. <br/>\"He spoke on the phone to his generals a lot, but the conversations were always focused and calm,\" she said.<br/>Analysts say the flexibility shown by Ukrainian units with junior officers able to make decisions on the battlefield gave them a considerable advantage over the top-heavy decision-making structures of the Russian army. <br/>Some sources in the Ukrainian military even go as far as to say that it is the decisive commanders on the ground who are collectively responsible for Ukraine's successes, while Gen Zaluzhny should only be credited with leaving them with the freedom to operate.<br/>As the war ground on, President Zelensky played a key role in maintaining the morale of the Ukrainian public through his nightly addresses. <br/>He pushed an image of strong governance while exerting pressure on foreign partners for financial and military support. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny's focus was on getting military strategy right.<br/>After successful advances in late summer and early autumn, Ukrainian troops liberated large swathes of the Ukrainian territory in the east and south.<br/>The commander-in-chief became a national hero, despite being rarely seen in public and even more rarely agreeing to interviews.<br/>His name became synonymous with bravery and determination, and his reputation spawned anecdotes and turns of phrase.<br/>\"When Zaluzhny walks into an unlit room, he doesn't switch on the light, he switches off the darkness,\" one such phrase went.<br/>His popularity ratings drew level with Zelensky's, and conspiracy theorists began speculating on a possible rift between them.<br/>There was talk of Zelensky replacing Zaluzhny as military chief or even of Zaluzhny challenging the president's political leadership.<br/> So far, neither has happened.<br/>A source in the presidential administration told the BBC that \"President Zelensky simply has no time for such jealousy as he is 102% preoccupied with getting military support for Ukraine from its partners\".<br/>The two men appear quite happy to let each other get with their jobs. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny told Time magazine last June that he did not bother to explain to Mr Zelensky all the minute details of military strategy.<br/>\"He doesn't need to understand military affairs any more than he needs to know about medicine or bridge-building.\" <br/>Political analysts and sociologists have told the BBC that Zaluzhny's popularity is natural in the current situation where Ukrainians need ways to boost morale. They also highlight his human touch. <br/>Once he turned up at a wedding of a soldier forced to delay the ceremony because he had been sent to the front line at Bakhmut. Eventually the soldier was given a short period of leave to get the chance to marry his fianc\u00e9e.<br/>As talk of a forthcoming Ukrainian offensive intensified, Russian military bloggers began circulating rumours in mid-May that Gen Zaluzhny had been critically wounded or even killed. <br/>This was picked up by Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin who said: \"Naturally, we have all information about the state of health of the commander of the Ukrainian Army but we will not disclose it.\"<br/>Col Anatoly Shtefan, who is close to Gen Zaluzhny, said that while Ukraine's top brass poked fun at the rumours -  which they described as the \"height of Russian propaganda madness\" - it was clear that Ukrainians were starting to worry too. <br/>At the beginning of June, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence published several photos of Gen Zaluzhny attending a military ceremony in Kyiv. <br/>For now Valery Zaluzhny's hero status among Ukrainians is secure, but with so many pinning their hopes on the commander-in-chief the future is likely to be complicated. <br/>Even if the defence of Ukraine ultimately succeeds, Ukraine will face a harsh reality, warns sociologist Oleksiy Antypovych, and Zaluzhny may choose to steer clear of politics.<br/>\"It is highly likely that after the war Ukraine will face a severe economic crisis, if not a complete collapse. It will be a completely different ball game.\"<br/>Political analyst Mykola Davydiuk believes that if the military chief were to move into politics, he might succeed. <br/>\"While Zelensky is a leader who didn't abandon Ukrainians, Zaluzhny was the one who defended them. It's an organic narrative for him and there is a demand for it in our society.\"<br/>The BBC asked Gen Zaluzhny for an interview. He declined our request."}, {"_id": "6489ffe451ac3319f5477dc3", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65898304?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Donald Trump stony-faced during federal indictment hearing", "lead": "Donald Trump's arraignment in a Florida court is observed by two BBC reporters in Miami.", "author": "By Kayla Epstein in the courtroom & Madeline Halpert in the overflow courtroom", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:00.037259", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E766/production/_130083295_trumpcourtsketch.jpg", "body": "Stony-faced in a blue suit and red tie, Donald Trump sat flanked by defence lawyers in a courtroom to face criminal charges, for the second time since leaving office.<br/>The former president listened with a slight frown while prosecutors accused him of improperly possessing and concealing classified documents. It is the first time a former president has faced federal criminal charges. <br/>There were no cameras, phones, or laptops allowed inside the Miami courthouse, and no photos were taken of Mr Trump's arraignment. <br/>Just a few moments before, US Marshals had processed Mr Trump like any other defendant, taking his fingerprints, date of birth, and address. No mugshot was taken, however. Mr Trump was so famous, officials said, that they did not need an additional photo.<br/>The former president, known for his bombastic oratorical style, did not address the court once during his arraignment, even to enter a plea.<br/>\"We most certainly enter a plea of not guilty,\" one of his attorneys, Todd Blanche, declared on his behalf.<br/>At the same table as Mr Trump was Waltine Nauta, the personal aide that federal prosecutors have charged as a co-conspirator. The two, who had travelled to court together, did not appear to interact once inside the courtroom.<br/>On the other side of the aisle, in the second row, sat Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who just days ago unveiled the bombshell charges that Mr Trump had hoarded top-secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. <br/>He too said nothing, allowing lawyer David Harbach to take the lead arguing the government's case.<br/>Despite the spectacle, the room was stifled by silence, the whir of the air-conditioner the only sound until the judge arrived at 14:55 local time.<br/>Judge Jonathan Goodman began the proceedings, presiding efficiently and firmly. <br/>The arraignment hearing served two main purposes: to have defendants enter their pleas, and to have the judge set conditions of their bond. <br/>The most significant action Mr Trump took on Tuesday was signing his bond agreement. A court employee passed the document to one of Mr Trump's lawyers, who then provided it to the former president.<br/>Mr Trump read it quickly, with his lawyers reading over his shoulder. <br/>With a firm stroke of his pen, he signed the documents mandating the terms of his release.<br/>Mr Trump and Mr Nauta received what was known as a \"personal surety bond\". Judge Goodman released both Mr Trump and Mr Nauta without any restrictions on their travel, nor did they have to surrender their passports or pay a monetary bond. <br/>The judge initially said Mr Trump would be forbidden from contacting a number of witnesses that was due to be provided by government prosecutors. Although that list has not yet been drawn up, Mr Trump's legal team argued that many potential witnesses were likely to be Mr Trump's employees or colleagues, and it would be \"impossible\" for him to not contact them at all.<br/>In the end, Judge Goodman attempted to accommodate Mr Trump, deciding he would only be forbidden from speaking to these as yet unknown witnesses about the facts of the case. If the list of witnesses he could not speak to seemed \"unwieldy\", Mr Goodman said, Mr Trump could appeal it.   <br/>Mr Nauta did not enter a plea today, as his lawyer was not currently authorised to practice in the Southern District of Florida.<br/>Instead, he was released on bond and his own arraignment was postponed to 27 June. <br/>Though historically significant, the proceedings moved relatively quickly, lasting just 50 minutes. <br/>\"My involvement in the case ends just about now,\" Judge Goodman declared at 15:45 local time, punctuating the statement with a tap of his watch. Another judge is expected to oversee future proceedings.<br/>As everyone in the court stood, Mr Trump was whisked out a side door by his security detail and into a waiting motorcade.<br/>A few moments after Mr Trump left, Mr Smith, the special prosecutor, strode out of the courtroom without saying a word."}, {"_id": "6489ffe451ac3319f5477dc4", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65894743?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Ukraine offensive: Inside one of the villages freed from Russian forces", "lead": "The BBC reaches Neskuchne in Donetsk region, which saw heavy fighting before it was liberated.", "author": "By James Waterhouse in Neskuchne, eastern Ukraine", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:00.300674", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1D5E/production/_130081570_villages_regained_by_ukrainian_forces_v3_640-2x-nc.png", "body": "The BBC was among the first media organisations to gain access to some of the first villages liberated in Ukraine's counteroffensive. <br/>Out of this cluster of four settlements in the eastern Donetsk region, Neskuchne has seen the heaviest fighting according to the battalion which liberated it.

The only remnants of civilisation come in the form of a blown out pharmacy and food store. <br/>There isn't a complex network of trenches either. A makeshift wooden bridge over a river is all it takes to take us into territory Russia has held for so long. <br/>Buildings are also riddled with bullet holes from smaller calibre weapons.

He explains the Russians are just on the brow of hill in three directions. <br/>The sudden rising of three plumes of smoke is a cue to keep moving. The Russians are responding with Grad missiles.<br/>The situation here is far more fluid than the triumphant claims of liberation which had come from from Kyiv this week. <br/>Russian forces have been pushing back as recently as last night, which Ukrainian officials have now acknowledged.<br/>Ukraine's counteroffensive is in its early stages with modest gains. <br/>If Neskuchne is anything to go by, any liberation will be far from immediate, and won't necessarily bring freedom straight away.<br/>Former residents of Neskuchne told the BBC that the village was also briefly occupied in 2014 - when Russia-backed fighters seized large swathes of land in the Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk regions. This followed the illegal annexation by Russia of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula.<br/>The small village then went back into Ukrainian hands only to be seized by Russian troops soon after last year's invasion.<br/>Earlier this week, a video emerged purportedly showing two Ukrainian soldiers raising the country's blue-and-yellow national flag on destroyed buildings in Neskuchne.<br/>The loud booming sound of nearby shelling can also be heard."}, {"_id": "6489ffe551ac3319f5477dc5", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65881261?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Ukraine offensive: What will it take for military push to succeed?", "lead": "If Kyiv can split Russian troops in the south and hold ground, its push will have achieved its aims.", "author": "By Frank Gardner", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:01.073342", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7400/production/_130069692_gettyimages-1258632908.jpg", "body": "\"Don't call it a counter-offensive,\" say the Ukrainians. \"This is our offensive, it's our chance to finally drive out the Russian army from our land.\"<br/>All right, but what will it take to actually succeed? <br/>First off, let's not get distracted by the recent hard-fought but tiny territorial gains Ukraine has been making as it retakes obscure, half-abandoned villages in the eastern Donetsk and south-eastern Zaporizhzhia regions. <br/>After months of stalemate, images of victorious, battle-stained Ukrainian soldiers holding up their country's blue and yellow flag in front of a bullet-ridden building is a welcome morale boost for Ukrainians. <br/>But in the big strategic picture, this is a sideshow. <br/>The area of Russian-held territory that matters most in this campaign is the south: the area between the city of Zaporizhzhia and the Sea of Azov. <br/>This is the so-called \"land corridor\" that connects Russia to illegally annexed Crimea, the central part of that purple-shaded strip on the map below that has barely changed since the early weeks of the invasion last year.<br/>If Ukraine can split that in two and hold the ground it's retaken, then its offensive will have largely been successful. <br/>It would cut off Russia's troops in the west and make it hard to resupply their garrison in Crimea. <br/>It would not necessarily spell an end to the war - which some are now predicting could drag on for years - but it would put Ukraine in a strong bargaining position when the inevitable peace talks finally take place. <br/>But the Russians have looked at the map, quite some time ago, and reached the same conclusion. <br/>So while Ukraine sent its soldiers off to Nato countries for training and readied their 12 armoured brigades for this summer campaign, Moscow spent that time constructing what is now being called \"the most formidable defensive fortifications in the world\".<br/>Blocking Ukraine's path to the coast - its own coast, let's not forget - are layer upon layer of Russian minefields, concrete tank-blockers (known as \"dragons' teeth\") bunkers, firing positions and trenches wide enough and deep enough to stop a Leopard 2 or M1 Abrams tank literally in its tracks. <br/>All of this is covered by pre-determined artillery impact zones calibrated to rain down high explosive on Ukraine's armoured vehicles as they and their crews wait for their engineers to find a way through.<br/>The early signs are - and it is still very early in this campaign - that those Russian defences are so far holding fast.<br/>Ukraine has yet to commit the bulk of its forces - so these are probing, reconnaissance attacks designed to reveal the whereabouts of Russia's artillery and search out areas of vulnerability in their lines. <br/>In Ukraine's favour is morale. Its soldiers are highly-motivated and fighting to liberate their own country from an invader. <br/>Most of Russia's troops do not share that motivation, and in many cases their training, equipment and leadership are inferior to Ukraine's. <br/>The General Staff back in Kyiv will be hoping that if they can achieve a sufficient breakthrough then a collapse in Russian morale will be contagious, spreading across the battlefront as demoralised Russian troops lose the will to fight.<br/>Also in Ukraine's favour is the quality of hardware that Nato countries have provided. Unlike Soviet-designed armoured vehicles, Nato's tanks and infantry fighting vehicles can often withstand a direct hit, or at least enough to protect the crew inside who then live to fight on. <br/>But will that be enough to counter the strength of Russia's artillery and drone attacks? <br/>Russia, as the vastly bigger country, can draw on more resources than Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin, who started this war in the first place, knows that if he can only wear down the Ukrainians into a stalemate that drags on into next year then there is a chance that the US and other allies will tire of supporting this expensive war effort and start to pressure Kyiv to reach a ceasefire compromise. <br/>Finally, there is the matter of air cover, or lack of it. Attacking a well dug-in enemy without sufficient close air support is highly risky. <br/>Ukraine knows this, which is why it's long been pleading with the West to supply it with F16 fighter jets. <br/>The US, which makes them, did not give the green light for this until late May, by which time the first, preparatory, phase of Ukraine's offensive was already under way. <br/>Critically for Ukraine, the game-changing F16s may now arrive too late on the battlefield to play a key role in the early phases of this counter-offensive.<br/>This is not to say the Ukrainians will lose. <br/>Time and again they have proved themselves agile, resourceful and inventive. They successfully drove the Russian army out of Kherson by hitting their rear-area logistics hubs to the point where the Russians could no longer resupply their troops in that southern city. <br/>Equipped with long-range weapons like Britain's Storm Shadow cruise missile, Ukraine will be attempting to do the same now. <br/>But amidst all the claim and counter-claim of a propaganda war, it may yet be weeks or even months before we get a clearer picture of who is likely to ultimately prevail in this war."}, {"_id": "6489ffe551ac3319f5477dc6", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65886246?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Silvio Berlusconi's big footprint in Europe", "lead": "The three-time prime minister leaves an indelible stamp on his country and on the European continent as a whole.", "author": "By Katya Adler", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:01.283475", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/129C3/production/_130072267_gettyimages-108499839.jpg", "body": "Flamboyant, controversial Silvio Berlusconi - a four-time prime minister and a key coalition partner in Italy's current government - was envied and admired, loathed and derided in equal measure for many, many years.<br/>Nicknamed Il Cavaliere - the Knight - he will not easily be forgotten at home. And he leaves an indelible Berlusconi-shaped stamp on European politics too. <br/>I followed his political career from the start - later as a journalist but firstly as a student - writing a university dissertation entitled \"Il cammino inarrestabile di Silvio Berlusconi - The unstoppable rise of Silvio Berlusconi\" after he won his first election back in 1994. <br/>Berlusconi quite simply set off a political earthquake in Europe that year - the aftershocks of which will still reverberate long after his state funeral on Wednesday.<br/>It seemed revolutionary back in the 1990s to have a business tycoon, former cruise ship crooner and generally screamingly obvious non-career politician at the helm of important EU and Nato military alliance member Italy.<br/>That was a time of political deepening of the European project focused in Brussels, but Silvio Berlusconi pushed a more nationalist, \"Italy First\" type of narrative. <br/>I was informed by someone in the room that he once told EU leaders at a summit they should speak more about women and football instead.<br/>At home, Berlusconi jumped into coalition government with the post-fascist far-right - until then a taboo in post-war Italy - rendering them more socially acceptable as a result. <br/>He was intentionally politically incorrect, claiming to speak the language of \"ordinary people\". He was also unapologetic about using his media empire as an advantage over political opponents. He displayed a blatant disregard for the judiciary too, later attempting to change Italian law to avoid prosecution himself.<br/>Is Berlusconi's political playbook sounding familiar at all?<br/>In many ways, he is the father of modern day populist nationalism in Europe. Ingredients of his political cocktail are evident in numerous ambitious right-leaning politicians and political movements across the continent.<br/>Think: Hungary's Victor Orban - who publicly mourned Mr Berlusconi's death on Monday, as well as more than one Austrian government, Marine Le Pen of France, and more.<br/>You could also draw parallels further afield - with former US President Donald Trump, for example, whom Mr Berlusconi admired.<br/>He had a penchant for strongmen politicians, such as Vladimir Putin, who he was great friends with. He is even said to have gifted the Russian leader with a duvet cover festooned with both men's faces. On hearing of Mr Berlusconi's death on Monday, President Putin described him as a \"dear person, a true friend\". <br/>A stark contrast to his often spiky relationship with Italy's traditional friends, Germany and France.<br/>That closeness to Moscow worried Italy's allies, especially after the invasion of Ukraine, when Mr Berlusconi was back in coalition government.<br/>In Brussels, at the European Union headquarters, he was widely viewed with derision and disdain.<br/>Despite the rhetoric, hyperbole and almost relentless optimist political shtick - even when Italy was hit by the 2008 economic crisis - Berlusconi failed to improve his country's fortunes or even radically change Italy.<br/>Instead, the real change he brought about was influencing and emboldening a new generation of ambitious politicians in the wider European political arena."}, {"_id": "6489ffe551ac3319f5477dc7", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65891543?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "John Fru Ndi obituary: Cameroon's brave champion of democracy", "lead": "John Fru Ndi became a hero to many in the 1990s for his bravery at taking on the one-party state.", "author": "By Randy Joe Sa'ah", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:01.552016", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/77E9/production/_130079603_gettyimages-71701536_afp976.jpg", "body": "John Fru Ndi, the man regarded as Cameroon's champion of democracy, has died at the age of 81.<br/>He became a hero to many in the 1990s for his bravery at taking on the one-party state that brutally dealt with those challenging its rule.<br/>A former bookseller and a great orator from the English-speaking area of Cameroon, he founded the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) in 1990.<br/>His popularity led the regime to accept a multi-party system was inevitable.<br/>In fact his party believed he won the 1992 presidential election, but the Supreme Court judge that heard its petition alleging fraud said his \"hands were tied\" - and let the official results granting victory to incumbent Paul Biya, with 40% of the vote, stand.<br/>This caused great upset with SDF supporters and their leader was put under house arrest for three months in his home in the economic hub, Bamenda, and a state of emergency was declared.<br/>Still the US must have given credence to his claim to the presidency, inviting him and his wife to the inauguration of Bill Clinton in January 1993. <br/>Fru Ndi was not a supporter of the secessionist rebellion in Anglophone Cameroon that has claimed tens of thousands of lives over the last six years - and was even kidnapped and beaten up by militants in 2019, and part of his house was burnt down.<br/>They were angered by what they saw as his betrayal for not supporting their demand for an independent state of Ambazonia, as they call Cameroon's two English-speaking areas - the North-West and South-West regions.<br/>Fru Ndi, popularly known as \"The Chairman\" after he launched the SDF, while always campaigning for the rights of English-speaking minority who felt marginalised by the country's French-speaking majority, wanted a federal, unified Cameroon.<br/>He favoured economic tactics, known as \"ghost towns\", when huge swathes of the country would effectively go on strike, or street protests to make his case to the authorities.<br/>His campaign rallies were always big events - pulling huge crowds across the country, not just in Anglophone areas.<br/>They were regarded as great entertainment and a rare opportunity to hear someone seeming to speak truth to power.<br/>A man of the people, he knew his audience and tended to speak in Pidgin English. They loved his jokes and gutsy performances, saying the SDF actually meant \"Suffer Don Finish\" in Pidgin, reflecting that under his leadership suffering would end.<br/>He would raise his fist to shout \"SDF\" to the crowd, who would chant back en masse: \"Power to the people!\" This call and response was repeated until the third time when they would roar back: \"Power to the people and equal opportunities!\"<br/>Fru Ndi was born in the village of Baba II, near Bamenda, in 1941, when the area was administered by British colonialists.<br/>As a child he had ambitions to be a pilot and his family decided to send him to Nigeria to stay with relatives to finish his schooling aged about 16.<br/>But he played truant from his studies, ending up making a living by doing odd jobs, only returning to Cameroon several years after independence in 1961, when the former British and French parts of Cameroon had unified. <br/>His family felt, with Nigeria's political upheavals, he was better off back home, fearing he might want to become involved in the civil war that had broken out there.<br/>Starting off as a small-time street vendor, he became a successful businessman, setting up the Ebibi Bookshops, with branches in Bamenda and Mamfe.<br/>He also made a name for himself on the football pitch, becoming goalkeeper for PWD Bamenda FC.<br/>His self-made bookselling empire - the place to go for all school textbooks as well as other titles - allowed him to purchase farms and become well known for his beef and water melons.<br/>At this time he became involved in local politics, and a member of the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) party.<br/>But he grew frustrated with the one-party system, and inspired by university lecturers and other activists who whispered about forming an opposition party - took their idea and had the courage to run with it.<br/>When he launched the SDF, troops were deployed to Bamenda and opened fire on groups of his supporters, killing six people.<br/>Yet he stood firm and loud in his defiance and the wind of multi-party change sweeping across Africa became a reality for President Biya, a southerner who had been in power since 1982.<br/>The two men only met once despite their long years of political sparring.<br/>Fru Ndi's grassroots' appeal and lack of a university education led some in the ruling party to mock him, referring to him as \"The Bookseller\".<br/>He had given up his book chain in the 1990s to concentrate on politics - and stood in other elections.<br/>One of his great failings is, perhaps, after having managed at one time to unite other opposition parties into a coalition, he failed to get them to agree to field a single candidate to take on Mr Biya.<br/>Over the last three decades Mr Biya has always been able to dominate because of the fractured opposition.<br/>The SDF also accused the authorities of constant harassment, blocking roads to rallies and putting other obstacles in their way - and more recently using internet shutdowns.<br/>Several months after losing the 2004 presidential election, Fru Ndi's second wife Rose died. They had had several children together in a marriage that lasted more than 25 years - and after her death he also became involved in charity work, setting up a foundation in her name. <br/>His first wife Susan had tragically died giving birth in 1973.<br/>Latterly Fru Ndi was accused by some in the SDF of dominating the party, and squashing other voices. <br/>There have been undignified court battles over high-profile expulsions from the party, but just before his death Fru Ndi said he would be stepping down as SDF chairman at a party conference scheduled for next month.<br/>Over the last few years he had occasionally sought medical treatment abroad, coming back from his most recent trip 10 days ago. <br/>He died at his home in the capital, Yaound\u00e9, where he had had to relocate because of the insecurity in Bamenda - a great sadness to him.<br/>But he said he had no real regrets, telling state TV recently: \"I have lived a full life.

In theory, we have a constitution, but in reality, we're not observing our constitution.\"<br/>At the same time, support for armed confrontation is highest amongst under 30-year-olds, with over 56% supporting a return to an intifada, or uprising, against Israel, according to the most recent poll in March. <br/>In the past year, numerous new militant groups have sprung up in the northern West Bank towns of Nablus and Jenin, challenging the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority's security forces.<br/>The most well-known are the Lions' Den and the Jenin Brigades, which have carried out attacks in the West Bank against Israeli forces and settlers.<br/>We join the Jenin Brigades at 02:00 one night as they carry out training exercises in the labyrinthine streets of the Jenin refugee camp. <br/>Each member is armed with an M16 assault rifle and dressed head to toe in black as they silently make their way in a single line formation. Their guns point forward scanning alleys and rooftops as they move. <br/>Mostly men in their 20s, these fighters claim to be independent of major militant groups and have publicly rejected links to political parties in the Palestinian territories. <br/>One of the fighters, Mujahed, 28, tells us that his generation is not represented by the current leadership. <br/>\"The youth of Palestine have lost hope with the political methods of the past 30 years,\" he says. <br/>Does he support violence as a solution? <br/>\"This occupation enters here daily and kills in cold blood, in broad daylight,\" he says, referring to Israeli forces. \"This occupation only understands the language of force.\"  <br/>In the absence of a general or presidential election, the student elections in universities are a barometer of the political temperature. Birzeit University in the West Bank and its student elections are widely regarded as a reflection of the political mood in the territories. <br/>The change of sentiments is evident here too. The student Fatah party, the youth wing of the dominant party in the Palestinian Authority, has always held out against opposition Islamist parties, including Fatah's main rival Hamas. But that changed last year.<br/>\"It was a shock,\" explains Mustafa, a student representative for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine party that also stood in the 2022 student elections. <br/>\"Usually, the difference between Fatah and the Hamas factions is one or two seats. This time it was 10 for Hamas.\"<br/>The unprecedented landslide win for Hamas in these student elections is largely seen as a protest against the Palestinian Authority, a feat which was repeated last month, albeit with a slightly reduced majority. <br/>\"Of course, if there were general elections, they would yield the same results as the ones in Birzeit,\" Mustafa continues, \"because people are fed up with the way the Palestinian Authority is dealing with things, whether it is political detentions, taxes, killings or the smothering of freedom of expression\".<br/>For many who have grown up with no voice in the future of the Palestinian territories, it has raised questions about identity. <br/>Majd Nasrallah works as a curator at the Qattan Foundation, an independent organisation working in culture and education. He is based in the West Bank city of Ramallah but was born in the town of Qanalsuwa, in central Israel.<br/>Palestinian citizens make up 20% of Israel's population and like many in his generation he prefers to identify as \"from '48\" - a term that describes Palestinians who remained in the land which became Israel following its creation in 1948. As a result, he finds himself excluded from Palestinian society. <br/>\"I'm not recognised as part of the Palestinian system in the West Bank,\" Majd continues. \"I'm not supposed to vote [in Palestinian elections]. Actually, according to Israeli law, I'm not even supposed to be here [in Ramallah].\" <br/>Israeli law prohibits citizens from travelling to Palestinian areas in the West Bank for security reasons.<br/>Without a voice in the Palestinian political process, Majd also has no faith in the two-state solution.<br/>\"The two-state solution is really a corpse of a political project that is usually used as a fig leaf for the continued oppression of Palestinians,\" he says.<br/>\"It's not about a state, if you ask me. A five-year-old can take a look at the map and tell you that this doesn't work.\" <br/>The future of a two-state solution is in question if a generation who have most at stake in it are increasingly rejecting it as a viable option. <br/>I ask Majd what he could imagine hoping for.<br/>\"For the longest time, I was an advocate for the 'one democratic state' solution [encompassing Israel and the Palestinian territories],\" he says. \"Over at least the last decade, there have been so many attempts to voice our discontent with this current form of governance, which have been completely repressed. I can say with a full heart, the PA does not represent the voice of not only my generation, but Palestinians at large.\"<br/>The Palestinian Authority did not respond to a request for a reply to issues raised in this article.

If there is no outright winner in the presidential contest, a run-off will be held six weeks later, on 2 October.<br/>The final list of candidates has not yet been confirmed.<br/>In the last election, in 2018, 23 people ran for president, but this time that number is likely to be lower after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission raised the nomination fee to $20,000 (\u00a316,000) from $1,000 (\u00a3800).<br/>There are likely to be two main candidates:<br/>Mr Mnangagwa, 80, has led Zimbabwe since the military forced Robert Mugabe to resign in 2017, and then won a disputed election a year later. He was a long-time ally of Mugabe before the pair fell out.<br/>Mr Chamisa, 45, came second in 2018, winning 44% of the vote. A 2020 court ruling stripped him of the leadership of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and he subsequently lost access to party assets and state funding. <br/>He formed the CCC in 2022, remains hugely popular in urban areas and is the main face of the opposition. <br/>Other contenders include Saviour Kasukuwere - an exiled former Mugabe ally, Douglas Mwonzora, the MDC's new leader, businesswoman Elisabeth Valerio, whose United Zimbabwe Alliance Party was launched in March 2022, and US-based businessman Robert Chapman - however the chances of any of them winning are slim. <br/>Nomination courts on 21 June will confirm final candidates for all the elections.<br/>Zanu-PF has the advantage of incumbency, state power and access to state resources. The party, which has been in power since independence in 1980, also retains strong support in rural areas.<br/>However with the economy in such a mess, many people, especially those in urban areas and the youth, think it is time for a change. <br/>Rural voters normally turn out in huge numbers, unlike urban and youth voters, which could work against the opposition. The government has also refused to allow Zimbabweans living abroad to vote - which could also work against Mr Chamisa. <br/>Polling so far has predicted different results, so it is hard to use that as a guide as to who may end up president.<br/>Furthermore, human rights activists say that in the past Zanu-PF has used various tactics to stay in power, including violence and intimidation, state-media blackouts and negative coverage of the opposition. Zanu-PF has previously denied using dirty tricks against its opponents.<br/>The cost-of-living crisis continues to be at the core of voters' concerns, with the last three years having been some of the worst in a decade. In the 12 months leading up to May this year, prices rose by 86.5%, one of the highest annual inflation rates in the world. <br/>Meanwhile, businesses are struggling to cope with crippling power outages and an unstable local currency, which lost 86% of its value between January and early June. <br/>Allegations of corruption also remain a source of frustration, with a very low rate of prosecution. During the Covid pandemic, equipment was allegedly procured at inflated prices - the health minister was fired but then exonerated by the courts. <br/>For members of parliament and council candidates, the election is won on a first-past-the-post basis - in other words the person who has the most votes. <br/>In the presidential race, however, a candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to be declared the winner, otherwise there will be a run-off election between the top two.  <br/>By law the presidential election results must be announced within five days after voting ends.  <br/>Civil society groups and the opposition doubt that polls will be free or fair. They cite what they say has been a systemic crackdown on government critics. <br/>The arrests and convictions of opposition figures and government critics has intensified over the last two years. <br/>The electoral reforms that the opposition have demanded for years - to level the playing field, provide access to public media and remove ex-military personnel from the electoral body - have not happened. <br/>CCC leader Mr Chamisa says more than 60 of the party's meetings were banned, or disrupted by police during by-elections last year, prompting fears it will happen again. <br/>As former Zimbabwean politician Jonathan Moyo put it, Zanu-PF will not \"reform itself out of power\".<br/>This will be the second time Mr Mnangagwa and Mr Chamisa face each other. <br/>Five years ago, the president won in the first round with 50.8% of the vote, but violence followed polling day in which six people were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters. <br/>Observers generally commended the freedom of movement during the campaign period and relative peace on voting day, but the EU for example noted major shortcomings including state resources being misused in favour of the incumbent. <br/>The EU said the final results as announced by the Electoral Commission contained numerous errors. <br/>Mr Chamisa's party failed in its legal challenge to have the result overturned after arguing that the presidential and parliamentary vote tallies were off by tens of thousands."}, {"_id": "6489ffe851ac3319f5477dca", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64230040?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "How Trump, Biden and Clinton secret files cases compare", "lead": "There are some key differences between the four cases, which centre on the handling of secret material.", "author": "By Anthony Zurcher", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:04.475939", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14BFA/production/_130068948_clinton_phone976getty.jpg", "body": "Four people serving at the very top of the US government - Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence - appear to have mishandled classified materials.

The US Department of Justice told him recently they are not pursuing charges.<br/>Those three discoveries were within a few months of each but the classified material saga concerning Hillary Clinton goes back a few years.<br/>She used a personal email address while working as secretary of state from 2009-13 under President Barack Obama.

He was arraigned in April in New York on charges that he falsified business records for a 2016 hush-money payment to a porn star. But that is a state-level case and much less serious than the one he is now facing.<br/>Florida officials are bracing for protests from supporters and opponents. <br/>The former president spent Monday night at the Trump National Doral, a hotel and resort in the Miami area.<br/>Accompanied by Secret Service officers, he is expected to travel in a motorcade from the hotel to the Wilkie D Ferguson court, where his arraignment is scheduled for around 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT). The court is about 11 miles (18km) from the hotel. <br/>The entire hearing is set to last about an hour, after which Trump will fly back to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on board his plane, Trump Force One.<br/>He is scheduled to give remarks there at 20:15 (00:15 GMT), shortly after landing.  <br/>Mr Trump will have the charges read to him, and he is expected to enter a plea of not guilty. <br/>One of his lawyers, Alina Habba - who is not representing him in this case - told Fox News the former president will \"never admit guilt\".<br/>The judge is expected to release the former president \"on his own recognizance\", meaning he will be freed without having to pay a bail bond, to return to court at a later date. <br/>Various procedural issues are likely to be addressed, although it is thought unlikely that a trial date will be set. <br/>Mr Trump will not be subjected to the humiliation of a booking photo. <br/>But fingerprints and a DNA swab are expected to be taken from him, a requirement of all defendants in the federal court system, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. <br/>At his earlier court appearance to face state charges in New York in April, Mr Trump was only fingerprinted. <br/>The US public is unlikely to see Mr Trump during the court appearance, as cameras are not permitted in federal courts. <br/>The initial stages of this case have been assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, whom Mr Trump appointed in 2020 while he was president.<br/>Last summer Judge Cannon granted a request by Mr Trump's legal team to grant a review of the files at the centre of this case. An appeals court later overturned her decision. <br/>The 42-year-old, who was born in Colombia and now resides in Florida, is a graduate of Duke University and The University of Michigan Law School, where she was an articles editor for the school's Journal of Law Reform publication.<br/>Dozens of his supporters gathered outside his hotel on Monday, to greet his arrival and express their support. The BBC's Nomia Iqbal, who was also there, said some carried huge flags and there were cars and motorbikes bearing Trump slogans.<br/>Security will be extremely tight in and around the court. Miami Police Chief Manuel Morales said on Monday they would deploy enough resources to handle a crowd of up to 50,000 people if necessary and ensure Miami is kept \"safe and secure\". <br/>Mr Trump is expected to enter the building through an underground tunnel, avoiding both the anticipated crowds of supporters and counter-demonstrators and the media outside.<br/>In an interview on WABC radio after the indictment, Mr Trump urged supporters to demonstrate. <br/>\"Look, our country has to protest,\" he said. \"We have plenty of protest to protest. We've lost everything.\" <br/>A number of other Trump supporters have also called for demonstrations. Former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake vowed that prosecutors would have to \"go through me, and 75 million Americans just like me\".<br/>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said on Monday that the city would facilitate any protests. <br/>\"But we also believe in law and order,\" he added, \"and we know that and we hope that tomorrow will be peaceful.\" "}, {"_id": "6489ffe951ac3319f5477dcc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65875898?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Donald Trump is 'toast' if indictment correct, William Barr says", "lead": "The ex-attorney general criticises Mr Trump after he was charged with mishandling classified files.", "author": "By Gareth Evans", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:05.333654", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E4E/production/_130064002_gettyimages-1184758255.jpg", "body": "William Barr, the former US attorney general who served under Donald Trump, has said the ex-president is \"toast\" if allegations he mishandled classified documents are proven to be true.<br/>Mr Barr criticised his former boss and said he had no right to keep the files allegedly found at his home.<br/>Mr Trump will appear in court in Miami on Tuesday to face dozens of charges accusing him of illegally retaining classified information.<br/>He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.<br/>Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Mr Barr, who was Mr Trump's attorney general from February 2019 until December 2020, defended the 37-count indictment made public by Special Counsel Jack Smith on Friday.<br/>\"I was shocked by the degree of sensitivity of these documents and how many there were... and I think the counts under the Espionage Act that he wilfully retained those documents are solid counts,\" he said.<br/>\"If even half of it is true, then he's toast.

He was allegedly told to conceal them from Mr Trump's attorney and the FBI.<br/>Prosecutors have said Mr Nauta can be seen on surveillance video removing the boxes from the storage room ahead of an imminent search of the Palm Beach property, and later moving some of them back - one of at least five times he moved boxes in and out of the room.<br/>They further allege that, in a May 2022 interview with the FBI, Mr Nauta lied that he did not know how the boxes had arrived on site, where they were being stored or whether Mr Trump had intentionally kept any.<br/>On his Truth Social platform on Friday, the former president defended Mr Nauta and accused officials at the US Department of Justice of \"trying to destroy his life\" and \"hoping that he will say bad things about 'Trump'\". <br/>Born in Agat, in the US territory of Guam, Waltine Torre Nauta enlisted in the US Navy in 2001.<br/>Navy records show he ascended through the ranks to become a Senior Chief Culinary Specialist, in 2021.<br/>By then, he had been serving in the military-staffed cafeteria for the Trump White House.<br/>The president later elevated him to a role as his military aide, a position similar to a personal valet and sometimes referred to as a \"body-man\".<br/>Mr Nauta retired from the Navy when Mr Trump left the White House. According to the indictment, he became an executive assistant to Mr Trump in August 2021.<br/>Unlike other aides, who sought to remain in Washington DC after Mr Trump lost the 2020 election, Mr Nauta relocated to Florida and continued to serve as an aide to the former president at Mar-a-Lago. <br/>He has been described as a low-key but constant presence in the Trump White House, and a trusted, well-liked aide in Mr Trump's post-presidential orbit.<br/>The New York Times reported that Mr Nauta is viewed as a Trump loyalist and does not appear to be playing a \"side game\" in exchange for prosecutorial leniency.<br/>When the BBC contacted some of Mr Nauta's relatives in Guam about the charges, they seemed stunned by the news. <br/>Reached by social media on Monday, his cousin, Lani Nauta, said the family had only just regained electricity after the typhoon that struck the island two weeks ago. <br/>She ended the conversation to call other members of her family and inform them of the indictment. <br/>In an interview with the Washington Post before Mr Nauta was charged, relatives in Guam described him as a \"good boy\" who moved to the United States \"to enjoy his life, not to cause problems\".  <br/>Pauline Torre, his mother, said the fact that her son had been selected to serve the president \"says it all\".  <br/>But his aunt said he did everything \"at the direction of the former president\". <br/>\"All he was instructed was to put the boxes where they were supposed to go,\" Elly Nauta told the Post.<br/>Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty in this case to all the charges against him."}, {"_id": "6489ffea51ac3319f5477dce", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65842845?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Vodafone Three deal to create UK's largest mobile firm", "lead": "The deal is yet to be approved by regulators, which will look at whether it will push up customer prices.", "author": "By Tom Espiner & Vishala Sri-Pathma ", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:06.546095", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/04EA/production/_130085210_phone-gettyimages-1094975398.jpg", "body": "A deal to create the UK's biggest mobile phone operator has been struck by Vodafone and the owner of Three UK.<br/>The firms plan to merge their UK-based operations, giving them around 27 million customers and making it the biggest mobile network in the UK.<br/>The deal is yet to be approved by regulators, which will look at whether it will push up customer prices.<br/>The Vodafone and Three merger will take their combined market share past Virgin Media O2's.<br/>Virgin Media O2 has around 24 million mobile customers while EE, which is owned by BT Group, has 20 million users.<br/>Vodafone and Three UK are the country's third and fourth largest mobile firms.

Consequently, they will buy fewer things which should slow the rate of rising prices.<br/>An increase in interest rates means higher monthly mortgage, credit card and loan payments for some people. But higher rates should benefit savers - if banks pass them on to their customers. <br/>Asked if he was following former chancellor John Major's dictum in 1989 that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working\", Mr Hunt said: \"In the end there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity.\"<br/>The government has no say over interest rates since the Bank of England was granted independence in 1997.<br/>The UK economy expanded in April after shrinking by 0.3% in the previous month. For the three months to April, it grew marginally by 0.1%. <br/>The ONS said strong trade in bars and pubs boosted growth, but added the construction sector had faltered as rising interest rates and mortgage costs made house buyers more cautious.<br/>As interest rates have risen and more people are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals, some lenders have been withdrawing certain mortgages from the market. <br/>First-time buyers are being met with higher rates, leaving some priced out, and renters are also facing higher costs due to landlords selling up.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, HSBC, a major UK mortgage lender, temporarily withdrew new residential mortgages supplied through brokers.<br/>\"Over recent days cost of funds has increased and, like other banks, we have had to reflect that in our mortgage rates,\" an HSBC spokesperson said.<br/>Hiking rates is meant to persuade consumers to spend less - as their cost of borrowing rises or rates on savings accounts increase - giving businesses less scope to raise prices. <br/>But that mechanism may have become less effective over time.<br/>Take mortgages. In the early 2000s, more than seven out of 10 residential mortgages were on variable or tracker rates, immediately impacted by rate hikes. Today, it's 15% of homeowners. Even adding in the 1.8 million who are re-mortgaging this year, means it's still, contrary to a couple of decades ago, the minority of mortgage holders who will be affected. <br/>The impact of rate hikes is less widespread and may be taking longer to filter through.<br/>Equally, banks and building societies have been particularly reluctant to pass on rate hikes to savers this time, as the Bank of England and outraged customers have noted. This may in part reflect savings institutions rebuilding margins after a period of ultra-low interest rates - but gives customers less of an incentive to stash spare cash. <br/>Higher interest rates also should mean businesses have less scope to give workers inflation-matching pay rises than in the past - but a shortage of workers makes this less likely this time. <br/>Even if, as some economists fear, interest rate rises are less effective this time, they remain the main tool for fighting inflation.<br/>Ian Burns, who runs Cameron Homes, a housebuilder in Staffordshire, said people were being \"very cautious\" and were \"taking longer to make decisions\".<br/>\"Over the past three or four weeks, we've seen a slowdown in reservations,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money.<br/>\"We can't just continue to build houses if we don't have customers for them.\"<br/>Stronger-than-expected wage growth for workers in the three months to April has raised the prospect that the Bank could raise rates close to 6% by the end of the year in its bid to reduce inflation.<br/>On Monday, two-year government borrowing costs rose to levels higher than during the aftermath of last September's mini-budget. <br/>When asked if this showed his plan was not working, Mr Hunt said: \"We are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn. The IMF, the international commentators, think the British economy is on the right track.\"<br/>But the New Economics Foundation, a think tank promoting social and economic justice, said the Bank should hold off on raising rates further and wait to see the impact of its previous increases.<br/>Its economist Lukasz Krebel said that while UK wages were rising, they were still not keeping up with inflation, meaning people were poorer in real terms. <br/>He added that rising prices were mainly due to supply side issues, such as worker shortages and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sending energy prices soaring.<br/>\"The UK government and the Bank should look to address underlying weaknesses that expose the UK to such inflation shocks - notably by supporting investment in clean energy and building retrofits to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil gas,\" he said.<br/>Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figures represented \"another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government\".<br/>\"The facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we're lagging behind on the global stage.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Raphael Sheridan"}, {"_id": "6489ffeb51ac3319f5477dd0", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65908054?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Beyonce blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden", "lead": "The frenzy stoked by the start of the singer's world tour is seen driving up prices in Sweden.", "author": "By Natalie Sherman", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:07.068726", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7863/production/_130091803_e1584e8a1d6b251abd128eedb1239c95388ab52a.jpg", "body": "Thought the war in Ukraine or supply chain snarls were to blame for rising prices?

At least one estimate suggests the run could gross almost \u00a32bn by the time it ends in September.<br/>Searches for accommodations in cities on the tour shot up after it was announced, Airbnb reported. Tickets for many concerts sold out within days and prices soared on the resale market. <br/>In the UK, 60,000 people descended on Cardiff, including fans from Lebanon, the US and Australia. Demand for hotel rooms tied to her concert in London was so strong that in one case, some homeless families being housedin a hotel by the local council were reportedly booted to make way for her fans. <br/>The Stockholm concerts, where Beyonce played to a crowd of 46,000 for two nights, reportedly drew fans from around the world - especially the US, where a strong dollar against the krona helped to make tickets in the Nordic country seem a relative steal.<br/>In an email to the Washington Post last month, Visit Stockholm described the boom in tourism to the city as the \"Beyonce effect\" .<br/>Inflation in Sweden peaked at 12.3% in December.

Get in touch.<br/>The rise in the minimum wage had had a \"significant\" impact on the April pay figures, said Andrew Hunter, co-founder of the job search engine Adzuna.<br/>The minimum wage - known as the National Living Wage - rose to \u00a310.42 an hour in April for those aged 23 and over.<br/>\"Nearly two million workers in the UK saw an almost 10% increase in pay this spring,\" Mr Hunter told the BBC's Today programme.<br/>Workers in multiple industries have held strikes since last summer as pay rates fail to keep pace with inflation. But the gap is narrowing as inflation starts to fall. <br/>The Bank of England has warned sharp pay rises are likely to prolong the UK's still-high rates of inflation. The cost of living rose by 8.7% in the year to April, more than four times the Bank's 2% target. <br/>Mr Hunter said: \"Your average worker will be delighted that their pay on average is going up, but that's not necessarily a good thing for inflation.\"<br/>The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, told the House of Lords economic affairs committee that the latest figures on jobs showed the the labour market was \"very tight\".<br/>\"We've had a fall in the supply of labour, which is showing signs of recovering, but very slowly, frankly,\" he said.<br/>\"One of things firms pretty much universally say to me and have been saying to me for a little while, is that they find it so hard to recruit labour in the current market, they are not going to release labour.\"<br/>The market interest rate for the UK government to borrow money over two years is now effectively higher than it reached in the aftermath of Liz Truss's mini-budget. It is also the highest level for a decade and a half and now clearly higher than seen for the US government.<br/>The fact that this is not the same market panic as last autumn will come as little respite to many people renewing their mortgages.<br/>All this reflects market expectations that the UK has a specific problem with stubborn and sticky inflation that will require higher interest rates for longer. Some market bets now see a half percentage point rate rise next week, and rates settling closer to 6% than 5% at the end of the year.<br/>There is an important difference to the mini-budget aftermath. The moves are being seen mainly in short-term rates. The real problem last autumn was for longer term 10- and 30-year borrowing, which saw significant moves in yields, the result of a loss of market confidence in the then-government's tax and spend plans. Current rates for such long-term borrowing are still well below that market panic.<br/>Today's move is more like a steady squeeze as the markets come to terms with the idea of the Bank of England keeping rates higher for longer had been expected, and above rates seen in similar economies.<br/>Read more<br/>Figures from the ONS also showed that:<br/>The UK economy is currently struggling to grow as the soaring cost of living and rising interest rates squeeze households. But the jobs market remains resilient.<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"Rising prices are continuing to eat into people's pay cheques - so we must stick to our plan to halve inflation this year to boost living standards.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Family finances are being squeezed to breaking point by a further fall in real wages, and record numbers of people are out of work due to long-term sickness.\"<br/>1.

Paigon is slang for enemy. The song is explicit and listener discretion is advised.<br/>In the past, HMRC has closed its telephone line when it could not cope with demand, a public accounts committee report has said. <br/>In the past five years the number of customer service staff has reduced from 25,500 to 19,500 as HMRC has moved more customers to digital systems. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"Our online services, including the HMRC app, are quick and easy to use and have been significantly improved.\"<br/>While the helpline is closed, taxpayers will be redirected to a digital assistant and online guidance. HMRC have said this change will free up 350 advisers to take urgent calls on other lines and answer customer correspondence. <br/>Jonathan Eida, of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be furious to learn that HMRC's self-assessment phone will be off the hook for months this year. <br/>\"Workers trying to do the right thing require assistance all year around, and for many people going online presents a number of challenges. <br/>\"HMRC should reverse this decision and pick up the phone this summer.\"   <br/>You must fill in a self-assessment tax return if in the last tax year you were self-employed as a \"sole trader\" and earned more than \u00a31,000, if you in a business partnership or if you earned \u00a3100,000 or more. <br/>Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Treasury committee, said: \"Given the potentially significant impact closing the self-assessment helpline may have on taxpayers, we're looking for clarification that HMRC has fully considered the costs and benefits of this decision. <br/>\"There are also concerns around the short notice with which this was announced. HMRC must be open, upfront and transparent when making decisions which could impact so many individuals.\" <br/>Ms Baldwin has written to HMRC to ask about the impact the closure will have on taxpayers and whether an analysis and consultation has taken place. <br/>She also wants to know if the helpline will be reopened earlier than planned if the negative impact on taxpayers is greater than expected. <br/>Ms Baldwin also asks if the closure of the helpline is related to HMRC's homeworking policy or staffing issues, as well as for information on the procedures in place to assist vulnerable taxpayers and those unable to use digital services. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"We continually review our services and a seasonal [self-assessment] helpline will make more of our expert advisers available to respond to the most urgent queries over the summer.\"<br/>The self-assessment helpline receives far fewer calls over the summer, with calls around 50% higher between January and April compared with June to August according to HMRC.<br/>HMRC also previously announced a decision to close its VAT registration helpline from Monday 22 May.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government.

However campaigners in favour of the strategy argue that tax revenues could be used to promote healthier eating patterns.<br/>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the government had taken \"firm action\" to tackle unhealthy foods, and would continue to work closely with industry.<br/>\"Our sugar reduction programme has delivered dramatic reductions in the amount of sugar in foods eaten by children - including a 14.9% decrease in the sugar content of breakfast cereals and a 13.5% reduction in the sugar content of yogurts and fromage frais,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.<br/>The government introduced restrictions late last year on where unhealthy foods can be displayed in shops, but delayed new limits on \"volume\" offers such as buy-one-get-one-free, until autumn this year.<br/>A ban on TV advertising of junk food before 21:00 has been pushed back to October 2025 to give the industry more time to prepare for the restrictions.<br/>Henry Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon fast-food chain, appointed as the government's healthy eating \"tsar\", resigned earlier this year, criticising the lack of progress. <br/>His report last year, which recommended measures including taxes on salt and sugar used in processed food, with the revenues used to provide fresh fruit and vegetables to low-income families, was not taken up by the government.<br/>Industry body the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said manufacturers were committed to improving the \"nutritional profile\" of their products, in part by offering a range of portion sizes.

Dozens of other UK companies are thought to be using MOVEit. <br/>The criminals responsible for the hack are linked to the notorious Clop ransomware group, thought to be based in Russia. <br/>They have threatened to begin publishing data of companies that do not email them to begin the negotiations by Wednesday. <br/>BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy said the group is well-known for carrying out its threats and it is likely that organisations will have private data published on the gang's darknet website in the coming weeks.  <br/>He said it is usually the case that if a victim does not appear on Clop's website, they may have secretly paid the group a ransom which could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.<br/>Victims are always encouraged not to pay though as it fuels the growth of this criminal enterprise and there is no guarantee that the hackers will not use the data for secondary attacks.

It is not only anxious homeowners - tenants are worried their landlords, facing higher rates of their own, will put up their rent.<br/>Here are five reasons for the current commotion.<br/>If forecasts were to be believed, we should be seeing a significant slowdown in price rises. The rate of inflation shows the pace at which prices are going up, and so charts the rising cost of living.<br/>The latest official data spooked markets and lenders though, as it suggested inflation was going to stay higher for longer than anticipated. It also pointed to a theory that higher prices were becoming more embedded in the UK economy.<br/>The premier, if rather blunt, tool to tackle high inflation is for the Bank of England to put up interest rates. With the benchmark rate now expected to peak at 5.5%, rather than the current 4.5%, the cost to lenders would be greater, and so - in turn - they have put up the interest rate they charge for mortgages.<br/>Mohamed El-Erian, former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and president of Queens' College at Cambridge University, says the blame lies with central banks who suggested high inflation would only be temporary. <br/>\"It turned out inflation was persistent and therefore central banks were late and society as a whole was late to adjust to higher inflation,\" he told the BBC.<br/>Two years ago there was a rush from property buyers as tax concessions from ministers to keep the housing market moving during Covid were wound down.<br/>Lower or zero rates on stamp duty, and the equivalent tax in Scotland and Wales, made \"a hot market even hotter\", according to analysts. The pandemic led many people to reconsider where they lived, and stamp duty cuts made them move more quickly.<br/>Many of those buyers got two-year fixed mortgages, which are now due to expire.<br/>The peak for homeowners rolling off fixed mortgage deals is July to October this year, with more than 400,000 expected to do so, according to figures from the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. <br/>The timing isn't great. The rates being offered for a new deal now are considerably higher than back then. That could add hundreds of pounds to a monthly mortgage repayment.<br/>Anil and Jessica Jhamat, from Solihull, are having to find an extra \u00a3550 a month. They bought their home during the stamp duty holiday, which allowed them to purchase \"a house we wouldn't otherwise have been able to afford\".  <br/>\"We assumed interest rates would stay low, otherwise we'd have taken out a five-year fix,\" Mr Jhamat said. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\"<br/>The pharmacist and his wife, a digital manager, also have to find \u00a31,000 a month in childcare fees for their one-year-old son. \"Where we are now, we've lost what we saved [in stamp duty]. Essentially we're back to square one,\" he said.<br/>A mortgage repayment is the highest monthly outgoing for many people, so decisions over which product to choose are made with lots of thought and advice.<br/>The trouble is lenders are currently withdrawing their mortgage products with hardly any notice. That makes for a frenzied situation.<br/>On Thursday, HSBC gave notice to brokers that it was going to pull its deals four hours later. After being inundated with applications, it withdrew them within three hours, only to then temporarily reopen the channel for applications on Friday. <br/>At times like this, big lenders do not want their deals to be significantly cheaper than their rivals, and they only want as many applications as they can cope with.<br/>Justin Moy, founder at Chelmsford-based mortgage broker EHF Mortgages, said: \"These last-minute communications just add to the stress of the situation. Decisions on rate changes and repricing must give everyone the opportunity to react in a controlled manner, especially when the increases are hefty and make a real difference to a borrower.\"<br/>Homeowners who decide the best thing to do is sit on their hands and wait for things to settle down could face a nasty shock.<br/>When a fixed term comes to an end - usually after two or five years - then a borrower reverts automatically to their lender's standard variable rate (SVR). That rate is higher, which is why most people go on to another fixed deal instead, although not everyone has that option as, for example, they may have missed payments in the past.<br/>Brokers say these SVRs have soared, meaning anyone who adopts a wait and see approach would see a massive jump in the rate they pay, and therefore a much higher monthly mortgage bill.<br/>\"Some lenders have a much higher SVR than others. We tell our clients how important it is to choose a lender that treats its customers fairly when their rates come to an end,\" says Aaron Strutt, of broker Trinity Financial.<br/>Many people have been shocked by the rise in mortgage rates since December 2021, because they had grown so accustomed to ultra-low interest rates for the previous decade or more.<br/>A variety of economic, and pandemic, reasons kept interest rates down - at times at historic lows.<br/>Anyone who has bought a first home during that time would never have faced such a situation as now. Rates have been much higher in previous decades, but people are now borrowing more as house prices have soared.<br/>Lenders tested applicants' finances for their ability to cope with higher rates. That is now more reality than theory, and will lead some people to question whether they stretched themselves too far. Analysts say the availability of jobs, and a relative lack of unemployment, has saved many from having to sell up.<br/>The impact is felt by tenants too. Higher costs for landlords will push up rental prices, and would lead to fewer homes being available to rent if they decide to leave the sector.<br/>Read more here<br/>Additional reporting by Jemma Dempsey"}, {"_id": "6489fff351ac3319f5477dea", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65854595?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "'Selling second-hand clothes online became my full-time job'", "lead": "\"Pre-loved\" clothing is big business and it is not just about saving money and the planet.", "author": "By Dearbail Jordan & Star McFarlane", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:15.549795", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175BA/production/_130047659_isabella.jpg", "body": "Second-hand clothing has come a long way from a rummage-fest in the musty charity shop of old.<br/>Buying and selling \"pre-loved\" clobber is now a huge industry, in part due to online companies - or marketplaces - such as Depop, Vinted and eBay where people can trade clothes.<br/>But there is evidence that some fashionistas are choosing to buy second-hand clothing only, not just for value and environmental reasons, but because they want individual style.  <br/>Isabella Vrana, 26, has made a business out of it. <br/>From a hobby that she started on Depop as a student eight years ago, she has generated sales of \u00a3800,000 and the business is still growing. <br/>It all started because of a \"shopping problem\".<br/>\"I was buying too much for myself basically,\" she says. \"But I was getting it all at really good prices because everything was second hand, so I just decided to start selling those pieces for money and realised that I was making profit off each piece.\" <br/>While her fellow university students were working in pubs or restaurants at the weekend, Ms Vrana - sometimes with the help of her mum - was packaging up vintage clothes for customers and dashing to the post office between lectures.<br/>After failing to get a job as a professional fashion buyer because of a lack of industry experience, Ms Vrana decided to take the plunge and move into selling second-hand clothing full-time.<br/>It was scary, she admits. \"At the time I was thinking, 'I just want a boss and a pay cheque and holiday and sick pay.'\"<br/>But she says: \"Actually I'm really glad I just sort of went for it because I love being self-employed.\" <br/>Ms Vrana now employs three people and has a shipping container/warehouse as well as two studios where clothes are shipped, sorted, photographed and sent out to customers who access her business through Depop. <br/>She also recently set up a wholesale business to sell vintage clothes to other online firms as well as hosting pop-up shops in New York, Dublin and Copenhagen. And she sells her own Isabella Vrana label.<br/>Over her eight years in the business, Ms Vrana says she has seen huge changes in demand for second-hand clothes. <br/>\"It wasn't such a normal thing when I started so I've definitely seen an increase in people buying second hand to try and be more sustainable,\" she says.<br/>Plus there's the quality of well-made vintage clothes. \"These items are lasting decades and they're being worn as well. Take a vintage pair of jeans - I've got jeans with dry cleaning labels from the 1990s and they're still going so strong,\" she says.<br/>\"I think people are realising that you might be investing a bit more of an upfront cost, but then it is really paying off long-term.\"<br/>Adam Jay, marketplace chief executive at the clothing resell app Vinted, says the growth in demand for second-hand clothing as been \"phenomenal\".<br/>Vinted now has over eight million registered members in the UK, up from 1.2 million in 2021.<br/>There are the obvious reasons why people are attracted to second-hand clothing. <br/>Buying new clothes and footwear can be expensive at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living. <br/>The rate at which prices are rising for clothing and shoes hit 6.5% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.   <br/>Meanwhile, the fashion industry is responsible for generating between 8-10% of global emissions, according to the United Nations, from growing cotton to using oil to create synthetic materials such as polyester.<br/>But for fashion and sustainability vlogger Rosie Okotcha \"thrifted fashion is very cool now because its my personal style, no-one else can get it\".<br/>She credits TikTok and Instagram with driving the trend for second-hand clothing, in particular with \"Gen Z\" shoppers - that's people who were born in between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s.<br/>That is reflected in the sort of styles people are buying. <br/>According to Depop, \"Y2K\" is a popular trend on its app including oversized denim, colourful crochet and vintage t-shirts. There's also demand for one-of-a-kind and customised items, as well as clothing that is handmade or reworked from existing pieces.  <br/>But while the internet might be fuelling the trend, there is vintage fashion to be found in the High Street charity shop.<br/>Ms Okotcha says that part of her mission is to try to \"break down the stigma that there is something wrong with shopping second hand because it is actually really fantastic fun and great for the planet\".<br/>While it might seem inevitable that the popularity of apps might have ended up re-routing clothing donations away from the High Street, the Charity Retail Association (CRA) says that's not the case.<br/>Charity shop sales rose by 15.1% between January and March compared with the same three months last year.  <br/>\"There is plenty of second-hand clothing to go around, so we see the growth of online selling platforms as complementary to the work of charity shops,\" says the CRA.<br/>Ms Vrana agrees that there is plenty of room for competition, and she plans to continue.  <br/>\"There's definitely money to be made,\" she says. <br/>\"You can definitely support yourself through doing this full-time, which I'm really grateful for because sometimes it doesn't even feel like a job because I enjoy it so much.\" "}, {"_id": "6489fff351ac3319f5477deb", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65874494?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "George Soros hands reins of $25bn empire to son Alex", "lead": "The American financier, targeted by right-wing conspiracists, is passing control of foundations to his son.", "author": "By Lucy Hooker", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:15.820825", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B046/production/_130062154_fph2fdvwyaegfey.jpg", "body": "US billionaire philanthropist George Soros has handed over the running of his $25bn (\u00a319.9bn) financial and charitable empire to his son Alex.<br/>The Hungarian-born financier said his son had \"earned it\", in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.<br/>Since the 1990s the family's wealth has been directed to support democracy-building in dozens of countries.<br/>But in recent years the 92-year-old former hedge fund manager has become the focus of anti-Semitic conspiracies.<br/>A Soros spokesperson confirmed to the BBC the details of the interview published on Sunday.<br/>George Soros is also one of the largest donors to the US Democratic Party.

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\""}, {"_id": "6489fff451ac3319f5477ded", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65784505?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why Singapore is the only place in the world selling lab-grown meat", "lead": "US-based Eat Just says its product is ethical, clean and green but scientists say it may just be a novelty.", "author": "By Nick Marsh", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:16.865515", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/273E/production/_129964001_labmeatvat3.jpg", "body": "It looks like chicken, it smells like chicken and, what do you know, it tastes like chicken.<br/>You would never guess that the piece of meat in front of me did not come from a farm. It was made in a laboratory on an industrial estate just a few miles down the road.<br/>I'm in Huber's Butchery and Bistro in Singapore, which is the only restaurant in world to have so-called cultivated meat on the menu.<br/>Feedback from customers has been \"phenomenal\", according to the restaurant's owner.<br/>The meat's creator - California-based Eat Just - says it is ethical, clean and green - with no compromise on taste. Billions of dollars are being poured into the industry, but huge question marks hang over its viability as anything beyond a novelty.<br/>Ever since the first lab-grown burger - which cost a mere $330,000 (\u00a3263,400) to create - was unveiled in London in 2013, dozens of companies around the world have joined the race to bring affordable cultivated meat to the market.<br/>So far, only Eat Just has managed to get its product approved for public sale after regulators in Singapore - the only country in the world to allow lab-grown meat to be sold - gave its chicken the green light in December 2020.<br/>But it is still nowhere near being widely available. Cultivated chicken nuggets were briefly on the menu at a private members' club in 2021. <br/>That partnership lasted a few months and this year Huber's has started offering a chicken sandwich and a chicken pasta dish to the general public - albeit only once a week with limited dining slots available.<br/>\"Cultivated meat is real meat, but you don't have to slaughter an animal,\" says Josh Tetrick, chief executive of Eat Just, who spoke to the BBC from San Francisco. \"This way of eating makes sense for the future,\" he says.<br/>Unlike plant-based substitutes, cultivated meat is literally meat. The process involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats.<br/>The cells are allowed to divide and grow, before being placed in a large steel bioreactor, which acts like a fermentation tank.<br/>After four to six weeks, the material is 'harvested' from the bioreactor. Some vegetable protein is added, then it is moulded, cooked and 3-D printed to give it the necessary shape and texture.<br/>The resulting strips of deep fried chicken on my plate of orecchiette pasta certainly tasted like the real deal, if a bit processed. Perhaps the sort of chicken you would eat in a fast-food restaurant.<br/>\"It's meat - it's perfect!\" says Caterina, an Italian student who came here especially to try the cultivated chicken. Normally, for sustainability reasons, she would not eat meat but Caterina says she would eat this.<br/>Her only quibble? Serving the chicken with pasta, which typically does not happen in Italy.<br/>Another diner from Singapore says he was surprised by how much it resembled real meat.<br/>\"It's legit\", he says. \"I wouldn't know where it came from. My only concern would be the cost.\"<br/>The chicken pasta dish I ordered was S$18.50 ($13.70; \u00a311), but that is vastly discounted relative to the current cost of producing the meat. <br/>Eat Just will not say exactly how much it spends on making its cultivated chicken, but at the moment the company's production capacity only yields 2kg (4.4lb) or 3kg per week in Singapore.<br/>When you compare that to the 4,000kg - 5,000kg of conventional chicken sold weekly - at Huber's alone - it gives you a sense of the scale of the task ahead. Put simply, they will need to increase production enormously to avoid making a loss on each piece of chicken.<br/>Eat Just says it has already achieved a 90% reduction in costs since 2018 and the company offered me a tour of its new multi-million dollar production facility in Singapore, which it hopes will open next year.<br/>The pair of shiny steel 1,320 gallon (6,000 litres) bioreactors certainly represent a sign of intent, but in reality they are a tiny fraction of the millions of tonnes of chicken that would need to be produced to match the price of slaughtered chicken.<br/>The industry is urging for patience, but many scientists have already seen enough.<br/>\"The narrative presented by these companies is very strong\", says Ricardo San Martin, co-director of the Alt: Meat Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.<br/>\"But that narrative must be contrasted with the science\", he says. \"Run the numbers, look at every scientific paper written by people who have no skin in the game, and you'll see the answer is clear.\"<br/>\"Can you do this, at scale, at a reasonable cost? No. Can you talk about saving the world with this? Again, no. These companies have to be honest - it's wishful thinking\", he says.<br/>Not only are there doubts about scaling up production, there is also uncertainty over the industry's green credentials, which have been questioned by scientists.<br/>In theory, reducing the world's reliance on land and livestock for meat production should reduce carbon emissions, but at the moment the advanced technology needed to create cultivated meat is so energy intensive that it cancels out any benefits. <br/>One study by the University of California, Davis even estimated that the process produces between 4 and 25 times as much carbon dioxide as regular beef. However, East Just has called the study \"flawed\".<br/>When asked by the BBC whether the whole project might end in failure, Josh Tetrick from Eat Just replied: \"For sure\".<br/>But he remains undeterred: \"Making meat in this way is both necessary and highly uncertain,\" he says.<br/>\"It's not straightforward. It's complicated. It's not guaranteed and it might not work out. But the other option for us is not to do anything. So we decided to take a bet and go for it.\"<br/>Plenty of investors have decided to make that same bet. As of this year, an estimated $2.8bn has been spent on developing cultivated meat.<br/>However, if cultivated meat is to become anything more than a niche alternative for the well-off in the developed world, then relying on investments from private businesses may not be enough.<br/>Governments, Mr Tetrick says, are going to need to put \"significant public money\" into cultivated meat for it to rival conventionally slaughtered meat. <br/>\"This is like the transition to renewable energy... It's a lifetime project - maybe a multiple lifetimes project,\" he says.<br/>At the moment though no country outside Singapore has authorised the sale of cultivated meat, let alone committed to serious investment.<br/>According to Ricardo San Martin from UC Berkeley, both private and public funding for cultivated meat companies will dry up if they do not \"look in the mirror\" soon and present realistic forecasts to investors.<br/>\"Unless there is a clear path to success at some point in the future, investors and governments will not want to spend money on something that is not scientifically proven\"."}, {"_id": "6489fff551ac3319f5477dee", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65669537?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why millions of usable hard drives are being destroyed", "lead": "It is estimated that 90% of hard drives are destroyed.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman."}, {"_id": "6489fff551ac3319f5477def", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-65411505?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Scotland", "subCategories": "Scotland Politics,Scotland Business,Edinburgh, Fife & East,Glasgow & West,Highlands & Islands,NE, Orkney & Shetland,South,Tayside & Central", "title": "Susannah Dale: I want to help keep mothers in the workplace", "lead": "Susannah Dale is urging firms to sign a \"maternity pledge\", to support pregnant staff and new mums.", "author": "By Magnus Bennett", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:17.702558", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17407/production/_129993259_susannah_dale.jpg", "body": "When Susannah Dale had her first child five years ago, she found herself struggling to cope.<br/>\"Motherhood hit me like a ton of bricks,\" she says. \"I struggled with bonding, with breastfeeding, with the monotony of the early days.\"<br/>She says it took three years and a second child before she had counselling.<br/>It helped and led her to look for answers about why she had struggled with the transition to motherhood.<br/>Susannah began talking to mothers and trawling through the internet to find out what impact motherhood was having on women, particularly on their careers.<br/>It ultimately led her to create a social enterprise that encourages companies across the UK to make workplaces as supportive as possible for pregnant employees and new mothers. <br/>Susannah's interest had been piqued by research from the Equality and Human Rights Commission which suggested at least 54,000 women a year were being pushed out of the UK workforce after becoming pregnant.<br/>Other areas of concern emerged for her, including a survey by HR tech firm Culture Shift which indicated that a quarter of expectant mothers feared \"negativity\" from colleagues and managers if they revealed they were pregnant.<br/>Susannah was also to stumble upon the concept of \"matrescence\", a term coined 50 years ago by anthropologist Dana Raphael to describe the complex and transformational process of becoming a mother.<br/>\"Simply put, matrescence means the physical, psychological and emotional changes you go through after the birth of your child,\" she says. <br/>\"This is tricky enough to navigate on its own, but can be even more stress-inducing when you add in the anxiety about going on, and returning from, maternity leave.\"<br/>For the past few months, Glasgow-based Susannah has been asking companies to commit to a series of wellbeing steps that go well beyond statutory requirements for maternity leave.<br/>More than a dozen UK firms - varying in size from under 20 employees to 200 - have already signed the pledge, which is divided into five \"pillars\".<br/>They include creating a maternity leave and return to work plan for employees and helping them \"maintain an emotional connection with the workplace so they do not feel anxious about being on maternity leave and their subsequent return to work\".<br/>Susannah believes current maternity leave practices often fall short of where they should be.<br/>She says: \"Although there are laws in place, the statistics and stories show that the measures currently in place to protect jobs and provide financial support are not working as well as they could as they're not reflective of the society we live in, what mothers want and the profound experience of motherhood.<br/>\"Our aim with the Maternity Pledge is to help keep mothers in the workplace if they want to be and through that we hope to see more women in leadership roles.\"<br/>Pregnant employees of firms that sign up are also given a \"matrescence pack\", which Susannah says covers \"the parts of motherhood which tend to be glossed over in pregnancy but can affect mental health\". <br/>It addresses issues such as breastfeeding problems and the affect of matrescence on relationships with partners.<br/>Companies already signed up to the pledge seem to be fully on board with its goals.<br/>Colchester-based PR company founder Megan Dorian says she is glad to be part of the project.<br/>\"When I launched Orange PR and Marketing when my first-born daughter was just over a year, I knew a priority for the business was to create an inclusive culture that not only supported but embraced parents in their journey,\" she says. <br/>\"There is still a stigma around women taking a career 'break' - it's certainly not a break - to have a baby and then return to work, and I am a big advocate for breaking this down.\"<br/>Another supporter is London-based Jenny Jones, chief operating officer of advisory, legal and accountancy firm Dragon Argent.<br/>\"Becoming a mother was the hardest transition I've ever had to make,\" she says. <br/>\"Going from being confident in your job and your life in general to being at home looking after a very small, fragile person 24/7 was tricky to say the least.  <br/>\"Supporting all our present and future parents through the often unspoken challenges of balancing parenthood and careers matters to us, which is why we signed The Maternity Pledge.\"<br/>Susannah says everyone benefits if companies support new mothers' return to work with as much flexibility and care for their wellbeing as possible.<br/>\"Maternity leave can work better for businesses and mothers if communication, support and empathy is improved,\" she says.<br/>\"Most women want to work -

If I have to give up being a blacksmith, then I will,\" the 39-year-old says.<br/>The craftsman is not alone. Many are facing similar financial dilemmas as they contemplate rising mortgage costs. <br/>The Bank of England has been steadily raising interest rates for the last year and a half, as it tries to tackle soaring prices. <br/>After figures last week showed inflation not coming down as quickly as expected, many now predict the central bank will continue to raise rates from their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5%.<br/>That in turn had an immediate impact on the mortgage market. Lenders began raising their rates. According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 5.49% and the average five-year fixed is currently 5.17%.<br/>And within a week hundreds of mortgage deals were removed from the market as lenders reassessed their offers.<br/>\"Carnage\" is how Craig Fish from Lodestone brokers in London described the situation. <br/>\"I'm currently on hold to NatWest - 30 minutes and counting - to discuss a possible new mortgage as they have just announced they are withdrawing rates at 10.30pm tonight. Do the lenders think the future is this uncertain?\" he said earlier this week.<br/>Jo Wilder, 28, works for Cardiff Council and pays \u00a3700 a month for a studio apartment she has been renting for the past 18 months. She now wants to buy her own home - a process that is taking longer than she hopes, as she watches rates rise. <br/>Despite having a healthy 20% deposit and a mortgage in principle, she says there are \"not really any properties on the market\".<br/>Repayments on a three-year fixed-rate deal at 4.5% would be between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 but she is worried about interest rates going up.<br/>\"It's not ideal. I'm just going to have to wait it out and hope rates come down. It really is very stressful,\" she says.<br/>Jo had hoped getting her own place would mean a drop in monthly outgoings but with rising food prices she no longer thinks that will be the case.<br/>\"It is disheartening,\" she adds. \"The way things are going I think it is actually going to be the same price, which is pretty daunting to be honest.\"<br/>In Bedfordshire, Anthony Jones and his wife have a 14-month-old daughter - they want to upsize and have been trying to sell since last August. <br/>The couple's five-year fixed deal has ended and they are now on a tracker mortgage, leaving them \u00a3200 worse off a month, at a little over \u00a31,200.<br/>\"It's a bit of a nightmare,\" says Anthony. \"We're looking at upsizing and all of a sudden are having to question the affordability of it.\"<br/>The 33-year-old says when they first put their house on the market there had been \"a lot of interest initially, then all of a sudden we had people saying 'our mortgage offer has been pulled' and 'we can't afford it anymore'.\"<br/>The couple have reduced the asking price from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3275,000, but say they cannot accept less because otherwise they will not have the deposit for their second home.<br/>\"Our daughter has grown so quickly, we need a garden and bigger bedrooms and more storage. The lack of space is even causing arguments between me and my partner,\" says Anthony.<br/>Read more here<br/>The upheaval for people going through the application process comes as Bank of England figures this week showed a decline in the number of mortgages being approved. <br/>The number of net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 48,700 in April from 51,500 in March.<br/>Mortgage broker London & Country is now seeing a trend for people fixing for one or two years, rather than the previous most popular five-year term, on the basis that interest rates will have fallen by the time they come to look for their next deal.<br/>Spokesman David Hollingworth says people who are refinancing should start searching for a new product six months before the end of their current deal.<br/>Some may want to consider taking out new mortgages over a longer term - something a lot of first-time buyers do to \"give themselves breathing space\", he says.<br/>If it is a struggle to meet payments on an existing mortgage there is also the option of extending the term, but Mr Hollingworth says this is \"not a move to be taken lightly because it will significantly increase the overall interest bill, by tens of thousands of pounds\".<br/>Are you struggling to get a mortgage or one that's affordable?

He had booked a train on Friday to get to Carlisle ahead of a 600km cycle event. <br/>The train he booked was cancelled, because of the strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which is expected to put a halt to half of Friday's scheduled trains. <br/>He can't depend on getting space for his bike on the trains that are running. So he'll be getting up at 07:00 to drive 300 miles instead.<br/>The leisure industry has protested the loudest about the impact of train strikes. <br/>\"We've seen time and time again that rail strikes put a significant dampener on any sales as visitors are deterred from booking visits or eating and drinking out,\" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said in a statement. <br/>The industry group reckons strikes this week, during the half-term school holiday, will cost the sector \u00a3132m, bringing the total impact on the sector to an \"eye-watering\" \u00a33.25bn.<br/>Having to cancel leisure activities was by far the most frequently mentioned impact of the strikes, according to the most recent study from the Office for National Statistics.  <br/>Businesses that are in stations obviously suffer particularly. The ONS tracks weekly sales from 400 Pret a Manger sandwich shops around the country, and the branches in stations see a noticeable dip in sales on strike weeks.<br/>And retailers were acutely affected by the wave of strikes in the key shopping days ahead of Christmas last year.<br/>But the impact of strikes on people getting to work is relatively limited, the ONS's work suggests. <br/>Only one in 10 people actually travel to work by train, according to a different ONS survey. <br/>And of those who do travel by train, 70% said they could work from home. <br/>The rest could get to work by other means - though not necessarily a 50-mile bike ride - and very few respondents said they couldn't work at all because of the train strike.<br/>Speaking to the BBC, the RMT's assistant general secretary John Leach said: \"We regret the inconvenience caused by industrial action. <br/>\"We would much rather be doing what we do every other day of the year, which is keeping Britain moving, our members coming to work to do that. It's an obvious regret but it's also our responsibility to represent our people, our members, and we will never apologise for doing that.\"<br/>Rail strikes have had much less impact since the signallers and other Network Rail staff agreed a pay deal to end their campaign. When the signallers joined the strikes, up to 90% of trains would be cancelled. <br/>The sector most hurt by the strikes may in fact be the railway industry itself.<br/>Mr Bezant says the strikes, and cancellations caused by engineering works, have shaken his faith in the rail network. <br/>\"I expect that any events I book in the future, I will consider driving. There's not much point trusting the trains. It will change the way I travel,\" he says.<br/>Even if the strikes were resolved tomorrow, he would still be uncertain. \"It has been going on for so long. It will affect me for quite some time I think.\"<br/>He estimates the train journeys he has not made because of strikes add up to around \u00a3700 - lost revenue for an industry that is already in a serious financial condition.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operating companies, reckons the dispute has cost the rail industry around \u00a3580m so far, a sum which increases with every new day of strike action. The bill is ultimately met by the government, which now picks up the tab for any shortfall in ticket sales.  <br/>And Mr Bezant is unlikely to be the only one who will take some time to regain his faith in the railways, even when the disputes are over.<br/>How are you affected by the latest train strikes?

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\""}, {"_id": "6489fff751ac3319f5477df3", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65321487?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The 'exploding' demand for giant heat pumps", "lead": "Whole towns in Europe are being heated by huge, energy efficient heat pumps.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:19.787430", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/042A/production/_129766010_f91b782b-55ab-46ab-9866-7ebe54e08d24.jpg", "body": "There are 2.5 million litres of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. <br/>If for some reason you wanted to bring it from a pleasant 20C to boiling point, German firm MAN Energy Solutions (MAN ES) has a heat pump that could do it. And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\""}, {"_id": "6489fff851ac3319f5477df4", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65640622?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?", "lead": "Linda Yaccarino has started her new post as chief executive of Twitter, a few weeks ahead of schedule.", "author": "By Natalie Sherman", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:20.052040", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18068/production/_129880489_whatsubject.jpg", "body": "Why would anyone want to leave a plum post at one of America's biggest media companies to take a chance leading Twitter, a social media platform with a spotty business record and an infamously mercurial owner?<br/>Enter Linda Yaccarino, a 60-year-old New York native widely respected in the advertising industry, who not only took the job, but started it a few weeks early.<br/>\"She's someone who really likes to be superwoman,\" says marketing veteran Lou Paskalis, who has known Ms Yaccarino for more than two decades, and describes her as fierce, shrewd and ambitious. She would jump at the chance, he says, \"to step in... and say, 'I can fix this'\".<br/>Which begs the question: can she?<br/>Even before billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, the social network had problems.<br/>It has been fiercely criticised, by the left and right, for how it polices misinformation and hate speech, and the business has struggled to break even - making an annual profit just twice since its launch in 2006.<br/>Growth, whether measured by users or the money it brings in, has been bumpy.<br/>Since Mr Musk took over the platform last year, the issues have only gotten worse.<br/>He has cut 75% of its former staff, including teams charged with tracking abuse; changed how the company verifies authentic accounts; and sparked debate with his own tweets spreading conspiracy theories.<br/>Advertisers have left in large numbers and users also appear sceptical. A recent poll by Pew found that six in 10 adults in the US, Twitter's largest base, were taking a break and a quarter said they did not expect to be using the app in a year.<br/>Even Mr Musk has seemed daunted by the challenges, going through with his $44bn purchase last year only under threat of a lawsuit. He has joked that only someone \"foolish\" would want the chief executive title from him.<br/>Ms Yaccarino appears undaunted. <br/>Raised in an Italian-American family, the daughter of a police officer has risen through the ranks of some of the biggest media companies in the US, forging a reputation as a high-heeled and hard-charging executive, who has helped steer entertainment giant NBCUniversal through the upheaval wrought by the growth of the tech giants.<br/>At NBCU, home to brands such as NBC News, Focus Features and Bravo, Ms Yaccarino overhauled the ad sales business, pushed the 2020 launch of its ad-supported streaming platform Peacock, and drove industry-wide debates about data gaps as audiences migrated online. <br/>The mother-of-two, who met her husband Claude Madrazo on a blind date and became a grandmother last year, was known to want some kind of promotion after a decade at NBCU where she was chairman of global advertising and partnerships. <br/>There was widespread speculation about her interest in Twitter, especially after she defended Mr Musk at a conference last year, urging critical advertisers to \"give the guy a minute\". <br/>\"I've long been inspired by your vision to create a brighter future,\" she tweeted after her new post was announced. \"I'm excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!\"<br/>By hiring Ms Yaccarino, Mr Musk has \"purchased trust\" from advertisers, says Mr Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory.<br/>Indeed, industry giant GroupM, who represents brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestle, has already said it sees the platform as less risky.<br/>But repairing Twitter's business will be no small task. <br/>Though big ad buyers are eager to have choices beyond the tech giants, the platform remains too small to be a must-buy, says long-time media analyst Brian Wieser, now principal at consultancy Madison and Wall. <br/>Beyond advertising, she will also face a host of pressing issues: regulatory scrutiny of Twitter's hate speech and privacy controls; lawsuits from landlords, vendors and former staff over unpaid bills; not to mention user complaints and basic tech glitches, like the malfunctions that plagued the high-profile interview with Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis hosted on the platform. <br/>The biggest wild card of all, of course, is Mr Musk, who has said he intends to remain involved at the site, overseeing products and technology. <br/>\"Anybody taking this job has been set up to fail - it's not specific to her,\" Mr Wieser says. \"The question is whether or not the odds are more likely to be in her favour than any alternative. And yeah, actually the odds are more favourable.\"<br/>Friends and former colleagues say they expect Ms Yaccarino to use her background in television to improve the platform's ad business and expand the use of video across the site. <br/>She has called Mr Musk's vision of Twitter as a starting point for an \"the everything app\", offering messages, payments and other functions a \"great opportunity\" for advertisers.<br/>\"[She has] the guts and the courage to take big swings,\" says Jacqueline Corbelli, founder and chief executive of Brightline, a tech company focused on streaming adverts, which has partnered with NBCU. <br/>\"If Twitter gives her the space to do it, she will bring the ability to integrate what's been successful in the past and blend that with what advertisers are going to be looking for to regain trust in Twitter.\"<br/>Whether Ms Yaccarino will have room to run remains a big if.<br/>Some commentators have already suggested she is poised to encounter the \"glass cliff\" - a phenomenon in which women reach positions of power only at the riskiest moments.<br/>\"As someone used to wearing 4 inch heels, let's be crystal clear: I don't teeter,\" Ms Yaccarino shot back on Twitter recently, in response to such analysis.<br/>At an industry conference before her appointment, Ms Yaccarino, whose politics have been described as conservative but not ideological, pressed Mr Musk to explain what Twitter's \"freedom of speech, not freedom of reach\" meant and how it differed from rules at other companies.  <br/>She also asked Mr Musk if he would curb his own tweeting, although she got little firm commitment, at least publicly, in response. <br/>\"I'll say what I want even if it costs me money,\" he told CNBC recently.<br/>Friends say Ms Yaccarino, who has described her strategy for dealing with difficult colleagues as \"patience and wine\", is entering her new role clear-eyed about the risks.<br/>\"Linda is not afraid,\" says Shelley Zallis, chief executive of the Female Quotient, which works to advance women in the workplace, and whom Ms Yaccarino has described as a \"soul sister\".<br/>\"Linda is fierce and fearless and Linda looks for the solution....

which is the maximum price suppliers can charge customers per unit of gas and electricity - a typical household will pay \u00a32,074 a year for gas and electricity from July.<br/>That is \u00a3426 a year less than what they pay now, although still far higher than what we saw before the energy crisis.<br/>So far, most big suppliers have said they will bring their tariffs in line with the new cap but none have set out cheaper fixed deals for customers.<br/>Such deals have effectively been off the table since the government stepped in to subsidise bills with its Energy Price Guarantee in October, holding them at \u00a32,500 a year for the average household. <br/>Suppliers have claimed they are not able to offer more competitive pricing plans, and so consumers have not been able to shop around.<br/>However, Natalie Mathie, an energy expert at the switching site Uswitch.com, believes the fall in the price cap will be \"a watershed moment\" for suppliers, \"who can now look to start offering fixed deals again given the market conditions\".<br/>\"The majority of homes are on standard variable tariffs and now subject to the volatility of price cap changes every three months,\" she says. <br/>\"But customers should have the choice of whether to lock in the benefits of lower wholesale prices for 12 months, just as they do in the mortgage market. <br/>\"We see no reason why energy suppliers cannot offer competitive fixed deals around the \u00a32,000 level.\"<br/>Emily Seymour, of consumer group Which?, thinks we could start seeing such deals some time this year. <br/>\"We hope to see consumers back able to make some choices,\" she said. <br/>\"It will be worth doing a bit of research to see if there's a deal out there that could be cost effective while also offering good customer service and low exit fees.\"<br/>However, she says it will depend on where energy prices go next, with fixed deals less likely if the cap has to go up again. <br/>Others meanwhile warn that fixed deals may not be best for everyone given the uncertainty over future prices. <br/>For example, energy supplier Ovo launched a fixed deal for existing customers in March that was cheaper than the government's limit on household bills. <br/>It offered a fixed 12-month tariff of \u00a32,275 for existing customers, but anyone who signed up is now locked into that rate, meaning they will miss out when the new cap comes into effect.<br/>Martin Lewis, from personal finance website Money Saving Expert, has also questioned just how much choice consumers will get when fixed deals finally return. <br/>\"I am expecting to see existing customer offers - where you will get a bespoke offer from your firm rather than deals offered across the market,\" he told BBC Radio 4.<br/>This could stifle competition, he warned, as the rules say companies do not have to publish the details of their existing customer offers. <br/>\"It makes it very hard for people like me to assess,\" he said. <br/>In any event, the energy analysts Cornwall Insight have suggested consumers should not expect to see huge savings from deals that do emerge. <br/>That is because further substantial falls in energy prices will be unlikely, particularly if there is a cold winter in Europe, with the UK competing to buy gas and electricity with other countries.<br/>\"Our forecasts suggest until the end of this decade, higher and more volatile prices are going to be seen, and that includes the impact they're going to have on domestic bills unfortunately,\" Cornwall analyst Kate Mulvany told the BBC.<br/>Energy suppliers should be in touch in the coming weeks to let customers know what their bill will look like under the new cap.<br/>However, Ms Seymour says it is always worth having a conversation with your supplier about any bespoke deals they can offer you. <br/>If you find yourself struggling to pay bills, consumer experts suggest speaking to your energy supplier about a payment plan that is manageable.<br/>By paying what you can - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears will grow more slowly and your supplier is likely to be less worried about your debt.<br/>Your supplier could also check if you qualify for any government schemes. <br/>It's also important to check the amount you pay each month if you use a direct debit. <br/>Your monthly payment is based on your estimated usage through the year not what you actually use so keep a close eye and update your supplier with your meter readings.<br/>Listen to The Martin Lewis Podcast for more on the new energy price cap<br/>Here are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips.<br/>What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts?<br/>What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?"}, {"_id": "6489fff951ac3319f5477df6", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65675027?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Nvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpower", "lead": "Innovation and good timing combined to make California's Nvidia the dominant firm for AI computer chips.", "author": "By Zoe Corbyn & Ben Morris", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:21.374023", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C3D6/production/_129843105_gettyimages-1468619875.jpg", "body": "Shares in computer chip designer Nvidia have soared over the past week, taking the company's valuation above the one trillion dollar mark.<br/>It means it joins tech giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in the elite club of $1tn US companies.<br/>The surge was sparked by its latest quarterly results which were released late on Wednesday. The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\""}, {"_id": "6489fff951ac3319f5477df7", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65688117?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Is the spike in strike action here to stay?", "lead": "BBC economics editor Faisal Islam asks whether a historic surge in industrial action is likely to persist.", "author": "By Faisal Islam", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:21.965098", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/386C/production/_129844441_strikingnurse2.jpg", "body": "Over the past 12 months, a historic wave of industrial action has swept the UK. As a new documentary series follows union leaders up close, the BBC's economics editor asks whether this surge in strikes is likely to persist.<br/>\"Listen, don't fall out with each other. Don't fall out with each other. It's really important everybody sticks together,\" says Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, as tensions flare on a bus drivers' picket line. <br/>The Abellio drivers in two south London depots had been offered a 12% pay rise and a \u00a3500 bonus - splitting opinion among drivers, who had been striking without full pay for 10 days. <br/>One driver later says: \"The union rep, they're selling us out\u2026 there's a lot of traitors around.\" <br/>Others say: \"We got screwed\" and \"we've been here for two months freezing and we're dying\". They would eventually win an 18% rise. <br/>Settlements such as this one have been occurring in so-called shortage sectors, such as driving buses, lorries, and rubbish trucks, since the beginning of last year. Many of those settlements went under the radar, in very local disputes or even, as here, in individual depots. <br/>The past year across industry and public services has seen hundreds of ballots, hundreds of thousands on picket lines, dozens of negotiations, double-digit pay claims and awards, and major legal battles between the government and public sector unions. <br/>Only 15 months ago, No 10 were slapping down the governor of the Bank of England for saying that people should not ask for excessive pay rises. Four months before that, the then-prime minister was celebrating the prospect of a high-wage Britain for all. <br/>And this time last year Ms Graham, the general secretary of the biggest private sector union, had never done a broadcast interview in that role. She and her colleagues are now household names after promising a \"summer, autumn, spring and winter of discontent\". <br/>Strike: Inside the Unions<br/>With access to top union leaders, the two-part documentary follows internal machinations at Unite, RMT and the RCN, as well as the GMB's campaign to win recognition at Amazon in Coventry. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). The first episode will be on BBC Two at 21:00 on 25 May, with the second a week later.<br/>Part of Boris Johnson's survival strategy had involved squaring up to the unions over their pay claims and seeking to direct blame towards the Labour Party. <br/>But the unions calculated that the old pattern of mutually dismissive relations between organised labour and government had altered since the pandemic and in the shared pain of a common cost of living crisis. The last year raises questions not just about that relationship, but whether something has changed in the water in the way the UK thinks about industrial relations. <br/>Looming over all of this are the restrictions on ballots in the government's anti-union laws. The documentary shows how unions have got around restrictions requiring postal ballots and high thresholds on turnout. <br/>The pattern over the past year has been unions breaking down national disputes into a series of far smaller local and sectoral ones, for which it is easier to win ballot mandates. Action is then co-ordinated across localities on the same day, giving the impression of massive national or regional walkouts, as with bus drivers across London. <br/>The other pattern is that of the private sector settling high wage claims in areas of labour shortages. <br/>Unite has a unit of forensic accountants assessing the profits and available cash flow of the parent companies, often foreign-owned, of the employers involved in disputes. In this case the owner was effectively the Dutch state (though it has now sold its stake), a fact routinely used by the union in online campaigning. <br/>The experience in the public sector has been different. This time last year, there was no negotiation. The Pay Review Body process had recommended a settlement of around 3% across public services. This was often before the spike in inflation to double digits following the Ukraine war. <br/>Prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss dug in on the issue. At first, so too did the Sunak administration, fearful of the fiscal cost and inflationary potential of significant rises in the wage costs of state employees. <br/>The cameras were with Royal College of Nursing (RCN) General Secretary Pat Cullen ahead of the first strikes in its history.<br/>The RCN itself had been asking for a 19% rise for nurses. The government said at that time it could not shift from the recommendation of the Pay Review Body and was not negotiating. <br/>\"It's never, ever going to get a resolution to this dispute,\" Cullen said later. \"The last meeting that I had with the secretary of state, he arrived accompanied by five men and it was not a pleasant meeting. It was quite a bullyish conversation.\" Cullen said nurses had concluded that they were being treated differently because \"we are 90% female\". <br/>And she said a government minister had told her in a meeting that they were surprised nurses needed to live off their salaries: \"And you know, ministers coming into the room saying to me that they're shocked that nursing staff may be the main breadwinner in the family. Because they believe that it's a second salary that we don't depend on. They are totally out of touch.\" <br/>The Department of Health said it did not recognise the claim and had \"utmost respect\" for all staff. <br/>Nurses in the RCN in the end rejected the deal recommended by their own union - a sign of how strongly a large swathe of public sector workers felt about the squeeze in their real wages. <br/>The film shows how nurses felt emboldened by large-scale public sympathy, especially since the pandemic. <br/>This perception of support, even in less popular professions than the NHS, has helped underpin double-digit pay claims. The successful tactics in the private sector of balloting first for strike action in order to gain negotiating leverage in pay disputes has also spread to the public sector. <br/>Some union bosses also acknowledge that in an era where more workers can work from home, the strikes may not have disrupted the public as much. While the overall number of strikes has not been seen for a generation, the total number of days lost to strike action is nowhere near the highs of the 1970s. <br/>Nonetheless, some in the union movement are trying to push into new territory too, such as the GMB at Amazon. <br/>Outside the company's Coventry warehouse, Stuart Richards, a senior GMB organiser, is attempting to recruit new members.<br/>A US training video cartoon for Amazon managers leaked in 2018 certainly made clear that \"we do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers, our shareholders, or most importantly, our associates\" - its term for workers.<br/>But the staff arriving by car have been squeezed hard by the cost of living crisis - one tells of having to pawn a wedding ring - and some were willing to U-turn near the entrance to their workplace and sign up to Richards' campaign. <br/>Eventually the GMB get more than half the Coventry workforce, which the union estimates at 1,300 in total, and serve a letter demanding recognition from the Amazon bosses - it is the first site in the UK to do so, after a decade of trying.<br/>So the question really is whether the current spike in strike activity is entirely a reaction to rampant inflation or whether this is something that might have a longer-lasting impact. <br/>The full data is not yet available, but it is difficult to escape a pattern of unionised workplaces, especially in shortage occupations, getting double-digit pay settlements. <br/>They have responded to existing strike restrictions by moving to immediate localised ballots, even before starting negotiations. On the other hand, insiders say that membership spikes during pay disputes, but then falls back when pay deals are done. Union subs are another expense during a cost of living crisis. Official figures will come next year. <br/>There are some concerns, though, about the persistence and stickiness of inflation. Even the Bank of England, which began last year warning about excessive pay rises, now couples that message with concerns about corporate pricing and profits, a similar message to that pushed by some union leaders. <br/>And the political economy of all this does appear to be changing. <br/>Bashing the unions has proven tricky for the government over the past year. David Cameron's union tsar Lord Richard Balfe argues that PMs Johnson and Truss should have sued for peace with public sector workers much earlier.

I think the AI risks are more that people will be discriminated [against], they will not be seen as who they are.<br/>\"If it's a bank using it to decide whether I can get a mortgage or not, or if it's social services on your municipality, then you want to make sure that you're not being discriminated [against] because of your gender or your colour or your postal code,\" she said. <br/>On Tuesday, Ireland's data protection authority said it had put Google's planned EU roll-out of its AI chatbot Bard on hold. <br/>It said it had been informed by Google that its ChatGPT competitor would be introduced in the EU this week, but was yet to receive details or information showing how the firm had identified and minimised data protection risks to prospective users.<br/>Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said the DPC was seeking the information \"as a matter of urgency\" and had raised further data protection enquiries about it with Google.<br/>Ms Vestager, who is the European Commission's executive vice president, said AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\".<br/>She insisted a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries should be prioritised before getting more jurisdictions, such as China, on board.<br/>\"Let's start working on a UN approach.

This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it. No-one can make sure that everyone is on board,\" she said, pointing out that a pause could be used by some as an opportunity to get ahead of competitors. <br/>\"What I think is important is that every developer knows that everyone has signed up for the same guardrails so that no-one takes excessive risks.\"<br/>The European Parliament's proposals for the AI Act seek to restrict the use of biometric identification systems and indiscriminate collection of user data from social media or CCTV footage for purposes such as facial recognition systems.<br/>However, Ms Vestager said: \"We want to put in strict guardrails so that it's not used in real-time, but only in specific circumstances where you're looking for a missing child or there's a terrorist fleeing.<br/>Before the AI Act can become finalised as the world's first rulebook on the use and development of AI systems, the EU's three branches of power: the Commission, Parliament and Council will all have to agree on its final version.<br/>It is not expected to come into effect before 2025.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example...

That can include the author's relationship with other online accounts, their sign-in activity, review history, and any unusual behaviour.<br/>\"We use machine learning to look for suspicious accounts, to track the relationships between a purchasing account that's leaving a review and someone selling that product,\" Dharmesh Mehta, the head of Amazon's customer trust team, told the BBC.<br/>\"Through a combination of both important vetting and really advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence - that's looking at different signals or behaviours - we can stop those fake reviews before a customer ever encounters it,\" he said.<br/>Harry Kind from Which? said in the UK some estimates suggest around one in seven online consumer reviews are fake. <br/>\"Amazon has been trying all sorts of technology to crack down on fake reviews and by all accounts that's having some success.<br/>\"But as far as we're concerned, it's still nowhere near enough to solve this huge problem,\" he said.<br/>Fake reviews made consumers more than twice as likely to choose poor-quality products, the consumer group said.<br/>As a result of the new methods it had developed, Amazon said it had blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews last year and would \"continue to build sophisticated tools that protect customers\".<br/>But the retail platform is calling for more cooperation between the private sector, consumer groups and governments to make the strategy more effective.<br/>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that is currently going through the UK parliament is expected to strengthen the legal powers available to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area.<br/>Which? welcomed Amazon's call for a more collaborative approach, but called for the UK legislation to go further than currently envisaged \"by explicitly making the buying, selling and hosting of fake reviews subject to criminal enforcement.\"<br/>It said fake review \"factories\" on Facebook that trade reviews for Amazon and other sites were still easy to find. <br/>The CMA said it had already taken significant action against fake and misleading reviews and those who trade them.<br/>A spokesperson for the CMA said: \"Our investigations relating to fake reviews - including the case into Amazon - are ongoing and further updates will come later this year.\"<br/>In the UK, Amazon recently took legal action against the operators of NiceRebate.com, a fake review broker aimed at British customers. <br/>Other websites run by the same operators were also shut down, with simultaneous legal action taken against them in the US.<br/>\"We are aggressively fighting review brokers,\" said Mr Mehta.<br/>Amazon had taken legal action against 94 such \"bad actors\" he said, including fraudsters in the US, China and Europe.

which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in the country.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>In December last year, the FTC had asked an in-house administrative judge to block the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.<br/>William Kovacic, former FTC chair and non-executive director at the UK's CMA, said the FTC had expressed concerns that Microsoft and Activision might close their deal despite UK opposition, and so asked a judge to halt it.<br/>\"The EU's decision to take a settlement was a bit of a surprise,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme<br/>Mr Kovacic said there was still a chance the takeover could be completed, but added \"the chance is diminished\".<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to play catch-up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases -

effectively a community of people who gather to discuss a particular interest. <br/>Reddit users - or Redditors - will typically join a variety of subreddits, rather than following individual users on other platforms, and see posts from these communities in their feed.<br/>As well as a few paid administrators, the website uses tens of thousands of unpaid moderators - known as mods - to keep the website functional.<br/>These mods may spend one or two hours per day ensuring that their subreddit does not get filled with off-topic comments, content that is banned, or even content which is illegal.<br/>But the flipside of this is that Reddit does not charge any hosting fees for people who want to set up their own community based on an interest they have.<br/>In a post to the website on Friday, Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman said it \"needs to be a self-sustaining business\" and addressed the blackout. <br/>\"We respect when you and your communities take action to highlight the things you need, including, at times, going private,\" he said.<br/>\"We are all responsible for ensuring Reddit provides an open accessible place for people to find community and belonging.\"<br/>He also confirmed that explicit content would remain on the site, but Reddit would limit how it can be accessed from third-party apps.<br/>The blackout includes 3,489 subreddits in total, including five of the 10 most popular communities on the site - r/gaming, r/aww, r/Music, r/todayilearned and r/pics - which each have memberships of more than 30 million people.<br/>A moderator for one of these subreddits told the BBC the protest was about \"strength in numbers\".<br/>\"If it was a single subreddit going private, Reddit may intervene,\" they said. <br/>\"But if it's half the entire website, then you feel a lot more pressured. <br/>\"This is a completely volunteer position, we don't receive any financial compensation, and despite that, we do like to take it quite seriously.\"<br/>They said they wanted Reddit admins to realise that they rely on moderators to operate the site and felt that the only way to send a message was by harming Reddit's traffic.<br/>\"Our entire community is supporting us against this change,\" they said.<br/>\"It feels good to be able to have the power to say: 'We will not continue to moderate our communities if you push these changes through'.<br/>\"If it's almost the entire website, would they destroy what they've built up in all these communities, just to push through this highly unpopular change that both the mods and users of Reddit are overwhelmingly against?\"<br/>Reddit, which describes itself as \"the front page of the internet\", has an official app but it was developed in 2016, many years after the website was founded.<br/>Because of this, third-party apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Sync and ReddPlanet were set up as a way for people to access the platform on their mobile devices. <br/>Reddit has introduced a series of charges to the developers who wish to continue using its Application Programming Interface (API) - the behind-the-scenes code which allows third-party apps to find and show the content on Reddit.<br/>All four of these apps have said they will be shutting down as a result of Reddit's new API pricing. <br/>These charges have been heavily criticised as extortionate - with Apollo developer Christian Selig claiming it would end up costing him $20m (\u00a315.9m) to continue operating the app.<br/>But a Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that Apollo was \"notably less efficient\" than other third-party apps.<br/>They said the social media platform spends \"multi-millions of dollars on hosting fees\" and \"needs to be fairly paid\" to continue supporting third-party apps. <br/>\"Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs,\" they said.<br/>The spokesperson also said that not all third-party apps would require paid access. Previously, Reddit announced it would not charge apps which make the platform more accessible.<br/>But the moderator the BBC spoke to said they believed the blackout could continue until Reddit row back on the changes.<br/>\"The current plan for many communities is... they might keep the blackout going for longer, beyond the original forty-eight hours, or keep their subreddits restricted so that nobody can post,\" they said.<br/>\"Every community operates differently, and different moderators have different views on what's happening right now, so it does vary. <br/>\"But given recent communications between moderators and Reddit admins, I don't believe that they are intending to reverse these changes.\"<br/>And some communities, such as r/Music - which has 32 million members - say their subreddit will be indefinitely inaccessible until Reddit reverses its policy."}, {"_id": "6489fffd51ac3319f5477e02", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-65878227?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Newsbeat", "subCategories": "", "title": "Xbox showcase 2023: Is Microsoft back in the game?", "lead": "Microsoft had a lot to prove in some people's eyes -

The Guardian said it was a \"supermassive black hole of a game\" - though some fans worried they wouldn't get time to play it.<br/>Director Todd Howard said the level of detail in the game meant it would be locked at 30 frames per second on both versions of the Xbox.<br/>And some will have mixed feelings about the news that the Elder Scrolls developer's resurrected one of its \"most annoying\" characters for its space odyssey.<br/>It would be unreasonable to expect any showcase to be filled with back-to-back big reveals, and quite a few expansions to existing games were announced.<br/>Fallout 76: Atlantic City, Overwatch 2: Invasion and Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom were all shown.<br/>A Monkey Island add-on for popular online pirate-em-up Sea of Thieves was also announced - perhaps the biggest \"didn't know we needed it\" announcement of the night.<br/>And Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty update was introduced in a recorded message from Keanu Reeves.<br/>It wasn't quite as breathtaking as his E3 appearance to promote the original game, but it was met with approval from many.<br/>One of the main complaints -

which didn't show any gameplay.<br/>But, if there were a Metacritic page for Microsoft's 2023 showcase, it would probably say the show had \"generally favourable\" reviews.<br/>And even PlayStation fansite Push Square was among those admitting it was \"probably the strongest Xbox Showcase in recent memory\".<br/>Microsoft still has hurdles to clear in its Activision Blizzard buyout, and the PS5 remains the bigger-selling console.<br/>It's clearly got big plans for gaming, though, so it's worth keeping an eye on the big green machine.<br/>Microsoft's collected all of its showcase trailers on its website.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

Dozens of other UK companies are thought to be using MOVEit. <br/>The criminals responsible for the hack are linked to the notorious Clop ransomware group, thought to be based in Russia. <br/>They have threatened to begin publishing data of companies that do not email them to begin the negotiations by Wednesday. <br/>BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy said the group is well-known for carrying out its threats and it is likely that organisations will have private data published on the gang's darknet website in the coming weeks.  <br/>He said it is usually the case that if a victim does not appear on Clop's website, they may have secretly paid the group a ransom which could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.<br/>Victims are always encouraged not to pay though as it fuels the growth of this criminal enterprise and there is no guarantee that the hackers will not use the data for secondary attacks.

rather than another human pair of eyes - made the process feel less intrusive.<br/>\"You know your images are on screen, and people are looking at them,\" she said. \"Whereas when it's an artificial intelligence, that bit of feeling that somebody is looking has gone.\"<br/>The results of June's biopsy means she will once again be having surgery.<br/>\"The biopsy showed that I do have an early-stage cancer, they've certainly caught it at an earlier stage this time,\" June said. \"But because I've had previous history with it, I'm going to go in and have a mastectomy.<br/>\"It's not treatment I want to have. But at the same time, it's reassuring that it's being caught.\"<br/>A major review of Scotland's breast screening programme published last year suggested a large number of radiology and advance practitioner staff are either nearing or at retirement age.<br/>It said the decline of \"super reader\" radiologists, relied on by the service to review a particularly high number of results, risks leaving the service \"vulnerable\".<br/>The Royal College of Radiologists has also warned the UK is facing \"chronic staff shortages\", with patients waiting too long for vital tests and cancer treatments.<br/>With two radiologists needed to read and report results, the Scottish government's review said replacing one human reader with AI could \"cover half of the screening image reading burden of approximately 1.72 million images read each year\". <br/>But could the technology being tested in Aberdeen some day replace human staff?<br/>\"I think the goal of this evaluation is to see what's the best way we can work with AI, whether it's replacing one of the radiologists, whether it's part reading some of the normal mammograms, or whether it's to improve our cancer detection as a safety net,\" Dr Lip said.<br/>Peter Kecskemethy, co-founder of Kheiron, said the tech will used by more than 30 NHS trusts across the UK for millions to access.<br/>And with trusts in England already exploring how AI can support better, faster outcomes for breast cancer patients, the tech looks to continue playing a large role in helping doctors save lives.<br/>You can see the full report and more ways AI is changing industries on this week's episode of Click."}, {"_id": "6489ffff51ac3319f5477e06", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65834521?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave platform", "lead": "One streamer tells BBC News this is the push he needed to leave the platform altogether.", "author": "By Tom Gerken", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:27.218967", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED7F/production/_126799706_gettyimages-1235589070.jpg", "body": "Twitch is scrapping its own new advertising rules, following a backlash that saw streamers leave the platform.<br/>The Amazon-owned livestreaming service had said it would restrict the size and type of ads used by streamers who create content on Twitch.<br/>This would have substantially reduced the ways in which streamers generate income on the platform.<br/>Twitch has abandoned this policy, after several creators threatened to boycott the platform and some moved elsewhere.<br/>But not all of the new rules have been reversed, some streamers say, despite Twitch's statement.<br/>In a tweet viewed 13.4 million times, it called the new rules \"bad for you and bad for Twitch\".<br/>\"Sponsorships are critical to streamers' growth and ability to earn income,\" it said. \"We will not prevent your ability to enter into direct relationships with sponsors - you will continue to own and control your sponsorship business.<br/>\"We want to work with our community to create the best experience on Twitch - and to do that we need to be clear about what we're doing and why we're doing it.

Once the headset is on, you see the room around you but you're not seeing it through glass, you're seeing it through the many on-board cameras. This is important for the \"mixed-reality\" experience - digital content projected onto your surroundings.<br/>You physically press a single button on the top right-hand side of glasses, and up pops some familiar app icons you'll recognise if you have used an iPhone - iMessage, photos, Apple TV (there will be more as developers make them). <br/>And from then on it's all about gesture control - the headset tracks where you are looking so when you look at an app and pinch your thumb and forefinger together, it opens.<br/>Apple swept me through a number of demos. A gallery of photos, stretching from floor to ceiling, were impressive to see - although these were clearly very carefully curated, and very beautifully shot. <br/>You can shoot 3D video using the cameras on the headset - I watched a child blow out birthday candles on a cake so close to me that I felt I could almost feel her breath.<br/>I had a live video call with another Apple employee, also wearing a headset - well, a photorealistic avatar of him rather than an actual video. I don't know what he really looked like because I never met him in real life but there was something a bit weird about the smoothness of his skin, and the detail of his eyes, even when he smiled and frowned.<br/>I watched movie clips on a giant virtual screen with the room digitally darkened around me like a cinema theatre.

It can fill the entire room or appear like a TV screen superimposed against your wall. <br/>If someone walks in front of you in real life, you can see them no matter how immersed you are.<br/>I had a laborious go at trying to respond to a text message on the digital keyboard that popped up in front of me. \"Remember this is not a finished product!\" was the enthused response every time I said something that was less than glowing.<br/>Unfortunately, I can't show you any of this because everyone there was banned from recording anything. Noticeably, nobody from Apple actually wore a Vision Pro either - not even the boss, Tim Cook, or Disney CEO, Bob Iger, who described the device as \"real-life magic\".<br/>I've tried a lot of virtual-reality (VR) and mixed-reality headsets in my time as a tech journalist and this was one of the better ones. And with a launch price tag of $3,499 (\u00a32,899) you'd hope so. <br/>It will probably still be the most-expensive headset on the market when it goes on sale next year. Bloomberg has reported that Apple hopes to shift 900,000 in the first year of sales.<br/>I think Apple is playing a very clever game here with its marketing - although I'm not sure whether it will work. Traditionally, mixed-reality headsets have been targeted at gamers and promised big, extravagant moments. Kill monsters the size of your house! Be a rock star on stage at Wembley Stadium! <br/>Apple barely mentioned gaming at all. The message here was much more: do everything you do on your phone, only bigger and brighter and against the backdrop of your own home.<br/>There was much speculation that the Apple Vision Pro announcement would be an \"iPhone moment\" - that is, a huge, game-changing product from Apple in the way the iPhone changed the smartphone landscape forever.<br/>But what if the Apple Vision Pro actually is the new iPhone?<br/>By making it a useful bit of every day kit rather than an occasional thrill, Apple is very much aiming this at the mainstream. <br/>I'm not sure whether it will work. Apple has a unique magic and a very loyal customer base. People who like the brand really, really like the brand. But hardware has long been a barrier in VR. <br/>Wearing a headset for long periods of time just does not feel great. Plenty of people experience nausea (I do too, although I didn't on Monday - my demo was only 15 minutes long though, with a couple of minutes on each section). <br/>I can tell you with certainty that while it was a remarkable experience, I'm not sure I want to be sniffed by a virtual dinosaur again any time soon.<br/>Now clearly $3,499 is not a novelty product price. I remember wincing last year when Facebook-owner Meta announced its Quest Pro headset would cost about $1,500, less than half the price (it has since fallen to $999).<br/>You are of course paying for the years of research and development that goes into building the first generation of any product. But what if you use it every day? <br/>A friend of mine who works in the fashion industry says you should spend the most money on the clothes you wear most often. <br/>So if you spend \u00a3100 on a dress and wear it once, that single wear was \u00a3100. But if you wear it 100 times - it's only cost you \u00a31 each time.  <br/>Perhaps Apple is gambling that if it can make the headset useful enough, people are more likely to think about it that way. It needs a lot of content, and a lot of developers to make that work.<br/>But if you like Apple, and you like mixed reality, and you have the cash - you'll probably like this headset. <br/>If in five years time it's replaced your smartphone - well, perhaps our avatars can virtually FaceTime each other and have a chat about it. <br/>Follow Zoe on Twitter."}, {"_id": "648a000251ac3319f5477e0d", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65822884?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Technology minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings", "lead": "Paul Scully says there should be more of a focus on the good artificial intelligence can do.", "author": "By Chris Vallance", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:30.947304", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/09C5/production/_130010520_gettyimages-85475547.jpg", "body": "Tech minister Paul Scully has warned so-called \"Terminator-style\" risks to humanity from artificial intelligence (AI) should not be highlighted at the expense of the good it can do.<br/>The Terminator sci-fi film franchise envisages a malevolent AI \"Skynet\" system bent on humanity's destruction.<br/>Last week several firms warned AI could pose a threat to human existence.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is about to travel to the US where AI is one of the items he will be discussing.<br/>AI describes the ability of computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. <br/>When it came to AI, there was a \"dystopian point of view that we can follow here. There's also a utopian point of view. Both can be possible\", Mr Scully told the TechUK Tech Policy Leadership Conference in Westminster.<br/>A dystopia is an imaginary place in which everything is as bad as possible.<br/>\"If you're only talking about the end of humanity because of some, rogue, Terminator-style scenario, you're going to miss out on all of the good that AI is already functioning - how it's mapping proteins to help us with medical research, how it's helping us with climate change.<br/>\"All of those things it's already doing and will only get better at doing.\" <br/>The government recently put out a policy document on regulating AI which was criticised for not establishing a dedicated watchdog, and some think additional measures may eventually needed to deal with the most powerful future systems .<br/>Marc Warner, a member of the AI Council, an expert body set up to advise the government, told BBC News last week a ban on the most powerful AI may be necessary.<br/>However, he argued that \"narrow AI\" designed for particular tasks, such as systems that look for cancer in medical images, should be regulated on the same basis as existing tech.<br/>Responding to reports on the possible dangers posed by AI, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"We are not complacent about the potential risks of AI, but it also provides significant opportunities. <br/>\"We can not proceed with AI without the guard rails in place.\"<br/>Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell told the BBC that while there was a \"level of hysteria going on and that's certainly dominating the public debate at the moment, there are real opportunities with the development of a technology like AI\".<br/>However, she added: \"But we do have to think really carefully about the risks, make sure we've got good regulation in place.\"<br/>It was also important that everyone benefited from the impact of AI and it \"doesn't just go to the big tech giants in the US as happened in the last technological revolution\".  <br/>Ms Powell earlier told the Guardian she felt AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power, both of which had dedicated regulators.<br/>AI company OpenAI recently blogged that a global regulator like the International Atomic Energy Authority might be needed for super-intelligent AI.<br/>At the same event, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the most powerful AIs may need safety licences to operate.<br/>\"Before a model can be deployed it will have to pass some some kind of safety review.\" <br/>Mr Smith argued it would be better if there was international co-operation and a single model of regulation. He said that when it came to cyber and national security, the UK and US were well placed to work together.<br/>He told reporters at the event that Microsoft would not join \"the fear parade\", adding it would be better to reduce some of the rhetoric and focus more on current problems.<br/>A number of other experts have also said focusing on sci-fi-like disaster scenarios is a distraction from current issues with AI, such as the risk of racial or gender biases in algorithms."}, {"_id": "648a000351ac3319f5477e0e", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65823482?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "'Ducking hell' to disappear from Apple autocorrect", "lead": "One of the most common swear words will no longer be automatically changed when typing.", "author": "By Shiona McCallum", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:31.456098", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8C5A/production/_130003953_gettyimages-1020478238.jpg", "body": "Apple has said it will no longer automatically change one of the most common swear words to 'ducking'.<br/>The autocorrect feature, which has long frustrated users, will soon be able to use AI to detect when you really mean to use that expletive.<br/>\"In those moments where you just want to type a ducking word, well, the keyboard will learn it, too,\" said software boss Craig Federighi.<br/>He announced the development at Apple's developers' conference in California.<br/>iPhone users have often complained about how autocorrect forces them to rewrite their own messages - with the term \"damn you autocorrect\" becoming an acronym, a meme, an Instagram account and even a song. <br/>The changes to the function will happen thanks to the use of a transformer model, which learns context by tracking relationships in data, like the words in this sentence, using mathematical techniques. <br/>Initially flagged in a 2017 paper from Google, transformers are some of the most powerful classes of AI models, and autosuggest - or predictive text - systems are beginning to become more mainstream.<br/>The autocorrect change will be part of the iOS 17 operating system upgrades which are expected to be available as a public beta in July, with the general release in September. <br/>It should mean that iPadOS 17 also carries the new function.<br/>Elsewhere at the developers' conference, Apple unveiled an augmented reality headset, Apple Vision Pro which will retail at $3,499 (\u00a32,849).<br/>Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the new headset \"seamlessly blends the real world and the virtual world\".<br/>It will be available early next year in the US and in other countries later in 2024.<br/>On Monday, Apple's market valuation reached just under $3 trillion - a new company record.<br/>Have you sent any funny or unfortunate autocorrect texts?

it is too time consuming and they care about one thing only, getting paid.<br/>And they will probably send ransom demands to the organisations breached, asking for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.<br/>\"The important message to organisations right now is not to panic, to install the security patch and not to pay the criminals,\" former National Cyber Security Centre lead Prof Ciaran Martin says.<br/>But once an organisation has been breached, the hackers have the upper hand.<br/>And the criminals thought to be responsible for the MoveIt hack are notoriously ruthless with their extortion techniques.<br/>The hackers often take time to consider their extortion tactics.<br/>\"Some prior incidents involving these criminals have seen victims not contacted until weeks after data was stolen - so if you don't hear from them in the coming days, you are not in clear,\" Mandiant Intelligence senior manager Kimberly Goody says.<br/>The group, thought to be based in Russia, will then contact a company email address, demanding payment not to publish the stolen data online, Mandiant research suggests.<br/>These demands are usually in the seven- or eight-figure range, Mandiant experts say, but there have been ones over $35m (\u00a328m).<br/>And law enforcement agencies around the world advise organisations not to pay, as it fuels the growth of these criminal gangs.<br/>For individuals, the advice is also not to panic but to be suspicious.<br/>If your organisation refuses to pay the criminals, there is a good chance they will publish the data on the dark web or try to sell it to other hackers.<br/>But there are many steps between that and you losing money.<br/>\"There really is an important message not to panic, as it's very unlikely that organisations have been storing data like full bank details which can lead directly to sort of financial harm,\" Prof Martin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. <br/>And although some organisations, such as British Airways, say some staff bank details have been stolen, this was highly unlikely to lead to individuals' bank accounts being drained.<br/>The risk, experts say, is from secondary attacks, where hackers use the details they have to trick victims into revealing more details.<br/>So the advice is to look out for suspicious emails and phone calls - particularly ones about the hack. <br/>In a typical scam, individual victims might receive a message claiming to be from their organisation, asking them to log in and verify their account because \"fraudulent activity has taken place\". <br/>Things to look out for, experts say, include:<br/>The MoveIt breach is likely to become more serious as other companies discover they have been hacked -

When it comes to moderating violent images from wars, however, machines lack the nuance to identify human rights violations.<br/>Ihor Zakharenko, a former travel journalist, encountered this in Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion he has been documenting attacks on civilians.<br/>The BBC met him in a suburb of Kyiv where one year ago men, women and children had been shot dead by Russian troops while trying to flee occupation.<br/>He filmed the bodies - at least 17 of them - and burnt-out cars. <br/>He wanted to post the videos online so the world would see what happened and to counter the Kremlin's narrative. But when he uploaded them to Facebook and Instagram they were swiftly taken down.  <br/>\"Russians themselves were saying those were fakes, [that] they didn't touch civilians, they fought only with the Ukrainian army,\" Ihor said.<br/>We uploaded Ihor's footage on to Instagram and YouTube using dummy accounts. <br/>Instagram took down three of the four videos within a minute.<br/>At first, YouTube applied age restrictions to the same three, but 10 minutes later removed them all. <br/>We tried again - but they failed to upload altogether. An appeal to restore the videos on the basis that they included evidence of war crimes was rejected.<br/>Key figures within the industry say there is an urgent need for social media companies to prevent this kind of information from vanishing.<br/>\"You can see why they have developed and train their machines to, the moment they see something that looks difficult or traumatic, to take it down,\" Mr Rusbridger told the BBC. The Meta Oversight Board that he sits on was set up by Mark Zuckerberg and is known as a kind of independent \"supreme court\" for the company, which owns Facebook and Instagram.<br/>\"I think the next question for them is how do we develop the machinery, whether that's human or AI, to then make more reasonable decisions,\" Mr Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of the Guardian, adds.<br/>No-one would deny tech firms' right to police content, says US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaak: \"I think where the concern happens is when that information suddenly disappears.\"<br/>War Crimes: Do Not Delete<br/>Atrocities from war are being documented on social media. This material can be used as evidence to help prosecute war crimes.

But our experiment with Ihor's videos suggest otherwise.<br/>Meta says it responds \"to valid legal requests from law enforcement agencies around the world\" and \"we continue to explore additional avenues to support international accountability processes\u2026 consistent with our legal and privacy obligations\".<br/>YouTube says that while it has exemptions for graphic content in the public interest, the platform is not an archive. It says, \"Human rights organisations; activists, human rights defenders, researchers, citizen journalists and others documenting human rights abuses (or other potential crimes) should observe best practices for securing and preserving their content.\"<br/>The BBC also spoke to Imad, who owned a pharmacy in Aleppo, Syria, until a Syrian government barrel bomb landed nearby in 2013.<br/>He recalls how the blast filled the room with dust and smoke. Hearing cries for help, he went to the market outside and saw hands, legs and dead bodies covered in blood.<br/>Local TV crews captured these scenes. The footage was posted on YouTube and Facebook but has subsequently been taken down. <br/>In the mayhem of the conflict, Syrian journalists told the BBC their own recordings of the original footage were also destroyed in bombing raids. <br/>Years later, when Imad was applying for asylum in the EU, he was asked to provide documents that proved he was at the scene. <br/>\"I was sure that my pharmacy was captured on camera. But when I went online, it was taking me to a deleted video.\" <br/>In response to this sort of incident, organisations like Mnemonic, a Berlin-based human rights organisation, have stepped in to archive footage before it disappears. <br/>Mnemonic developed a tool to automatically download and save evidence of human rights violations - first in Syria and now in Yemen, Sudan and Ukraine.<br/>They have saved more than 700,000 images from war zones before they were removed from social media, including three videos showing the attack near Imad's pharmacy.<br/>Each image might hold a key clue to uncover what really transpired on the battlefield - the location, the date or the perpetrator.<br/>But organisations like Mnemonic cannot cover every area of conflict around the world. <br/>Proving that war crimes have been committed is incredibly hard - so getting as many sources as possible is vital.<br/>\"Verification is like solving a puzzle - you put together seemingly unrelated pieces of information to build a bigger picture of what happened,\" says BBC Verify's Olga Robinson.<br/>The task of archiving open-source material - available to pretty much anyone on social media - often falls to people with a mission to help their relatives caught up in violent conflict. <br/>Rahwa lives in the United States and has family in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, which has been wracked with violence in recent years, and where the authorities in Ethiopia tightly control the flow of information.<br/>However, social media means there is a visual record of a conflict that might otherwise remain hidden from the outside world.<br/>\"It was our duty,\" says Rahwa. \"I spent hours doing research, and so when you're seeing this content trickle in you're trying to verify using all the open-source intelligence tools you can get your hands on, but you don't know if your family is OK.\"<br/>Human rights campaigners say there is an urgent need for a formal system to gather and safely store deleted content.  This would include preserving metadata to help verify the content and prove it hasn't been tampered with.<br/>Ms Van Schaak, the US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice, says: \"We need to create a mechanism whereby that information can be preserved for potential future accountability exercises.

And on Wednesday, the bloc's technology chief, Margrethe Vestager, said a voluntary code of conduct for AI could be created \"within the next weeks\".<br/>Some fear that advanced computational ability could be used for harmful purposes, such as the development of deadly new chemical weapons.<br/>Prof Bengio told the BBC he was concerned about \"bad actors\" getting hold of AI, especially as it became more sophisticated and powerful.<br/>\"It might be military, it might be terrorists, it might be somebody very angry, psychotic. And so if it's easy to program these AI systems to ask them to do something very bad, this could be very dangerous.<br/>\"If they're smarter than us, then it's hard for us to stop these systems or to prevent damage,\" he added.<br/>Prof Bengio admitted those concerns were taking a personal toll on him, as his life's work, which had given him direction and a sense of identity, was no longer clear to him.<br/>\"It is challenging, emotionally speaking, for people who are inside [the AI sector],\" he said.<br/>\"You could say I feel lost. But you have to keep going and you have to engage, discuss, encourage others to think with you.\" <br/>The Canadian has signed two recent statements urging caution about the future risks of AI. Some academics and industry experts have warned that the pace of development could result in malicious AI being deployed by \"bad actors\" to actively cause harm - or choosing to inflict harm by itself.<br/>Fellow \"godfather\" Dr Geoffrey Hinton has also signed the same warnings as Prof Bengio, and retired from Google recently saying he regretted his work. <br/>The third \"godfather\", Prof Yann LeCun, who along with Prof Bengio and Dr Hinton won a prestigious Turing Award for their pioneering work, has said apocalyptic warnings are overblown.<br/>Twitter and Tesla owner Elon Musk has also voiced his concerns.<br/>\"I don't think AI will try to destroy humanity, but it might put us under strict controls,\" he said recently at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. <br/>\"There's a small likelihood of it annihilating humanity. Close to zero but not impossible.\"<br/>Prof Bengio told the BBC all companies building powerful AI products needed to be registered.<br/>\"Governments need to track what they're doing, they need to be able to audit them, and that's just the minimum thing we do for any other sector like building aeroplanes or cars or pharmaceuticals,\" he said.<br/>\"We also need the people who are close to these systems to have a kind of certification... we need ethical training here. Computer scientists don't usually get that, by the way.\" <br/>But not everybody in the field believes AI will be the downfall of humans - others argue that there are more imminent problems which need addressing.<br/>Dr Sasha Luccioni, research scientist at the AI firm Huggingface, said society should focus on issues like AI bias, predictive policing, and the spread of misinformation by chatbots which she said were \"very concrete harms\". <br/>\"We should focus on that rather than the hypothetical risk that AI will destroy humanity,\" she added.<br/>There are already many examples of AI bringing benefits to society. Last week an AI tool discovered a new antibiotic, and a paralysed man was able to walk again just by thinking about it, thanks to a microchip developed using AI.<br/>But this is juxtaposed with fears about the far-reaching impact of AI on countries' economies. Firms are already replacing human staff with AI tools, and it is a factor in the current strike under way by scriptwriters in Hollywood.<br/>\"It's never too late to improve,\" says Prof Bengio of AI's current state. \"It's exactly like climate change. <br/>\"We've put a lot of carbon in the atmosphere. And it would be better if we hadn't, but let's see what we can do now.\"<br/>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk<br/>What are your questions about artificial intelligence?"}, {"_id": "648a000d51ac3319f5477e1c", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65762114?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Elon Musk: Tesla boss on first China trip in over three years", "lead": "The multi-billionaire has not yet publicly commented on the visit, which comes amid US-China tensions.", "author": "By Annabelle Liang", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:41.306245", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C781/production/_129937015_962bf1c875278696e9c31b8e2bb5bf1f79ad5d15.jpg", "body": "Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is in China, as he makes his first trip to the world's second largest economy in over three years.<br/>He arrived in Beijing on Tuesday and is also expected to visit Tesla's huge manufacturing plant in Shanghai.<br/>The multi-billionaire met China's foreign minister Qin Gang within hours of arriving in the country.<br/>Mr Musk has not yet publicly commented on the trip, which comes amid tensions between the US and China.<br/>He also declined to make any comments about his plans for the trip when asked by reporters as he left a hotel in Beijing on Wednesday.<br/>Later on Wednesday, Mr Musk met China's industry minister Jin Zhuanglong and discussed the development of electric vehicles.<br/>In a statement on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said that Mr Musk was willing to expand the car maker's business in the country, which is Tesla's biggest market after the US.<br/>The ministry added that during the meeting Mr Musk had described the economies of the US and China as \"conjoined twins\".<br/>Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.<br/>Mr Musk has also been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter, which he owns and where he has more than 141 million followers.<br/>He is known for tweeting many times a day but as of midday on Wednesday had not posted anything since arriving in the country on Tuesday afternoon. <br/>The social media platform is banned in China but it can be accessed through VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks.<br/>Mr Musk is the latest high-profile US executive to make a trip to China.

Her arrival at the facility was confirmed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which declined to give any more details about her confinement, citing privacy concerns. <br/>There, the woman once billed as the world's youngest self-made billionaire might work alongside other inmates for between 12 cents (10p) and $1.15 (93p) an hour - much of which will go towards her court-mandated restitution payments. <br/>Earlier this month a US judge ordered Holmes and her former romantic and business partner, ex-Theranos boss Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, to pay $452m to victims.<br/>Balwani is already serving a 13-year prison sentence in California for his role in the scheme. <br/>Together, the pair are accused of duping some of the world's richest and most prominent investors - including media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and former US Treasury Secretary George Shultz - into backing Theranos. <br/>The firm, once valued at $9bn, promised it had technology that could detect conditions such as diabetes with just a few drops of blood. The tech, however, never worked. The company finally collapsed in 2018. <br/>The Texas prison camp where Holmes will serve time is a sprawling 37-acre facility. Most inmates there have been convicted of non-violent crimes, low-level drug dealing or white-collar offences. <br/>According to the facility's handbook, life largely revolves around work and extracurricular activities that include foreign language, computer literacy or business courses.<br/>Holmes had fought to stay out of prison while her legal appeal works its way through the courts. She argued a delay would allow her to raise \"substantial questions\" about the case that could warrant a new trial. <br/>Her defence team also argued that she should remain free to care for her children, one who is nearly two and the other three months old. <br/>The Wall Street Journal reported the prison has facilities where inmates can host gatherings and where children can play.<br/>Holmes and other mothers are allowed to hold their children in their lap and breastfeed their infants, according to official Bureau of Prison guidelines. <br/>The image of Holmes walking into a federal prison on Tuesday stands as a dire warning to other bosses in Silicon Valley, where observers have long warned of a \"fake it until you make it\" culture. <br/>Still, it is rare to see tech bosses go to prison on fraud charges.<br/>The US government hopes that Holmes's plight will deter executives from making outlandish claims about what their technology can do while hunting for financial backing. <br/>Eileen Lepera, who lost part of her savings investing in Theranos, told the BBC this week that she is \"glad she [Ms Holmes] got 11 years\". <br/>\"Her hubris is beyond belief,\" she added. \"I don't believe she's still taking any responsibility for what has happened.\" <br/>In tearful remarks ahead of her sentencing in November, Holmes said she regrets her failings at Theranos \"with every cell in my body\" but did not admit any criminal wrongdoing."}, {"_id": "648a000e51ac3319f5477e1e", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65746524?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Artificial intelligence could lead to extinction, experts warn", "lead": "Heads of OpenAI, Google Deepmind and Anthropic say the threat is as great as pandemics and nuclear war.", "author": "By Chris Vallance", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:42.420526", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B80/production/_129902572_gettyimages-1257740282.jpg", "body": "Artificial intelligence could lead to the extinction of humanity, experts - including the heads of OpenAI and Google Deepmind - have warned.<br/>Dozens have supported a statement published on the webpage of the Centre for AI Safety.<br/>\"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\" it reads.<br/>But others say the fears are overblown. <br/>Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Demis Hassabis, chief executive of Google DeepMind and Dario Amodei of Anthropic have all supported the statement.<br/>The Centre for AI Safety website suggests a number of possible disaster scenarios:<br/>Dr Geoffrey Hinton, who issued an earlier warning about risks from super-intelligent AI, has also supported the Centre for AI Safety's call.<br/>Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science at the university of Montreal, also signed.<br/>Dr Hinton, Prof Bengio and NYU Professor Yann LeCun are often described as the \"godfathers of AI\" for their groundbreaking work in the field - for which they jointly won the 2018 Turing Award, which recognises outstanding contributions in computer science. <br/>But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta, has said these apocalyptic warnings are overblown tweeting that \"the most common reaction by AI researchers to these prophecies of doom is face palming\". <br/>Many other experts similarly believe that fears of AI wiping out humanity are unrealistic, and a distraction from issues such as bias in systems that are already a problem.<br/>Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University, has previously told the BBC that sci-fi-like disaster scenarios are unrealistic: \"Current AI is nowhere near capable enough for these risks to materialise.

They would \"drive an exponential increase in the volume and spread of misinformation, thereby fracturing reality and eroding the public trust, and drive further inequality, particularly for those who remain on the wrong side of the digital divide\". <br/>Many AI tools essentially \"free ride\" on the \"whole of human experience to date\", Ms Renieris said. Many are trained on human-created content, text, art and music they can then imitate - and their creators \"have effectively transferred tremendous wealth and power from the public sphere to a small handful of private entities\". <br/>But Centre for AI Safety director Dan Hendrycks told BBC News future risks and present concerns \"shouldn't be viewed antagonistically\". <br/>\"Addressing some of the issues today can be useful for addressing many of the later risks tomorrow,\" he said.<br/>Media coverage of the supposed \"existential\" threat from AI has snowballed since March 2023 when experts, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a halt to the development of the next generation of AI technology.<br/>That letter asked if we should \"develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us\".<br/>In contrast, the new campaign has a very short statement, designed to \"open up discussion\".<br/>The statement compares the risk to that posed by nuclear war.

That's despite Intel reporting more than $63bn in revenue last year, compared with Nvidia's $27bn. <br/>Geir Lode, head of global equities at Federated Hermes, said the magnitude of the recent leap in Nvidia's share price was \"an astonishing surprise even to techno-optimists\". <br/>\"Artificial intelligence is the next super charged growth area, and we expect this is just the beginning,\" Mr Lode said. \"We know growth will be there, but valuations can be hard to justify.\"<br/>Investor Cathie Wood, chief executive of Ark Invest, who is known as a tech booster, sold her stake in Nvidia in January, missing the gains made since then.<br/>She recently tweeted that the firm's shares were \"priced ahead of the curve\". She said markets were making a mistake to think the company was \"the only AI play\".<br/>In the past, investors have not hesitated to sour on former favourites. <br/>Facebook-owner Meta, which joined the $1tn club in 2021, was booted out just a few months later, as its shares lost roughly three quarters of their value.

She would jump at the chance, he says, \"to step in... and say, 'I can fix this'\".<br/>Which begs the question: can she?<br/>Even before billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, the social network had problems.<br/>It has been fiercely criticised, by the left and right, for how it polices misinformation and hate speech, and the business has struggled to break even - making an annual profit just twice since its launch in 2006.<br/>Growth, whether measured by users or the money it brings in, has been bumpy.<br/>Since Mr Musk took over the platform last year, the issues have only gotten worse.<br/>He has cut 75% of its former staff, including teams charged with tracking abuse; changed how the company verifies authentic accounts; and sparked debate with his own tweets spreading conspiracy theories.<br/>Advertisers have left in large numbers and users also appear sceptical. A recent poll by Pew found that six in 10 adults in the US, Twitter's largest base, were taking a break and a quarter said they did not expect to be using the app in a year.<br/>Even Mr Musk has seemed daunted by the challenges, going through with his $44bn purchase last year only under threat of a lawsuit. He has joked that only someone \"foolish\" would want the chief executive title from him.<br/>Ms Yaccarino appears undaunted. <br/>Raised in an Italian-American family, the daughter of a police officer has risen through the ranks of some of the biggest media companies in the US, forging a reputation as a high-heeled and hard-charging executive, who has helped steer entertainment giant NBCUniversal through the upheaval wrought by the growth of the tech giants.<br/>At NBCU, home to brands such as NBC News, Focus Features and Bravo, Ms Yaccarino overhauled the ad sales business, pushed the 2020 launch of its ad-supported streaming platform Peacock, and drove industry-wide debates about data gaps as audiences migrated online. <br/>The mother-of-two, who met her husband Claude Madrazo on a blind date and became a grandmother last year, was known to want some kind of promotion after a decade at NBCU where she was chairman of global advertising and partnerships. <br/>There was widespread speculation about her interest in Twitter, especially after she defended Mr Musk at a conference last year, urging critical advertisers to \"give the guy a minute\". <br/>\"I've long been inspired by your vision to create a brighter future,\" she tweeted after her new post was announced. \"I'm excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!\"<br/>By hiring Ms Yaccarino, Mr Musk has \"purchased trust\" from advertisers, says Mr Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory.<br/>Indeed, industry giant GroupM, who represents brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestle, has already said it sees the platform as less risky.<br/>But repairing Twitter's business will be no small task. <br/>Though big ad buyers are eager to have choices beyond the tech giants, the platform remains too small to be a must-buy, says long-time media analyst Brian Wieser, now principal at consultancy Madison and Wall. <br/>Beyond advertising, she will also face a host of pressing issues: regulatory scrutiny of Twitter's hate speech and privacy controls; lawsuits from landlords, vendors and former staff over unpaid bills; not to mention user complaints and basic tech glitches, like the malfunctions that plagued the high-profile interview with Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis hosted on the platform. <br/>The biggest wild card of all, of course, is Mr Musk, who has said he intends to remain involved at the site, overseeing products and technology. <br/>\"Anybody taking this job has been set up to fail - it's not specific to her,\" Mr Wieser says. \"The question is whether or not the odds are more likely to be in her favour than any alternative.

He can also now stand and climb stairs.<br/>\"It has been a long journey, but now I can stand up and have a beer with my friend. It's a pleasure that many people don't realise.\"<br/>The development, published in the journal Nature, was led by Swiss researchers. Prof Jocelyne Bloch, of Lausanne University, who is the neurosurgeon who carried out the delicate surgery to insert the implants, stressed that the system was still at a basic research stage and was many years away from being available to paralysed patients. <br/>But she told BBC News that it was the team's aim to get it out of the lab and into the clinic as soon as possible.<br/>\"The important thing for us is not just to have a scientific trial, but eventually to give more access to more people with spinal cord injuries who are used to hearing from doctors that they have to get used to the fact that they will never move again.\"<br/>Harvey Sihota is chief executive of the UK charity Spinal Research, which was not involved in the research. He said that although there was a long way to go before the technology would be generally available, he described the development as \"very encouraging\".<br/>\"While there is still much to improve with these technologies this is another exciting step on the roadmap for neurotechnology and its role in restoring function and independence to our spinal cord injury community\".<br/>The operation to restore Gert-Jan's movement was carried out in July 2021. Prof Bloch cut two circular holes on each side of his skull, 5cm in diameter, above the regions of the brain involved in controlling movement. She then inserted two disc-shaped implants which wirelessly transmit brain signals - Gert-Jan's intentions - to two sensors attached to a helmet on his head.<br/>The Swiss team developed an algorithm which translates these signals into instructions to move leg and foot muscles via a second implant inserted around Gert-Jan's spinal cord - which Prof Bloch intricately attached to the nerve endings related to walking.<br/>The researchers found that after a few weeks of training he could stand and walk with the aid of a walker. His movement is slow but smooth, according to Prof Gr\u00e9goire Courtine of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale in Lausanne (EPFL),  who led the project.<br/>\"Seeing him walk so naturally is so moving,\" he said. \"It is a paradigm shift in what was available before\".<br/>The brain implants build on Prof Courtine's earlier work, when only the spinal implant was used to restore movement. The spinal implant amplified weak signals from the brain to the damaged part of the spinal column and was boosted further by pre-programmed signals from a computer.<br/>BBC News reported how  in 2018, David M'Zee became the first patient to be successfully treated with a spinal implant, so much so that he was able to have a baby with his wife, something that had not been possible previously. <br/>And last year we reported how as the result of the same technology, Michel Roccati became the first man with a completely severed spine to walk again.<br/>Both have benefitted tremendously but their walking motion is pre-programmed and looks robotic. They also have to keep their intended movements in step with the computer and have to stop and reset if they get out of sync.<br/>Gert-Jan had only the spinal implant before he had the brain implants. He says that he now has much greater control.<br/>\"I felt before that the system was controlling me, but now I am controlling it\".Neither the previous or new systems can be used constantly. They are bulky and still at an experimental stage. <br/>Instead, patients use them for an hour or so for a few times a week as part of their recuperation. The act of walking trains their muscles and has restored a degree of movement when the system is turned off, suggesting that damaged nerves may be regrowing.<br/>The eventual aim is to miniaturise the technology. Prof Courtine's spin out company Onward Medical, is making improvements to commercialise the technology so it can be used in people's day-to-day lives.<br/>\"It's coming,\" says Prof Courtine,. \"Gert-Jan received the implant 10 years after his accident. Imagine when we apply our brain-spine interface a few weeks after the injury.

However, he has managed to retain his billionaire status - he has a net worth of \u00a32.4bn according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. <br/>When it became clear Virgin Orbit was unable to secure long-term funding, it filed for bankruptcy protection in the US early last month. <br/>Rival start-up Rocket Lab has bought most of Virgin Orbit's headquarters in California as well as other assets. The company's Boeing 747 plane, which was converted to help launch satellites, has also been sold off. In total, the asset sale fetched $36.4m (\u00a329.4m).<br/>Virgin Orbit, which was founded in 2017, never made a profit as a public company.<br/>So much was riding on Virgin Orbit's rocket launch from Cornwall in January, it was supposed to be a spectacular start to a new industry in the UK.<br/>But the dislodging of a small component - a fuel filter - had a domino effect. The rocket failed, confidence was lost in Virgin Orbit and now the company has been sold off, piecemeal. <br/>Where does this leave Spaceport Cornwall, the UK's first licensed spaceport? US-based Virgin Orbit was their key customer.   <br/>The Cornwall team there say they're working with other launch companies, including Sierra Space, and they'll continue to create and grow a space cluster in the South West. <br/>But another Cornwall blast off is unlikely to happen anytime soon. The site at Newquay Airport is limited to horizontal launches - where a plane takes off, carrying a rocket, which is then launched mid-flight.  <br/>Other sites around the UK have their sights set on space too. SaxaVord Spaceport, based on the Shetland island of Unst, is now leading the way.<br/>This is a vertical launch site where rockets blast off skywards from a pad. SaxaVord is working with several firms, including a German company called Rocket Factory Augsburg - engine testing is set to take place in Shetland later this year.<br/>And it's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland.

also used in apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage - prevents law enforcement and the firms themselves from identifying the sharing of child sexual abuse material.<br/>Mr Tugendhat said: \"Faced with an epidemic of child sexual exploitation abuse, Meta are choosing to ignore it and in doing so, they are allowing predators to operate with impunity. <br/>\"That is an extraordinary moral choice. It is an extraordinary decision. And I think we should remember who it is who is making it.\"<br/>He was speaking at the PIER23 conference on tackling online harms at Anglia Ruskin University Chelmsford.<br/>The security minister singled out the Meta boss for criticism. <br/>\"I am speaking about Meta specifically, and Mark Zuckerberg's choices particularly. These are his choices,\" he said.<br/>A government advertising campaign will soon be launched \"to tell parents the truth about Meta's choices and what they mean for the safety of their children\", he said. <br/>The campaign, which would run in print, online and broadcast, would \"encourage tech firms to take responsibility and to do the right thing\", Mr Tugendhat said.<br/>The Home Office declined to provide more detail about the campaign when approached by the BBC.<br/>Meta argues the majority of British people already rely on apps that use encryption to keep them safe from hackers, fraudsters and criminals.<br/>\"We don't think people want us reading their private messages so have developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security\", it said.<br/>The company removes and reports millions of images each month. <br/>WhatsApp, which Meta owns, made more than one million reports in a year even though it uses end-to-end-encryption.<br/>The Home Office has promoted similar campaigns in the past, such as last year's No Place to Hide campaign, which also called on Facebook to abandon plans for end-to-end encryption. <br/>But the data watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office was critical of the campaign, arguing the tech helped protect children from criminals and abusers, urged Facebook to roll it out without delay.<br/>The Online Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament, contains powers that could enable communication regulator Ofcom to direct platforms to use accredited technology to scan the contents of messages.<br/>Several messaging platforms, including Signal and WhatsApp, have previously told the BBC they will refuse to weaken the privacy of their encrypted messaging systems if directed to do so.<br/>The government argues it is possible to provide technological solutions that mean the contents of encrypted messages can be scanned for child abuse material.<br/>The only way of doing that, many tech experts argue, would be to install software that would scan messages on the phone or computer before they are sent, called client-side scanning.<br/>This, critics argue, would fundamentally undermine the privacy of messages and to argue otherwise would be like arguing that digging a hole under a fence did not break the fence<br/>Signal told the BBC in February that it would \"walk\" from the UK if forced to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging app.<br/>In response to the minister's comments, its president Meredith Whittaker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was trying to implement \"a mass surveillance apparatus\". It would, she said, require people to \"run government-mandated scanning services on their devices\".<br/>Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, told Today that: \"Essentially it's building a door that doesn't currently exist, not into the encrypted messaging app but into devices, which could be used or misused by people who aren't interested in protecting children for more nefarious purposes.\" <br/>Mr Martin said he believed the UK would end up in the \"unhappy situation\" where the power in the bill would be passed by Parliament but not used. <br/>Apple tried client-side scanning, but abandoned it after a backlash. In an article in the Financial Times, Mr Martin suggested Apple is privately critical of the powers in the bill, but the firm has so far declined to set out publicly its position on the issue.<br/>BBC News learned from Freedom of Information requests that Apple has had four meetings since April 2022 with the Ofcom team responsible for developing policy regarding the enforcement of the relevant section of the bill.

The testers said Evolv should inform potential clients.<br/>Despite this, the company has been expanding into schools, and now claims to be in hundreds of them across the US. <br/>In March 2022, the Utica Schools Board bought Evolv's weapons scanning system for 13 schools. It was installed over the summer holidays.<br/>On 31 October, CCTV captured the perpetrator of the attack against Ehni Ler Htoo entering Proctor High School and passing through the Evolv weapons scanners, according to one source at the school who has seen the security footage. <br/>\"When we viewed the horrific video, we all asked the same question. How did the student get the knife into the school?\" said Brian Nolan, Superintendent of Utica Schools.<br/>The knife used in the stabbing was more than 9in (22.8cm) long. <br/>The attack triggered an internal investigation by Utica's school district. <br/>\"Through investigation it was determined the Evolv Weapon Detection System\u2026 was not designed to detect knives,\" Mr Nolan said.<br/>The scanners were removed from Proctor High School and replaced by 10 metal detectors. But the scanners are still operating in the district's remaining 12 schools. Mr Nolan says the district cannot afford to get rid of Evolv's system in its remaining schools. <br/>Since that attack, Mr Nolan says three other knives have been found on students in other schools in the district where the Evolv systems continue to operate. <br/>One of the knives was 7in long. Another was a curved blade with finger holes. Another was a pocket knife. Mr Nolan says they were all found because they were reported to staff - not because the weapons scanner had detected them. <br/>\"The kids [who had the knives] all said they walked right through the weapons detection system, we asked them about that\u2026 it truly, truly does not find knives,\" he said.<br/>After the stabbing, the wording on Evolv's website changed. <br/>Up until October last year, Evolv's homepage featured a headline that boasted of \"Weapons-Free Zones\". The company then removed that wording, and changed the text  to \"Safe Zones\". It has now been changed again and reads \"Safer Zones\". <br/>Evolv claims its system uses cutting-edge AI technology to find weapons. However, its critics say not enough is known about how the system works - or how effective this technology is at finding different types of weapons.<br/>The BBC sent a detailed right of reply to Evolv, laying out what had happened at the school in Utica, and the decision of the school to stop using its system. <br/>We also asked what Evolv had told schools about what its system could and could not detect, whether it had told schools that independent testing had found its systems could not reliably detect large knives, and whether it thought its systems were suitable for use in schools. Evolv did not answer the questions.<br/>Conor Healy of IPVM, a firm that analyses security equipment, says Evolv has exaggerated how effective the system is.<br/>\"There's an epidemic of schools buying new technology based on audacious marketing claims, then finding out it has hidden flaws, often millions of dollars later. Evolv is one of the worst offenders. School officials are not technical experts on weapons detection, and companies like Evolv profit from their ignorance.\"<br/>Playing fast and loose with marketing claims is unacceptable when you sell a security product used to protect young people, he added.<br/>Although Evolv did not give the BBC a comment, it did direct it to a blog post from its CEO, Peter George, in which he defends the lack of detail in how much the firm has said about how the technology works. <br/>\"Marketing weapons detection security requires a delicate balance between educating stakeholders on new technology and not providing bad actors with the information they could use to do harm,\" he said. <br/>\"So, while public-facing marketing materials are intentionally not specific, we communicate all aspects of the Evolv Express system - including limitations and\u202fcapabilities - with the trusted security professionals at our customers, partners, and prospects\", the blogpost read. <br/>The BBC contacted seven other school districts that all use Evolv weapons scanners. Five did not respond. Two said they did not wish to comment."}, {"_id": "648a001c51ac3319f5477e32", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65679356?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "WhatsApp to allow users to edit messages within 15 minutes", "lead": "The instant-messaging service, which is used by 2 billion people, counts India as its largest market.", "author": "By Annabelle Liang", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:59:56.878313", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E2D9/production/_129837085_f46af221921b9b965194b8f638f605003e571ead.jpg", "body": "WhatsApp says it will allow users to edit messages, in a move that will see it match a feature offered by competitors like Telegram and Discord.<br/>The firm says messages can be edited for up to 15 minutes after being sent.<br/>The instant-messaging service is part of US technology giant Meta, which also owns Facebook and Instagram.<br/>The feature will made be available to WhatsApp's 2 billion users in the coming weeks.

This week Ireland saw semiconductor firm ADI invest \u20ac630m in a research and manufacturing facility in Limerick.<br/>The chair of the House of Commons Business Select Committee, Labour MP Darren Jones, welcomed the strategy and the recognition of the need to invest but added, \"the initial \u00a3250m is a very small amount of subsidy compared to other countries\".<br/>Under the strategy \u00a3200m will be invested between 2023-25 to provide infrastructure for industry, fund more research, and promote international co-operation.<br/>Labour shadow culture minister Lucy Powell said that after years of delays, the strategy would be met with disappointment and showed \"significantly less ambition than our competitors\".<br/>Gaurav Gupta of consultants Gartner said the funding was fine for research, but if the ambition was to be competitive with the big players in the field - Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom and AMD then the \u00a31bn was \"insignificant\".<br/>Dr Simon Thomas, chief executive of UK based graphene semiconductor start-up Paragraf, told the BBC the announcement was \"quite frankly flaccid\". <br/>\"It is a long way from addressing the needs of UK chipmakers,\" he said. <br/>Zoe Kleinman, the BBC's technology editor said: \"Many businesses making hardware say when there's a shortage, it's difficult to get a look-in with the enormous chip manufacturers because their output is hoovered up by giants like Apple with far deeper pockets than anybody else. <br/>\"Will the UK government have sharp enough elbows to muscle in?

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\""}, {"_id": "648a002851ac3319f5477e3e", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65669537?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why millions of usable hard drives are being destroyed", "lead": "It is estimated that 90% of hard drives are destroyed.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman."}, {"_id": "648a002851ac3319f5477e3f", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65532128?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The tech tricks that make computer games look real", "lead": "Computer games are becoming indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:08.768749", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1580A/production/_129647088_cyberpunk_2077_street_bike_rtxon_badged.png", "body": "The police officer approaches a derelict, graffiti-scrawled industrial building.

People who would kill him.<br/>\"This is the only game I've ever seen that actually confuses my brain into thinking it's real,\" reads the top comment below the YouTube video of gameplay from Unrecord, an upcoming title by French indie game studio Drama.<br/>The video chalked up millions of views in just a few weeks and caused a sensation in the games industry. Some commentators on social media questioned if it really was a game and, if so, whether it was actually a little too real - too raw - an experience.<br/>Drama declined an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We are currently busy with investors and publishers.\"<br/>But graphics in many different games have been getting noticeably more sophisticated, arguably approaching what's known as \"photorealism\" - indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.<br/>The Unrecord demo looks so lifelike partly thanks to some clever techniques, says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points to the shaky camera, which imitates actual crime scene footage. The dull lighting, grittiness and urban bustle audible in the background all help, too.<br/>But could it make some people uncomfortable?<br/>\"That setting for it is quite reminiscent of some of the more horrendous footage you get out of real life,\" notes Mr Harding-Rolls. <br/>In a statement posted on Twitter, Drama said the game is not inspired by specific real-life events.<br/>Also, look closely at still images from the video and it's possible to see some objects and textures that don't look realistic at all. This might not matter - but it does undermine the idea that the game is photorealistic.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points out that, in general, advances in graphics matter for the games industry: \"Consumers definitely want that. They love looking at things and thinking, 'Wow, this looks amazing'.\"<br/>Rachel McDonnell, professor in creative technologies, Trinity College Dublin agrees that the Unrecord video is impressive, though she notes that certain character animations are a little clunky.<br/>They call to mind the movement of characters in other games falling over and dying in pre-programmed sequences.<br/>\"Animation hasn't caught up with the rendering at all in games yet,\" she says, adding that crowds are particularly tricky to make lifelike.<br/>\"You'll still see them doing very strange behaviour, running around in circles and getting stuck - that instantly breaks you from your presence in the game.\"<br/>Experiments she and her colleagues have conducted suggest that, for players' immersion in games, how an on-screen character looks is much less important than how they move.<br/>Marc Whitten, president of Create Solutions at game software firm Unity notes that today's most realistic content relies on highly-detailed 3D modelling of objects.<br/>Last year, Unity showed off a computer generated clip of a lion and its cub featuring two million individually rendered strands of fur.<br/>\"If you don't do that, it does not come across as photorealism,\" argues Mr Whitten. The firm has also developed highly lifelike models of humans, where digital puppetry controls their subtle facial expressions.<br/>There's still room for improvement, he adds. There are many other difficult-to-simulate materials, such as clothing, which are still a long way from looking photorealistic in games.<br/>One important emerging technology for game graphics is neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. California-based Luma AI specialises in this and says it already has customers using the tech to make games.<br/>A NeRF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can represent objects or scenery captured in photographs or video footage in the real world. <br/>\"When you show it these images from different sides, the network learns how light is bouncing off of everything,\" explains Luma AI co-founder Amit Jain. \"It measures light and it learns from light.\"<br/>The way light reflects off a motorbike's leather seat versus a headlamp, for example, is completely different and simulating that in a game is very challenging. Nerfs could help to automate the process.<br/>Some of the best game graphics today use what's known as ray-tracing - accurate simulations of the way light bounces off surfaces or creates glowing effects around neon signs and so on. <br/>AI is making it possible to produce these effects in games despite only modest improvements in chip performance, says Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research, Nvidia.<br/>\"We have to be smarter in how we construct the world and how we render it,\" he explains.<br/>A new mode for Cyberpunk 2077, an action-adventure game, called Ray Tracing: Overdrive, demonstrates the difference this can make.<br/>Nvidia says its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology allows developers to create high resolution, high frame-rate graphics featuring ray-tracing with the help of AI.<br/>\"The model's trained to know what things in the real-world look like,\" explains Mr Catanzaro.<br/>Games are increasingly difficult to tell apart from real life at times, says Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games.<br/>However he says it is still very hard to render certain materials convincingly - such as an iridescent layer of oil on a puddle of water.<br/>\"Those are aspects that we don't yet have the power to simulate in real time,\" he says.<br/>And doing that on games consoles or home PCs is what matters. For movies featuring computer generated imagery, it's possible to use huge computers and take many minutes or more to render individual frames.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The most popular games of the future might not need to be photorealistic. Consider Minecraft or Epic's own Fortnite - both enormously successful, both very far from photoreal. <br/>Improved lighting effects and material simulations help artists working on all kinds of games, though, argues Mr Penwarden. It can give stylised or cartoonish environments more depth and complexity, too.<br/>\"One of the great benefits about having the ability to do photoreal images is the tech can start to do a lot of the work for you,\" he says."}, {"_id": "648a002951ac3319f5477e40", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65678967?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Elizabeth Holmes has gone to prison.

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\""}, {"_id": "648a002951ac3319f5477e41", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65321487?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The 'exploding' demand for giant heat pumps", "lead": "Whole towns in Europe are being heated by huge, energy efficient heat pumps.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:09.385047", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/042A/production/_129766010_f91b782b-55ab-46ab-9866-7ebe54e08d24.jpg", "body": "There are 2.5 million litres of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. <br/>If for some reason you wanted to bring it from a pleasant 20C to boiling point, German firm MAN Energy Solutions (MAN ES) has a heat pump that could do it. And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\""}, {"_id": "648a002a51ac3319f5477e42", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65729383?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Neuralink: Why is Elon Musk\u2019s brain chip firm in the news?", "lead": "Elon Musk\u2019s brain chip firm Neuralink has received the US regulatory green light for its first human clinical trial, after earlier controversies.", "author": "By Shiona McCallum", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:10.016416", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7852/production/_122520803_gettyimages-1194820617.jpg", "body": "Elon Musk's brain chip firm Neuralink has said that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its first human clinical trial, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain approval. <br/>The FDA nod \"represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people,\" Neuralink said in a tweet. <br/>It did not elaborate on the aims of the study, saying only that it was not recruiting yet, and more details would be available soon. <br/>The firm says it is trying to create a new way to allow computers to communicate directly with the human brain.  <br/>The hope is that by doing this, Neuralink would be able to tackle complex neurological conditions which have so far proved beyond the capability of medical intervention. These range from paralysis and blindness to depression and schizophrenia. <br/>The procedure would involve implanting a tiny hermetically sealed chip directly into a patient's brain. <br/>The chip is connected to 1,024 tiny electrodes, no thicker than a human hair and is powered by a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. It would create an interface with an external computer, allowing it to both send and receive signals.<br/>There are three elements to this: short term physical risks; long term medical concerns; and ethical safety. <br/>Any surgery involving the brain carries inherent danger, both of physical harm and rejection by the host. There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals. <br/>A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology. <br/>The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges. <br/>Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand. <br/>Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products. <br/>The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement. <br/>This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector.<br/>The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company.<br/>Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet. <br/>When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today. <br/>Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain. <br/>There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds. <br/>Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players. <br/>Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed. <br/>That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe.

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\""}, {"_id": "648a002a51ac3319f5477e44", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65034773?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "ChatGPT: Can China overtake the US in the AI marathon?", "lead": "Washington's efforts to limit China's access to crucial cutting-edge technology continue.", "author": "By Derek Cai & Annabelle Liang", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:10.911493", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13738/production/_129327697_gettyimages-1248931741.jpg", "body": "Artificial intelligence has emerged as enough of a concern that it made it onto what was already a packed agenda at the G7 summit at the weekend.<br/>Concerns about AI's harmful impact coincide with the US' attempts to restrict China's access to crucial technology.<br/>For now, the US seems to be ahead in the AI race. And there is already the possibility that current restrictions on semiconductor exports to China could hamper Beijing's technological progress.<br/>But China could catch up, according to analysts, as AI solutions take years to be perfected. Chinese internet companies \"are arguably more advanced than US internet companies, depending on how you're measuring advancement,\" Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China tells the BBC.<br/>However, she says China's \"ability to manufacture high-end equipment and components is an estimated 10 to 15 years behind global leaders.\"<br/>The US' biggest advantage is Silicon Valley, arguably the world's supreme entrepreneurial hotspot. It is the birthplace of technology giants such as Google, Apple and Intel that have helped shape modern life.<br/>Innovators in the country have been helped by its unique research culture, says Pascale Fung, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br/>Researchers often spend years working to improve a technology without a product in mind, Ms Fung says.<br/>OpenAI, for example, operated as a non-profit company for years as it researched the Transformers machine learning model, which eventually powered ChatGPT.<br/>\"This environment never existed in most Chinese companies. They would build deep learning systems or large language models only after they saw the popularity,\" she adds. \"This is a fundamental challenge to Chinese AI.\"<br/>US investors have also been supportive of the country's research push. In 2019, Microsoft said it would put $1bn (\u00a3810,000) in to OpenAI.<br/>\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time and has the potential to help solve many of our world's most pressing challenges,\" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said.<br/>China, meanwhile, benefits from a larger consumer base. It is the world's second-most populous country, home to roughly 1.4 billion people.<br/>It also has a thriving internet sector, says Edith Yeung, a partner at the Race Capital investment firm.<br/>Nearly everyone in the country uses the super app WeChat, for example. It is used for almost everything from sending text messages, to booking doctor's appointments and filing taxes.<br/>As a result, there's a wealth of information that can be used to improve products. \"The AI model is going to be only as good as the data that is available for it to learn from,\" Ms Yeung says.<br/>\"For good or bad, China has a lot less rules around privacy, and a lot more data [compared to the US]. There's CCTV facial recognition everywhere, for example,\" she adds. \"Imagine how useful that would be for AI-generated images.\"<br/>While China's tech community may appear to be lagging behind the US, its developers have an edge, according to Lee Kai-Fu, who makes the argument in his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.<br/>\"They live in a world where speed is essential, copying is an accepted practice, and competitors will stop at nothing to win a new market,\" wrote Mr Lee, a prominent figure in Beijing's internet sector and the former head of Google China.<br/>\"This rough-and-tumble environment makes a strong contrast to Silicon Valley, where copying is stigmatised and many companies are allowed to coast on the basis of one original idea or lucky break.\"<br/>China's copycat era has its problems, including serious issues around intellectual property. Mr Lee writes that it has led to a generation of hardy and nimble entrepreneurs ready to compete.<br/>Since the 1980s, China has been expanding its economy, which used to be based mainly on manufacturing, to one that is technology-based, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"In the last decade, we have seen more innovation from Chinese consumer-driven internet companies and high-end Chinese designs,\" she adds.<br/>While Chinese tech companies certainly have unique advantages, the full impact of Beijing's authoritarianism is still unclear.<br/>There are questions, for instance, about whether censorship would affect development of Chinese AI chatbots. Will they be able to answer sensitive questions about President Xi Jinping?<br/>\"I don't think anyone in China will ask controversial questions on Baidu or Ernie in the first place. They know it's censored,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Sensitive topics are a very small part of the usage [of chatbots]. They just get more media attention,\" Ms Fung adds.<br/>The bigger concern is that US attempts to restrict China's access to specialised tech can stymie the latter's AI industry.<br/>High-performing computer chips, or semiconductors, are now the source of much tension between Washington and Beijing. They are used in everyday products including laptops and smartphones, and could have military applications. They are also crucial to the hardware required for AI learning.<br/>US companies like Nvidia currently have the lead in developing AI chips and \"few [Chinese] companies can compete against ChatGPT\" given export restrictions, Ms Fung says.<br/>While this will hit China's high-tech industries like cutting edge AI, it won't affect the production of consumer technology, such as mobiles and laptops. This is because \"the export controls are designed to prevent China from developing advanced AI for military purposes,\" Ms Schaefer says.<br/>To overcome this, China needs its own Silicon Valley - a research culture that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"So far it has relied on both domestic talent and those from overseas with Chinese heritage. There is a limit to homogeneous cultural thinking,\" she adds.<br/>Beijing has been trying to close the gap through its \"Big Fund\", which offers massive incentives to chip companies.<br/>But it has also tightened its grip on the sector. In March, Zhao Weiguo became the latest technology tycoon to be accused of corruption by authorities.<br/>Beijing's focus on certain industries can bring financial incentives and loosen red tape, but it may also mean greater scrutiny, and more fear and uncertainty.<br/>\"Zhao's arrest is a message for other state-owned firms: don't mess around with state money, particularly in the chip space,\" Ms Schaefer says. \"Now it's time to get on with the job.\"<br/>How that message will affect the future of China's AI industry remains to be seen."}, {"_id": "648a002b51ac3319f5477e45", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65626371?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why car parks are the hottest space in solar power", "lead": "Car parks are a good place for solar panels, providing shade and electricity where it is needed.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:11.527318", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1785A/production/_129764369_newsolarcarparkcanopy2-credit-jontillott.jpg", "body": "There's more than just cars and empty spaces in this car park.

The canopies have additional benefits in that they protect cars from rain and snow, or hot sun in the summer.<br/>In a drive to boost clean energy production, the French Senate recently approved legislation that makes it mandatory for all existing and new car parks with 80 spaces or more to be covered by solar panels. <br/>While there is no equivalent requirement in the UK, solar car parks have been around for years and there are signs that they are beginning to boom here. With electricity prices currently still elevated, many businesses are turning to on-site renewables to try to keep costs down in the long run. <br/>There is a huge opportunity to turn more British car parks into solar farms, according to a new report published by the countryside charity CPRE and the UCL Energy Institute.<br/>\"We think the total potential in the built environment is about 117GW,\" says Prof Mark Barrett of UCL. \"And of that, 11GW, we think, is car parks.\"<br/>For context, the UK currently has around 15GW of solar capacity in total and requires 40GW by 2030 in order to meet net zero targets, according to Solar Energy UK.<br/>Prof Barrett notes that the figure of 11GW is conservative and is based on an estimate of 130 sq km of available car parks in the UK - lower than the 200 sq km estimated by estate agents Knight Frank. The CPRE and UCL report also assumed that 50% of each individual car park would be covered by a canopy rather than 100%.<br/>Whichever way you look at it, there's plenty of space out there in car parks for solar panels and people are beginning to realise this. <br/>\"It's absolutely gone crazy,\" says Mr Chilvers, referring to his inbox.

Mr Chilvers and his colleagues design and build the steel structures for solar canopies while the panels are supplied separately.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Rival companies that spoke to the BBC also described high demand for solar car park canopies.<br/>Praxia Energy, based in Spain, supplies about 3MW of car park solar installations in the UK each year and says it expects this to grow tenfold by 2028. <br/>A spokeswoman for Veolia says the company recently installed a 1.1MW solar canopy system in the car park of Eastbourne Hospital and the firm has registered increased demand for solar infrastructure in the UK lately. <br/>Solarsense, a company in Clevedon, says it has also received rising enquiries in recent months.<br/>Tim Evans, chief executive of 3ti, argues that, in the past, the UK has been slow to pursue this technology in comparison with countries on the continent. \"We are quite some way behind the curve,\" he says.<br/>There are some flagship examples already in place, though. The largest solar car park installed to date in the UK is the one at the Bentley car factory in Crewe, which has a peak capacity of 2.7MW. <br/>Mr Evans says he is currently exploring four new potential projects with clients that could exceed 5MW peak capacity.<br/>Solar panels in car parks can also power electric vehicle (EV) charging. This works especially well at offices, where employees' cars are parked outside for many hours. Shopping centres, football stadiums, leisure centres and cinemas are also suitable venues, since cars tend to be parked for two hours or more to allow sufficient charging, says Mr Evans. <br/>But the steel supports required for many solar canopies do add to the cost. It is often cheaper to simply put solar panels on the roof of large buildings, such as supermarkets. Mr Evans estimates that rooftop solar yields electricity at about 9p per kWh currently, versus 14p or 15p per kWh from panels in car parks.<br/>There aren't many other obvious downsides to the canopies, though, says Richard Watkins at the University of Kent. He notes that installers might want to fit them with efficient under-canopy lighting so that they don't result in dark, potentially dangerous spaces at night.<br/>One hiccup facing many renewable energy projects at the moment is a lack of grid connections, since surplus energy generated by solar panels, for example, must be handled by the grid. Billions of pounds worth of renewable installations are effectively on hold because of this issue, according to BBC research.<br/>\"I've just had a megawatt car park, beautiful car park, for a factory turned down because it can't get a grid connection,\" says Mr Chilvers. <br/>A spokesman for Solar Energy UK also highlights this problem, saying that solar car parks becoming a common sight will remain a \"distant prospect\" until it is resolved.<br/>The energy industry regulator Ofgem is looking at ways to speed up connections and National Grid also has a plan to improve the process.<br/>There are lots of other locations around the UK, besides car parks, that could also accommodate solar installations and help us ditch fossil fuels, notes Prof Sara Walker at Newcastle University. Cycle paths and railways, for instance, or reservoirs that can be covered with floating solar panels. These also help reduce the evaporative loss of water from reservoirs.<br/>\"Where we can co-locate solar photovoltaics alongside infrastructure that would be there anyway, like a car park, it enables us to get double use out of the land surface,\" she says."}, {"_id": "648a002b51ac3319f5477e46", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65468298?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "How the power of protein is being uncovered", "lead": "Artificial intelligence has transformed research into proteins and promises new drugs and materials.", "author": "By Ben Morris", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:11.757337", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1301A/production/_129605877_img_8334.jpg", "body": "The Light Gas Gun at the University of Kent is an unwieldy device which, to me, looks more like a lathe than a gun.<br/>Despite its lumbering appearance the gun can fire projectiles at a speed of 1.5km per second, or around 3,500mph, that's almost twice the speed of a bullet.<br/>Today it has been loaded up with a piece of of basalt rock, a bit smaller than a pea, which will be blasted at a very special gel. <br/>The gel is made of the protein talin - or at least a version of the protein that has been refined and tweaked to give it an extraordinary ability to absorb impacts, as we are about to find out.<br/>We are herded out of the gun room and after a quick countdown the gun operator, Luke Alesbrook, pushes the button, triggering the gun.<br/>Back inside smoke wafts from the gun barrel as the target is removed. On inspection, the gel has been pushed around a bit but, amazingly, is still intact.<br/>What's important is that the metal plate behind the gel is not damaged. Without the gel the basalt would have torn a chunk out of the plate.<br/>Talin can absorb force thanks to unique mechanical properties. Its structure includes spirals of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - which form bundles. When pulled the bundles unfurl, increasing the length of the protein by a factor of 10.<br/>When the stress is released the bundles snap back into their original position, kind of like a spring.<br/>Prof Ben Goult worked out the structure of talin and how it responds to forces and, with his colleague Prof Jennifer Hiscock, they came up with the idea of making talin into a shock-absorbing material.<br/>\"I literally wandered into Ben's office and he was talking about his wonderful protein. And I said we have to make a bulletproof vest - this is what we have to do,\" she says.<br/>Starting in 2016 their team developed a way to join the talin proteins together into a lattice - like a net with an almost cartoon-like ability to stretch and rebound.<br/>It's been a long haul for Prof Goult who has been involved with working out the mechanical properties of talin and its structure since 2005.<br/>\"It wasn't easy. It took a team of six of us over four years to work out the protein structure of talin, and another four years to work out how talin responded to force\" he says.<br/>Proteins are complicated molecules to decipher. They are made up of a chain of amino acids, a bit like beads on a string. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids - or beads - so there are a bewildering number of ways they can combine. <br/>Traditionally working out those structures was done using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a process which could take years.<br/>But in recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the process, predicting the structures of hundreds of millions of proteins.<br/>A key event came in November 2020, when AlphaFold performed best at CASP 14, an assessment every two years where different computer programs predict the structure of proteins. <br/>Not only did AlphaFold outperform rival systems, it predicted the structure of the proteins with a level of accuracy way beyond its rivals.<br/>\"That was pretty crazy,\" says Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, who helped develop AlphaFold, along with others at London-based DeepMind, the AI division of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.<br/>\"We knew that we had pretty good results internally going into that CASP. But it wasn't at all clear whether other people would have similar results. It was, I guess, a bit of a surprise to us to see just how large the margin was compared to other groups,\" says Ms Tunyasuvunakool.<br/>That version of AlphaFold - AlphaFold2 - was so good, that in the next competition all the best performing teams used versions of it. <br/>Thanks to AlphaFold and its offspring the database of protein structures has gone from a few hundred thousand to hundreds of millions.<br/>For scientists and researchers, particularly in drug development, this is a bonanza. Proteins with structures that look promising for certain uses, like binding to a cancer cell, can be identified more quickly than ever before - the pace of research has been accelerated.<br/>But even AlphaFold has its limitations. Proteins often work by interacting with other molecules and at the moment AlphaFold can only predict the protein part.<br/>And as Prof Goult discovered with talin, proteins are dynamic molecules that change form. AlphaFold can gives researchers a static picture, but can't model those changes.<br/>Also, scientists might also want to design proteins from scratch, to do specific tasks. That's the focus of Prof David Baker, head of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, just outside Seattle.<br/>His team has developed an artificial intelligence based on DALL-E, an AI which generates original images.<br/>Called RF Diffusion, it was trained by breaking down known proteins and then reassembling them in steps. <br/>Scientists using RF Diffusion decide on a particular characteristic they want from a new protein - perhaps a catalyst for a certain kind of chemical reaction, or a protein that can bind to a particular target.<br/>They can feed their requirements into RF Diffusion and it will come up with a suitable protein structure.<br/>\"I think RF diffusion is a step change compared to what we had before,\" says Prof Baker.<br/>\"The potential of designing proteins that solve so many different problems is really great,\" he adds.<br/>He sees new treatments emerging for cancer, neuro-degeneration and infectious diseases. Industry might benefit from catalysts which can speed up reactions or make them more efficient.<br/>Plus, according to Prof Baker, whole new materials could emerge. For him, the possibilities make protein research a compelling place to work. <br/>\"It's an extremely exciting area right now. For young scientists just starting out on a career, it's probably one of the most exciting areas in science today,\" he says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Back in Kent, Professors Goult and Hiscock are working on scaling up production of their protein talin, with investment coming from the Ministry of Defence.<br/>The idea is to make enough of their shock-absorbing gel for a much bigger test. The Kent scientists think that one day their gel might be able to reduce the amount of heavy ceramic used in today's bulletproof plates. <br/>For now, Prof Hiscock still marvels at how their protein gel comes together.<br/>\"It's a beautiful process, the spontaneity of it, and the fact that all those molecules can come together to form those fibrous networks.\" "}, {"_id": "648a002c51ac3319f5477e47", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65625526?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Elizabeth Holmes: Inside the routine at the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas", "lead": "Here's what we know about the Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where Holmes will serve her 11-year sentence.", "author": "By Madeline Halpert", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:12.362084", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3BF3/production/_129774351_bry_lrg1.jpg", "body": "Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has swapped life in California for a minimum-security women's prison facility, roughly 100 miles (160 km) from her Texas hometown. <br/>The disgraced former CEO reported to prison on Tuesday to serve her over 11-year sentence at the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas (known as FPC Bryan). <br/>Earlier this month a judge rejected Holmes' latest bid to remain free while appealing against her conviction. <br/>She was found guilty of defrauding investors in her blood-testing start-up last year.  <br/>Holmesreportedly spent her last free weeks in a rental home in San Diego, California with her partner, hotel heir William Evans, and their two young children, including a three month old. <br/>She will now be wearing khaki pants and a khaki shirt and getting an 06:00 wake-up call each day with other female inmates at FPC Bryan, according to a handbook for the prison. <br/>The facility, which sits on 37 acres, is home to more than 500 inmates - most of whom are serving time for non-violent offences and white-collar crimes. <br/>Holmes, who grew up partly in Houston, Texas, would not be the first celebrity to spend time at the prison camp. Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Star Jen Shah is serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence there for wire fraud.<br/>The celebrity entrepreneur might have roommates in prison. Inmates are typically housed in dormitory-style two-person bunk beds, and four to eight person cubicles, according to Pink Lady Prison Consultants, a prison consulting group led by formerly incarcerated people. <br/>Life at the federal facility is centred around work and extracurricular programmes, the prison handbook says. <br/>All inmates are expected to work, and earn between 12 cents and $1.15 (\u00a30.90) an hour for their jobs. Many are involved in food service and factory work. <br/>Outside of their work, female inmates can take classes on business skills and foreign languages, watch television, play sports and go to religious services, according to the handbook.<br/>Holmes would be allotted an hour for each meal at the facility, which offers a standard Federal Bureau of Prisons menu, consisting of foods like chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs, tacos and macaroni. <br/>As per the prison handbook, she could speak to her family via video calls. Inmates are also allowed visitors during weekends and holidays, but like other inmates, Holmes would be allowed limited physical contact with her partner and young children.<br/>Rules at the female-only facility are also strict, the handbook says, adding that inmates are \"treated in a mature and responsible manner\" and are \"expected to act accordingly\". <br/>Inmates can face disciplinary measures for a number of actions, including not keeping their cell or room neat, sleeping past the early designated wake-up hour, sharing their phone account with other inmates, and leaving an area during an official inmate rollcall, which happens five times a day. <br/>Holmes' time behind bars will stand in stark contrast to her past life. Once lauded as the \"next Steve Jobs\", the start-up founder was said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire, making the cover of Forbes and other prominent magazines. <br/>She started Theranos shortly after dropping out of Stanford University. As the leader of the company, she raised millions of dollars from high-profile investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.<br/>But the start-up fell apart in 2018 after it was revealed Holmes and other executives had lied about the company's technology. The blood-testing device was purported to be able to run a multitude of tests from just a few drops of blood.<br/>In addition to serving time in prison, Holmes has been ordered to pay $452m to the victims of her fraud. She will split the amount with her former romantic and business partner, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who started serving a 13-year sentence in prison in April.

So his grandparents gave him $200 (\u00a3159) Apple credit for Christmas.<br/>\"To my shock, he spent all of it in a matter of days,\" says Ms Ward. \"After that, I gave him no more than $10 worth of robux per month. He quickly became frustrated and bored with the game.\" <br/>Leif moved on to World of Tanks, which also requires players to upgrade their weaponry using PlayStation credit. <br/>\"However, this game has the option to watch ads to gain credit,\" says Ms Ward. \"He would do that out of desperation when he had used up his monthly gaming allowance.\"<br/>Ms Ward says her younger son has yet to learn self-control or money-sense. <br/>\"It's something that I have to police constantly.\"<br/>Rather than profiting from the initial sale of a video game, many of today's gaming companies rely on revenue generated by in-game purchases, or microtransactions.<br/>The content purchased can be purely aesthetic - dance moves, skins or clothing. <br/>Alternatively, in-game purchases can provide a tactical advantage to the gameplay - extra lives, character upgrades or weapons - providing a lead over players who did not purchase the additional content.<br/>The global online microtransaction market is forecast to grow from $67.94bn in 2022 to $76.66bn in 2023.<br/>However, there are signs of a backlash from experts and consumers alike. Also, some companies are promising new releases that are in-game purchase-free.<br/>Gaming companies use behavioural psychology to manipulate users into spending, says Prof Sarah Mills, and the link between gaming and gambling is becoming \"increasingly blurred\", she explains.<br/>Ms Mills is professor of human geography at Loughborough University. Her research found gambling techniques make gamers play for longer and spend more money, and drive repeat buying.<br/>Vicki Shotbolt, chief executive of Parent Zone, an organisation which helps parents navigate the digital world for their children, is more specific about how games incentivise players to part with their money.<br/>By spending players can \"avoid the grind\" - where making an in-game purchase means you avoid hours of monotonous gaming to progress to another level.<br/>\"Fun pain\" is where you risk losing something important if you don't make a purchase.<br/>Meanwhile, \"obfuscation techniques\", like in-game currencies, make it hard to see how much you're really spending.<br/>Another tactic is the use of \"loot boxes\". Players buy a box without knowing what's inside. It could contain a game-changing item - but more often than not the prize is nothing more than a mediocre customisation. <br/>\"Young people recalled senses of shame when they reflected on the amount they spent trying to gain a rare item, even if they were successful,\" says Prof Mills.<br/>And - despite many children saying they dislike in-game purchasing - spending money on microtransactions has become an expectation.<br/>While spending on games has risen, some argue that playing games can benefit young people and fears are exaggerated.<br/>Gaming as a form of play has been found to relieve stress, help develop cognitive skills and combat loneliness.<br/>As a teenager Zhenghua Yang, from Colorado, spent two years in hospital.<br/>\"I played a lot of video games. The single-player games made me feel like a hero. The multiplayer games connected me to other people. I made life-long friends all over the world.\"<br/>In 2014, Mr Yang founded Serenity Forge, a gaming company on a mission to help others. To date, more than 20 million people have played the firm's games.<br/>\"We are in the business of expanding people's horizons,\" says Mr Yang.<br/>Serenity Forge does not use microtransactions but, says Mr Yang, that could change in the future if they found them to contribute to \"meaningful, emotionally impactful games that challenge the way you think\".<br/>The impact of microtransactions, says Mr Yang, depends on the vulnerability of the user.<br/>\"Like a credit card can be dangerous for someone in an inappropriate context, so too can microtransactions. However, credit cards can also serve an important function and in-game purchases can be important to a gamer engaging with their favourite game.\"<br/>Sarah Loya's son Andrew, 14, spends almost all his pocket money on gaming but, she says, that isn't a problem and gaming makes him happy.<br/>\"He plays daily, after school and on the weekends. I don't really see much of a negative. He's a smart kid and knows the difference between reality and fantasy.\"<br/>Ms Loya lives in Texas with Andrew, and his brother Rex, 6.<br/>\"My bank account is linked to Andrew's subscription, so I would see if he purchased something without permission,\" says the 43-year-old, \"but he always asks me before making a purchase.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While it can be difficult for parents to keep track of registered emails, passwords and payment cards across various platforms and devices - there are ways that you can protect your teen and your bank account.<br/>Child accounts and parental controls can be used to disable purchases or set a spending limit. Parents can set up email notifications to flag purchases, and use gift cards rather than credit cards.<br/>Perhaps most importantly, adds Mr Yang, talk to your child.<br/>\"In my experience, friction stems from a lack of parental presence,\" he says. \"I now have two kids and, instead of using games as a babysitting tool, I make sure I'm present in their lives as they consume media.\"<br/>Back in Barbados, Ms Ward has set up screen time limits and passcodes to keep Leif gaming safely. <br/>\"My password is needed to make any purchases and if he wants money added to his account he has to ask me.

In a bid to encourage homeowners to decarbonise their heating, Germany introduced a rebate scheme in January 2023 that offers up to 40% back on the cost of buying and installing a heat pump. <br/>Heat pumps use energy taken from the air, water or ground to provide both heating and cooling. They have been proven to work even in extreme temperatures and can drastically reduce energy bills once installed.<br/>The scheme is just one of a host of heat pump subsidies in place across Europe and part of a broader push to reduce carbon emissions. From 2024, every new heating system installed in Germany must run on 65% renewable energy.<br/>Bastian Distler, a product manager in Ketsch in south-west Germany, was considering upgrading to a heat pump anyway for environmental reasons, but admits that he wouldn't have been able to without the subsidy. Purchase and installation can cost anywhere from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac30,000 (\u00a38,700 to \u00a326,000; $11,000 to $33,000) compared to around \u20ac7,000 for a new gas boiler.<br/>\"I have two little children which makes you question some behaviours and you feel better if you do something good for the environment. But to be very honest, if it had been very, very expensive and it didn't pay off, I probably would not have done it,\" says Mr Distler.<br/>While the scheme is certainly making it easier for Germans to invest in heating system upgrades, heat pump sales were already on the increase. <br/>\"We had a market growth of 53% last year,\" says Martin Sabel, managing director of the German Heat Pump Association. \"The year before it was around 30% and the year before that around 40%. So we've had a good growth rate for several years now.\"<br/>The dramatic uptick in demand caught many manufacturers off guard, leaving some homeowners waiting up to 10 months before their new heat pumps could be supplied and installed by trained technicians, who are also in short supply.<br/>Manufacturers like Viessmann are scaling up production to solve the shortfall, as well as pouring huge investment into training installers, providing educational materials for would-be buyers, and helping customers navigate often complex subsidy applications.<br/>G\u00fcnther Schlachter, vice president of residential electric solutions at Viessmann, believes that supporting and training installers is key to decarbonising home heating. <br/>\"Our installer... can consult with their customers [and advise against] the cheapest gas or oil option to make use of the subsidies that are now in place for a future-proof solution,\" says Mr Schlachter.<br/>J\u00fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danfoss agrees. \"Typically, installers focus on gas. For a heat pump, they need to also understand electrics and refrigeration. So educating the end user is important, but it's more important to educate the person selling the system because 80% of the decision-making process happens with the installer.\"<br/>Most European countries currently face the same issues with supply, installer training and cost, but geography and culture also heavily influence what we expect and demand from our heating systems.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>So perhaps it is not surprising that Europe's coldest countries, with the best insulation, have the highest heat pump penetration. According to the International Energy Agency, 60% of Norway's buildings are fitted with a heat pump, followed closely by Sweden at 43% and Finland at 41%. <br/>In Germany the figure is a little over 4% and in the UK just 1%.<br/>\"Scandinavia is much more advanced because they have higher insulation standards and moved from direct electric heating to heat pumps early because it's saved them from day one,\" says Thomas Nowak, secretary general of the European Heat Pump Association.<br/>Central Europeans also tend to have high expectations of heating and insulation whereas people in the UK have long accepted the need for draught excluders and chunky indoor jumpers.<br/>Southern countries tend to eschew heating in favour of cooling and use instantaneous gas boilers to heat water, whereas Eastern Europeans often rely on solid fuel stoves. <br/>Regardless of where you live or how old your building is, there's an easy way to find out if your home is suitable for a heat pump. <br/>If you can feel comfortable at home when the flow temperature on your boiler is reduced to 55C, then you can install a heat pump straight away without retrofits or insulation upgrades. <br/>Of course, not everyone can choose how their home is heated. Germany has one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe, which means the onus is on landlords and housing management companies to upgrade heating to serve the country's approximately 40 million tenants. <br/>The German Heat Pump Association has seen housing providers begin to understand that decarbonisation will soon begin to affect their bottom line. <br/>\"They have the goal of decarbonising their building stock because they realise that if they don't, in 10 or 20 years, they won't be able to rent these flats anymore,\" says Martin Sabel. <br/>Tenants who would prefer to take matters into their own hands may soon be able to access smaller-scale heat pump solutions for heating and cooling individual rooms.<br/>US start-up Gradient hopes to enter the European market in 2023 and is working on producing small, affordable, self-install heat pumps that fit over window sills and can replace existing air conditioning units. <br/>For Viessmann, the long-term vision is to build a holistic low-carbon, low-cost energy system where heat pumps, high-quality insulation, solar energy, rerouted waste heat, other renewables, and smart technology work in tandem to provide a circular system of heating and cooling, charging cars, and meeting other energy needs for homeowners and their wider community. <br/>Germany may still be a long way from that, but heat pumps are a good step on that road. When asked what message homeowners should take home about heat pumps, Thomas Nowak has a simple answer. <br/>\"They work. That's all. Don't trust anybody who tells you they don't.\""}, {"_id": "648a002e51ac3319f5477e4a", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65261147?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Can a wind turbine handle hurricane speed winds?", "lead": "As wind farms expand into new areas they will need to withstand extreme wind speeds.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:14.190292", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13A68/production/_129388408_gettyimages-856895372.jpg", "body": "The world's biggest storms, which whip the high seas into a frenzy or flatten buildings on land, have long daunted wind farm developers. But that is changing. <br/>Operators are increasingly adopting turbines designed to withstand tropical cyclones. One of the latest examples is a \"typhoon-resistant\" floating wind turbine, which will soon help to power an offshore oil platform in China. <br/>According to the manufacturer, MingYang Smart Energy, this 7.25 megawatt (MW) turbine can survive wind speeds of up to 134mph for 10 minutes. It has been installed at a facility 136km off the coast of the island province of Hainan.<br/>MingYang did not respond to a BBC request for comment but theirs is not the first turbine designed to face down such an onslaught. In 2021, US firm GE received typhoon-certification for its mammoth Haliade-X turbine. It is fixed, not floating, and has a capacity of up to 13MW.<br/>The blistering growth of the wind energy industry is pushing turbines to their limits and some question whether the pace of the rollout is wise.<br/>While components such as turbine blades are remarkably strong, they are not indestructible. And the forces of nature, especially out at sea, are notoriously unpredictable, meaning the pressure is on to prove that wind turbines really are hurricane-ready.<br/>Tropical cyclones - often called typhoons or hurricanes depending on location - are a familiar threat in certain parts of the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico or around much of Southeast Asia.<br/>Such storms can produce wind speeds well in excess of 100mph. The strongest one-minute sustained winds on record, of 215mph, were created by Hurricane Patricia in the Eastern Pacific in 2015. <br/>Despite the meteorological challenges in such regions, the expansion of wind energy is expected there in the coming years and decades.<br/>Today's turbines already put up with some powerful gales. Those positioned off the northeast coast of the UK in the North Sea operate in wind speeds of up to 50mph or so, after which point they are switched off, notes Simon Hogg at Durham University, who holds the \u00d8rsted chair at the university, which is funded by energy firm \u00d8rsted. <br/>Technically, such turbines are designed to survive even higher wind speeds.<br/>Leon Mishnaevsky of the Technical University of Denmark suggests that wind turbine blades are generally quite reliable. These days, they are made from strong but lightweight carbon fibre composites and automated manufacturing processes help to ensure the uniform placement of the fibres, which is important for the blades' robustness, he notes.<br/>Wind turbine makers also perform a range of stress tests on blades to ensure that they are up to scratch.<br/>This can include attaching large \"exciters\" to the blades, which bounce up and down, simulating the repeated stresses of winds on the structure. Giant blades are also sometimes bent to the point of breaking, says Prof Hogg, which helps to confirm the maximum loads they can bear.<br/>But the fallibility of turbines, especially the biggest ones, is becoming more apparent as time goes by. Insurer GCube notes in a recent report that offshore wind losses rose from \u00a31m in 2012 to more than \u00a37m in 2021.<br/>Plus, machines with capacities larger than 8MW can suffer component failures within just two years of installation, the firm says, more than twice as fast as 4-8MW devices.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Some of the most dangerous forces to trouble turbine blades are torsion, or twisting, loads, says Find M\u00f8lholt Jensen, chief executive of Bladena, a firm that specialises in diagnosing and repairing large turbine blades around 60m in length, or longer. <br/>Repeated twisting of blades can induce difficult-to-spot fractures, he says: \"The damage cannot be seen from the outside.\"<br/>The longer the blade, the greater the risk, comments a spokesman for Bladena.<br/>Current testing and industry standards are not sufficient to prove that the largest turbine blades can withstand these stresses, argues Dr Jensen.<br/>New designs could help, though. In Japan, Challenergy has been working on a turbine with tall, vertical blades that spin around a central tower.<br/>While currently much smaller and less powerful than the biggest traditional, three-bladed turbines in operation today, Challenergy's device is intended to cope with very high winds. <br/>When a powerful typhoon called Hin Nam No struck the Philippines and Japan last August, it passed over two of the company's turbines. One of the devices, at Ishigaki City in Okinawa, recorded wind speeds of around 64mph. The turbine continued to operate without any problems, according to Challenergy.<br/>In the US, a research team has taken a cue from nature in their design of an alternative hurricane-resistant turbine. <br/>\"We were inspired by palm trees,\" explains Lucy Pao at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"In high winds they kind of go with the flow, they bend with the wind.\"<br/>She and her colleagues designed a prototype two-bladed wind turbine design with flexible blades. Plus, the rotor faces downwind rather than into the wind, as is common in traditional configurations, helping it to absorb the impact of strong gales.<br/>During tests at an onshore site in Colorado, the blade tips were observed deflecting by up to 600mm, more than half a metre. \"None of them snapped,\" says Prof Pao.<br/>Wind speeds in the area can reach 100mph in the wintertime, she adds.<br/>However, the wind energy industry has almost universally adopted the upwind, three-bladed design so selling a new concept is difficult, Prof Pao explains. Currently, her research in this area is on hold, pending further funding.<br/>She shares the concerns of other observers who question whether wind turbines are really ready for some of the strongest winds nature can hurl at them.<br/>\"The novel materials, they are stronger, they are pretty amazing, but I don't know that they've been tested out as thoroughly as maybe they should be,\" she says.<br/>Then there are the tricky economics of siting turbines in places where winds are especially variable. James Martin is chief executive at Gulf Wind Technology, a company exploring the deployment of turbines in the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>In this area, low wind speeds are common for most of the year - with the occasional hurricane blasting its way through. <br/>\"If you design that turbine to be strong enough to withstand the peak wind event, then you'll be carrying a lot of extra cost for the times that you've got light wind,\" notes Mr Martin. He declines to share details of the turbines or technologies his firm is considering.<br/>In the coming years, you can expect to see more and more turbines arriving in regions affected by cyclones, though.<br/>\"We need [turbines] there as much as we need them in any other area of the globe,\" argues Prof Hogg. \"I don't think we should shy away from it.\""}, {"_id": "648a002e51ac3319f5477e4b", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65904441?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "PMQs: Keir Starmer attacks Rishi Sunak over Boris Johnson honours list", "lead": "The Labour leader accuses Rishi Sunak of failing to stand up to his predecessor over controversial peerages.", "author": "By Brian Wheeler", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:14.552548", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10C46/production/_130087686_mediaitem130087685.jpg", "body": "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak of being \"too weak\" to block Boris Johnson's honours list.<br/>The former PM handed out awards to some of his closest aides from the Covid era in a list published last week.<br/>\"That means that those who threw a Downing Street party the night before the late Queen sat alone at her husband's funeral will now receive awards from the King,\" Sir Keir said.<br/>Mr Sunak insisted he had acted \"in line with established conventions\".<br/>And - in a jibe at Sir Keir's own title - he said: \"I'd expect a knight like him to understand that.\"<br/>The list of Mr Johnson's nominees included his former head of operations, Shelley Williams-Walker, who was reportedly the DJ at a Downing Street gathering on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral.

Consequently, they will buy fewer things which should slow the rate of rising prices.<br/>An increase in interest rates means higher monthly mortgage, credit card and loan payments for some people. But higher rates should benefit savers - if banks pass them on to their customers. <br/>Asked if he was following former chancellor John Major's dictum in 1989 that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working\", Mr Hunt said: \"In the end there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity.\"<br/>The government has no say over interest rates since the Bank of England was granted independence in 1997.<br/>The UK economy expanded in April after shrinking by 0.3% in the previous month. For the three months to April, it grew marginally by 0.1%. <br/>The ONS said strong trade in bars and pubs boosted growth, but added the construction sector had faltered as rising interest rates and mortgage costs made house buyers more cautious.<br/>As interest rates have risen and more people are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals, some lenders have been withdrawing certain mortgages from the market. <br/>First-time buyers are being met with higher rates, leaving some priced out, and renters are also facing higher costs due to landlords selling up.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, HSBC, a major UK mortgage lender, temporarily withdrew new residential mortgages supplied through brokers.<br/>\"Over recent days cost of funds has increased and, like other banks, we have had to reflect that in our mortgage rates,\" an HSBC spokesperson said.<br/>Hiking rates is meant to persuade consumers to spend less - as their cost of borrowing rises or rates on savings accounts increase - giving businesses less scope to raise prices. <br/>But that mechanism may have become less effective over time.<br/>Take mortgages. In the early 2000s, more than seven out of 10 residential mortgages were on variable or tracker rates, immediately impacted by rate hikes. Today, it's 15% of homeowners. Even adding in the 1.8 million who are re-mortgaging this year, means it's still, contrary to a couple of decades ago, the minority of mortgage holders who will be affected. <br/>The impact of rate hikes is less widespread and may be taking longer to filter through.<br/>Equally, banks and building societies have been particularly reluctant to pass on rate hikes to savers this time, as the Bank of England and outraged customers have noted. This may in part reflect savings institutions rebuilding margins after a period of ultra-low interest rates - but gives customers less of an incentive to stash spare cash. <br/>Higher interest rates also should mean businesses have less scope to give workers inflation-matching pay rises than in the past - but a shortage of workers makes this less likely this time. <br/>Even if, as some economists fear, interest rate rises are less effective this time, they remain the main tool for fighting inflation.<br/>Ian Burns, who runs Cameron Homes, a housebuilder in Staffordshire, said people were being \"very cautious\" and were \"taking longer to make decisions\".<br/>\"Over the past three or four weeks, we've seen a slowdown in reservations,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money.<br/>\"We can't just continue to build houses if we don't have customers for them.\"<br/>Stronger-than-expected wage growth for workers in the three months to April has raised the prospect that the Bank could raise rates close to 6% by the end of the year in its bid to reduce inflation.<br/>On Monday, two-year government borrowing costs rose to levels higher than during the aftermath of last September's mini-budget. <br/>When asked if this showed his plan was not working, Mr Hunt said: \"We are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn. The IMF, the international commentators, think the British economy is on the right track.\"<br/>But the New Economics Foundation, a think tank promoting social and economic justice, said the Bank should hold off on raising rates further and wait to see the impact of its previous increases.<br/>Its economist Lukasz Krebel said that while UK wages were rising, they were still not keeping up with inflation, meaning people were poorer in real terms. <br/>He added that rising prices were mainly due to supply side issues, such as worker shortages and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sending energy prices soaring.<br/>\"The UK government and the Bank should look to address underlying weaknesses that expose the UK to such inflation shocks - notably by supporting investment in clean energy and building retrofits to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil gas,\" he said.<br/>Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figures represented \"another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government\".<br/>\"The facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we're lagging behind on the global stage.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Raphael Sheridan"}, {"_id": "648a002e51ac3319f5477e4d", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65898515?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Nadine Dorries keeps Conservative Party waiting on by-election", "lead": "The former cabinet minister is yet to officially resign as an MP, putting a vote to replace her on hold.", "author": "By Iain Watson & Paul Seddon", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:14.979846", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/265A/production/_130081890_8c0630c1-8acc-42c9-a0ac-d1b9c7a5f840.jpg", "body": "Former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries has not yet officially resigned as an MP, to the frustration of the Conservative Party.<br/>The close Boris Johnson ally announced last Friday she would be standing down as MP for Mid Bedfordshire \"with immediate effect\".<br/>But she is yet to officially tender her resignation -

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him, saying: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>The committee can order any MP to appear before it, and require them to hand over documents or other evidence. <br/>There isn't a set list of punishments it can recommend, but they must be approved by a vote in the House of Commons.<br/>Parties have traditionally not told their MPs which way to vote on such matters, although there have been exceptions to this.<br/>The committee can advise that an MP be suspended from the Commons.

It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him.

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK.

A representative of the guru was also present at the event.<br/>Nithyananda fled India in 2019 while facing multiple criminal charges, including rape and sexual assault. <br/>He has since claimed to have founded a new country, known as the \"Republic of Kailaasa\", on an island off the coast of Ecuador. <br/>Nithyananda has denied the accusations against him.<br/>In December last year, Lord Ranger, a businessman who has donated tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party over the past decade, told The Observer he had no knowledge of Nithyananda or his organisation.<br/>Had he known about the guru, he would not have attended the event, he told the newspaper. <br/>Standards Commissioner Akbar Khan said in his report that Lord Ranger had abused his position as a member of the House of Lords in his social media feud with Ms Joshi.<br/>\"He was acutely aware of this imbalance of power and abused it by persistently undermining, humiliating and denigrating Ms Joshi,\" said Mr Khan. <br/>\"Examples of this included his frequent disparaging remarks including 'Who is asking you?

Ms Dorries added she understands this \"to be true despite denials from those concerned\".<br/>Ms Dorries used her article to argue for her place in the House of Lords, writing: \"I was born into poverty and clawed my way out of it to build a new life for me and my family, and then carved out a role in public service.<br/>\"A seat in the Lords was recognition of that - and a means of continuing to give back to society.\"<br/>The prime minister's press secretary has denied Ms Dorries' version of events, saying: \"No-one in No10 amended or edited any list.\"<br/>\"As is convention, on receiving the former prime minister's resignation honours list the prime minister forwarded the peerage list unaltered to HOLAC,\" the press secretary said.<br/>Ms Dorries said Mr Johnson had told her in autumn last year she had been put on his resignation honours list.<br/>The former culture secretary said she had been vetted for the peerage, but because six months had passed, her checks had expired.<br/>She also said Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson had a meeting last week to discuss his honours list.<br/>Ms Dorries accused the prime minister of using \"weasel words\" at that meeting to give Mr Johnson the impression Mr Sunak would ask HOLAC to restart the vetting process.<br/>According to Ms Dorries, these \"duplicitous machinations\" were to avoid a by-election caused when an MP steps down to take a seat in the House of Lords."}, {"_id": "648a003151ac3319f5477e58", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65886472?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "England,N.

It makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\"<br/>Labour MP Stella Creasy also called for urgent reform, telling BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"I don't understand in whose interests this case was.\"<br/>Madeline Page, director of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students, described the case as a \"sad situation\" and said she would welcome a parliamentary debate.<br/>The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which opposes abortion, criticised providers for \"pushing for dangerous home abortions,\" and said women such as Foster were \"left to self-administer these drugs alone with no medical supervision or support.\"<br/>But providers say the most common side-effects of at-home abortions are \"usually easy to treat\", and \"rarely have any long-term health effects\". <br/>The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is one of 30 campaign and health groups calling for the law to be repealed to decriminalise women seeking to end their own pregnancies.<br/>BPAS chief executive Clare Murphy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are now seeing a mother-of-three prosecuted under laws that do not exist in the same way in any other country.\"<br/>She said \"a growing number of women\" were coming under police investigation over suspected illegal abortions, with another woman facing trial later this year. <br/>A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said cases such as that of Carla Foster were \"exceptionally rare... complex and traumatic\".<br/>They added: \"Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions.\"<br/>Downing Street said it recognised that abortion was \"a highly emotive issue and there is a strength of feeling on all sides,\" but \"the law is clearly set out.\"<br/>\"It's up to the police and the judiciary to enforce it,\" the spokesperson added. <br/>Dame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs select committee, called for the government to decriminalise abortion.<br/>She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Removing the criminal law is a very sensible, reasonable step, but it's not to deregulate abortion care and who can provide it.\"<br/>The CPS argued in court that Foster had been aware of abortion limits and had provided false information during a remote medical consultation. <br/>Her defence said lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare, adding: \"This will haunt her forever.\" <br/>Foster went into labour on 11 May 2020 and the baby was confirmed dead 45 minutes later. <br/>The 44-year-old from Staffordshire had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby, the court heard.<br/>Sentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall accepted she had been \"in emotional turmoil\" as she sought to hide the pregnancy.<br/>He said she was a good mother to her three sons, one of whom has special needs, and that a suspended sentence might have been possible if there had been an earlier guilty plea.<br/>But he rejected appeals from women's health organisations to pass a non-custodial sentence, saying it was the court's duty to \"apply the law as provided by Parliament\".<br/>Ahead of Monday's hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women's health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.<br/>The judge told the defendant the letter's authors were \"concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\".<br/>But he said it also \"has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\"."}, {"_id": "648a003251ac3319f5477e59", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-65889239?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Entertainment & Arts",

He also suggested Mr Davie was \"managing decline\".<br/>\"Quite the reverse,\" the director general replied, noting that local radio audiences had declined by 20% in recent years.<br/>\"If you're sitting with all your money on broadcast, you will be managing decline,\" he said. \"That is a decision I cannot take for the BBC.\""}, {"_id": "648a003251ac3319f5477e5a", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65842385?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "UK government must be more open on use of AI, say campaigners", "lead": "Rishi Sunak wants to lead in shaping global rules - but is being urged to boost transparency at home.", "author": "By Paul Seddon", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:18.504217", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10B0B/production/_130036386_aiengineergetty.jpg", "body": "The government risks undermining faith in AI unless it becomes more open about its own use of the technology, campaigners have warned.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has sought to position the UK as a leader in designing new AI rules at a global level.<br/>But privacy campaigners say its own use of AI-driven systems is too opaque and risks discrimination.<br/>The government said it was committed to creating \"strong guardrails\" for AI.<br/>The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a flurry of doom-laden headlines about the risks it could pose to humanity.<br/>Mr Sunak has said he wants the UK to become the \"geographical home\" of new safety rules, and will host a global summit on regulation in the autumn.<br/>However, several campaign groups say the UK government is not doing enough to manage the risks posed by its own increasing use of AI in fields such as welfare, immigration and housing.<br/>In a document sent to MPs on cross-party groups on AI and data analytics, seen by the BBC, they say the public should be given more information about where and how such systems are used.<br/>It has been signed by civil liberties organisations including Liberty, Big Brother Watch, Open Rights Group and Statewatch, as well as a number of migrant rights groups and digital rights lawyers.<br/>Shameem Ahmad, chief executive of the Public Law Project (PLP), a legal charity co-ordinating the statement, said the government was \"behind the curve\" in managing risks from its AI use.<br/>She added that whilst AI chatbot ChatGPT had \"caught everyone's attention\", public authorities had been using AI-powered technology for years, sometimes in a \"secretive\" manner.<br/>The government's current strategy for AI, set out in a policy statement in March, focused mainly on how best to regulate its emerging use in industry. <br/>It did not set out any new legal limits on its use in either the private or public sectors, arguing that to do so now could stifle innovation. Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\"."}, {"_id": "648a003351ac3319f5477e5b", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65868314?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Slow-walk protest law heads for further Lords clash", "lead": "The government wants new regulations to give police powers to stop protests, but opposition parties are unhappy.", "author": "By Mark D'Arcy", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:19.142374", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1179E/production/_130028517_edf0ad4220af7ee637ae23869006d6a9eb606079.jpg", "body": "The government is being accused of trying to by-pass Parliament and rewrite the laws on public protests by \"sneaky\" means.<br/>MPs and peers are due to debate new regulations next week, which will give the police clearer powers to stop slow-walking protest marches blocking roads and bringing cities to a halt.<br/>The changes are designed to provide a clearer definition of what \"serious disruption to the life of communities\" means, so the police would be better able to block or impose conditions on demonstrations thought likely to cause it. <br/>The new definition would cover the cumulative impact of repeated protests and disruption and delays, with \"community\" defined as any citizens who might be affected.  <br/>Taken together these would provide a much clearer legal basis for imposing bans or restrictions. <br/>Conservative peer Lord Jackson said the government was reacting to public concern about protests by groups like Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil, and slow-walking tactics, which could \"clog up whole city centres\".<br/>The government majority in the Commons should see the order voted through by MPs on Monday, but it must also be approved in the Lords, on Tuesday, and there is no government majority in that House, so it is at least technically possible that the regulations could be defeated. <br/>There's also a looming row about the way the regulations have been introduced. <br/>Peers defeated exactly the same policy, when the government attempted to add it to the Public Order Bill in the Lords, in February. <br/>So many are now angry that a policy they rejected has been brought back as regulations, particularly because they are not allowed to propose changes, and, by convention, they never reject them.<br/>Conservative former Cabinet minister Lord Hunt of Wirral said the government was seeking to bring the changes in, \"in a way, through the back door\", completely ignoring the decision the House of Lords had made in February. <br/>He will be calling for assurances that ministers would not try the same thing again. <br/>Meanwhile, the Green Party's Baroness Jones has put down a \"fatal motion\" to block the regulations.

But using an external agency to resolve workplace issues is not difficult. <br/>\"Neither Parliament nor the whips' offices are equipped to do it. This is highly specialised stuff.\" <br/>She said whips could remove the whip from MPs, but \"that's a political party decision\".<br/>\"The whips shouldn't be enacting sanctions as part of the complaints process. It may be considered prudent by a political party to withdraw the whip pending an investigation.\" <br/>Current MPs have also raised concerns about a lack of \"HR professionals\" to deal with cases like this. <br/>One Conservative MP said: \"Where does the buck stop? The whips, the police, the Speaker, there's also the parties. I don't see that there is any formal coming together of those.\" <br/>Parties often \"live in fear of someone saying: 'why didn't you take action?' That's where the judgement comes,\" they added.   <br/>This MP said that, while they still wanted a say in who their staff were, \"I do think there's a benefit in more HR support for MPs - I'm not an HR expert.\" <br/>They compared MPs employing their own staff with Parliament \"dealing in effect with 650 small businesses\".  <br/>Another former chief whip the BBC spoke to echoed the argument for \"external supervision\", saying the role of the whips was to \"look after their flock, not to sit in judgement of them\", and to persuade them to vote with their party the \"right\" way. <br/>On Monday, MPs will debate proposals to bar some MPs under criminal investigation for violent or sexual offences from setting foot in Parliament. <br/>The proposals have been drawn up by the House of Commons Commission, a body of senior MPs which oversees the working of the Commons, following a consultation.<br/>If approved, the plans could allow MPs or peers to be barred from the Houses of Parliament if they are deemed to pose a risk.<br/>The exclusion would apply to the parliamentary estate in Westminster and any parliamentary-funded travel.<br/>MPs are being asked to have their say on the plans, but a formal vote has yet to be arranged. <br/>The Commission has proposed that if the parliamentary authorities were presented with credible allegations of a sexual or violent offence by the police at any point in the criminal justice process, a staff panel would assess the claims.<br/>If the panel undertook a full risk assessment on the basis of information provided by the police, it would consider the nature of the alleged misconduct and whether there were any safeguarding concerns.<br/>If this led to exclusion being recommended, this would be put to an adjudication panel for a decision.<br/>Under the proposals, excluded members would get a proxy vote so their constituents were not disadvantaged.<br/>The BBC has been told there is some disagreement on the plans - with a number of MPs arguing members should not be excluded unless they are charged by police, and others arguing that the threshold for exclusion should be lower. <br/>One former chief whip said excluding people who had not been charged flew \"against natural justice\".<br/>\"Allegations can be made against members of parliament that may be false, and they may be made in a vexatious way.\" <br/>Ms Milton said she believed Parliament should be able to vote on excluding MPs from the Commons, because it was \"quite a serious issue democratically\". <br/>\"Their [MPs'] job is to hold the government to account.

where drivers pay according to what journeys they do and at what time. <br/>The inclusion of Mr Hossain will be a surprise to many because it did not appear widely known that he had applied.<br/>He is a leading barrister and King's Counsel and has been described by the Court of Appeal as an advocate of \"great eloquence\". <br/>Mr Hossain was born in Barisal, Bangladesh, and came to the UK in 1995.<br/>In 2019, he became the first Bangladeshi-born criminal barrister to be appointed Queen's Counsel.<br/>Mr Khan's Conservative opponent in the last mayoral election in 2021, Shaun Bailey, has meanwhile been offered a peerage by former prime minister and ex-London mayor, Boris Johnson. <br/>Commenting on the news, Mr Khan joked about the 2024 election: \"What I'd say to the three candidates is, obviously I'm hoping that I win and I'm chosen, but the good news for them is anyone who loses gets a job in the House of Lords.\"<br/>In a statement on Sunday, issued as the shortlist of candidates was published, Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands MP said: \"All three of these individuals have shown great commitment to fighting Sadiq Khan and to bettering London with the Conservatives.<br/>\"I thank all of the candidates that put their name forward for this process and look forward to the hustings to come.\"<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

And maybe Lord Speakers past and present will weigh in. <br/>Many peers have identified patronage in appointments to the Lords as the main reputational threat to their chamber. <br/>All this will be superimposed on an otherwise low-key parliamentary agenda - it's been getting embarrassing; last week saw the Lords sit until 04:16 on Thursday morning debating the Illegal Migration Bill, while the Commons ran out of steam on Tuesday at 14:20. <br/>Peers are debating late into the night; MPs are home in time for Hollyoaks. There may be efforts to avoid the unbearable lightness of last week's Commons business in the week ahead, but the causes remain the same - a surfeit of detailed legislation inching through the Upper House, while MPs twiddle their thumbs on the green benches of the Commons.<br/>On the committee corridor, watch out for the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman's appearance before Home Affairs on Wednesday - but as has been the recent trend, the real action is in the Lords, where peers have continued to defeat the government on a variety of issues and continue to battle the Commons over the Retained EU Law Bill.<br/>But while they regularly push back on the content of bills, Labour inhibitions about voting down secondary legislation make it highly unlikely that Green Party peer Jenny Jones's attempt to strike down an order which would give the police greater power to control or ban protest marches will have the numbers to succeed.<br/>Commons (14:30): Education Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following.<br/>Main debate: Motion to approve a statutory instrument, the Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023. This is a highly controversial measure to rewrite what constitutes serious disruption, with the aim of giving clearer legal underpinning for the police to ban or restrict protests.<br/>That's followed by a general debate on proposed new rules for risk-based exclusion of MPs who have been accused of sexual misconduct or violent offences. This is a tough issue where the constitutional rights of MPs to attend Parliament are balanced against the safeguarding concerns of the thousands of people who work on the parliamentary estate, and many MPs are worried that the new system would make excluding them from parliament the option of first resort, as soon as there was a live accusation.<br/>The expectation had been that there would be a vote to approve proposals from the House of Commons Commission, the Commons administrative arm, but, tellingly, there will not now be a vote. The Commons Leader, Penny Morduant has, however, said she expects their will be a vote before the Summer recess. Watch out for pressure to rewrite the proposals.<br/>MPs also respond to the latest Lords amendments to the Retained EU Law Bill. This bill is now bouncing between the two Houses, and peers have pinged back new clauses requiring that EU regulations rewritten by ministers must be put before Parliament, with the possibility of debate and amendment in both Houses, and that such regulations must not reduce environmental protections and must not conflict with the UK's international agreements.

This petition attracted 109,463 signatures.<br/>The second, e-petition 627984 says the government should commit to NOT amending the Equality Act's definition of sex, arguing that ministers had previously committed to not remove legal protections for trans people, an already marginalised group, but this change would do so.

He argues that charging VAT penalises blind and partially sighted people.<br/>Committees: Public Accounts (10:00) question senior officials on the effort to get to net zero by 2050.<br/>Lords (11:00): Debate on the performance of the NHS and health service innovation; on support for freelancers in the arts and creative industries and on local government in England.<br/>The Commons is not sitting.<br/>Lords (10:00): Peers will whiz through the third reading rubber-stamping of a series of private members' bills (laws proposed by individual MPs) sent over from the Commons - the Shark Fins Bill, the Co-operatives, Mutuals and Friendly Societies Bill , the Child Support Collection (Domestic Abuse) Bill, the Offenders (Day of Release from Detention) Bill, and the Supported Housing (Regulatory Oversight) Bill.<br/>This is their final parliamentary stage and they will shortly become law.<br/>Also up for third reading - the Ofcom (Duty Regarding Prevention of Serious Self-harm and Suicide) Bill and the Coroners (Determination of Suicide) Bill. Although they will clear their Lords process, they will not be debated in the Commons.<br/>Then it's back to more private members' bills from MPs - with second reading (initial) debates on the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill, the Powers of Attorney Bill, the Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Bill and the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Bill.<br/>Also up for debate, but again with no real chance of becoming law, the Public Advocate Bill (from Labour's Lord Wills)."}, {"_id": "648a003751ac3319f5477e60", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65872070?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "England,N.

\"at least for now\". <br/>Hours earlier, one of his biggest allies, former Cabinet minister Nadine Dorries, unexpectedly stepped down from her Mid Bedfordshire seat. <br/>And on Saturday, another supporter Nigel Adams resigned, triggering a third by-election for the Tories.<br/>Speculation about Mr Johnson's future in politics has subsequently included the suggestion he could stand in another seat, although there is no indication this is likely. <br/>Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson could \"easily get back into Parliament at the next election\" - and he was \"in pole position to return as Conservative leader if a vacancy should arise\".<br/>But the former business secretary went on: \"I would most strongly warn Conservative Party managers against any attempt to block Boris if he seeks the party nomination in another seat.<br/>\"Any attempt to do so would shatter our fragile party unity and plunge the Conservatives into civil war.\"<br/>In contrast, former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine has said Mr Johnson should not be allowed to run to be a Tory MP again. <br/>Writing in the Observer, he says: \"To me it is inconceivable that in these circumstances he could stand as a Conservative member of parliament again.\"<br/>Addressing the former PM's resignation letter, Mr Heseltine writes: \"Words are designed to make his audience believe whatever they want to believe. There is no anchor to any discernible truth or sense of integrity.\"<br/>He adds that Mr Johnson will leave Parliament and \"have little to do with the reality of the mess he left behind\".<br/>Elsewhere in the Sunday Mirror, Sir Keir accused Mr Sunak of failing to stand up to Mr Johnson and agreeing \"to hand gongs to a cast list of cronies\".<br/>\"Rishi Sunak must finally find a backbone, call an election, and let the public have their say on 13 years of Tory failure,\" he added.<br/>A government source rejected that and said Mr Sunak was focussed on delivering \"what the British people want.\""}, {"_id": "648a003851ac3319f5477e63", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65863267?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "I've been forced out over Partygate report, says Boris Johnson", "lead": "Boris Johnson is to step down as an MP but insists that \"I did not lie\" over Covid lockdowns.", "author": "By Andre Rhoden-Paul, Michael Sheils McNamee & Political Editor Chris Mason", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:24.477275", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1295D/production/_130052167_46507c14-94ee-4969-ac01-10083a140aff.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has stepped down as a Tory MP after claiming he was \"forced out of Parliament\" over Partygate. <br/>The ex-PM saw in advance a report by the Commons Privileges Committee investigating if he misled the Commons over Downing Street lockdown parties.<br/>In an explosive and lengthy statement, he called the committee a \"kangaroo court\" whose purpose \"has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts\".<br/>The committee said it had \"followed the procedures and the mandate\". <br/>The cross-party committee of MPs - the majority of which are Conservative - added it would conclude its inquiry on Monday and \"publish its report promptly\".<br/>Mr Johnson's resignation now triggers a by-election in his marginal constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. <br/>Delivering his announcement late on Friday evening, Mr Johnson said the draft report he had seen was \"riddled with inaccuracies and reeks of prejudice\", adding it was clear the committee was \"determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\".<br/>\"They have still not produced a shred of evidence that I knowingly or recklessly misled the Commons,\" he said, insisting \"I did not lie\".<br/>He also accused its chairwoman, Labour's Harriet Harman, of \"egregious bias\", saying he was \"bewildered and appalled\" at how he was being forced out.<br/>The ex-prime minister previously admitted misleading Parliament when he gave evidence to the committee in a combative hearing in March - but denied doing it on purpose.<br/>He said social distancing had not been \"perfect\" at gatherings in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns but insisted the guidelines, as he understood them, were followed at all times. <br/>Mr Johnson also used his letter to attack the direction of the government, saying \"we must not be afraid to be properly Conservative\" and warning the party's majority was at risk.<br/>\"We need to show how we are making the most of Brexit and we need in the next months to be setting out a pro-growth and pro-investment agenda,\" Mr Johnson argued.  <br/>\"Why have we so passively abandoned the prospect of a Free Trade Deal with the US? Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\"<br/>It was a direct aim at Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - hours after he stepped off a plane from Washington where Mr Sunak was not talking about a free trade agreement with the US. <br/>And Mr Johnson's statement was an attempt to rally Brexiteers in his party, suggesting his demise was driven by a motivation to \"reverse the 2016 referendum result\".<br/>The statement contained further criticism of former senior civil servant Sue Gray, who investigated lockdown gatherings at Number 10. <br/>\"I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence\" that she will soon become \"chief of staff designate\" of the Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer, Mr Johnson wrote.<br/>Ending his 1,000-word letter, Mr Johnson said he was \"very sad to be leaving Parliament\" before adding - \"at least for now\" - for anyone thinking he is about to retreat into obscurity. <br/>Mr Johnson's exit will trigger a by-election in his west London seat, which he held with a 7,000 vote majority in the 2019 election. <br/>The Conservatives will also have to defend the Mid Bedfordshire seat of Nadine Dorries - a close ally of Mr Johnson - after she stepped down as an MP earlier on Friday.<br/>Mr Johnson's dramatic move came after he was given the committee's findings, including details of criticisms it intended to make and evidence to support its conclusion. <br/>He had faced a potential by-election if MPs recommended a suspension from the Commons as a punishment for misleading Parliament. <br/>Responding to his statement, a Privileges Committee spokesperson said: \"The committee has followed the procedures and the mandate of the House at all times and will continue to do so.<br/>\"Mr Johnson has departed from the processes of the House and has impugned the integrity of the House by his statement.

that extra borrowing could increase interest rates and mortgage costs - as an attack line. <br/>However, the change in tack could make it more difficult to deliver Labour's aim of generating all electricity without using fossil fuels by 2030. <br/>Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands said Labour's main economic policy was \"in tatters\" after they realised \"it would lead to disaster\". <br/>\"It doesn't matter if they try and pretend otherwise, Labour's plan remains to stick \u00a328bn of borrowing on the government credit card which will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates,\" he said.<br/>The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the move was \"the latest in a long line of broken promises\" from Labour, which \"could have very real and damaging consequences for Scotland's green energy potential\". <br/>Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Labour had offered a policy which \"does not go far enough\" and then \"row[ing] back at the first sign of any difficulty\". <br/>Ms Reeves was also critical of the deal Prime Minister Rishi Sunak secured with the US on his visit to Washington this week. <br/>Plans for a full free trade agreement have been abandoned but the new proposals include allowing UK electric car firms access to US green tax credits and subsidies. <br/>Ms Reeves, who visited the US herself last month, said she was \"staggered\" that Mr Sunak had returned with \"no industrial plan for Britain\". <br/>She has said Labour is taking inspiration from US President Joe Biden's plan to tackle inflation and create jobs, which includes a huge package of subsidies and tax breaks for green industries. <br/>But she said her \"secureonomics\" strategy would be \"built on the rock of financial stability and economic security\", with strict limits on borrowing.<br/>Labour has also promised to create a publicly owned renewable energy company to create jobs and improve the country's energy security. <br/>Last week the party pledged to ban new licences for oil and gas production in the UK, despite concerns from unions this could cost jobs."}, {"_id": "648a003c51ac3319f5477e68", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65846871?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden announce green funding agreement", "lead": "The UK-US Atlantic Declaration \"sets a new standard for economic cooperation\", Rishi Sunak says.", "author": "By Sam Francis", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:28.838563", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6E21/production/_130039182_0021453572cdfd5ae4577786211f3d130026ce1f121_504_5400_30371000x563.jpg", "body": "UK firms could gain access to US green funding as part of plans to boost UK and US ties announced by Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden.<br/>The pair unveiled the Atlantic Declaration, to strengthen economic ties between the two countries, at a White House press conference.<br/>The PM said the agreement, which falls short of a full trade deal would bring benefits \"as quickly as possible\".<br/>UK electric car firms may get access to US green tax credits and subsidies.<br/>As the pair unveiled their partnership to bolster economic security, Mr Sunak said the UK-US relationship was an \"indispensable alliance\".<br/>The Atlantic Declaration, includes commitments on easing trade barriers, closer defence industry ties and a data protection deal and steps up co-operation on AI.<br/>Asked by BBC Political Editor Chris Mason whether the new deal was an \"acknowledgement of the failure\" to strike a broader trade agreement between the UK and US, Mr Sunak said today's deal \"responds to particular challenges and opportunities we face right now\".<br/>A UK-US free trade agreement was a key pledge in the Conservative Party's 2019 general election manifesto.<br/>Mr Sunak insisted the more targeted approach of the declaration was about \"what can do the most benefit to our citizens as quickly as possible\".<br/>\"Be in no doubt, the economic relationship between our two countries has never been stronger,\" Mr Sunak said.<br/>Plans for a full free trade agreement were  abandoned months ago. On the plane ride over to Washington Mr Sunak said: \"For a while now, that has not been a priority for either the US or UK.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy criticised Mr Sunak, saying the government has left \"Britain's cupboards bare\" by not securing a trade deal. <br/>\"This statement shows the government has failed to deliver the comprehensive trade deal they promised in the 2019 manifesto, or to secure the ally status under the Inflation Reduction Act that is so important for the automotive sector and for the green transition,\" Mr Lammy said. <br/>Mr Biden said the special relationship with the UK was in \"real good shape\", referring to their co-operation on Ukraine.<br/>\"Together we are providing economic and humanitarian aid and security systems to Ukraine in their fight against a brutal invasion from Russia,\" he said.<br/>The Atlantic Declaration includes plans to mitigate some of the impact of the US flagship Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)  on the UK economy, with proposals to remove barriers which affected trade in electric vehicle batteries.<br/>Under current policy, the IRA provides tax credit worth $3,750 (\u00a33,000) for each electric vehicle (EV) manufactured in the US, or which use components mined, processed or manufactured in the country. <br/>The UK is already a net exporter of raw materials for EV batteries to the US. But nations without a US trade deal are barred from accessing IRA subsidies.  <br/>The Atlantic Declaration commits the UK and US to working on a new critical minerals agreement - which would give buyers of vehicles made using critical minerals processed, recycled or mined by UK companies access to tax credits.<br/>The declaration says the agreement would be launched after consultation with US Congress.<br/>Japan already has a similar deal, which allows Japanese firms to also swerve export duties on minerals used in producing EV batteries.<br/>The declaration also includes a commitment to a \"new UK-US Data Bridge\" which would allow UK firms to transfer data freely to certified US organisations without paying a levy.<br/>Downing Street estimate the change will affect around 55,000 UK businesses - translating into \u00a392.4m in direct savings per year.<br/>Mr Biden also supported Mr Sunak's plans to set up an international summit on AI safety which will be hosted in the UK later this year.<br/>The prime minister said: \"The UK and US have always pushed the boundaries of what two countries can achieve together.<br/>\"So it is natural that, when faced with the greatest transformation in our economies since the industrial revolution, we would look to each other to build a stronger economic future together.  <br/>\"The Atlantic Declaration sets a new standard for economic cooperation, propelling our economies into the future so we can protect our people, create jobs and grow our economies together.\" <br/>Both Mr Biden and Mr Sunak agreed to carry out work to improve the resilience of supply chains and efforts will be stepped up to shut Vladimir Putin's Russia out of the global civil nuclear market.

A spokesperson said it \"should help to improve investor confidence in the UK North Sea, which will remain crucial to maintaining Britain's energy security in the coming years\".<br/>However, the change to the windfall tax was criticised by the Green Party.<br/>\"The government seems happy to allow these huge corporations to not only wreck the climate but to profit off the back of the cost-of-living crisis which they themselves have contributed to,\" said Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay.<br/>\"Instead, the government should be tightening the tax, closing the loopholes and ensuring the money raised helps people through the cost-of-living crisis and funds the sustainable green energy jobs in the renewable sector we urgently need.\"<br/>Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Georgia Whitaker, said: \"Irrespective of what happens to the price of oil and gas, the tax these companies pay should be higher, permanently.<br/>\"This cash should be used to help insulate homes and transition the UK to cheap, clean energy, not fill the bank balances of already wealthy shareholders.\""}, {"_id": "648a003e51ac3319f5477e6a", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65846876?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Boris Johnson has Partygate inquiry findings ahead of report's publication", "lead": "A committee is deciding whether the former PM purposely misled Parliament over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street.", "author": "By Helen Catt & Sam Francis", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:30.465259", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6587/production/_130019952_2d3fc2cd-eb34-4fee-aee0-e941e3fa6a6a.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has been given the findings of an MP-led investigation into whether he misled parliament over Partygate. <br/>The Privileges Committee is examining whether the former PM purposefully misled Parliament over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street.<br/>In evidence given in March, Mr Johnson admitted misleading Parliament, but denied doing it on purpose.<br/>He now has two weeks to respond to a \"warning letter\" sent by the committee.<br/>The letter details the criticisms it intends to make of Mr Johnson, along with any evidence which supports them, the BBC understands.<br/>If the committee finds that Mr Johnson did mislead Parliament, it could recommend his suspension from the House of Commons for 10 days or more, triggering a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>The letter will also inform Mr Johnson of any proposed penalties that the committee will suggest for MPs to approve.<br/>MPs would be asked to endorse the findings, via a vote in the House of Commons.<br/>Mr Johnson now has two weeks to reply.

I think you have to ask yourself, where do we live right now, are we living in Russia or are we living in Britain?\"<br/>The Labour party has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments and has promised to invest in renewables if it wins power. <br/>After unions raised concerns over potential job losses, Sir Keir said that existing North Sea projects would be able to continue until 2050, meaning \"oil and gas will be part our energy mix for years to come\". <br/>Mr Sunak accused the Labour party of \"putting ideology ahead of jobs, ahead of investment, and ahead of our energy security\". <br/>Mr Vince said he wouldn't stop funding Labour if Keir Starmer were to backtrack on his commitment over North Sea Oil. <br/>Asked if he had become more of a problem than an asset to Labour, Mr Vince said: \"I hope what I'm doing here [is] speaking out for Just Stop Oil and the millions of people that share their frustration...I hope that's not harming Labour, it's so vital Labour win the next election.\"<br/>A spokeswoman for the Labour leader's office said: \"Keir has been outspoken in his condemnation of Just Stop Oil who he believes have put lives and livelihoods at risk.<br/>\"The idea that they have influenced our policy is for the birds.\""}, {"_id": "648a004151ac3319f5477e6e", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65843261?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Lords debate Illegal Migration Bill until 4am", "lead": "The measures face strong opposition from peers, as they debated potential changes to the bill until the early hours.", "author": "By Emaan Warraich", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:33.312605", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/51A7/production/_130030902_16c6a8513a31d642ac0cc70789a6c7f31f29b4e3115_315_3334_18761000x563.jpg", "body": "A debate on the Illegal Migration Bill in the House of Lords continued until 4.16am on Thursday morning.<br/>There was criticism from some peers about the late hours, with one Labour peer describing it as \"disgraceful\".<br/>It is rare for MPs or peers to continue to debate so late.<br/>The bill, aimed at stopping people crossing the Channel in small boats, has already passed the Commons but has run into strong opposition from peers as they continue detailed debate.<br/>The legislation gives ministers the power to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally, and migrants would be barred from claiming asylum.<br/>Instead they would be detained and removed, either to Rwanda or another \"safe country\".<br/>The Lords was holding its third day debate on committee stage of the bill, which is when changes to the bill, or amendments, are discussed.<br/>Although targets are set for amendments at this stage, these are flexible and it is not unusual for extra days to be added. <br/>Despite late hour, an unusually large number of ministers remained in the chamber, along with the Lords chief whip and some Tory peers, as an apparent safety net in case a vote was called.<br/>Critics argued it was \"disappointing\" such important matters, including the care of unaccompanied migrant children and detention of pregnant women, were being dealt with in such a way.<br/>Labour former minister Lord Bach said: \"Can I for my own part say how disgraceful I think it is we are debating these really important and serious matters at this hour in the morning.\"<br/>Liberal Democrat Lord Scriven said: \"It is not funny and amusing to be told that we have to stay here until goodness knows what time to do our job because the government benches wish to rush this through at any cost as a red-wall, red-meat bill, rather than allowing us the serious job that we have to do as members of this House.

an issue that has been kicked into the political long grass for years.<br/>The report says the immediate priority - should Labour take power - would be to tackle recruitment and retention, and along with a new minimum wage of \u00a311.45 an hour, employment rights for care workers should also be improved.<br/>There is little doubt that this is in line with the Labour's leadership thinking.<br/>In a wide-ranging speech to the GMB union this week, Sir Keir Starmer promised \"a fair pay agreement for every care worker in the country and the deal...will set a new floor, a higher floor for wages\".<br/>By 2028, the report envisages the new National Care Service would be set up.<br/>This would be separate from the NHS, with care homes still predominantly privately owned. But, there would be greater public oversight and higher standards. <br/>The report recognises that providers would need to be better funded - arguing that more than \u00a37bn has been spent by councils on care homes which are inadequate.<br/>While the case for more funding is set out, the report is rather shy when it comes to specific numbers.<br/>It says Labour should make a promise to increase real terms funding by a \"significant percentage each year\".<br/>\"Significant increases for adult social care are essential and inevitable,\" the report said.<br/>Insiders say that, with Labour under fire from opponents for specific spending commitments on green policies, there is a reluctance to set out specific sums in other areas well before an election.<br/>But critics are more concerned that the report has largely ducked the question of the lifetime cost of care for individuals.<br/>In a 2011 report, for the then Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, the economist Sir Andrew Dilnot recommended a cap on social care costs of between \u00a325,000-\u00a335,000.<br/>This was never implemented.

That committee is made up mainly of Tory MPs. The former PM has faced the same procedure as other MPs that get into trouble. And while Mr Johnson claims he has been \"forced out\", remember he has chosen to quit before we even see the black and white of their verdict. <br/>It is also a fact there are some Conservatives who begrudge him his success. It is also true that during his last few months in No 10 there were internal enemies trying to force him out. <br/>But to dress that up as a grand conspiracy is, candidly, a stretch. One of those who knows him best told me his resignation announcement was \"1,000 words that tell you everything about Johnson's mindset - it's your fault not mine\".<br/>Rather than confront what has happened or try to defend himself from the judgement that is coming, Boris Johnson made a political choice this week not to stay and fight. <br/>As ever, the line between farce and tragedy is skinny. While most of the headlines screamed of the shock, the former prime minister's exit from Parliament is entirely on brand. <br/>The timing on a Friday was unexpected, but no surprise. He never much liked Parliament anyway, even though he managed to find a gong for the Commons' hairdresser. <br/>The idea he would savour being a humble backbencher asking questions about cash for the local hospital or appearing at school fetes was for the birds. And if the Privileges Committee's findings are as savage as expected he would have faced a by-election. <br/>Clues from his track record tell us there is little chance he would have fought if he hadn't been sure he could win. He pulled out of the Tory leadership race in 2016 when Michael Gove's move blew up his status as front-runner. <br/>He didn't run in 2022 despite a dash back from the Caribbean and fevered claims that he had enough support. One former cabinet ally says he is \"more calculating than people think and this will have been a calculation -  if he thought he would win the by-election he would stay\". To win and lose does not match brand Boris. To leave like this absolutely does.<br/>The power of his personality - frankly his fame - means he leaves behind some devastated colleagues and a strand of the public who believe he has been hard done by. <br/>One former cabinet minister says: \"The party wounded itself when it defenestrated Boris and continues to bleed.\"<br/>Some of his hard-core supporters left on the backbenches say his exit is a sad day for democracy and - with some justification believe his leadership is what secured their seats, particularly in parts of the country where the Tories could never have dreamt of doing well before. <br/>Some of his loyal backers do feel like he is the great hero in a tragedy, cast aside unfairly in an epic drama, undone by those who envy his talents. <br/>His exit is arguably a tragedy for those who genuinely believed in and adored him. And there is a political tragedy for the Conservative Party, which many MPs privately believe squandered a once in a generation majority. <br/>2019 gave it one of those rare chances to make radical changes to the country, and while many believe it was thrown away by mismanagement and mistakes, there was of course the unexpected horror of the Covid pandemic too. <br/>For those who deplore Boris Johnson, there is a different kind of tragedy, the damage they believe he did to the UK's reputation. And several of those who have been close to him over the years identify a fourth element of the mess - the fact they believe it was never going to end well. <br/>In the Greek tragedies so beloved of Mr Johnson himself, fate, and inevitability plays an important role. One of them says: \"Boris is a genuine tragedy. This was all inevitable. We knew how it would play out, but we are still surprised and shocked about how dreadful it is. All our hard work pissed away.\" <br/>So what happens next? Some MPs are actually cock-a-hoop despite the colossal mess. One tells me: \"The man-baby has gone - so pleased!\"<br/>But allies talk up his chances of running for another seat some time. One former senior minister tells me \"the question is does he plan to get another seat or even Mid-Beds?\" - the constituency his close ally and former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has just left. <br/>Another former cabinet minister says: \"It would be very unwise for him to run again. He has a vociferous 20% in the party who like him but 80% don't. If he ran in a by-election the Lib Dems would murder him.\"<br/>Would party HQ even let that happen? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has changed the personnel in charge there. One senior figure pours a bucket of freezing water over the idea telling me: \"Boris died today.\"<br/>What is not clear yet is whether as that MP suggests the manner of his departure could \"generate so much unrest I fear there will be an election much sooner than thought\".<br/>Mr Johnson has thrown grenades at No 10 - not just the committee that has judged him - suggesting Mr Sunak is not running a \"proper Conservative\" government. <br/>One former ally says the ex-PM has \"gone full circle, returning to his political home - a hut across the water where he can now lob rocks without any sense of responsibility or accountability - and that is ultimately very dangerous for his party and Sunak\". <br/>But if Boris Johnson is unlikely to run for Parliament again, and is happy to dangle the prospect of a return, what else might he do with his time?<br/>You'll find plenty of people in Westminster chattering that he'll return to his first love - writing - but might there be something bigger? <br/>By chance his old newspaper the Telegraph has just come up for sale and - by chance - its former editor Will Lewis has just been made a knight by Mr Johnson. Is there, by chance, the possibility they might be part of a bid to take it over? <br/>It's been suggested to me that is in fact something that has been discussed. It's no secret that Mr Lewis - now Sir Will - would be keen to take it on. <br/>He advised Mr Johnson in No 10 sometimes and the two men worked together at the Telegraph when the former PM was its star columnist who attracted extra subscribers each week. <br/>Going back as a columnist would be one thing for Mr Johnson and not all that surprising. But for him to take a bigger role - as one source whispers, the editor - might be the Conservatives' worst nightmare. <br/>I'm told that conversations are only at the stage of ideas being scribbled down on paper. A formal sale process, let alone any decisions about actual bids, is a long way off.  <br/>But I can't help wondering, what would the consequences be for Downing Street and the Conservatives if their most loyal backer in the press gave a major role to Mr Sunak's bitter rival? Could the next twist in the Boris Johnson story be even wilder than the last? Perhaps. <br/>Some of those who have worked alongside him believe it is more likely to be \"terminal Boris\". A former ally says \"he was obviously once someone with exceptional skills, who came so far, and did so much in the face of incredible opposition\".<br/>But they say, perhaps in sorrow and in anger: \"His career ends with him alone, a victim of his utter inability to tell the truth to anyone, including himself.\"<br/>Maybe he will fade into obscurity. Perhaps he'll be back in Parliament one day. He might make millions speaking and writing or become Rishi Sunak's most powerful opposition. <br/>But his name is now on the list of those unprovable political \"what ifs' so furiously and perpetually debated by political nerds. <br/>What if Mrs Thatcher hadn't been forced out? What if Tony Blair hadn't invaded Iraq? What if Boris Johnson had given a different answer in the Commons when he was first asked what happened under his roof during the Covid lockdowns? <br/>We will never know. But what we do know this weekend is that one era is over. We know Boris Johnson had huge potential to create, but also to destroy - his extraordinary majority, his reputation, and the party he led too. <br/>He must now decide what to do with the power that he still retains. And his old party must decide how much attention it wants to pay.

Like all prime ministerial trips abroad, it wasn't exactly typical.<br/>Here are four things that make travelling with the prime minister a unique experience.<br/>For years the debate raged. Was it legitimate for the prime minister to have a plane they could call their own?<br/>The issue made headlines during Tony Blair's premiership - when, inevitably, the prospect of such a thing was called Blair Force One. In 2006, a plan was announced. But in 2008, when Gordon Brown was prime minister, it was scrapped.<br/>Is a private jet ostentatious? Does it help with the practicalities of being a frequently flying leader? Does it project an image of the UK abroad that you wouldn't get turning up on a chartered plane? <br/>For now at least, the debate is over: the prime minister does have access to his own plane. And I type these words sitting on it, somewhere over the Atlantic.<br/>It is an Airbus A321, with a union flag on the tail fin, and \"United Kingdom\" written down the side. <br/>When you fly on this thing, it is rather different from rolling up at the airport to go on holiday. We leave from a private terminal, we often don't get a boarding pass and usually we take all of our baggage on with us - for a reason I'll get to shortly.<br/>But meanwhile\u2026<br/>You might imagine, in a private jet, the entertainment system would be something else. <br/>There is WiFi, so the prime minister and his team can stay connected and work efficiently, which is something they value. And it helps us reporters too.<br/>On the plane, there are none of those little screens you get in the back of the seat in front of you on some flights, packed with films and playlists and maps showing precisely where you are over the ocean. Instead, we often have what is called a \"huddle\".<br/>A huddle involves the prime minister coming to the back of the plane, where reporters crowd around him, and each ask him a question.<br/>This is how it works: all the reporters get together beforehand, in the airport, to work out what we are going to ask, in what order, to ensure we cover a range of topics. <br/>The conversation is \"on the record\" - to use the jargon - meaning we can quote the words and attribute them to the prime minister. But the huddle is not recorded for television or radio. <br/>A round of on-camera interviews with the prime minister tends to happen later in the trip. Each broadcaster is assigned a strictly agreed amount of time - often seven minutes - to attempt to find things out, hold the government to account and test its arguments. <br/>Interviewing any prime minister is a huge privilege and responsibility: working on your behalf, trying to ask the questions you want asking. I will always ask the brilliant producer I am working with to stand just out of shot counting down the minutes I have left on their fingers. <br/>Journalistically, there is a tension on these trips: we are close to the prime minister and his team throughout. This is useful, in understanding what they are doing and what motivates their decisions. But instinctively reporters want to be detached, independent and disinterested, and being in what can feel like a bubble feels odd in that context.<br/>Oh, and if we are going somewhere on a long-haul flight - for example Indonesia, Japan or the west coast of America, as we've have recently - we end up having to stop to refuel. <br/>And so those trips involved landing in Dubai, Muscat, Almaty and Washington, hanging around for an hour or so, and then taking off again. <br/>There aren't huge queues to check in. Or any queues at all. <br/>There are comfy settees to sit on, there is loads of natural light and a free coffee machine. To say it feels different from when you head off on a family holiday with the kids is to put it gently. Mind you, I don't take laptops, a tripod, and no end of other broadcasting kit with me on holiday either. <br/>Recently, we flew back into Luton Airport in the middle of the night and pulled up at a private terminal. Past the entrance to what was described as the \"VVIP lounge\" (I couldn't see in, I'm afraid) was a glass cabinet proffering stuff from Harrods, including a collection of pink teddies complete with \"recycled polyester filling\". <br/>A large rectangular steel clock hung on the wall. \"We commissioned this clock from Beaumont flying art,\" read the inscription. Also on the wall, a colossal screen, pitching the merits of executive private jets, the kind that only carry a handful of passengers. \"15 hours of peaceful luxury!\" is how they describe the flight on offer.<br/>When the prime minister's plane lands abroad, a diplomatic ritual begins. As the plane pulls up, a smiling delegation greets us. <br/>One of the first people off the plane is the camera journalist assigned to film the prime minister's arrival on behalf of all the broadcasters. There might be a red carpet. There are almost always flags.<br/>The UK ambassador to wherever we are will be there at the bottom of the plane steps. Maybe even some sort of performance will be offered by the hosts - at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport last autumn, it was a troupe of traditional dancers.<br/>And while the prime minister is getting off via the front set of steps, the rest of us are piling off at the back and getting into a seemingly never-ending line of minibuses waiting on the tarmac.<br/>There's no time to wait for a bag in the hold. That's why we take them onto the plane with us.<br/>In next to no time, the motorcade is moving - and moving fast. Police outriders swarm all around us, and junctions are closed, so we can race through.<br/>On the motorway, the fast lane is (temporarily) closed so we can zip by. Passers by can be lining the streets, sometimes, to grab pictures. <br/>On a recent trip to Japan, the press minibus wasn't the nippiest, its engine squealing to keep up with the slick Mercedes of the prime minister a dozen or so vehicles ahead."}, {"_id": "648a004851ac3319f5477e78", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-65323861?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Scotland", "subCategories": "Scotland Politics,Scotland Business,Edinburgh, Fife & East,Glasgow & West,Highlands & Islands,NE, Orkney & Shetland,South,Tayside & Central", "title": "Why was Nicola Sturgeon arrested and what happens next?", "lead": "The arrest of the former first minister is the latest remarkable twist in the investigation into the SNP's finances.", "author": "By Stuart Nicolson", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:40.933739", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB84/production/_129280934_murrellhome-pa2.jpg", "body": " Nicola Sturgeon has been released without charge pending further investigations after being arrested by police investigating the SNP's finances. <br/>It was the latest remarkable twist in Police Scotland's ongoing Operation Branchform inquiry. <br/>The former first minister was taken into custody and questioned by detectives at a police station after she attended voluntarily shortly after 10:00 on Sunday. <br/>Officers had up to 12 hours from the time Ms Sturgeon was arrested before they had to decide whether to charge her with a crime or release her while their inquiries continue. <br/>In the end, she was released from custody at about 17:25 on the same day - well before the deadline expired and just over seven hours since her arrest.<br/>Shorty afterwards, she published a statement on Twitter saying that she knew \"beyond doubt that I am innocent of any wrongdoing\".<br/>She also said she would \"never do anything to harm either the SNP or the country\" and that the situation she had found herself in earlier in the day was \"both a shock and deeply distressing\". <br/>Despite her release, police have said the case remains active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.<br/>It means everyone has to be careful about what they say to avoid potentially prejudicing any future trial. <br/>This applies to politicians and members of the public on social media as well as broadcasters and newspapers and the rules around what can and cannot be said about this - or any other - case are interpreted much more strictly in Scotland than in some other parts of the world.<br/>Scotland is not the United States, for example, where pundits merrily speculate about the guilt or innocence of a suspect long before the case goes anywhere near a jury.<br/>Convictions for contempt of court can be punishable by up to two years in prison and/or an unlimited fine.<br/>The police investigation into this case began almost two years ago when complaints were made relating to more than \u00a3660,000 that was donated to the SNP by activists. <br/>The money was raised after the party sought funds for a future referendum campaign, and Police Scotland launched Operation Branchform to examine what happened to it.<br/>Earlier this year, officers sent an initial report seeking advice and guidance from the body which prosecutes crimes in Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).<br/>That advice was provided and the investigation continued.<br/>On 5 April, officers searched Ms Sturgeon's home and the party's headquarters in Edinburgh and arrested her husband Peter Murrell, who was until recently the party's chief executive.<br/>A luxury motorhome was also seized by police from outside the home of Mr Murrell's mother in Dunfermline. <br/>Almost two weeks later, SNP treasurer Colin Beattie was arrested.<br/>Mr Murrell and Mr Beattie were both treated as suspects and were taken into custody for the legally defined period of up to 12 hours of questioning before also being released pending further inquiries.<br/>Under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016, police can release a suspect for further investigation, but they can be re-arrested at a later date. <br/>Over the coming days and weeks, the force is likely to continue to investigate and gather more evidence. They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account.

who are standing close to each other. <br/>The Privileges Committee's initial report said: \"We will consider why Mr Johnson told the House that no rules or guidance had been broken in No. 10 when he knew what the rules and guidance were and was in attendance at gatherings where the rules and guidance were breached.\"<br/>Appearing before the committee, Mr Johnson said: \"The guidance specifically allows for workplace freedoms to decide how to implement it.\"<br/>He argued that thanking staff in person at leaving events was essential for the operation of government.<br/>But there was nothing in the guidance for England from the time that implied that workplace gatherings such as leaving drinks were permitted. <br/>Boris Johnson made these opening remarks to Parliament after a video emerged of members of his staff joking about how to respond to questions about a Christmas party at Downing Street on 18 December 2020 - which involved wine, cheese and a Secret Santa.<br/>Mr Johnson says he did not attend that event.<br/>Mr Johnson's claim revolves around what assurances he was given. <br/>He told the Privileges Committee that he received those assurances from two of his senior communications advisers: Jack Doyle and James Slack and an unnamed No 10 official. <br/>The MPs asked why he had not sought advice from a government lawyer or from the head of the civil service, Simon Case.<br/>The committee has published evidence showing that Mr Case denied giving Mr Johnson assurances \"at any time\" that Covid rules and guidance \"were followed at all times in No 10\".<br/>And he said he was unaware of anyone else having given him these assurances. <br/>Boris Johnson said this in Parliament in response to the publication of the Sue Gray report. This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold."}, {"_id": "648a004b51ac3319f5477e7b", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65852054?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Chris Mason: What Sunak\u2019s Atlantic Declaration is \u2013 and isn\u2019t", "lead": "There's an economic elephant in the diplomatic corridors so big it has turned heads in boardrooms globally.", "author": "By Chris Mason", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:43.169420", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31A0/production/_130040721_8522bcc601bc8160927c836f48d16ea347783658.jpg", "body": "The Conservative manifesto in 2019 read like this: \"Our goals for British trade are\u2026 ambitious. We aim to have 80% of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years, starting with the USA.\" <br/>In truth the likelihood of such a full fat agreement, on that timeframe in particular, was probably pretty small, and it's been very small for as long as President Joe Biden has been in the White House - a reality acknowledged by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss as well as Rishi Sunak. <br/>And three years on from 2019 was 2022, last year - and there is no such deal.<br/>This is why I asked the prime minister and the president about it: given they are unveiling something of an alternative - the Atlantic Declaration - it is important to scrutinise and highlight the gap between what was in the prospectus for government that gives Mr Sunak his mandate to govern, and what he is now talking up.<br/>Not least because trade deals have been done with others, possible once the UK was outside the European Union.<br/>From Mr Sunak's perspective, the politics of this is straightforward: attempting a free trade agreement, even if President Biden wanted to deliver one and could deliver one, would take longer than either man has between now and facing their electorates in the next 18 months.<br/>So better to work up an arrangement now, even if chunks of it require further negotiation before they happen. <br/>Downing Street argues, in explaining why there has been no such deal with the US, that the world has changed since 2019. And it has. <br/>It is worth exploring how it has changed, how that is remoulding international relations and the consequences for the UK.<br/>Covid, the threat posed by China, and the war in Ukraine have been catalysts for a collective fretting from many of the relatively rich democracies over economic security.<br/>Translated: how to get hold of components or energy without relying on now hostile states. <br/>This Declaration, at least partially, attempts to address this. <br/>There is concern about military security too, which prompted the  AUKUS pact between the UK, the US and Australia.<br/>But the economic elephant in the diplomatic corridors is America's Inflation Reduction Act - a massive stimulus to address economic security and base green industries of the future in previously left behind American areas. <br/>It is so big it has turned heads in boardrooms globally. <br/>The Biden Administration's motivation is this: the economy needs to adapt given climate change, China and Russia - so let's make America less dependent on others and ensure those jobs of the future are in America.<br/>Labour say they'd do something similar. The Conservatives won't - but No10 point to elements in this deal that mitigate against some of its downsides to British businesses.<br/>Downing Street are upbeat about how the last few days have panned out. <br/>Rishi Sunak and his delegation stayed at Blair House, the President's official guesthouse. <br/>Talk to those who have been there and it's a reminder the accommodation on these trips is part of the diplomacy.<br/>The political history at every turn. The portraits on the walls. The giant strawberry dipped in chocolate left in a guest's room.<br/>Oh, and it turns out the chef in Blair House is from Warrington. <br/>He keeps fish and chips on the menu as a nod to his British heritage. But hasn't yet persuaded his bosses of the merits of shepherd's pie. <br/>The prime minister appears to relish the international element of his job: the methodical building of alliances and personal relationships, the deal making.<br/>But the domestic fray beckons again, as he swaps the Oval Office of the White House for a gathering of his northern English MPs in South Yorkshire."}, {"_id": "648a004c51ac3319f5477e7c", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65756981?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Local elections 2023: Did voters punish failing councils?", "lead": "We looked at four failing English councils to find out whether they paid the price at the ballot box.", "author": "By Oscar Bentley", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:44.094457", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1038A/production/_128824466_thurrock1.jpg", "body": "Do voters care about how badly local councils are doing their job - or do they just follow national trends? <br/>We looked at four failing councils in England, to find out whether they were punished at the ballot box in this month's local elections. <br/>The four councils - Liverpool, Sandwell in the West Midlands, Slough in Berkshire and Thurrock in Essex - have all seen the government step in to help sort out major problems.<br/>The Department for Levelling Up has sent in commissioners to oversee the work of the councils, who also take over some powers.<br/>Councils are normally placed under intervention for financial mismanagement, poor governance or a combination of the two. <br/>Thurrock and Slough have issued so-called section 114 notices, meaning they are essentially bankrupt and can't make any new spending commitments. Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years. Last year, voters elected a Conservative mayor - even though the council itself is Labour.<br/>Commissioners have reported good progress at Sandwell and are \"optimistic\" about Liverpool - both areas where the incumbent party's vote has held up.<br/>Progress at Slough on the other hand has \"been very slow\", according to the commissioners, while Thurrock had another commissioner appointed in March after the government said it was \"continuing to fail in its best value duty\".<br/>So perhaps we can conclude that voters do pay attention to local issues - and are prepared to punish failed administrations at the ballot box."}, {"_id": "648a004c51ac3319f5477e7d", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65766235?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Why row about Boris Johnson's Covid WhatsApp messages matters", "lead": "A stand-off over Boris Johnson's submissions to the Covid inquiry spells trouble for the government.", "author": "By Nick Eardley", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:44.698559", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/85F5/production/_129939243_johnson_reuters.jpg", "body": "In less than two weeks' time, one of the most important inquiries in recent British history will start holding public hearings.<br/>Senior government ministers - who made life-or-death decisions - will be among those giving evidence. <br/>The inquiry is supposed to help the government and the public work out what ministers got right and wrong - before, during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>But, already, there is an almighty row over what the inquiry should have access to.<br/>This isn't just about process. Let me explain. <br/>The inquiry's chair Baroness Hallett is demanding unredacted WhatsApp messages and notebooks from Boris Johnson.<br/>They cover the period of the pandemic when he was prime minister and making key decisions.<br/>She is adamant that it is her job to decide what is and isn't relevant to her inquiry.<br/>The government disagrees - and speaking to people close to the process, I don't think they're going to back down. <br/>They argue that they need to protect the privacy of ministers and others. They say they will not send information that is \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry.<br/>Insiders have told the BBC they will send relevant messages - for example, WhatsApp conversations that led to a policy decision. They would not send messages involving personal conversations. <br/>But they think that decision is for the government - and its lawyers - to make.<br/>So who is going to win?<br/>The more likely answer seems to be the Covid inquiry.<br/>It has legal powers to compel people to produce documents. It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled."}, {"_id": "648a004f51ac3319f5477e82", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65694014?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Chris Mason: Johnson Partygate row dredges up stench of chaos", "lead": "The former PM continues to loom large over the Tory brand despite Rishi Sunak's efforts to move on.", "author": "By Chris Mason", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:47.875069", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EEB1/production/_129850116_e87a7747-ae3e-43ea-bd8a-08c3e8cb5459.jpg", "body": "You hear occasional grumbles about repeats on the BBC.<br/>Well, here's another one.<br/>It involves Boris Johnson, Covid-19 rules and the police.<br/>One set of taxpayer-funded lawyers working for Mr Johnson -

For MPs from the party, the data on voting intention highlights their thin support among younger generations.<br/>A YouGov poll found only 21% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they voted Conservative at the last general election in 2019, compared to 67% in the over-70s category.<br/>In recent polling, done at this month's local elections, only 8% of the 18 to 24 group said they would vote Conservative.<br/>\"For the 29 to 49-year-olds, that figure was 10%,\" Mr Hancock tells the event.<br/>That 10% figure, Mr Hancock says, \"is catastrophic for the electability of the Conservative Party, not just now, but for a decade\".<br/>\"We need to have credible policies that address the issues that younger people care about,\" he says.<br/>As a TikTok enthusiast with 184,000 followers on the platform, Mr Hancock claims to have an antenna for what young people are looking for in politics.<br/>Curbing climate change, providing more affordable housing, and technological innovation are what young people care about - not some \"divisive culture war\", Mr Hancock says.<br/>Even though he's been suspended as a Tory MP over his appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity, Mr Hancock is well received here.<br/>But does his analysis really reflect the hopes and fears of younger generations?<br/>At the event, we speak to five people under the age of 30, and tellingly, all of them say housing is their biggest worry.<br/>Eve Redmond, a 23-year-old renter who recently moved to London, says: \"I don't think I'll get on the property ladder in the next 10 to 15 years.<br/>\"I do think housing is a particularly important political issue for young people under the age of 30, millennials like me.\"<br/>Joe Lynch, the 18-year-old chairman of Romford Young Conservatives, agrees.<br/>\"We need more affordable housing,\" he says. \"If we can do that as a party, more young people can flock to us.\"<br/>He says the creeping Americanisation of British politics has damaged the Conservative brand.<br/>Some young people, he says, \"think we're all Make American Great Again lunatics, but that's not the case at all\".<br/>The perception among young people of being \"the nasty party\" troubles Nathan Stone, 20.<br/>He says the war against woke - a term that has come to symbolise conservative resistance to social changes - has been \"taken to the extremes\" lately.<br/>He says some of the ideas expressed at this week's National Conservatism Conference - an event organised by a right-wing American think tank - are \"not really going to appeal to younger people\".<br/>In his comments, Mr Hancock savages the \"Conservative Corbynistas\" in his party, who \"preach the same sort of cancel culture and virtue signalling that they say that they abhor on the left\".<br/>\"Looking at what's going on at other conferences, sometimes it felt like 'I'm a Conservative get me out of here',\" he says.<br/>With Mr Hancock standing down as an MP at the next election, he soon will be out of there. And yet, he still believes the liberal wing of his party has the answers to today's political questions.<br/>They will need answers if they are to bridge the generational gulfs exposed at recent general elections. In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now. I'm not a Conservative MP. It's just like, be normal, like the people who we represent. That's what we need to do.\""}, {"_id": "648a005451ac3319f5477e85", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-65676875?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Scotland", "subCategories": "Scotland Politics,Scotland Business,Edinburgh, Fife & East,Glasgow & West,Highlands & Islands,NE, Orkney & Shetland,South,Tayside & Central", "title": "What happens next in the Margaret Ferrier case?", "lead": "The MP has been suspended from the Commons for 30 days - making a by-election extremely likely.", "author": "By Mary McCool", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:52.936618", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11ABA/production/_129387327_ferrier.jpg", "body": "A crunch by-election looks likely in Scotland after MPs voted overwhelmingly to suspend Margaret Ferrier.<br/>The MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West broke pandemic rules by speaking in parliament while awaiting the results of a Covid test in September 2020. <br/>After learning she had tested positive, she took a train home to Glasgow rather than isolating. <br/>Her suspension could lead to a by-election - so what happens next and what does it mean for her constituency? <br/>The Commons standards committee recommended in March that the MP - who was elected for the SNP but had been sitting as an independent - should be suspended for 30 days.<br/>Ms Ferrier appealed the judgement, but it was later upheld when MPs voted by 185 to 40 in favour of the suspension on 6 June. <br/>Any MP suspended for more than 10 days will face a recall petition.<br/>If the petition is signed by more than 10% of eligible voters in the constituency within six weeks, the MP is removed from their seat and a by-election called.<br/>South Lanarkshire Council has confirmed the Margaret Ferrier recall petition will be open from 09:00 on Tuesday 20 June to 17:00 on Monday 31 July 2023.<br/>Constituents can sign the document at seven council sites across the area.<br/>Applications to participate by post or by proxy can be organised by contacting the Electoral Registration Office.<br/>The council has also confirmed that the number of Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituents entitled to sign the petition is 81,124 - so 8,113 people would have to sign to remove Ms Ferrier.<br/>If this is successful, it is likely a by-election will not happen until the autumn.<br/>Labour had already selected a candidate for a by-election before the Commons had even voted to suspend her, with the party quietly confident of winning the seat and adding momentum to its campaign ahead of next year's general election. <br/>The recall procedure for MPs was introduced in 2015 in response to the MPs' expenses scandal in the run up to the 2010 general election.<br/>MPs can be recalled under three circumstances:<br/>A petition officer then arranges for the petition to be open for six weeks. <br/>According to House of Commons Library, electors can sign it in person at a signing station or by post or proxy.<br/>If the 10% threshold is reached the petition officer informs the Speaker of the House of Commons - the seat becomes vacant when this notice is given.<br/>Two MPs have been recalled through this process both in 2019 - Labour's Fiona Onasanya of Peterborough and Conservative Chris Davies of Brecon and Radnorshire.<br/>Ms Onasanya, who lied to police over a speeding ticket, had been jailed for three months for perverting the course of justice.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Davies had pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false expenses claim.<br/>A recall petition was held in North Antrim in September 2018 over the DUP's Ian Paisley, but failed to get enough signatures.<br/>The Commons had voted to suspend him for failing to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government and lobbying on its behalf.<br/>This will be the first recall petition held in Scotland.<br/>People can campaign for or against recall petitions and the Electoral Commission has rules in place for spending and donations on such campaigns.<br/>Voters who want to sign the recall petition will need voter ID because of new rules introduced by the UK government.<br/>It had been suggested that some Conservative MPs might vote against the motion to ban Ms Ferrier as they are concerned about the precedent it would set in the case of Boris Johnson.<br/>The former PM's behaviour is being looked at by Westminster's Privileges Committee over whether he misled parliament.<br/>Of the 40 MPs who ultimately opposed her suspension, 32 were Conservatives, two were DUP, two were Alba - Neale Hanvey and Kenny MacAskill - and one was Reclaim.<br/>The Conservatives who backed her included former ministers David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and party grandees Sir Bill Cash and Sir Edward Leigh.<br/>Ferrier was accompanied in the Commons for the vote by Conservative former minister Andrew Selous and SNP MP Carol Monaghan. <br/>At one point, Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski was seen walking to the opposition benches to shake her hand.<br/>Many of her former SNP colleagues had been calling for her to quit as an MP since her lockdown breach first came to light.

Europe, the Middle East, and the South Atlantic also saw significant increases in turbulence.<br/>Prof Williams said the increased turbulence was due to greater wind shear - or differences in wind speed - in the jet stream, a strong wind system blowing from west to east, about five to seven miles above the Earth's surface. It exists largely due to a difference in temperature between the world's equator and poles. <br/>While satellites can't see the turbulence, they can see the structure and the shape of the jet stream, allowing it to be analysed.<br/>Radar can pick up turbulence from storms, but clear-air turbulence is almost invisible and hard to detect. <br/>Turbulent flights are not only uncomfortable, but can also cause injuries for those on the flight. Severe turbulence is very rare, but clear-air turbulence can come out of the blue, when passengers are not belted in.<br/>\"Nobody should stop flying because they're afraid of turbulence, but it is sensible to keep your seat belt fastened all the time, unless you're moving around, which is what the pilots do,\" said Prof Williams. \"That is almost a guarantee that you will be safe even in the worst turbulence.\"<br/>There are also financial consequences. The aviation industry loses between $150m (\u00a3120m) and $500m (\u00a3400m) in the US alone annually due to effects of turbulence, including wear-and-tear on aircraft, said the researchers.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\""}, {"_id": "648a005651ac3319f5477e88", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65839060?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "El Ni\u00f1o planet-warming weather phase has begun", "lead": "Storms, droughts and record high temperatures lie ahead as US scientists confirm El Ni\u00f1o has arrived.", "author": "By Matt McGrath", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:54.966201", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B287/production/_130030754_gettyimages-1248304400.jpg", "body": "A natural weather event known as El Ni\u00f1o has begun in the Pacific Ocean, likely adding heat to a planet already warming under climate change.<br/>US scientists confirmed that El Ni\u00f1o had started. Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

We are seeing both a larger area burned, and more severe fires.\"<br/>Spring in Canada has been much warmer and drier than usual, creating a tinder-dry environment for these vast fires. <br/>In Halifax, in the eastern province of Nova Scotia, temperatures last week reached 33C, around 10 degrees higher than normal for the time of year.<br/>Parts of the country, including Alberta and Saskatchewan, have been in drought since 2020.<br/>\"The vegetation in the forests is exceptionally dry,\" says climate scientist Daniel Swain at UCLA, which has meant that a higher fraction of lightning strikes has resulted in forest fires. <br/>Experts link the high temperatures to record-breaking spring heat seen in other parts of the northern hemisphere, including Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria and Siberia.<br/>Last year scientists concluded that high temperatures exacerbated by climate change made drought in the northern hemisphere more likely.<br/>Wildfires also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, those gases that warm our atmosphere. <br/>Emissions from the Canada wildfires in May reached 54.8 million tonnes, which is more than double the past records for that month since estimates began in 2003, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.<br/>A storm system and swirling low-pressure weather has been pushing hazy, smoggy air into parts of Canada and the US, hundreds of miles away from fires.<br/>Those weather conditions may ease in the next few days, meaning the skies could begin to clear, but for areas closer to the fires, the smoke is likely to continue.<br/>The Canadian government says the risk of wildfires is expected to recede in Quebec and Ontario in July, but the potential is expected to expand next month into the Yukon in north-western Canada.<br/>And the heat and dry weather are projected to last throughout the summer, meaning the risk of fire is unlikely to decrease soon.<br/>Scientists predict wildfires will become more frequent and intense in future because of the combined effects of land use and climate change.<br/>But Prof Scheller says \"there will always be year-to-year variation\". <br/>While wildfire frequency varies from region to region, the number of acres burned by these conflagrations has risen notably in recent decades in North America.<br/>That trend is expected to continue for decades as climate change worsens, causing higher temperatures and drier conditions, says Prof Scheller."}, {"_id": "648a005751ac3319f5477e8a", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65834167?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "Crocodile found to have made herself pregnant", "lead": "Researchers have found the first case of a crocodile who made herself pregnant.", "author": "By Pallab Ghosh", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:55.726530", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1528F/production/_130017668_screenshot2023-06-07at12.03.22.png", "body": "The first case of a crocodile who made herself pregnant has been identified at a zoo in Costa Rica.<br/>She produced a foetus that was 99.9% genetically identical to herself.<br/>The phenomenon of so-called \"virgin birth\" has been found in species of birds, fish and other reptiles, but never before in crocodiles.<br/>The scientists say the trait might be inherited from an evolutionary ancestor, so dinosaurs might also have been capable of self-reproduction.<br/>The research has been published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters.<br/>The egg was laid by an 18-year-old female American crocodile in Parque Reptilania in January 2018. The foetus inside was fully formed but stillborn and so did not hatch.<br/>The crocodile who laid the egg was obtained when she was two years old and was kept apart from other crocodiles for its entire life. Because of this, the park's scientific team contacted Belfast-born Dr Warren Booth, now working at Virginia Tech in the US.  He has been studying virgin births, known scientifically as parthenogenesis, for 11 years.<br/>Dr Booth analysed the foetus and found that it was more than 99.9 % genetically identical to its mother - confirming that it had no father.<br/>He told BBC News that he wasn't surprised by the discovery.<br/>''We see it in in sharks, birds, snakes and lizards and it is remarkably common and widespread''.<br/>He speculated that the reason that parthenogenesis has not been seen in crocodiles is because people have not been looking for instances of them.<br/>''There was a big increase in reports of parthenogenesis when people started keeping pet snakes. But your average reptile keeper doesn't keep a crocodile,\" he said.<br/>One theory is that it happens in species capable of parthenogenesis when numbers dwindle, and they are on the verge of extinction. And Dr Booth told BBC news that this may have happened to some species of dinosaurs when their numbers dwindled due to environmental changes.<br/>''The fact that the mechanism of parthenogenesis is the same in so many different species suggests that it is a very ancient trait that has been inherited throughout the ages.

Aimee's blood sugar levels also worsened and her blood fat levels - lipids - went up.<br/>This was a short-term study on just one set of twins, but the results highlight growing fears among some scientists about the possible impact of so-called ultra-processed foods on our health, which BBC Panorama has been investigating.<br/>Prof Tim Spector, is a professor of epidemiology at King's College London, who studies trends in disease and oversaw the test. <br/>He told BBC Panorama: \"In the last decade, the evidence has been slowly growing that ultra-processed food is harmful for us in ways we hadn't thought. <br/>\"We're talking about a whole variety of cancers, heart disease, strokes, dementia.\" <br/>The term ultra-processed foods - or UPF - was only coined 15 years ago but it makes up about half the things we now eat in the UK. <br/>From sliced brown bread to ready meals and ice cream, it is a group of foods made with varying - but often substantial - levels of industrial processing. Ingredients used, such as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, do not typically feature in home cooking. <br/>\"Ultra-processed foods are among the most profitable foods companies can make,\" says Prof Marion Nestle, a food politics expert and professor of nutrition at New York University.<br/>As our consumption of ultra-processed foods go up - the UK is one of the biggest consumers per head in Europe - so have rates of diabetes and cancer.<br/>Some academics think the link is not coincidental. <br/>Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health?<br/>Ultra-processed convenience foods contain chemicals that UK regulators say are safe, but Panorama investigates emerging scientific evidence of a link between some of these chemicals and cancer, diabetes and strokes.<br/>Watch on BBC iPlayer now, or on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Monday 5 June (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 23:10 in Wales) <br/>In January, one of the most comprehensive studies on ultra-processed food - by Imperial College's School of Public Health - was published in The Lancet medical journal.  <br/>The study of 200,000 UK adults found that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods may be linked to an increased risk of developing cancer overall, and specifically ovarian and brain cancers. <br/>And, as of last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now cautioning against the long-term use of artificial sweeteners - citing potential health risks. <br/>It follows dozens of studies linking increasing consumption of UPF to increased risk of developing serious illnesses.<br/>But proving that specific ingredients cause human harm can be challenging - there are a range of other factors in our lifestyles that can cause these diseases. For example: lack of exercise, smoking or sugary diets.<br/>Common ultra-processed foods:<br/>The first investigations into mortality and consumption of ultra-processed food started in France at the University Sorbonne Paris Nord, as part of the ongoing study into the eating habits of 174,000 people.<br/>\"We have 24-hour dietary records during which they tell us all the foods, the beverages and so on, that they are eating,\" explains Dr Mathilde Touvier who heads up the study.<br/>The ongoing research has already published results showing UPF may drive an increased burden of cancer.<br/>More recently, they have been looking into the impact of one specific ingredient - emulsifiers - which act as a glue in ultra-processed foods to hold everything together.<br/>Emulsifiers are the Holy Grail for the food industry - they improve the appearance and texture of food, and help to extend the shelf life far beyond that of less-processed food.<br/>They're everywhere, in mayonnaise, chocolate, peanut butter, meat products. If you eat, you're likely to be consuming emulsifiers as part of your diet. <br/>BBC's Panorama was given exclusive access to Dr Touvier's early results.<br/>They are yet to be peer reviewed - a crucial verification step for scientific studies - but she said they are still concerning. <br/>\"We observed significant associations between emulsifier intake and increased risk of cancer overall - and breast cancer notably - but also with cardiovascular diseases,\" she says.<br/>This means that a pattern has been observed between consuming ultra-processed food and disease risk, but further research is needed.<br/>Despite the growing body of evidence, the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) - which regulates the food industry in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - has yet to issue any regulation restricting emulsifiers.<br/>When Panorama asked the FSA about the growing body of evidence that these additives could cause harm it said: \"We have not been presented with any evidence - by this programme or otherwise - of any specific emulsifiers which are believed to pose a risk to health.\"<br/>But the FSA said it planned to hold a public consultation. <br/>Could the food industry itself be playing a role in pushing back on regulation?<br/>The BBC Panorama team spent the past eight months investigating.<br/>\"Food companies are not public health agencies... their job is to sell products,\" food politics expert Prof Nestle told the BBC. <br/>She said the food industry has been known to fund research, sponsor experts and disparage existing studies to prevent regulation.<br/>The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) is a body that receives funding from some of the world's largest food companies.<br/>It says its mission is to \"provide science that improves human health\" - but it has previously published studies globally undermining regulation and public guidance on healthy diets. In 2012, the European Food Safety Agency was so worried about potential conflicts of interest, it insisted anyone associated with ILSI either had to resign from the institute or leave the agency.  <br/>Prof Alan Boobis, emeritus professor at Imperial College London, is an unpaid director of ILSI Europe and a former vice president of its board of directors. But he also heads up a group of UK scientists, known as the Committee on Toxicity which provides advice on the risk of chemicals in food to the FSA.  <br/>More than half the members of the committee have recent links to the food or chemicals industries. And over the past 10 years, the committee hasn't supported a single restriction on the use of any chemical additive in our food. <br/>Prof Boobis told Panorama his advice wasn't slanted to favour industry, and he had always been \"totally committed to conducting and identifying the very best scientific research... whoever is funding it.\" <br/>The Food Standards Agency said it had a \"clear code of conduct\u2026 for declarations of interest\" and that it had \"no evidence\" bias has affected its decisions.<br/>ILSI said: \"[We] operate within a framework of the highest principles of scientific integrity.\" <br/>One of the most controversial additives in UPF is the sweetener aspartame. <br/>Two-hundred times sweeter than sugar, it has been heralded as a great low-calorie alternative - turning once unhealthy sugary drinks, ice cream and mousses into products marketed as \"healthy\".<br/>There have been questions about its potential harm over the past two decades.  <br/>Then, last month, the World Health Organization said, although the evidence is not conclusive, it was concerned that long-term use of sweeteners like aspartame may increase the risk of \"type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and mortality\".   <br/>In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) decided - after looking at all the available evidence - that aspartame was safe. The UK's Food Standards Agency accepted this position. <br/>The Committee on Toxicity looked at a study into aspartame in 2013 and concluded that the results \"did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public\". <br/>Six years later, Prof Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, decided to review the same evidence considered by EFSA - to see who had funded the different studies.<br/>He discovered that 90% of the studies defending the sweetener were funded by large chemical corporations that manufacture and sell aspartame. <br/>And that all the studies suggesting that aspartame may cause harm were funded by non-commercial, independent sources.  <br/>A spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation, a membership body for manufacturers, told the BBC that companies took \"the health of consumers, and safety of the food they produce, seriously - and adhere to the strict regulations\".<br/>A spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: \"Low/no calorie sweeteners are safe to use, are amongst the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and have been approved by all major food safety bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\"<br/>The FSA says it will look into WHO's ongoing assessment of aspartame. And the government says it is aware of the growing concerns around UPF and has ordered a review into the evidence on ultra-processed foods. <br/>Watch Panorama - Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health? - on BBC iPlayer and listen to 5Live listeners have their say with Nicky Campbell, Is ultra processed food okay?"}, {"_id": "648a005951ac3319f5477e8d", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65804939?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "England,N.

Ordinary solar panels have a capacity of about 400W, so if you count both rooftops and solar farms, there could be as many as 2.5 billion solar panels.,\" says Dr Rong Deng, an expert in solar panel recycling at the University of New South Wales in Australia.<br/>According to the British government, there are tens of millions of solar panels in the UK. But the specialist infrastructure to scrap and recycle them is lacking.<br/>Energy experts are calling for urgent government action to prevent a looming global environmental disaster.<br/>\"It's going to be a waste mountain by 2050, unless we get recycling chains going now,\" says Ute Collier, deputy director of the International Renewable Energy Agency. <br/>\"We're producing more and more solar panels - which is great - but how are we going to deal with the waste?\" she asks.<br/>It is hoped a major step will be taken at the end of June, when the world's first factory dedicated to fully recycling solar panels officially opens in France. <br/>ROSI, the specialist solar recycling company which owns the facility, in the Alpine city of Grenoble, hopes eventually to be able to extract and re-use 99% of a unit's components. <br/>As well as recycling the glass fronts and aluminium frames, the new factory can recover nearly all of the precious materials contained within the panels, such as silver and copper, which are typically some of the hardest materials to extract. <br/>These rare materials can subsequently be recycled and reused to make new, more powerful, solar units.<br/>Conventional methods of recycling solar panels recover most of the aluminium and glass - but ROSI says the glass, in particular, is of relatively low-quality. <br/>The glass recovered using those methods can be used to create tiles, or in sandblasting - it can also be mixed with other materials to make asphalt - but it cannot be used in applications where high-grade glass is required, such as the production of new solar panels.  <br/>The new ROSI plant will open during a boom period for solar panel installations. <br/>The world's solar energy generation capacity grew by 22% in 2021. Around 13,000 photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are fitted in the UK every month - most of them on the roofs of private houses. <br/>In many cases, solar units become relatively uneconomical before they reach the end of their expected lifespan. New, more efficient designs evolve at regular intervals, meaning it can prove cheaper to replace solar panels that are only 10 or 15 years old with updated versions. <br/>If current growth trends are sustained, Ms Collier says, the volume of scrap solar panels could be huge.<br/>\"By 2030, we think we're going to have four million tonnes [of scrap] - which is still manageable - but by 2050, we could end up with more than 200 million tonnes globally.\"<br/>To put that into perspective, the world currently produces a total of 400 million tonnes of plastic every year. <br/>The reason there are so few facilities for recycling solar panels is because there has not been much waste to process and reuse until recently. <br/>The first generation of domestic solar panels is only now coming to the end of its usable life. With those units now approaching retirement, experts say urgent action is needed.<br/>\"Now is the time to think about this,\" says Ms Collier. <br/>France is already a leader among European nations when it comes to processing photovoltaic waste, says Nicolas Defrenne. His organisation, Soren, partners with ROSI and other firms, co-ordinating the decommissioning of solar panels all over France.<br/>\"The biggest one [we decommissioned] took three months,\" Mr Defrenne recalls. <br/>His team at Soren has been experimenting with different ways of recycling what they collect: \"We're throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\"<br/>At ROSI's high-tech plant in Grenoble, the solar panels are painstakingly taken apart to recover the precious materials inside - such as copper, silicon and silver.<br/>Each solar panel contains only tiny fragments of these precious materials and those fragments are so intertwined with other components that, until now, it has not been economically viable to separate them. <br/>But because they are so valuable, extracting those precious materials efficiently could be a game-changer, says Mr Defrenne. <br/>\"Over 60% of the value is contained in 3% of the weight of the solar panels,\" he says.<br/>The team at Soren are hopeful that, in the future, nearly three-quarters of the materials needed to make new solar panels - including silver - can be recovered from retired PV units and recycled - to help speed up production of new panels. <br/>Currently there is not enough silver available to build the millions of solar panels which will be required in the the transition from fossil fuels, says Mr Defrenne: \"You can see where you have a production bottleneck, it's silver.\" <br/>Meanwhile British scientists have been trying to develop similar technology to ROSI. <br/>Last year, researchers at the University of Leicester announced they had worked out how to extract silver from PV units using a form of saline. <br/>But so far, ROSI is the only company in its field to have scaled up its operation to industrial levels.<br/>Moreover, the technology is expensive. In Europe, importers or producers of solar panels are responsible for disposing of them when they become expendable. And many  favour crushing or shredding the waste - which is far cheaper. <br/>Mr Defrenne acknowledges that intensive recycling of solar panels is still in its infancy. Soren and its partners recycled just under 4,000 tonnes of French solar panels last year. <br/>But there is potential to do a lot more. And he's making that his mission. <br/>\"The weight of all the new solar panels sold last year in France was 232,000 tonnes - so, by the time those wear out in 20 years, that's how much I'll need to collect every year.  <br/>\"When that happens, my personal goal is to ensure France will be the technological leader of the world.\"<br/>Listen to The Climate Question on BBC Sounds"}, {"_id": "648a005b51ac3319f5477e8f", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65648361?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "Can \u2018enhanced rock weathering\u2019 help combat climate change?", "lead": "'Enhanced rock weathering' uses tiny volcanic rocks to capture the greenhouse gas carbon from the atmosphere.", "author": "By Jonah Fisher", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:00:59.030042", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14E4/production/_129784350_mediaitem129784349.jpg", "body": "In a quarry surrounded by the din of heavy machinery Jim Mann crouches down and picks up a handful of tiny black rocks. <br/>\"This is my magic dust,\" he says with a smile, gently rubbing them between his fingers.<br/>He's holding pieces of basalt. It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.

Countries agreed to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C under the 2015 Paris agreement.<br/>Going over 1.5C every year for a decade or two would see far greater impacts of warming, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires. <br/>But passing the level in one of the next few years would not mean that the Paris limit had been broken. Scientists say there is still time to restrict global warming by cutting emissions sharply.<br/>Since 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation has been giving an estimate of the chances of the world breaking the 1.5C threshold in any one year. <br/>Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead. <br/>By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%, which the scientists say means it's \"more likely than not.\"<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long term global average. <br/>Scientists use average temperature data from the period between 1850-1900 as a measure of how hot the world was before our modern reliance on coal, oil and gas. <br/>For decades they believed that if the world warmed by around 2C that would be the threshold of dangerous impacts - but in 2018 they significantly revised this estimate, showing that going past 1.5C would be calamitous for the world. <br/>Over the past few decades our overheating world has nudged the mercury up so that in 2016, the warmest on record, global temperatures were 1.28C above the pre-industrial figure. <br/>Now researchers say that figure is set to be smashed - they are 98% certain the high mark will be broken before 2027.<br/>And in the years between now and then they believe there's a very solid chance the 1.5C limit will be surpassed for the first time. <br/>\"We really are now within reach of a temporary exceedance of 1.5C for the annual mean temperature, and that's the first time in human history we've been that close,\" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long range forecasts at the Met Office, who compile the data from weather and climate agencies around the world.<br/>\"I think that's perhaps the most stark and obvious and simplest statistic that we've got in the report,\" he told a news conference. <br/>The researchers stress that temperatures would have to stay at or above 1.5C for 20 years to be able to say the Paris agreement threshold had been passed. <br/>\"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas<br/>\"However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,\" he said.<br/>There are two key elements - the first is the continuing high levels of carbon emissions from human activities that despite a fall during the pandemic are still going up. <br/>The second, critical part is the likely appearance of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather phenomenon with global implications. <br/>For the last three years the world has been experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a event which has dampened climate warming to some extent. <br/>But the extra heat that El Ni\u00f1o will bring to the surface of the Pacific will likely push the global temperature to a new high next year.<br/>However there is still uncertainty around the onset and scale of the event.<br/>\"It's worth noting that a lot of our forecasts that are being made now for the El Ni\u00f1o that we think is developing this winter, are showing pretty big amplitude,\" Prof Scaife told reporters. <br/>\"But to actually predict the magnitude, or a subsequent event within the five-year period, we can't give the exact dates of that beyond this one year ahead, so it could be in three or four years from now we get to two and a half degree El Ni\u00f1o and that might be the one that does it. \"<br/>The Arctic will experience warming at a greater level than many regions, with the temperature anomaly expected to be three times as large as the global figure over the next five northern hemisphere winters. <br/>Northern Europe including the UK will likely experience increased rainfall for the May to September period over the next five years, the report says.<br/>Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."}, {"_id": "648a005c51ac3319f5477e91", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65339214?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "Earth Day: How to talk to your parents about climate change", "lead": "You want to do more about climate change, but how do you persuade the people who call the shots?", "author": "By Georgina Rannard", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:00.534264", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/48A1/production/_129439581_gettyimages-1402625152.jpg", "body": "You want to go vegan to help the planet, but you're not paying for the shopping. You think trains are better than planes, but your dad books the summer holiday.<br/>Young people are some of the world's most powerful climate leaders and want rapid action to tackle the problem.<br/>It makes a lot of sense. Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.<br/>Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:<br/>Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, say scientists. <br/>Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. <br/>Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.<br/>\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. <br/>\"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. <br/>Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains. <br/>Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.<br/>Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"<br/>How we travel is a major source of carbon emissions, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.<br/>Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. <br/>\"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.<br/>Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\" <br/>\"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.  <br/>She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.<br/>Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.<br/>Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.<br/>\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.<br/>Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.<br/>\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.<br/>\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains.

It's an important summary of six key pieces of research completed over the past five years. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers the critical messages.<br/>The sober tones of this study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make clear that there is very little chance of keeping the world from warming by more than 1.5C. Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid that. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s, despite all the political speechmaking.<br/>\"It has always been clear in the IPCC and in climate science, that it's not very likely that we always will stay below 1.5C,\" said Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team.<br/>Dr Geden and his colleagues now argue that coming back down as quickly as possible after overshooting this mark is where the focus should be. <br/>Overshooting is risky, as the report acknowledges, because it might trip tipping points that can't be uncrossed, such as the melting of permafrost that would in turn release vast amounts of warming gases.  <br/>Coming back from overshooting will need expensive, unproven technology to pull CO2 from the air, something known as carbon capture.<br/>It also means that it's even more urgent to get as quickly as possible to net zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere does not increase. Every increment of global warming and every year that goes by really matters. <br/>While the report doesn't definitively say it, there are some clear indications that there's no future for coal, oil and gas on a liveable planet.<br/>It highlights how renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar are now cheaper and that sticking with fossil fuels may be more expensive in many places than switching to low carbon systems.<br/>\"The message in terms of urgency, I think, is stop burning fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible,\" Dr Friederike Otto, one of the report's authors told BBC News.<br/>\"It is not because we are lacking some important piece of technology or some important knowledge. It is because so far, the sense of urgency has been lacking in the places where the important decisions are made.\"<br/>While it is easy to think that scientific reports on climate change are all about governments and energy policy, the IPCC has been moving to highlight the fact that the actions that people can take make by themselves make massive difference to the overall picture. <br/>\"We could cut 40 to 70% of projected 2050 emissions with end-use measures,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session.<br/>This includes shifting to plant-based diets, avoiding flights, building more walkable and bikeable cities,\" she told BBC News. <br/>The report nudges governments towards reforming their transport, industry and energy systems so that making these low carbon choices becomes much easier and cheaper for individuals.<br/>It's amazing to think that the decisions we make around the world over the next seven years will echo down the centuries.<br/>The report warns that with sustained warming of between 2 and 3C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost \"almost completely and irreversibly\" over multiple millenia.<br/>Many other thresholds will be crossed at low levels of heating, impacting things like the world's glaciers. <br/>To stop this runaway train of warming, governments need to up their commitments before 2030, to reach net zero by 2050, in order to keep warming in or around 1.5C by 2100. <br/>\"I think our climate system, but also our social systems and our ecosystems, all show us that it's bloody urgent, so that we can still change the world to make it a better place for all of us,\" said Dr Otto.<br/>The real strength of the IPCC is that their reports are agreed with governments - and as such the reports are approved by their representatives in the presence of the scientists who research and write them.<br/>But the future of fossil fuels is becoming more and more a political question. <br/>Last November in Sharm el-Sheikh, a number of countries tried but failed to get the UN to agree to phase out oil and gas as well as coal. <br/>This argument is not going away - with the EU now openly supporting such a move.<br/>This new IPCC report will be central to it when countries meet again at COP28 in Dubai later this year.

These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.<br/>\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.<br/>Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.<br/>The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.<br/>\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said. <br/>Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. <br/>Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\" <br/>The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.<br/>Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. <br/>It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. <br/>By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.<br/>Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. <br/>\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.<br/>\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.<br/>\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"<br/>The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. <br/>And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. <br/>\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.<br/>\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"<br/>The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". <br/>The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. <br/>They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. <br/>But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.<br/>Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.<br/>Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. <br/>\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well."}, {"_id": "648a005e51ac3319f5477e94", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-65035041?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "UN warns against 'vampiric' global water use", "lead": "A new report warning of \"endemic\" water scarcity is released ahead of a three-day water summit.", "author": "By Marita Moloney", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:02.431284", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C7B8/production/_129082115_gettyimages-670191292.jpg", "body": "A United Nations report has warned of a looming global water crisis and an \"imminent risk\" of shortages due to overconsumption and climate change.<br/>The world is \"blindly travelling a dangerous path\" of \"vampiric overconsumption and overdevelopment\", the report says.<br/>Its publication comes before the first major UN water summit since 1977.<br/>Thousands of delegates will attend the three-day gathering in New York which begins on Wednesday.<br/>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says water, \"humanity's lifeblood\", is being drained by \"unsustainable water use, pollution and unchecked global warming\".<br/>The report, published by UN Water and Unesco, warns that \"scarcity is becoming endemic\" because of overconsumption and pollution, while global warming will increase seasonal water shortages in both areas with abundant water and those already strained.<br/>Richard Connor, the lead author of the report, said that about 10% of the global population \"currently lives in areas that are high or critical water stress\". <br/>\"In our report, we say that up to 3.5 billion people live under conditions of water stress at least one month a year,\" he told the BBC.<br/>According to the most recent UN climate report, published Monday by the IPCC expert panel, \"roughly half of the world's population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least part of the year\".<br/>Mr Connor told reporters that \"uncertainties are increasing\" when it comes to global water supply. <br/>\"If we don't address it, there definitely will be a global crisis,\" he said.<br/>UNDP Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari told the BBC that resources would need to be managed more carefully in the future. <br/>\"There is enough water on the planet if we manage it more effectively than we have managed it over the last few decades,\" she said. <br/>\"I think we will have to find new governance models, new finance models, new models of using water and reusing water than ever before.

One referred to a boss who used to \"shout and belittle staff\", while another called ITV a \"terrible place to work\".<br/>The committee's chair Dame Caroline Dinenage concluded by telling the executives there was \"clearly some work for ITV to do here to rebuild trust with with us, but more importantly with its staff and with its viewers that it's a safe and welcoming workplace.\"<br/>She added: \"We want to be confident that ITV is not letting star power and favouritism damage the lives and careers of people working there - and, more importantly than that, we want to be confident that when mistakes have been made, ITV will be making changes rather than making jokes about aubergines.\"<br/>That was a reference to a recent remark made by This Morning editor Martin Frizell when he was asked by a Sky News reporter whether his programme had a toxic workplace. \"I'll tell you what's toxic and I've always found it toxic. Aubergine,\" he replied.<br/>Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter<br/>ITV bosses did as much as they could in their attempt to reassure MPs, viewers and advertisers that they had no knowledge of the affair when it was happening, and that their duty of care policies are robust.<br/>We also got some key information from Wednesday's session - perhaps most significantly, confirmation from ITV bosses that they did not reach a financial settlement with the young man in exchange for his silence.<br/>This story may have cooled in the past week or so, but it is not over. The independent investigation being carried out by Jane Mulcahy KC is ongoing and many will be reading its findings closely when they are published.<br/>There are also a few outstanding questions for This Morning. Schofield's replacement as Holly Willoughby's permanent co-host has still not yet been announced. Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary are the frontrunners.<br/>For now, ITV bosses will hope their answers during the two-hour grilling from MPs have done enough to reduce the intense pressure the broadcast network has faced in recent weeks."}, {"_id": "648a005f51ac3319f5477e96", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-65908540?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Entertainment & Arts", "subCategories": "", "title": "Miriam Margolyes makes Vogue cover debut at 82", "lead": "The iconic actress tells the magazine she \"wouldn't want to be straight for anything\".", "author": "By Mattea Bubalo", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:03.668225", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13C7B/production/_130091018_screenshot2023-06-14155337.jpg", "body": "Miriam Margolyes says she \"wouldn't want to be straight for anything\", as she makes her Vogue cover debut at 82. <br/>The actress posed for vibrant photos and discussed the joy she felt in her sexuality, saying she's \"never had any shame\" around it.<br/>\"Gay people are very lucky, because we are not conventional,\" she said.<br/>Known for her iconic TV and film roles, and candour in interviews, she came out as a lesbian in 1966 when homosexuality was illegal.<br/>She also lived through the HIV crisis of the 1980s, during which she lost 34 friends.<br/>\"I never had any shame about being gay or anything really.

I was anxious, I was on edge, my confidence was at an all-time low.\"<br/>Ms Wightman became a subject of tabloid stories again in 2000 when she broke up with Mr Whitehouse, who had an affair with a costume designer he had been working with. <br/>She alleged that her mobile voicemail messages to and from Mr Whitehouse were listened to by journalists and private investigators. <br/>They remained friends with shared children despite the break-up and continued to leave each other voicemail messages, to which she alleges journalists and private investigators listened.<br/>In her witness statement, she said: \"I was young, I had ovarian cancer, and the prognosis for ovarian cancer then was awful. I was dealing with infertility. <br/>\"My husband had an affair. It sounds like a tragedy. I am not a tragedy, but I was dealing with such incredibly difficult, painful things.\"<br/>\"For someone to have listened to my messages and thought 'there is a great story here' is just awful.\" <br/>The Mirror papers never published a story about Ms Wightman's cancer, but they did write about Paul Whitehouse's affair.<br/>Concluding her evidence, Ms Wightman said she had been \"really anxious\" about giving evidence. <br/>She said: \"I've had to discuss some of the most personal things I have had to go through. Most difficult times in my life. The most challenging times. Ironically, it can now be reported. At the time, I chose not to discuss any of it.\"<br/>In his statement, Mr Whitehouse, who currently stars in BBC Two series Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing, said: \"It is called a private life for a reason.\"<br/>\"MGN's journalists overstepped the mark. And it was not just my life they were investigating, it was Fiona's, our daughters' and her parents' lives.<br/>\"It makes us both feel very angry and there was zero reason for them to get involved,\" he added. <br/>Ms Wightman's claims have been chosen as one of three test cases in this legal action, with many other well-known people also preparing to sue MGM.<br/>Prince Harry has refused to settle his claim against the newspapers, and gave evidence last week. <br/>MGN apologised in 2015 for using \"unlawful information gathering\" techniques but denies the majority of Ms Wightman's claims. <br/>It said her allegation that private investigators were accessing credit agencies to get her personal information were false, arguing that journalists were paying for searches on the Electoral Roll. <br/>The publisher also says her case should be rejected because she failed to take legal action at the time. Victims of privacy breaches usually have a six-year time limit to sue."}, {"_id": "648a006051ac3319f5477e98", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65908054?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Beyonce blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden", "lead": "The frenzy stoked by the start of the singer's world tour is seen driving up prices in Sweden.", "author": "By Natalie Sherman", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:04.162247", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7863/production/_130091803_e1584e8a1d6b251abd128eedb1239c95388ab52a.jpg", "body": "Thought the war in Ukraine or supply chain snarls were to blame for rising prices?

It says less than 3% of its news feed these days is traditional news stories. The tweaking of the algorithm over recent years has been catastrophic for some organisations that relied on its traffic.<br/>In the UK, 41% of 18 to 24-year-olds say social media is their main source of news (43% across all countries), up from 18% in 2015. <br/>TikTok and Instagram have both seen increases in use. Instagram is now a source of news for 14% of people, with TikTok on 6%.<br/>But the figures are much higher for young users. One in five (20%) 18 to 24-year-olds get news from TikTok, up from 15% last year. The report says the platform \"is the fastest growing social network in our survey\".<br/>However, it is not necessarily news from traditional news providers. TikTok users are more likely to get news on the platform from celebrities, influencers or ordinary creators than mainstream news outlets or journalists. <br/>Reuters Institute director Rasmus Neilsen said: \"Younger generations increasingly eschew direct discovery for all but the most appealing brands.<br/>\"They have little interest in many conventional news offers oriented towards older generations' habits, interests, and values, and instead embrace the more personality-based, participatory, and personalised options offered by social media, often looking beyond legacy platforms to new entrants.\"<br/>Liking, sharing and commenting about news on open social media platforms is also in decline.<br/>Only around 10% of people in the UK are classed as \"active participants\" - they are largely male, old, have strong political views and are more highly educated than the rest of the population. <br/>One reason suggested for the change is a growing sense that online conversations on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have become increasingly toxic.<br/>However, while the sharing of articles and engagement time may have dropped, it doesn't mean such sites are being deserted.<br/>Twitter made headlines after it was bought by Elon Musk, but the number of people using the site each week appears to have has barely changed. There is, Reuters said, no evidence of a mass movement to rivals such as Mastodon.

It was one of several songs on a cassette labelled \"For Paul\" that Lennon had made shortly before his death in 1980. <br/>Lo-fi and embryonic, the tracks were largely recorded onto a boombox as the musician sat at a piano in his New York apartment.<br/>Cleaned up by producer Jeff Lynne, two of those songs - Free As A Bird and Real Love - were completed and released in 1995 and 96, marking the Beatles' first \"new\" material in 25 years.<br/>The band also attempted to record Now And Then, an apologetic love song that was fairly typical of Lennon's later career, but the session was quickly abandoned.<br/>\"It was one day - one afternoon, really - messing with it,\" Lynne recalled.<br/>\"The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish.\"<br/>Sir Paul later claimed George Harrison refused to work on the song, saying the sound quality of Lennon's vocal was \"rubbish\".<br/>\"It didn't have a very good title, it needed a bit of reworking, but it had a beautiful verse and it had John singing it,\" he told Q Magazine.<br/>\"[But] George didn't like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn't do it.\"<br/>There were also said to have been technical issues with the original recording, which featured a persistent \"buzz\" from the electricity circuits in Lennon's apartment.<br/>In 2009, a new version of the demo, without the background noise, was released on a bootleg CD. Fans have speculated that this recording may not have been available in 1995, suggesting it was stolen from his apartment, along with other personal effects, after his death.<br/>In the intervening years, Sir Paul has repeatedly talked about his desire to finish the song.<br/>\"That one's still lingering around,\" he told a BBC Four documentary on Jeff Lynne in 2012. \"So I'm going to nick in with Jeff and do it. Finish it, one of these days.\"<br/>It would seem that technology has now afforded the musician a chance to achieve that goal.<br/>The turning point came with Peter Jackson's Get Back documentary, where dialogue editor Emile de la Rey trained computers to recognise the Beatles' voices and separate them from background noises, and even their own instruments, to create \"clean\" audio.<br/>The same process allowed Sir Paul to \"duet\" with Lennon on his recent tour, and for new surround sound mixes of the Beatles' Revolver album to be created last year.<br/>\"He [Jackson] was able to extricate John's voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,\" Sir Paul told Radio 4's Martha Kearney. <br/>\"We had John's voice and a piano and he could separate them with AI. They tell the machine, 'That's the voice. This is a guitar. Lose the guitar'. <br/>\"So when we came to to make what will be the last Beatles' record, it was a demo that John had [and] we were able to take John's voice and get it pure through this AI. <br/>\"Then we can mix the record, as you would normally do. So it gives you some sort of leeway.\"<br/>However, the musician admitted that other applications of AI gave him cause for concern. <br/>\"I'm not on the internet that much [but] people will say to me, 'Oh, yeah, there's a track where John's singing one of my songs', and it's just AI, you know? <br/>\"It's kind of scary but exciting, because it's the future.

I need a fresh start. So I moved away,\" he said. <br/>\"The week I moved down to England I got signed to Patrick Topping's [Trick] label and my career just kind of went from there.<br/>\"But I've never forgotten where I come from. I go on about Ayr as much as I can.\"<br/>McVicar's music finally hit the big time in 2021 when his version of Rufus and Chaka Khan's 1974 US hit Tell Me Something Good spent 13 weeks in the Top 40. <br/>\"I was working in a cold storage warehouse over lockdown while I was in the charts,\" he said. <br/>\"That was just a mad experience because folk on the shop floor were listening to my tune while I was working there.\"<br/>Despite moving away, he still had a deep affection for his hometown, even naming an EP Heather Park after the Kincaidston street where he grew up. <br/>Th DJ's father was murdered before he was born, but he has a strong bond with his mother and younger brothers - and is driven to succeed.<br/>The genesis of his career was formed as a teenager, watching rave documentaries with his friends. He now tries to emulate the \"soulful and raw\" 90s sound of that scene. <br/>In April his two great passions - dance music and Ayr - finally collided when he staged the Pavilion Festival in his home town. <br/>With the help of STREETrave, which was responsible for some legendary club nights in Ayr in the 80s and 90s, they brought 7,500 ravers to Ayr for the inaugural festival.<br/>He said it was \"biblical\" to work with the experienced promoters, who were returning to the Ayrshire coast for the first time in 30 years.<br/>\"I had no idea how to run a festival. I just had an idea in my head,\" he said. <br/>\"I can always picture stuff like that but you never know how it's going to turn out until you have the people there and it's all set up. I just never thought it was going to happen.\"<br/>McVicar headlined the two-day event alongside acts like Skream, Kettama, Karen Dunbar and Optimo Espacio.<br/>\"It's all about celebrating being Scottish and having a good time,\" the DJ said. <br/>His house rules were: \"Don't be a dafty\". <br/>\"It worked,\" he said. \"Everyone was so lovely and it was a credit to the punters that came to Pavilion.<br/>\"I've put faith in my hometown and they've given that back to me tenfold.\"<br/>He said he wanted to give a boost to a town which had seen a downturn in fortunes since he left. <br/>\"I want folk to have belief and see a different part of Scotland which doesn't normally get talked about,\" he said. <br/>The event was a huge success - and now the leader of South Ayrshire Council has backed plans for the festival to be held annually over the next five years. <br/>But McVicar is being secretive about his future plans for Pavilion. <br/>\"All we're focusing on is making the experience as good as it can be on the site and hopefully we'll increase the capacity a little bit - just a little bit every year.\"<br/>Although he can now add \"successful festival organiser\" to his CV, he is not letting it distract from his music. <br/>He's working on a new album and a collaboration with one of the world's most famous DJs and record producers. <br/>\"I'm writing an album right now and me and Calvin Harris have got a track on it right now... that's an exclusive, by the way, I've not told anyone that,\" he said. <br/>They're both Scottish - Harris is from Dumfries - but they're from \"different realms\", according to McVicar. <br/>\"We both play different music but the amount of respect I have for him, for everything he's done and the fact he's Scottish as well is just insane.<br/>\"And then when he saw me he was like: 'Its good to finally meet you.' He's lovely\u2026 what a lovely guy he is.<br/>\"I'm looking to release the album next year and I think it's going to be a huge turning point in me going from Ewan McVicar, the wee happy DJ, to actually folk taking me a bit more seriously. <br/>\"It's not just fun anymore.

When her father died unexpectedly at the age of 48, the huge shock was the trigger for her to go.<br/>Back in apartheid South Africa she befriended the musical group The Pacific Express and toured with them. The group contained both black and Indian members. She was breaking apartheid laws by mixing with them, and found herself in jail on one occasion as a result.<br/>She had known the risks, but the music drew her in.<br/>The experience left her \"heartbroken and disgusted\" at what South Africa was like under apartheid so she did not go back.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Instead, she channelled her passion for music into interior design, starting her company in her teens without qualifications, and growing it organically, one client at a time.<br/>Hoppen's understated look for interiors has appealed to clients who specialise in luxury environments, whether it is boutique hotels, cruise ships or airlines looking to please first-class customers. <br/>She says it's a reputation she has played along with, though she's not averse to a splash of colour.

A new streaming series shows what became of the characters.<br/>The Full Monty film opened with a shot of a derelict Sheffield factory, and ended with a group of former employees hauling themselves off the scrapheap to stage a strip show in a working men's club.<br/>Twenty-six years on, the new Disney+ series opens with a shot of the same working men's club. It's now derelict too.<br/>A quarter of a century may have passed, but not much has changed.<br/>And despite the 1997 film's uplifting ending, it turns out that most of the six friends have only narrowly avoided dereliction themselves. <br/>They are led by lovable rogue Gaz, played by Robert Carlyle. The actor says that after years of industrial decline, when the film came out there was a sense of optimism in the UK, thanks to New Labour, Cool Britannia and Britpop. \"It seemed to be that things can only get better.\"<br/>That didn't last long, though, Carlyle continues. \"The past 25 years have been really tough for people. Twenty-five years, it seems, of austerity that's really chipped away at these characters and their lives.<br/>\"It's chipped away the infrastructure in the country as well. And I think the show reflects that.\"<br/>Gaz is now a porter on a psychiatric ward, while best mate Dave (played by Mark Addy) is a caretaker at the school where his wife Jean (Lesley Sharp) is headteacher. Both fertile settings for storylines about a crumbling state.<br/>Meanwhile, Gerald (Tom Wilkinson) and Horse (Paul Barber) have been left behind by modern life, and Lomper (Steve Huison) runs a caf\u00e9 called Big Baps with his husband - although that name soon gets cancelled.<br/>Only Guy (Hugo Speer) seems to have prospered, now the privately-financed pantomime villain.<br/>However, he disappears half-way through the series because the actor was himself cancelled after Disney investigated \"allegations of inappropriate conduct\" on set. The actor denied that and said he \"didn't believe I'd done anything wrong\".<br/>The gang are joined by William Snape - who played Gaz's son Nathan in the film - and Talitha Wing, who has been cast as Gaz's daughter Destiny.<br/>At 26, Wing is the same age as the film. She familiarised herself by watching it with her grandparents. \"I thought we'd find different bits funny,\" she says.<br/>\"But we all actually were laughing at the same bits. So the humour and people coming together in times of hardship, I guess, is something that transcends time and generations, and is a story that everyone can understand.<br/>\"Even though I might not have been around at the time that it was going on, I feel like you can take the message and apply it to whatever is going on [today]. And unfortunately in some instances, not that much has changed.\"<br/>The eight-part series has been co-written by Simon Beaufoy - who was nominated for an Oscar for the original - and Alice Nutter.<br/>They have been able to put a wide range of issues \"in a package and still make it funny\". Carlyle says. \"That's the genius of Simon's writing. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.\"<br/>With the main characters now in their mid-50s to mid-70s, the South Yorkshire-set comedy-drama resembles what might emerge if Ken Loach directed Last of the Summer Wine.<br/>In a three-star review, The Telegraph's Michael Hogan said the new version \"firmly wears its politics on its sleeve - with mixed success\".<br/>\"The issues will be all too recognisable, especially to those in neglected communities,\" he wrote.<br/>\"If the optimism of the original... has gone, that's the point - this is a sobering reminder of how far we haven't come.\"<br/>Collider's Chase Hutchinson described it as \"a slightly baggy series elevated by the charm of flawed characters just trying to find their way in the world\".<br/>He concluded that \"the overall experience is a mirthful yet melancholic one worth riding along with\".<br/>While having eight episodes does make the series \"slightly baggy\" (there are major plots about a Britain's Got Talent-winning dog, a lost racing pigeon and a Job Centre siege), it does provide more time for characters like Jean.<br/>\"In the 90 minutes that was the film, naturally and rightly the story had to be about that group of men, who were all trying to live with being made redundant,\" Sharp says.<br/>\"What's fantastic about revisiting it is that instead of having 90 minutes, you've got eight hours to explore in detail what has happened subsequently to all of those characters. And yes, that includes a lot of really vibrant, whip smart women - young and older. <br/>\"So I think it's great that the original film, which was male centric, is now being ameliorated by the presence of some really interesting older and younger women.\"<br/>While revisiting a beloved film is a surefire way to attract eyeballs, it also comes with expectations.<br/>\"Revisiting anything can be fraught with complication,\" Sharp accepts. \"But because the film had been so loved and because Simon obviously wanted to continue telling the story of those characters, it felt like it was an enormous opportunity.\"<br/>One plot line that gets relatively little screen time is stripping. \"Well, nobody really needs to see that,\" smiles Addy. \"It's about so much more.<br/>\"That was our starting block and it's interesting to see where these characters have gone from there.\"<br/>Much of the film's appeal, though, came from the idea of stripping, if not the act itself - as a clever way to give the men a liberating and cheeky opportunity to shed society's limitations and regain control of their lives.<br/>Its feel-good power was such that the film has spawned a number of celebrity charity spin-offs - see The Real Full Monty on Ice - as well as inspiring amateur fundraisers.<br/>\"There are still men who get together and do the Full Monty for charity,\" Carlyle notes. \"And I think that's an amazing thing. If The Full Monty has done nothing [else] and it was only that, then it is worth it.\"<br/>The actor originally feared the film would bomb because it was such a tough shoot. \"You'd go home at night thinking, what is this? Is this funny? Is this anything?\" he says.<br/>\"I thought, this is never going to work. Of course, the finished article proved me wrong.\"<br/>This time, filming was \"relatively easy\", he says. \"It really was beautiful to see the guys again, because you look in each other's faces and you see life, you know, in the lines in their face. And that was lovely.<br/>\"And the thing is, The Full Monty has been like a huge big warm shadow that's followed me my whole career. There's only about four or five other people in the world that understand that. And it's those guys. It was fantastic to be back doing all that again.\"<br/>The Full Monty is on Disney+ from Wednesday 14 June."}, {"_id": "648a006451ac3319f5477ea5", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-65881992?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Newsbeat", "subCategories": "", "title": "Britain's Got Talent star Jack Carroll on new BBC Three show Mobility", "lead": "Comedian Jack Carroll tells Newsbeat about why he hopes his BBC Three short will make a difference.", "author": "By Aine O'Donnell", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:08.021534", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/51D3/production/_130074902_392279976.jpg", "body": "If you watched Britain's Got Talent 10 years ago, you might remember Jack Carroll.<br/>Thanks to his quick wit, the comedian was runner-up on the show when he was 14.<br/>That was in 2013.

Tory shot Meg.\"<br/>Megan told the courtroom Lanez had offered her $1m to keep quiet about what happened, and called her afterwards to apologise, claiming he was \"just too drunk\".<br/>Through tears, she said she had regrets about coming forward, saying speaking out had been \"torture\".<br/>Lanez was convicted in December of three charges: assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.<br/>Prosecutors are seeking a 13-year prison sentence and the 30-year-old faces deportation to his native Canada.<br/>But he still hasn't been sentenced.<br/>On 13 June, a judge accepted his lawyer's request to delay the sentencing until 7 August to give them more time to prepare their recommendations.<br/>During the brief court hearing, Lanez - wearing an orange jail outfit and black cap - mostly kept his head down and barely made eye contact with anyone.<br/>Outside the court, Lanez' supporters stood opposite crowds of fans carrying \"We stand with Megan\" signs.<br/>And as Megan arrived at the building, his side heckled her by shouting: \"Why are you lying on that boy?\"<br/>Accusations of lying have dogged the Grammy-winning rapper throughout the case, because her story changed early on.<br/>She initially told police she'd been hurt by stepping on broken glass.<br/>It wasn't until later, on Instagram, when she first said that Tory had shot her. <br/>She then told an interviewer she'd needed surgery to remove bullets from her feet which had missed her bones and tendons.<br/>Megan, 27, said she lied to officers at the time because she didn't want to \"get in more trouble\". <br/>It sparked a long war of words between her and Lanez - they both released tracks about the case.<br/>In his song Money Over Fallout, Lanez accused Megan of trying to frame him, while Megan said she was the one \"speakin' facts\" in her track Shots Fired.<br/>The dispute spilled out into the wider hip-hop world, with artists like 50 Cent and even Drake getting involved.<br/>Megan frequently defended herself on Twitter and said she'd been painted as aggressive and a \"snitch\".<br/>She suggested misogynoir - misogyny against black women - could be why she was targeted.<br/>Megan criticised Drake when he released Circo Loco, a collab with 21 Savage that appeared to reference the shooting case.<br/>But she did receive support from fellow artists, like JoJo and Kehlani. <br/>And a group of prominent black women, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, released an open letter backing Megan.<br/>In Da Club rapper Fiddy eventually apologised for sharing memes casting doubt on Megan's version of events.<br/>He said he'd changed his mind after hearing evidence from the trial.<br/>Lanez has always denied the charges against him, he's filed various appeals and his lawyers could launch other motions after his sentence.<br/>Since the guilty verdict, Megan has tried to reclaim the narrative around the shooting, and spoken about the effect \"false narratives\" and \"conspiracy theories\" had on her.<br/>In an Elle Magazine feature, she said the guilty verdict \"was a victory for every woman who has ever been shamed, dismissed, and blamed for a violent crime committed against them\".<br/>\"We can't control what others think, especially when the lies are juicier than the truth,\" she said.<br/>\"But as a society, we must create safer environments for women to come forward about violent behaviour without fear of retaliation.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

We take it for granted, don't we?\"<br/>Critics uniformly described the concert as a joyful celebration of Mitchell's life and work. Many marvelled at how her voice had recovered and matured since her aneurysm.<br/>\"There was a renewed ease in her movement across melodies, and a pearly purity in her tone,\" wrote Lindsay Zoladz in the New York Times. <br/>\"To hear Mitchell hit certain notes again in that inimitable voice was like glimpsing, in the wild, a magnificent bird long feared to have gone extinct.\"<br/>\"Mitchell fans know that her voice has changed - has lowered and gotten grainier - since the high-and-pure days of Blue, but it's a gift to hear how much (more) emotional wisdom her singing has accrued as she nears 80,\" agreed Mikael Wood in the LA Times. <br/>\"Her vocals sounded pure on a slow-and-low version of Both Sides Now, which seemed to bleed wisdom when she wrote it more than half a century ago but now feels like some kind of ancient rune.\"<br/>\"Mitchell's performance feels ego-free,\" added The Guardian's Matthew Cantor. \"She laughs and cracks jokes between songs and further extols the virtues of her fellow performers, never seeming to take the evening too seriously. <br/>\"That sets the tone for a joyful show, though the momentousness of the occasion leaves more than a few audience members - and even some on stage - tearful.\"<br/>Some of those tears, however, were tears of laughter.<br/>Mitchell recalled the last time she had played the Gorge, on tour with Van Morrison and Bob Dylan in the late 1990s.<br/>She said Morrison had been upset that he'd never been invited to spend time with Dylan, even though she had. \"Bob's rude,\" she placated him, \"He loves to be an enigma.\"<br/>The musicians then decided to run on stage during Dylan's set and force themselves into one of his songs. But when Mitchell stepped up to the microphone, she forgot the words.<br/>\"I said to the guitar player, 'You got it,' and he sang the fourth verse,\" she told the crowd, to peals of laughter. \"I tried frantically to remember what the fifth verse was. I couldn't remember that one either, so I made one up.\"<br/>\"Bob turned around and did a double take and gave me a look. He was grinning from ear to ear.\"<br/>Afterwards. Morrison scolded her for being \"disrespectful\", but she argued that he'd misunderstood. <br/>\"Bob loves to see me [mess] up,\" she said, using an unprintable expletive.<br/>The only sign of Mitchell's extended absence from the stage came during Shine, when the audience held up their phones with the torches turned on.<br/>\"Where'd they get those lights?\" Mitchell asked Carlile.<br/>\"Cellphones,\" she responded.<br/>\"Cellphones? Really?\" Mitchell said, seemingly inspired. \"That was a real spectacle... You look like a fallen constellation... Thank you for that.\"<br/>As the set drew to a close Mitchell picked up a guitar to play Just Like This Train and If - a remarkable moment, given that she had to teach herself to play again by watching old YouTube videos.<br/>But she ended the night with a cover of Frank Sinatra's Young At Heart - whose closing lyrics couldn't have been more appropriate. <br/>\"And if you survive to 105 / Look at all you'll derive / Out of being alive / And here is the best part / You have a head start/ If you are among the very / Young at heart.\"<br/>As Mitchell had said earlier in the concert: \"Vive La Old Age.\"<br/>You may also be interested in:"}, {"_id": "648a006451ac3319f5477ea8", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-65878227?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Newsbeat", "subCategories": "", "title": "Xbox showcase 2023: Is Microsoft back in the game?", "lead": "Microsoft had a lot to prove in some people's eyes -

Cases have fallen by more than 99% since the late 1980s and about 20 million people who would have been paralysed can walk thanks to vaccines. <br/>The original or \"wild\" poliovirus is now contained to small pockets of Afghanistan and Pakistan and the oral vaccines play a pivotal role in the attempt to rid the world of polio. <br/>\"The issue is they're genetically unstable,\" Dr Andrew Macadam, from the UK's National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, told BBC News.<br/>It takes only one mutation to turn the safe polio vaccine back into a virus that can move out of a child's stomach, invade their nervous system and cause paralysis. <br/>And if those viruses spread from an immunised child - through their contaminated faeces - there is a risk of infecting the unvaccinated and triggering an outbreak. <br/>There are now more cases of \"vaccine-derived polio\" than of the wild poliovirus and the polio detected in London's sewers last year was connected to the oral vaccine. <br/>So the researchers have genetically altered the weakened virus even further to make it much harder for it to start causing paralysis again. <br/>\"By genetically modifying this part of the virus, we could modify this region so it couldn't revert and this I think has been remarkably successful,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Prof Raul Andino, from University of California San Francisco, said he was \"super-proud\" of the scientific effort showing the vaccine was \"50 to 100 times more stable\".<br/>In March 2021, the World Health Organization made the researchers' vaccine against type-two polio available for emergency use. Since then, it has been used more than 650 million times. <br/>Now, in the journal Nature, the researchers have detailed the creation of stable vaccines against polio types one and three. <br/>The first-stage human trials of the upgraded vaccines have already been conducted - and, the researchers say, the data, which is still being analysed, is \"very promising\". <br/>The trio represent the first new polio vaccines in 50 years. <br/>\"I don't think there's any question that they're helpful, the new vaccines address the instability question, but it doesn't address the coverage issue,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Tackling the last 1% of polio cases has proven stubborn. The original goal was to completely eradicate polio by the year 2000 - but delivering vaccines to some of the poorest and most conflict-ridden parts of the world has been a challenge. <br/>Prof Alan Barrett, from the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences, at the University of Texas, called the \"super-engineered\" vaccines a feat of \"impressive science\".<br/>\"[But] will it lead the endgame to the finish line? That is a big question,\" he added.<br/>Joseph Swan, from the World Health Organization and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, said more stable vaccines were a \"significant part\" of the plan for a polio-free world.<br/>But, he said: \"Simply having these new and better tools will not get us over the finish line - vaccination, not just vaccines, is what will end polio.\"<br/>There was now a \"unique opportunity\" to eradicate wild poliovirus - but vaccine-derived polio outbreaks were causing problems in places facing \"complex humanitarian emergencies\", in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Yemen. <br/>Follow Jameson Twitter.

The hot weather was already causing high demand for urgent services - and people should avoid the sun at the hottest time of day and drink plenty of fluids.<br/>Alongside heat-stroke, hot weather also brings an increase in heart failure and kidney problems as well as high rates of sprains and fractures and respiratory problems.<br/>Consultants are being drafted in to provide cover during the strike but the amount could be lower than during previous junior doctors' strikes, in March and April.<br/>Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health bosses, said a particular challenge this time was \"securing the level of consultant cover\" - because of the amount consultants were asking for overtime payments - creating uncertainty over how many appointments would need to be postponed.<br/>The four-day April walkout saw about 196,000 hospital appointments and treatments postponed. And the hospital waiting list, growing since the start of the pandemic, has now hit a record 7.4 million people.<br/>\"Each wave of strikes chips away at the NHS's resilience, impacting on staff, internal relationships and their ability to deliver on government pledges to reduce the elective backlog,\" Mr Deighton said.<br/>NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the strike would have an \"enormous impact\".<br/>\"The NHS is facing significant disruption this week, with a three-day strike that is set to be exacerbated by the ongoing hot weather,\" he said.<br/>\"Emergency, urgent and critical care will be prioritised this week but some patients will unfortunately have had their appointments postponed - if you haven't been contacted to reschedule, please do continue to attend your planned appointment.<br/>\"As ever, use 999 and A&E for life-threatening emergencies - and NHS 111 online for all other health conditions.\"<br/>While hospitals are expected to bear the brunt of the disruption, community services, including GPs, will be much less affected.<br/>Dr Tom Corkery-Bennett is in his second year as a junior doctors and works in the A&E at Royal Berkshire Hospital.<br/>He works an average of 48 hours a week, but can put in up to 60 and regularly receives messages asking if he can take on extra shifts.<br/>What has happened to pay was a major factor in the staffing shortages, the 26-year-old said, and \"grossly unfair\".<br/>\"The resilience in the system is so low - staffing levels are skeletal,\" Dr Corkery-Bennett said.<br/>\"There is very often situations where doctors call in sick for a nightshift and there's no cover available.<br/>\"It means there's a large number of patients without a doctor to cover them and care is really put in jeopardy.  <br/>\"One doctor will cover the work of two or three doctors if there's no contingency plan in place, which very often happens, and that's unsafe.\"<br/>Junior doctors want a 35% pay hike to make up for 15 years of below-inflation rises.<br/>In talks last month, the government offered an extra 5%, which Health Secretary Steve Barclay called \"fair and reasonable\", adding the \"extremely disappointing\" walkout would put patients at risk.<br/>Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said he wished the strikes were not going ahead, but added the reason for them was \"because they haven't got someone to negotiate\". <br/>He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the strikes should be viewed alongside the broader range of issues affecting doctors, such as retention and career progression, but would not be drawn on what salary Labour would offer doctors if in government.<br/>\"I really do fear what the state of the economy will be by the time of the next general election - I can't yet be sure what the state of the public finances will be and at the moment I'm fearing the worst.\"<br/>Prof Powis told the same programme that other discussions held between government and other NHS employees showed it was possible to resolve disputes, but the \"key is talking\". <br/>BMA junior doctor leader Dr Vivek Trivedi said the offer from government \"beggars belief\" given inflation had reached double-digits this year. <br/>\"Junior doctors are in despair at this government's refusal to listen,\" Dr Trivedi said.<br/>\"We have made clear that junior doctors are looking for the full restoration of our pay. <br/>\"The NHS can only function with a workforce that is properly valued.\"<br/>BMA Deputy Chair Emma Runswick told the BBC that doctors' roles had become more important since 2008 and that they were \"not willing to accept that further pay cuts is all the government can give us\". <br/>This walkout affects services in England only - but junior doctors in Scotland have this week announced they too will be going on strike, after a vote by BMA members.<br/>A strike ballot for consultants in England is also being held. And Royal College of Nursing members are voting on whether to continue their industrial action, after joining the minority of health unions to have rejected the government's offer of 5% plus a one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655.<br/>Have you had your treatment cancelled?

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK.

On the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, they are home to about 1,300 islanders. <br/>But remoteness also means challenges providing healthcare to a population that is a one-hour flight or a six-hour drive from the nearest A&E.<br/>There has been no permanent doctor on the two Hebridean islands since last summer and while two posts have now been advertised, the community fears it will be a struggle to attract the right type of medical professionals who are a lifeline to the islands.<br/>In 2020, early in the Covid pandemic, Sandy Maclean was working on his tractor when its wheel blew and threw him across the shed. <br/>The explosion was so ferocious, his wife Kirsty, ran out from the house and when she saw her husband, immediately thought he was dead.<br/>Sandy's daughter Ishbel, who lives next door, arrived and realised he was severely injured. She started first aid, bandaging his head in sheets and towels to stem a major bleed.<br/>She told BBC Scotland: \"It was all very quick, and yet not quick at the same time. The paramedics arrived and they could tell it was bad so he got bundled into the ambulance and taken three miles up the road to the hospital.\"<br/>St Brendan's is a tiny three-bed hospital in Castlebay, the main village on Barra, which is not even equipped with an X-ray machine. <br/>But it is the place where the local doctor tries to keep patients stable in an emergency while awaiting the air ambulance to take them to the mainland. <br/>A trauma team from almost 200 miles away in Glasgow was diverted to Barra but had to refuel meaning it was almost five hours before Sandy was helicoptered off the island. <br/>\"The only way the trauma team in Glasgow could describe it, was he was like a bomb victim\" says Ishbel.  <br/>\"The neurosurgeon put a massive question mark over how long it took for him to get to her.\"<br/>Ishbel added: \"If you look at what we do (on the islands) everyone is out working the land or working the sea so the potential for accidents is high here and that doctor is going to be the only person to respond. <br/>\"Anywhere else, what you go to your regular GP for, and what you go to A&E for, are two very different things and here it is the same person that needs to be able to do both jobs.\"<br/>The most recent resident GP left Barra last year and since then cover has been provided by locums. Temporary staff are also providing dental care on the island and plans to build a new hospital are now on hold after the Scottish government pulled the funding. <br/>It has left residents unsettled and worried about the future of vital services.<br/>Margaret Ann Beggs is the manager of Cobhair Bharraigh, a day centre for elderly people.  <br/>She says: \"The doctors and the nurses are lifeline services for the community of Barra. They really do save lives and keep people alive until such time as they can get off the island for specialist care.  <br/>\"They deal with everything here on the island and as such they are a fundamental and really important part of the community\".<br/>Half of the 16 consultant posts in the Western Isles, which includes the larger islands of Lewis and Harris, are currently filled by locum doctors and the health board spent \u00a33.6m on temporary staff in the past year.  <br/>NHS Western Isles chief Executive Gordon Jamieson says he was recently quoted over \u00a31m to fill one specialty post for a year.  <br/>He told BBC Scotland he is optimistic they will find permanent GPs for Barra but there is competition with high vacancy rates across all the islands.<br/>He said: \"The single biggest issue, or risk, that the Outer Hebrides faces is population decline.  <br/>\"If you put on top of that some very clear and obvious general pressures across the NHS then that adds to the challenge for more remote areas. I can't remember a time when it was more difficult to recruit into posts than it is now.\"<br/>Young families accept that choosing to live in such a remote community means you cannot take access to healthcare for granted. But there are frustrations that people have to leave the island for routine things like blood tests or dental treatment.  <br/>Alison Sinclair has two daughters, Emma, aged five, and Sophie who is three.<br/>She said: \"Nine times out of 10, the healthcare is great but it's little things, like Sophie needs a blood test and we had to get a paediatrician appointment and you have to go to Uist for that.  <br/>\"Five minutes before we were due to get on the ferry it was cancelled.

lawyer has told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry.<br/>Ronan Lavery, KC, who represents Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice NI, was speaking at the start of the inquiry's public hearings in London.<br/>The inquiry was launched by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2021.<br/>It will cover pandemic decision-making in Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>The Department of Health's barrister Neasa Murnaghan told the inquiry the response in Northern Ireland was \"effective and coherent\".<br/>The first strand will examine the preparedness of the UK and assess if the pandemic was planned for properly.<br/>Opening the inquiry, the chair Lady Heather Hallett noted the \"dignified vigil of bereaved family members holding photographs of their loved ones\" when she arrived on Tuesday.<br/>\"Their grief was obvious to all,\" she said.<br/>Mr Lavery told the inquiry that people in Northern Ireland were at a \"distinct disadvantage\". <br/>He told the inquiry that a large part of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 did not apply to Northern Ireland and that the problem was not just devolution, but that in 2004 the NI executive and the Assembly were in suspension.<br/>\"There was no equivalent devolved legislation ever introduced despite this being a key recommendation of the Cygnus report and despite the Northern Ireland Secretary of State's expectation in 2005 that Northern Ireland would have 'a similar level of protection for its citizens as experienced elsewhere',\" he said.<br/>Exercise Cygnus was a cross-government exercise designed to test the UK's response to a serious influenza pandemic which took place in 2016.<br/>The inquiry also heard that there was \"a lack of knowledge among political leaders as well in relation to central government planning and preparedness and the reasons for it\".<br/>He added that Northern Ireland did not attend important UK-wide pandemic meetings before March 2020.<br/>There was a disconnect between Westminster and Stormont, he said, adding:<br/>Mr Lavery also said EU exit preparations also impacted preparations, adding \"Northern Ireland was more than 18 months behind the rest of the UK in terms of ensuring sector resilience to any pandemic flu outbreak\".<br/>Ms Murnaghan said there was a clear structure within the Department of Health and their \"main priority from day one was the protection of Northern Irish citizens from the virus\".<br/>\"Throughout these first stages, there were improvements in Northern Ireland's reaction to the pandemic as a result of increased availability to testing, improvements in pandemic modelling, improved understanding of individual and population behaviours and how they were influenced by modelling, and by the development of vaccines and how their rapid deployment was effected as well as the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions,\" she added.<br/>She told the inquiry that preparations for a no-deal EU exit did divert attentions away from pandemic preparedness, but said on the \"positive side\" there was additional training and increased stockpiles for medicines and medical devices.<br/>At the start of the day the inquiry showed a video hearing testimony from bereaved family members, including those from Northern Ireland.<br/>Some had travelled to London for the first day. <br/>Brenda Doherty said her mother was one of the first to die at the start of the first lockdown in March 2020. <br/>\"Mum was our world,\" she said.<br/>\"It's a very important part of history and history has to reflect the truth of what happened to families like mine.\" <br/>Catriona Clarke talked about losing her 67-year-old father to \"hospital-acquired Covid\" in December 2020. <br/>\"The circumstances surrounding the lead-up

hit 30C (86F) over the weekend.<br/>The alert is in place from 09:00 BST on Friday 9 June to 09:00 on Monday 12 June.<br/>Heat can affect anyone, but some people run a greater risk of serious harm. Check on those who may be more vulnerable, such older people and babies.<br/>Here's what you need to know about the effects of heat on the body and how to stay cool.<br/>As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.<br/>This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. <br/>At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. <br/>This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:<br/>If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.<br/>Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave.<br/>It is the temperature our bodies have evolved to work at. <br/>But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.<br/>It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.<br/>As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.<br/>The UK Health Security Agency has some tips:<br/>Use thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say.<br/>If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.<br/>NHS advice says: <br/>However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.<br/>It is a medical emergency and you should call 999.<br/>People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. <br/>Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.<br/>Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. <br/>Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.<br/>People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.<br/>Yes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.<br/>Diuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body.<br/>Antihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure.<br/>Some drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself.<br/>And other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. <br/>There are about 2,000 deaths caused by high temperatures in England every year.<br/>Most of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.<br/>The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.<br/>However, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than \"peak summer\".<br/>This could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat.<br/>The evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave. <br/>Follow James on Twitter."}, {"_id": "648a006f51ac3319f5477eb4", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-62120167?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Health", "subCategories": "", "title": "What are the heat exhaustion and heatstroke symptoms?", "lead": "Know the signs and what to do if someone is unwell in hot weather.", "author": "By Michelle Roberts", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:19.798210", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/52D6/production/_125860212_gettyimages-1370992568.jpg", "body": "During the hot weather, it can be easy to overheat. <br/>Environmental temperatures of 40C (104F) can make it difficult to keep the body at its ideal 37C.<br/>The advice - be sensible and slow down to stay cool.<br/>While heat exhaustion is not usually serious, as long as you can cool yourself down, heatstroke is a medical emergency. <br/>Here's what to look for and what to do. <br/>Heat exhaustion happens when your body is becoming too hot and struggling to regulate or cope. <br/>It can affect anyone, including fit and healthy people - especially if they are doing strenuous exercise in high temperatures or have been drinking alcohol in the sun all day. It can come on quickly, over minutes, or gradually, over hours.<br/>The symptoms you will feel are your body's way of warning you to cool down, fast.<br/>An obvious sign is excessive sweating, as well as feeling very hot and unwell with it. <br/>Other symptoms include:<br/>Young children, who might not be able to tell you about how they are feeling, may become floppy and sleepy. <br/>Heat exhaustion can turn into heatstroke, which is an emergency.

Get urgent medical help. <br/>The signs to watch for and quickly act on:  <br/>Older adults and young infants, as well as people with long-term health conditions, are particularly at risk. <br/>The body's ability to regulate its temperature is not fully developed in the young and may be reduced by illness, medications or other factors in older adults.

In England just 61% of patients start treatment in that time against a target of 85%.<br/>Growing delays are, in part, the flip side of a medical success story.<br/>Scientific progress in cancer care has been remarkable, with cutting-edge drugs offering hope where previously there was little that could be done.<br/>New techniques are more effective but often far more complex for doctors to deliver.<br/>At the same time the UK population is getting older - and as cancer risk is strongly linked to age it means more more demand for expensive scanners, along with more staff to analyse those scans, and more specialist doctors and nurses. <br/>The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) describes the situation as a perfect storm - and says the workforce is struggling to keep up.  <br/>Across the four UK nations, it calculates there is now a 15% shortfall of specialist cancer doctors - or clinical oncologists - who deliver chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <br/>Without action, it says this gap will grow to 25% - or a shortage of 368 full-time consultants - by 2027.<br/>Just as concerning is an even larger shortage of consultant radiologists - highly trained doctors who interpret scans to diagnose cancer or monitor its progression.<br/>The RCR says for each month a patient waits to start cancer treatment, the risk of death is increased by about 10%. <br/>In its annual survey, 44% of cancer service managers say they are now \"highly concerned\" about patient delays, up from 29% in the previous year.<br/>\"There are examples in almost every cancer centre where parts of the service just aren't running as well as we would like,\" said Dr Tom Roques, a consultant oncologist and vice-president of the RCR.<br/>\"We're having to tell patients all the time that we can't quite treat them as quickly as we would like, or in the way that we'd like, and that's a stressful thing to have to do.\"<br/>Kevin O'Hara, 60, from County Durham, broke five ribs in a motorbike accident last November. <br/>A scan of his upper body also picked up a shadow near one of his kidneys that was later diagnosed as cancer.<br/>He was offered drug treatment meant to slow the growth of the tumour and - in early February - was told the waiting list for surgery would be three to four months. <br/>That period has now been and gone but he is still waiting for a date for his operation. <br/>\"Every day you are waiting and waiting and nothing changes,\" he said. <br/>\"I come home from work and go to the door and, when there's no envelope that says NHS on the top, I just get so depressed.\" <br/>There is another trend in cancer care which is often overlooked.<br/>The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in people coming forward to get checked after spotting a possible symptom such as an unusual lump, strange mole or unexplained weight loss.<br/>The reasons for that are complex and include a bounceback in demand since Covid, stronger guidance for GPs to refer to cancer specialists, major NHS publicity drives and the work of campaigners such as \"Bowelbabe\" Deborah James.<br/>Cancer doctors view the spike in demand as a \"very good thing\", as a growing proportion of patients are now diagnosed earlier when cancer is easier to treat.<br/>But it also puts more pressure on NHS services, with waiting times for diagnosis and other scans one of the key bottlenecks in the system.<br/>Since Christmas there have been some signs of progress, with the NHS in England reducing the backlog of long waits for treatment and hitting one of its other standards - for faster diagnosis - for the first time. <br/>The RCR also says there is a \"chink of light\" - with recruitment of oncologists rising over the last three years, particularly in parts of the country with the worst staff shortages.<br/>It wants each UK nation to increase medical school places and training posts, and says more also needs to be done to stop experienced staff cutting their hours or leaving the profession early. <br/>The Department of Health said that the total number of full-time staff in the cancer workforce in England had risen by 51% to 33,093 since 2010.<br/>A spokesman added: \"We want to build on this progress and will publish a workforce plan shortly to ensure we have the right numbers of staff, with the right number of skills.\"<br/>The Scottish government is also expected to publish its new 10-year cancer strategy within weeks, setting out ways to attract and retain more staff.<br/>The Welsh government recently published a cancer improvement plan and says it is now investing heavily to train more staff and build more diagnostic and treatment centres.  <br/>In Northern Ireland, the health department said it is \"extremely disappointing\" that cancer targets are being missed. It has recently opened two new rapid diagnostic centres and started a \"cancer strategy workforce review\". <br/>Data visualisation by Liana Bravo.<br/>Follow Jim on Twitter.<br/>Has your treatment been affected by the junior doctor strikes?

They can then apply for those jobs directly. Ghana's dire economic situation acts as a big push factor. <br/>Howard Catton from the International Council of Nurses (ICN) is concerned about the scale of the numbers leaving countries like Ghana. <br/>\"My sense is that the situation currently is out of control,\" he told the BBC. <br/>\"We have intense recruitment taking place mainly driven by six or seven high-income countries but with recruitment from countries which are some of the weakest and most vulnerable which can ill-afford to lose their nurses.\"<br/>The head of nursing at Greater Accra Regional Hospital, Gifty Aryee, told the BBC her Intensive Care Unit alone had lost 20 nurses to the UK and US in the last six months - with grave implications. <br/>\"Care is affected as we are not able to take any more patients. There are delays and it costs more in mortality - patients die,\" she said. <br/>She added that seriously ill patients often had to be held for longer in the emergency department due to the nursing shortages. <br/>One nurse in the hospital estimated that half of those she had graduated with had left the country - and she wanted to join them.<br/>The BBC found a similar situation at Cape Coast Municipal Hospital. <br/>The hospital's deputy head of nursing services, Caroline Agbodza, said she had seen 22 nurses leave for the UK in the last year.  <br/>\"All our critical care nurses, our experienced nurses, have gone. So we end up having nothing - no experienced staff to work with. Even if the government recruits, we have to go through the pain of training nurses again.\"<br/>Smaller clinics are also affected by staff migration because even one nurse leaving a small health centre can have a large knock-on effect. <br/>At Ewim Health Clinic in Cape Coast, one nurse has left their small emergency department and another has left the outpatients unit. Both nurses were experienced and had found jobs in the UK.  <br/>The chief doctor there, Dr Justice Arthur, said the effects were enormous. <br/>\"Let's take services like immunisation of children. If we lose public health nurses, then the babies that have to be immunised will not get their immunisation and we are going to have babies die,\" he told the BBC.<br/>He said adult patients would also die if there were not enough nurses to look after them after surgery.<br/>Most of the nurses that the BBC team spoke to wanted to leave Ghana due to the fact they could earn more elsewhere.  <br/>At Kwaso healthcare centre near the city of Kumasi, Mercy Asare Afriyie explained that she was hoping to find a job in the UK soon. <br/>\"The exodus of nurses is not going to stop because of our poor conditions of service. Our salary is nothing to write home about and in two weeks you spend it. It's from hand to mouth.\"  <br/>Ghanaian nurses told the BBC that in the UK they could earn more than seven times what they are receiving in Ghana.<br/>Perpetual Ofori-Ampofo from Ghana's Nurses and Midwives Association said her country's healthcare system needed more help. <br/>\"If you look at the numbers, then it is not ethical for the UK to recruit from Ghana because the numbers of professional nurses compared to trainee or auxiliary nurses is a problem for us,\" she said. <br/>But she added that it was not possible to stop nurses from leaving as migration was a right and that the Ghanaian government needed to do more to persuade them to stay. The health ministry in the capital, Accra, declined to comment. <br/>Ghana is on the World Health Organization's list of 55 vulnerable countries, which have low numbers of nurses per head of population. The list - dubbed by some as the \"red list\" - is designed to discourage systematic recruitment in these countries. <br/>The UK government recently gave \u00a315m ($18.6m) to Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya to help boost their healthcare workforces. <br/>But the country is known to be looking at brokering a formal deal with Ghana whereby it might be able to recruit more proactively in return for giving the government there a sum of money per nurse. <br/>It already has a similar agreement with Nepal. <br/>But the ICN's Mr Catton questioned whether it was enough. <br/>He told the BBC that he believed such deals were \"trying to create a veneer of ethical respectability rather than a proper reflection of the true costs to the countries which are losing their nurses\". <br/>The WHO's Director of Health Workforce, Jim Campbell, explained to the BBC that Brexit had been a factor in the UK turning to African countries for nurses to fill NHS vacancies. <br/>\"The labour market is extremely competitive around the world and, having closed off the potential labour market from European freedom of movement, what we're seeing is the consequences of that in terms of attracting people from the Commonwealth and other jurisdictions.\""}, {"_id": "648a007251ac3319f5477eb8", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65688117?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Is the past year's spike in strike action here to stay?", "lead": "BBC economics editor Faisal Islam asks whether a historic surge in industrial action is likely to persist.", "author": "By Faisal Islam", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:22.351271", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/386C/production/_129844441_strikingnurse2.jpg", "body": "Over the past 12 months, a historic wave of industrial action has swept the UK. As a new documentary series follows union leaders up close, the BBC's economics editor asks whether this surge in strikes is likely to persist.<br/>\"Listen, don't fall out with each other. Don't fall out with each other. It's really important everybody sticks together,\" says Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, as tensions flare on a bus drivers' picket line. <br/>The Abellio drivers in two south London depots had been offered a 12% pay rise and a \u00a3500 bonus - splitting opinion among drivers, who had been striking without full pay for 10 days. <br/>One driver later says: \"The union rep, they're selling us out\u2026 there's a lot of traitors around.\" <br/>Others say: \"We got screwed\" and \"we've been here for two months freezing and we're dying\". They would eventually win an 18% rise. <br/>Settlements such as this one have been occurring in so-called shortage sectors, such as driving buses, lorries, and rubbish trucks, since the beginning of last year. Many of those settlements went under the radar, in very local disputes or even, as here, in individual depots. <br/>The past year across industry and public services has seen hundreds of ballots, hundreds of thousands on picket lines, dozens of negotiations, double-digit pay claims and awards, and major legal battles between the government and public sector unions. <br/>Only 15 months ago, No 10 were slapping down the governor of the Bank of England for saying that people should not ask for excessive pay rises. Four months before that, the then-prime minister was celebrating the prospect of a high-wage Britain for all. <br/>And this time last year Ms Graham, the general secretary of the biggest private sector union, had never done a broadcast interview in that role. She and her colleagues are now household names after promising a \"summer, autumn, spring and winter of discontent\". <br/>Strike: Inside the Unions<br/>With access to top union leaders, the two-part documentary follows internal machinations at Unite, RMT and the RCN, as well as the GMB's campaign to win recognition at Amazon in Coventry. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). The first episode will be on BBC Two at 21:00 on 25 May, with the second a week later.<br/>Part of Boris Johnson's survival strategy had involved squaring up to the unions over their pay claims and seeking to direct blame towards the Labour Party. <br/>But the unions calculated that the old pattern of mutually dismissive relations between organised labour and government had altered since the pandemic and in the shared pain of a common cost of living crisis. The last year raises questions not just about that relationship, but whether something has changed in the water in the way the UK thinks about industrial relations. <br/>Looming over all of this are the restrictions on ballots in the government's anti-union laws. The documentary shows how unions have got around restrictions requiring postal ballots and high thresholds on turnout. <br/>The pattern over the past year has been unions breaking down national disputes into a series of far smaller local and sectoral ones, for which it is easier to win ballot mandates. Action is then co-ordinated across localities on the same day, giving the impression of massive national or regional walkouts, as with bus drivers across London. <br/>The other pattern is that of the private sector settling high wage claims in areas of labour shortages. <br/>Unite has a unit of forensic accountants assessing the profits and available cash flow of the parent companies, often foreign-owned, of the employers involved in disputes. In this case the owner was effectively the Dutch state (though it has now sold its stake), a fact routinely used by the union in online campaigning. <br/>The experience in the public sector has been different. This time last year, there was no negotiation. The Pay Review Body process had recommended a settlement of around 3% across public services. This was often before the spike in inflation to double digits following the Ukraine war. <br/>Prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss dug in on the issue. At first, so too did the Sunak administration, fearful of the fiscal cost and inflationary potential of significant rises in the wage costs of state employees. <br/>The cameras were with Royal College of Nursing (RCN) General Secretary Pat Cullen ahead of the first strikes in its history.<br/>The RCN itself had been asking for a 19% rise for nurses. The government said at that time it could not shift from the recommendation of the Pay Review Body and was not negotiating. <br/>\"It's never, ever going to get a resolution to this dispute,\" Cullen said later. \"The last meeting that I had with the secretary of state, he arrived accompanied by five men and it was not a pleasant meeting. It was quite a bullyish conversation.\" Cullen said nurses had concluded that they were being treated differently because \"we are 90% female\". <br/>And she said a government minister had told her in a meeting that they were surprised nurses needed to live off their salaries: \"And you know, ministers coming into the room saying to me that they're shocked that nursing staff may be the main breadwinner in the family. Because they believe that it's a second salary that we don't depend on. They are totally out of touch.\" <br/>The Department of Health said it did not recognise the claim and had \"utmost respect\" for all staff. <br/>Nurses in the RCN in the end rejected the deal recommended by their own union - a sign of how strongly a large swathe of public sector workers felt about the squeeze in their real wages. <br/>The film shows how nurses felt emboldened by large-scale public sympathy, especially since the pandemic. <br/>This perception of support, even in less popular professions than the NHS, has helped underpin double-digit pay claims. The successful tactics in the private sector of balloting first for strike action in order to gain negotiating leverage in pay disputes has also spread to the public sector. <br/>Some union bosses also acknowledge that in an era where more workers can work from home, the strikes may not have disrupted the public as much. While the overall number of strikes has not been seen for a generation, the total number of days lost to strike action is nowhere near the highs of the 1970s. <br/>Nonetheless, some in the union movement are trying to push into new territory too, such as the GMB at Amazon. <br/>Outside the company's Coventry warehouse, Stuart Richards, a senior GMB organiser, is attempting to recruit new members.<br/>A US training video cartoon for Amazon managers leaked in 2018 certainly made clear that \"we do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers, our shareholders, or most importantly, our associates\" - its term for workers.<br/>But the staff arriving by car have been squeezed hard by the cost of living crisis - one tells of having to pawn a wedding ring - and some were willing to U-turn near the entrance to their workplace and sign up to Richards' campaign. <br/>Eventually the GMB get more than half the Coventry workforce, which the union estimates at 1,300 in total, and serve a letter demanding recognition from the Amazon bosses - it is the first site in the UK to do so, after a decade of trying.<br/>So the question really is whether the current spike in strike activity is entirely a reaction to rampant inflation or whether this is something that might have a longer-lasting impact. <br/>The full data is not yet available, but it is difficult to escape a pattern of unionised workplaces, especially in shortage occupations, getting double-digit pay settlements. <br/>They have responded to existing strike restrictions by moving to immediate localised ballots, even before starting negotiations. On the other hand, insiders say that membership spikes during pay disputes, but then falls back when pay deals are done. Union subs are another expense during a cost of living crisis. Official figures will come next year. <br/>There are some concerns, though, about the persistence and stickiness of inflation. Even the Bank of England, which began last year warning about excessive pay rises, now couples that message with concerns about corporate pricing and profits, a similar message to that pushed by some union leaders. <br/>And the political economy of all this does appear to be changing. <br/>Bashing the unions has proven tricky for the government over the past year. David Cameron's union tsar Lord Richard Balfe argues that PMs Johnson and Truss should have sued for peace with public sector workers much earlier. The opposition felt confident enough to announce it would repeal the new \"minimum service level\" laws as well as older restrictions on ballots, if it wins power. <br/>This current wave of industrial action appears to be calming, but is not yet over. The government is trying to settle pay deals it had previously left to Pay Review Bodies. Inflation may also now be falling sustainably. But the shadow of this year of industrial action may linger for some time."}, {"_id": "648a007351ac3319f5477eb9", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-65499929?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Health", "subCategories": "", "title": "Covid global health emergency is over, WHO says", "lead": "Close to 20 million people are likely to have died during the last three years, says the WHO.", "author": "By Smitha Mundasad and Philippa Roxby", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:23.275064", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/741E/production/_114962792_mediaitem114962791.jpg", "body": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that Covid-19 no longer represents a \"global health emergency\". <br/>The statement represents a major step towards ending the pandemic and comes three years after it first declared its highest level of alert over the virus. <br/>Officials said the virus' death rate had dropped from a peak of more than 100,000 people per week in January 2021 to just over 3,500 on 24 April. <br/>The head of the WHO said at least seven million people died in the pandemic. <br/>But Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the true figure was \"likely\" closer to 20 million deaths - nearly three times the official estimate - and he warned that the virus remained a significant threat. <br/>\"Yesterday, the Emergency Committee met for the 15th time and recommended to me that I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern.

According to the WHO, 13 billion doses have been given, allowing many people to be protected from serious illness and death. <br/>But in many countries vaccines have not reached most of those in need. <br/>More than 765 million confirmed Covid infections have been recorded worldwide.<br/>The US and UK, like many other countries, have already talked about \"living with the virus\" and wound down many of the tests and social mixing rules. <br/>Dr Mike Ryan, from the WHO's health emergencies programme, said the emergency may have ended, but the threat is still there. <br/>\"We fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit and this is the history of pandemics,\" he said.<br/>\"It took decades for the final throes of the pandemic virus of 1918 to disappear. <br/>\"In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins.\""}, {"_id": "648a007351ac3319f5477eba", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64819965?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Toxic debate over lab leak theory hampers search for Covid origins", "lead": "US agencies cannot agree on how the pandemic started, with the scientific community bitterly divided.", "author": "By John Sudworth", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:01:23.868426", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17FA5/production/_128831289_813dfc25a4e0fbdf895234db26fcf68412554a760_0_5760_38401000x667.jpg", "body": "There have long been two competing theories for how the pandemic started. Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me. He suggests that Donald Trump, who has indulged in conspiracy theories across a range of other issues, may in fact have been right to question this narrative. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"I mean, yes, you do have conspiracy theories. But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab? No.\"<br/>Some experts hope that Congress may now be able to uncover new information.  <br/>US scientists have collaborated closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there may yet be data held by government agencies or research archives that could prove useful.  <br/>Meanwhile the Chinese government of course pushes back at any and all suggestions that the virus came from China - via a market or a lab.  <br/>My own attempts to examine those possibilities led, at least in part, to my forcible departure from the country, under threat of legal action by the authorities in 2021.  <br/>State media accused me of \"stigmatising China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus\" and of having \"maliciously incited hostility from the international community to China.\" <br/>The question of Covid's origin is likely to remain shrouded in bitterness, acrimony and politics in both Washington and Beijing.<br/>The lack of information is both why President Biden ordered his intelligence agencies in 2021 to use \"every tool\" to look again for answers, and also why they're finding them so hard to come by. <br/>John's podcast on the hunt for the origin of Covid is coming soon on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4"}, {"_id": "648a00b351ac3319f5477ebb", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64823096?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "England,N.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.<br/>The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.<br/>Deaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. <br/>Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. <br/>Using this metric, researchers from the Lancet medical journal suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021. That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources.

However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. <br/>More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.<br/>Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.<br/>The aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.<br/>Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.<br/>However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.<br/>Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.<br/>Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%.<br/>Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.<br/>Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%.<br/>When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%.<br/>There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.<br/>Analysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.<br/>The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.<br/>In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.<br/>Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. <br/>Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light.<br/>The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. <br/>In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. <br/>French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."}, {"_id": "648a00b951ac3319f5477ec0", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64122626?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Health", "subCategories": "", "title": "Covid: Why are some places testing Chinese arrivals?", "lead": "Beijing is finally opening its borders - but some countries are wary of a Covid threat.", "author": "By Fergus Walsh", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:02:33.998547", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1CA7/production/_128153370_mediaitem128153369.jpg", "body": "When a country of 1.4 billion people suddenly ended its zero-Covid policy after nearly three years, there was little doubt what would happen.   <br/>Poor immunisation levels and little natural immunity meant an explosion of cases - just as China is about to lift restrictions on its citizens travelling abroad. <br/>So now, some countries - wary of an influx of cases - are imposing Covid testing, and possible quarantine, on visitors from China.<br/>The Covid wave hitting China is not due to some radical new variant, but Omicron in its different forms.   <br/>BF.7 and BQ.1 are both sub-lineages of BA.5, which itself is part of the Omicron \"family\" - more contagious, more infectious than any previous Covid strain. <br/>But these Omicron sub-variants have all been widely detected outside China - including in the UK.    <br/>Omicron has been the dominant global variant for more than a year, but that does not exclude the possibility that a new variant of concern will emerge in future. <br/>A key reason that many countries are imposing Covid checks on travellers from China is the lack of surveillance data coming out of the country. The more Covid that is circulating, the more chance there is for the virus to mutate. <br/>But new variants can pop up anywhere - the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India have all been the likely origins of previous variants of concern.<br/>So will the new Covid test restrictions make any difference?<br/>Several countries are asking travellers from China to produce a negative Covid test in order to gain entry. <br/>The US said this would \"slow the spread\" of the virus, while scientists worked to identify any potential variants that may emerge. But no-one is suggesting that this will stop Covid cases coming in. <br/>Italy has gone further, and is imposing mandatory post-arrival PCR tests on travellers from China. Those that test positive will need to quarantine for several days. <br/>This has the advantage of enabling genomic sequencing of the virus, and so aids the search for new variants. But it will also add to airport congestion.   <br/>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that those travellers from China who have tested positive so far are carriers of \"Omicron variants already present in Italy\". Italy wants an EU-wide approach on the issue - but the EU's disease agency says, for many reasons, that is \"unjustified\".<br/>In the UK, there is plenty of Covid about. Probably well over a million people a week are getting infected, either at work, home or socialising - in other words anywhere people gather. The latest ONS survey estimated that around 1 in 45 people had the virus earlier this month.<br/>But most of the UK population is very well protected from severe illness, via a combination of vaccines and repeated natural infection.<br/>That means Covid - while still a potential danger here - is no longer the threat it once was.

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. <br/>If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. <br/>The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur.
