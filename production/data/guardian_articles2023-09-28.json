Ten Dead is lent a sense of unease by the eerie string arrangement and the noise that grumbles softly in the background.

As early as the 1930s, microbiologists were puzzling over the disconnect between the microbial world they encountered in the wild and what they could study in the laboratory. They found that if they placed a sample \u2013 say a drop of seawater or smear of dirt \u2013 under a microscope, they could see hundreds of wondrous and varied organisms swirling about. But if they placed the same sample on to the gelatinous nutrient slurry of a petri dish, only a few distinct species would survive and grow. When they went to count the number of microbial colonies growing on the plate, it was a meagre handful compared to what they had just seen magnified. This would later be dubbed \u201cthe great plate count anomaly\u201d. \u201cWith the microscope, and then the electron microscope, you could see all these hints.

And so scientists were stuck with whatever could survive in their limited conditions. Yet there were some microbiologists who attempted to escape this straitjacket and discover the true extent of the microbial kingdom. The story of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 is familiar: a fungal spore wafting through the corridors of St Mary\u2019s hospital and settling at random in Fleming\u2019s petri dish contained penicillin, which turned out to be one of the most potent medical weapons of the 20th century. Less well known, but no less significant, is the story of the Rutgers University chemist Selman Waksman, who coined the term \u201cantibiotic\u201d after noting that certain soil bacteria produced toxins that killed or inhibited other bacteria with whom they were competing for food. Waksman worked tirelessly to figure out the conditions required to grow these wild bacteria in his lab, and his efforts produced not just the second commercially available antibiotic, streptomycin, in 1946, but the next five antibiotics brought to market, too. Ultimately, searching the soil for antibiotic-producing microbes proved far more fruitful than waiting for them to float into one\u2019s laboratory. Today, 90% of all antibiotics are descended from the grouping of bacteria that yielded Waksmans original discoveries."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Efforts like Waksman\u2019s were relatively rare.

Suddenly the microbes under the microscope could be catalogued and identified by their DNA, which also hinted at how they might grow and function. Not only that, says Handelsman, \u201cthe genetic diversity we were seeing was enormous\u201d. It turned out that \u201cthese life forms that looked quite similar are in fact very, very different. It opened this door to realising how much more was out there.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "text": "About 25 years ago, the consensus among scientists was that there were probably fewer than ten million species of microbes on the planet; in the past decade, some new studies have put the number as high as a trillion, the vast majority still unknown.

And, at this historical moment, humans are creating more extreme environments across the globe at an alarming rate. Where other animals and plants have no hope of evolving a solution quickly enough to outpace their changing habitats, microbes are adapting fast.

In the case of plastic-eating microbes, that leap has now been made. Since 2021, a French company named Carbios has been running an operation that uses a bacterial enzyme to process about 250kg of PET plastic waste every day, breaking it down into its precursor molecules, which can then be made directly into new plastic.

To accelerate the process, Carbios pays a biotech company to harvest and concentrate huge amounts of pure plastic-digesting enzyme from bacteria. The Carbios scientists then place the plastic nurdles in a solution of water and enzyme, inside a sealed steel tank several metres high. In the adjoining lab where the process is tested, you can observe the reaction taking place in smaller vessels. Inside, the off-white plastic bits swirl about like the flakes in a snowglobe. As time goes on, the plastic erodes away, its components dissolving into the solution, leaving only a greyish liquid churning behind the glass. The liquid now contains not solid PET, but two liquid chemicals called ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, which can be separated out and turned into new plastic."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The technique Carbios has developed appears to scale easily.

The chemical reaction itself turns the surrounding solution acidic, and so like an outdoor pool, chemical base must be constantly added to the solution to keep it close to neutral, which creates several kilograms of sodium sulphate as a byproduct each time the reaction runs. Sodium sulphate has many uses, including glassmaking and in detergents, but everything from manufacturing the chemical base, to moving the sodium sulphate on to further uses, adds environmental costs and logistical friction."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In a sunny conference room in the factory complex, Emmanuel Ladent, the Carbios CEO, told me that the company\u2019s recycling process currently produces 51% fewer emissions than making new plastic (with the significant added benefits of no new oil drilled to make the plastic, and no net addition of plastics to the world). \u201cVery good,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut the hope is we are just getting started.\u201d Carbios has not released their analysis publicly, but several other scientists familiar with the field told me that halving emissions was within the best-case scenarios for this kind of recycling."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Carbios and the scientists behind it \u2013 the University of Toulouse biologists Alain Marty and Vincent Tournier \u2013 have been working in the field for more than a decade.

(The waxy coating of leaves, which the enzyme works on, bear a close similarity to plastic.) \u201cIt was a bit weak, and it didn\u2019t work well with any kind of high temperature, but it was a good beginning,\u201d Marty told me recently.

Nearly 50,000kg of nitrogen fertiliser was spread along the shoreline to turbocharge bacterial growth. Similarly, when a former industrial site in Stratford, east London, was chosen for the 2012 Olympic Games, the committee charged with cleaning it up moved more than 2,000 dump trucks\u2019 worth of soil contaminated with petroleum and other chemicals to sites where it was pumped full of nitrogen and oxygen for weeks, inducing a bloom of bacterial growth that consumed the toxins.

Hoping to buy and revive his hometown church, Purlie hopes to claim a $500 inheritance that plantation owner \u201cCap\u2019n\u201d Cotchipee (Jay O Sanders) owes to his late cousin Bee, who has no next of kin. Purlie knows that Cotchipee \u2013 who keeps a number of local Black folks in his employ, in his debt, and under his thumb \u2013 won\u2019t part with the money easily. So Purlie enlists the starry-eyed (and Purlie-besotted) Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins (Kara Young) to pose as Cousin Bee. After all, Cotchipee hasn\u2019t seen Bee since she was young \u2013 and, more to the point, Purlie understands how interchangeable Black faces are to white people who still see them as lesser creatures, slaves in all but name."}, {"type": "text", "text": "What results, then, is a sort-of farce with genuine danger and tension lurking underneath the frantic deception.

Moreover, the cast is a joy to watch, seamlessly blending righteous passion and practical laughs, even as the play\u2019s torrents of dialogue threaten to overwhelm them. Though Odom is the top-billed star attraction here, it takes Young all of about 30 seconds to start stealing scenes. She gives Luttiebelle a slightly cracked voice and, when she\u2019s called upon to perform as a college-educated Cousin Bee, a teetering case of nerves; it adds up to a perfectly judged case of playing daft but not dumb.

Not in Odom\u2019s performance, by turns charming and fiercely emotional, but the writing and direction of the character, who must shoulder the burden of the play\u2019s plot, character, and messaging all at once. Occasionally, it feels like too much for such a brief production to bear and leaving some conceptual questions hanging: is it Purlie\u2019s faith that powers his fervor, or is part of him embracing the elaborate bluster of a con man in order to find some measure of revenge? Either take would be satisfying, but the show makes him a little too opaque for Odom to land on one, the other, or a mix.
