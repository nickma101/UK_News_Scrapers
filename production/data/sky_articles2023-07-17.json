down from \u00a39,250.The plans, announced by Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, are part of the government's response to the Augar review, established by Theresa May back in 2017.Among the report's recommendations - which also included cutting tuition fees and more funding for further education - was an aim to reduce the number of \"low value\" courses leaving students with poor job prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the plans, the Office for Students (OfS) will be asked to limit the number of students universities can recruit to courses that are seen to fail to deliver good outcomes for graduates. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n2:24\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents take universities to court\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said: \"The UK is home to some of the best universities in the world and studying for a degree can be immensely rewarding.\"But too many young people are being sold a false dream and end up doing a poor quality course at the taxpayers' expense that doesn't offer the prospect of a decent job at the end of it.\"That is why we are taking action to crack down on rip-off university courses, while boosting skills training and apprenticeships provision. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will help more young people to choose the path that is right to help them reach their potential and grow our economy.\" \n\n\nWhat courses could be at risk?\n\nThe government is yet to specify what courses it is defining as \"low value\" and which will have student numbers limited by the Office for Students. \nFigures released on 6 July by the longitudinal educational outcomes (LEO) database \u2013 which connects education data with employment data - suggested which subjects had the highest and lowest employment rates and salaries in the tax year 2020-2021.\nOut of the higher education institutions (HEIs) analysed, first degree graduates in languages and area studies, and creative arts and design, had the lowest median proportions in sustained employment, further study or both.\nMeanwhile, graduates in nursing and midwifery, and medicine and dentistry, had the highest median proportions.\nFurther data from the LEO suggested that five years after graduation from HEIs in the UK, medicine and dentistry had a median graduate earning of \u00a352,900, whereas performing arts stood at \u00a321,200. \n\nThese findings echo those recommended by the Augar review, which found that male graduates in creative arts, English and philosophy earn less in comparison to peers who did not complete a degree.\nIt is important to note that some subjects showed wider variations in earnings \u2013 for example, computing had a difference of \u00a361,900 between its highest and lowest earners.\nThis is likely down to the availability of the labour market, and the use of standardised salaries in some sectors, the LEO reported.\nDespite suggestions from the data, education minister Robert Halfon denied that the government's cap is an attack on arts and humanities courses. \n\"We're not saying that particular arts courses are going to have limits,\" he said when speaking on Times Radio on Monday. \n\"It may be that in some universities there are arts courses that are leading to good jobs.\n\"It's only courses in universities, whatever those courses may be, that lead to poor outcomes \u2013 whether that's continuation, completion of courses or not getting good, skilled jobs at the end \u2013 those courses will be the focus of recruitment limits by the Office for Students.\"\nData released back in March 2019 by the Higher Education Statistics Agency revealed the degrees with the highest non-continuation rate among first degree entrants at UK HEIs.\nIt suggested that the five highest courses for non-continuation rates included:\ncomputer science - 9.8%; business & administrative studies - 7.4%; engineering & technology - 7.2%; mass communications & documentation - 7.2%; and creative arts & design - 7.2%.\nIn comparison, medicine and dentistry and veterinary science students had the lowest non-continuation rate at 1.5%.\nThe term non-continuation is defined as a student not having obtained the qualification they were originally aiming for. This does not take course changes into account, or students who leave within the first 50 days of the course commencement.\n\n\nBut opposition MPs said the measures amounted to a \"cap on aspiration\" that will restrict choice for young people.Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the plans were \"simply an attack on the aspirations of young people and their families by a government that wants to reinforce the class ceiling, not smash it\".Read more:More than 100,000 students try to sue universitiesUniversity bosses to meet after boycott leaves students without grades \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nGillian Keegan\n        \n\n\n\nMunira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson, accused the prime minister of being \"so out of ideas that he's dug up a new version of a policy the Conservatives have announced and then unannounced twice over\".She added: \"Universities don't want this.

and who are the Tories hoping to win over if they axe it?\n\n\n\nWhat is inheritance tax?Inheritance tax is paid on money, property and possessions somebody leaves behind after they die.These things of value are known as the person's estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritance tax isn't paid on the whole estate. If a person's estate is worth less than \u00a3325,000, there isn't any inheritance tax to pay.If it's worth more than that, inheritance tax applies and everything above that threshold will be taxed 40% (but you still get the first \u00a3325,000 tax-free).However, there are some instances where the threshold changes.Married couples  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are married or in a civil partnership, you can pass on a home to your spouse without paying inheritance tax.The surviving partner also inherits what's left of the late partner's tax-free threshold.If the first spouse to die did not use any of their threshold, the surviving person will be able to leave \u00a3650,000 without any tax being paid on it.Leaving a home to a child or grandchildIf you give away your home to your children - including adopted, foster or stepchildren - or grandchildren, the inheritance tax threshold rises to \u00a3500,000. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any other loopholes?If you leave everything above your tax-free threshold to a charity or a community amateur sports club, it won't be subject to inheritance tax.What about money given away before you die?Money given away in your lifetime is mostly still considered part of your estate, unless you survive for seven years after giving it.However, you can give away up to \u00a33,000 a year before you die and it isn't considered part of your estate, so isn't liable for tax.You can also give away payments of up to \u00a3250 per person each tax year and they are excluded from inheritance tax.Wedding gifts are another way to give away money tax-free. You can give \u00a35,000 to a child, \u00a32,500 to a grandchild and \u00a31,000 to anyone else without worrying about inheritance tax.Does everyone pay inheritance tax?No. Inheritance tax is only paid on estates that reach the thresholds laid out above.According to the HMRC, that's only one in 20 estates.The Treasury said more than 93% of estates are forecast to have zero inheritance tax liability in the coming years.How much money is raised through inheritance tax?About \u00a37bn is raised each year through inheritance tax. This money is spent on public services.What are the Conservative Party's plans for inheritance tax?Conservatives are reportedly discussing scrapping inheritance tax.But Number 10 has indicated it is not an immediate priority.It's \"future-scoping speculation\", Number 10 told Sky News, and \"requires a different kind of economic environment to the one we're operating in\".It could be considered a manifesto pledge rather than a policy to be implemented next year.Why would the Tories want to axe inheritance tax?The Conservatives are trailing Labour in opinion polls and are on the lookout for ways to shore up votes.As Sky News' chief political correspondent Jon Craig explains: \"This is one - potentially - for the manifesto, in a bid to win back those disgruntled Tory voters in the shires

six years ago that the Lords adopt a one-in, two-out system - for every two people left, only one is appointed.While Theresa May \"responded positively\" to this, and \"progress\" was made up to 2019 in reducing the ermined headcount, the committee singles out Mr Johnson for criticism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson showed no interest in the issue of the size of the House,\" the report said.\"While the number of departures from the House continued to be broadly in line with our benchmarks, the number of appointments far exceeded them and they were granted predominantly to members of his own party.\"The report also noted that the House of Lords Appointments Commission rejected more than half of Mr Johnson's initial nominees, and raised concerns about the party balance in the Lords

period, 168 new peers were added.Under their one-in, two-out formula, this number should have been 88 - but instead, 88 Conservatives peers alone have been added.As part of its recommendations, the

suggested which subjects had the highest and lowest employment rates and salaries in the tax year 2020-2021.\nOut of the higher education institutions (HEIs) analysed, first degree graduates in languages and area studies, and creative arts and design, had the lowest median proportions in sustained employment, further study or both.\nMeanwhile, graduates in nursing and midwifery, and medicine and dentistry, had the highest median proportions.\nFurther data from the LEO suggested that five years after graduation from HEIs in the UK, medicine and dentistry had a median graduate earning of \u00a352,900, whereas performing arts stood at \u00a321,200. \n\nThese findings echo those recommended by the Augar review, which found that male graduates in creative arts, English and philosophy earn less in comparison to peers who did not complete a degree.\nIt is important to note that some subjects showed wider variations in earnings \u2013 for example, computing had a difference of \u00a361,900 between its highest and lowest earners.\nThis is likely down to the availability of the labour market, and the use of standardised salaries in some sectors, the LEO reported.\nDespite suggestions from the data, education minister Robert Halfon denied that the government's cap is an attack on arts and humanities courses. \n\"We're not saying that particular arts courses are going to have limits,\" he said when speaking on Times Radio on Monday. \n\"It may be that in some universities there are arts courses that are leading to good jobs.\n\"It's only courses in universities, whatever those courses may be, that lead to poor outcomes \u2013 whether that's continuation, completion of courses or not getting good, skilled jobs at the end \u2013 those courses will be the focus of recruitment limits by the Office for Students.\"\nData released back in March 2019 by the Higher Education Statistics Agency revealed the degrees with the highest non-continuation rate among first degree entrants at UK HEIs.\nIt suggested that the five highest courses for non-continuation rates included:\ncomputer science - 9.8%; business & administrative studies - 7.4%; engineering & technology - 7.2%; mass communications & documentation - 7.2%; and creative arts & design - 7.2%.\nIn comparison, medicine and dentistry and veterinary science students had the lowest non-continuation rate at 1.5%.\nThe term non-continuation is defined as a student not having obtained the qualification they were originally aiming for. This does not take course changes into account, or students who leave within the first 50 days of the course commencement.\n\n\nBut opposition MPs said the measures amounted to a \"cap on aspiration\" that will restrict choice for young people.Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the plans were \"simply an attack on the aspirations of young people and their families by a government that wants to reinforce the class ceiling, not smash it\".Read more:More than 100,000 students try to sue universitiesUniversity bosses to meet after boycott leaves students without grades \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nGillian Keegan\n        \n\n\n\nMunira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson, accused the prime minister of being \"so out of ideas that he's dug up a new version of a policy the Conservatives have announced and then unannounced twice over\".She added: \"Universities don't want this. It's a cap on aspiration, making it harder for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go on to further study.\"But Sir Philip Augar, the former chair of the Post-18 Education and Funding Review, welcomed the policy.He told Sky News that while the OfS already has the power to issue fines and regulations on universities and courses that underperform, the plan announced today \"puts a bit of teeth into it and it means that they can actually restrict the numbers recruited onto those courses\".He added: \"I'm hoping that there's a kind of a constructive look at this and that it's a stick that's out here that never actually has to be used.\" \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusan Lapworth, the chief executive of OfS, said: \"Students from all backgrounds are entitled to expect high-quality teaching on courses that lead to successful outcomes after graduation.\"We know that many universities and colleges consistently deliver that for their students.\"But where that's not the case it's important that the OfS, as the independent regulator of higher education in England, can intervene to protect the interests of students and taxpayers.\"We look forward to continuing our work on these important issues.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64b544bd51ac332720b2e5da", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/only-32-of-40-new-hospitals-promised-by-boris-johnson-to-be-built-by-2030-and-some-may-be-too-small-audit-suggests-12921893", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Only 32 of 40 new hospitals to be built by 2030 - and some may be 'too small'", "lead": "The government is set to finish only 32 of its promised new 40 hospitals by 2030 as part of an over-budget and hard-to-deliver scheme, that might result in medical facilities that are \"too small\", according to a \"damning\" report.", "author": "\nTim Baker\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 01:26:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:40:13.298653", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-rishi-sunak-hospital_6203256.jpg?20230630110309", "body": "\nThe government is set to finish only 32 of its promised new 40 hospitals by 2030 as part of an over-budget and hard-to-deliver scheme, that might result in medical facilities that are \"too small\", according to a \"damning\" report.The National Audit Office (NAO) has completed an investigation into the programme, initiated by the 2019 Conservative manifesto and reaffirmed in October 2020.\n\n\n\nThe report lays out myriad difficulties the government faces in completing a promise first made by Boris Johnson and often repeated by the Conservative Party since.The investigation found the government is now set to miss the 40 hospitals by 2030 pledge - with at least eight facilities set to miss the close of the decade target, and it has also highlighted problems with a government plan to use mass-produced, preconstructed hospitals that could see patients unable to be treated.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the results \"shocking\" and \"damning\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nA map showing the location of the 40 new hospitals.

In November 2020 Rishi Sunak - then chancellor - told parliament they were increasing capital spending to \"fund the biggest hospital building programme in a generation - building 40 new hospitals and upgrading 70 more\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NAO points out that, after Mr Sunak made that announcement, the definition of a new hospital was changed to include a whole new hospital, a new clinical building or wing, or a major refurbishment and alteration of \"all but the main structure of an existing hospital\".The audit also points out that, at the time of Mr Johnson's October commitment, \"for most of the schemes the issue of affordability had not yet been considered\".The report states the scheme to build the 40 new hospitals by 2030 was always \"likely\" to change the timescale or scope, and \"this was not made clear to the public at the time\".May 2023: Barclay insists 40 hospital target will be met \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay at one of the few finished hospitals\n        \n\n\n\nWhat is being built?The scheme was initially split into four cohorts, although this was later expanded to five.A total of 48 hospitals make up the cohorts, as there are eight facilities which already had plans in place.Of the eight projects in the first cohort, only one counts towards the total of 40 - as the other seven were already in progress.The other four cohorts are not set to start construction until at least next year, with one of the cohort two projects also making up the eighth previously planned hospital.Cohort three and onwards are set to use \"hospital 2.0\" guidelines - where blueprints of the hospitals and construction are standardised and partially made off-site.The plans for this project have not yet been published, and there are concerns from the construction sector about whether it will be feasible to build.Furthermore, the NAO criticised a lack of transparency in how the 40 new projects were chosen, saying there was \"a failure in record keeping\" and they cannot say how the hospitals were chosen.August 2022: Majority of 40 hospitals unlikely to be finished by next election   \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nBoris Johnson promised the hospitals in 2019 and again in 2020\n        \n\n\n\nHospitals 'too small'As part of its design for the new \"hospital 2.0\", the government came up with plans for what would be the minimum viable hospital - the cheapest functioning facility.But the NAO states that this specification risks being \"too small\", and the estimated capacity of new hospitals is based on assumptions that \"may be unrealistic\" about the number of people able to be moved out of hospitals for social care.And estimates by the government that average stays will fall by 12% \"seem poorly supported by the evidence\".Furthermore, when the Department for Health and Social Care went to the Treasury for funding, it asked for \u00a321.3bn, but was instead given \u00a318.5bn.In order to find savings, the government may need to move even more schemes into the 2030s, or lower the lowest specification of the new-style hospitals further to save money, the NAO said.December 2021: Johnson accused of calling refurbishments 'new hospitals' \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsWhat are the delays?One of the key factors in the delays, according to the NAO, is issues with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete.This material, used extensively, has now been found to be unsuitable for building past around 30 years.As announced earlier this year, an extra five hospitals with the concrete have been added to the new hospitals scheme.According to the NAO, only 32 of the previously promised hospitals will now be complete by 2030 to make space for the new five projects - and the eight others will be finished in the next decade.Even this estimate is generous, as it includes regenerating facilities not previously included and splitting one project into two parts to up the figures from 31 to 32.A lack of construction contractors has also been raised - with infrastructure projects like HS2 and a lack of clarity over what the designs will be causing uncertainty. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nProjects like HS2 are taking up building resources\n        \n\n\n\nWhen will they be built, and how much will it cost?The NAO has taken an estimate of costs and time frames.Back in 2020, the government estimated it needed between \u00a320bn and \u00a330bn to build the 40 hospitals promised - plus the eight already started - by 2030.It wanted between \u00a33.7bn and \u00a316bn for the first five years - and was given \u00a33.7bn by the Treasury under Mr Sunak.As such, a decision was taken to do smaller projects first and aim at completing large ones later in the decade.In the first three years, \"slow progress\" was made on the hospitals - but three opened by June of this year, although none of them were part of the 40 new hospitals.The other five suffered delays of between one and 16 months.Cohort two was expected to start in 2022, but as of May 2023 no building had started, although \u00a311m of preconstruction work had taken place.The first of the 40 new hospitals is expected to open in late 2023, and the second in late 2025.Cohorts three and four were expected to start in 2025, and the fifth later in the 2020s.Now, the NAO reckons Cohort three will not open until 2029 or 2030. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n2:25\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state of the NHS explained\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of cost, both cohorts one and two have risen by almost 50%, overrunning by a total of \u00a31.2bn.On top of the \u00a33.7bn for the first half of the 2020s, the Treasury has indicated it will supply \u00a318.5bn for the rest of the scheme - but this was only up to 2031, and with the overrun more money could become available.Inflation will also eat into the budget, and the NAO suggest the Treasury and health department might have to renegotiate the budgets.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \"The programme has innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, delivering efficiencies and quality improvements. However, by the definition the government used in 2020 it will now deliver 32 rather than 40 new hospitals by 2030.\"Delivery so far has been slower than expected, both on individual schemes and in developing the hospital 2.0 template, which has delayed programme funding decisions.\"There are some important lessons to be drawn for major programmes from the experience of the New Hospital Programme so far. These include strengthening the business case process to improve confidence on affordability and delivery dates, and improving transparency for key decisions.\" \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:57\n\n\n\n\n\nBlair on current state of NHS\n\n\n\n\nShadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"This shocking report could not be more damning of the failing new hospitals programme.\"The so-called 40 new hospitals are over-budget, behind schedule, and may be too small. Many are not 'new', others are not 'hospitals', and there aren't 40 of them. In fact, just one hospital is on track to be built by the next election.\"A DHSC spokesperson said: \"The NAO's report acknowledges that despite changes to the original programme, 40 new hospitals are still expected to be delivered by 2030 and praises the programme's innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, deliver efficiencies and improve quality.\"We remain firmly committed to delivering these hospitals, which are now expected to be backed by over \u00a320bn of investment - helping to cut waiting lists so people can get the treatment they need quicker. Three new hospitals have already opened and more will open this year so patients and staff can benefit from major new hospital buildings, equipped with the latest technology.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64b544bd51ac332720b2e5db", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/rmt-boss-mick-lynch-criticises-keir-starmer-for-not-being-on-side-of-working-people-12921741", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "RMT boss criticises Starmer for not being on 'side of working people'", "lead": "Union boss Mick Lynch has said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has to show he is \"on the side of the people\" before the next general election.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 11:35:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:40:13.663923", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-sir-keir-starmer-mick-lynch_6220132.jpg?20230716104705", "body": "\nUnion boss Mick Lynch has said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has to show he is \"on the side of the people\" before the next general election.The general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union criticised Sir Keir and the Labour Party when asked about how long strikes on the railway could potentially go on for.\n\n\n\nHe said that despite the disturbance industrial action has caused, most people respect that RMT members have put forward a differing opinion, which opposition politicians have failed to do.Politics latest: Chances of free trade deal with US 'very low', admits Badenoch\"It's a shame that Labour and others can't show that they're distinct from the kind of consensus that got us into this trouble where working people are struggling in the cost of living crisis,\" Mr Lynch told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seems to be ignored by the political class to a certain extent.\"He said that at the minute it is a \"shame\" that people \"cannot spot the difference\" between Labour and the Conservatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nMick Lynch (R) said nobody knows what Sir Keir's five missions are\n        \n\n\n\n\"He's got to show that he's on the side of working people and progressive politics, and I don't think we've seen that,\" he said.When asked why people are not seeing this from Sir Keir, Mr Lynch hit out at the Labour leader again, saying he has five missions but \"nobody knows what they are\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He should be saying something about workers rights.

It carried on about how much Neo loved everything from summer to helping others. The tone was more soppy romance novel than snappy dating profile.Asked for something more concise, it went with: \"Health care pro, introverted Aquarius and amateur YouTuber. Summer-loving meat-eater with a weird sense of humour. Enjoys Radiohead, Coldplay, and Justin Bieber.

The AI suggested using a \"clear, well-lit headshot\", an action shot, and a candid photo to go last. Neo went to his Instagram page to find photos that matched its ideas.Once the profile was complete, each match received a response written by ChatGPT based on prompts Neo gave it about each person's profile.Talking to matchesAnyone who's used chatbots will know they can often sound a bit formal and use flowery language.Politeness can go a long way, though, and AI delivers that in spades.\"I can only imagine how tiring it can be to learn so much new information, but at least you're making progress!\" was ChatGPT's response when one of Neo's matches revealed they'd started a new job. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chatbot is also a stickler for correct grammar, punctuation, and capital letters - some way from how most people write online.

And even then we don't understand the differences properly, which is why Kat has done 3D scans of hundreds of feet, to map them.That research will end up benefiting the men's game too because Kat is also charting the differences between ethnicities. Because the default foot isn't just a man's, it's a white man's.The male is also the norm when it comes to other environmental factors, like booking a pitch.On a Thursday evening in Kent, the Gravesham Girls and Women\u2019s Football Club, founded in 1999, is training ahead of the start of the season.

Research seems to suggest that some hormones can make ligaments looser, increasing the risk of rupture.So over the course of the season Prof Elliott-Sale measures the laxity of players' knees, charting that against their hormones, and cross referencing it with other factors like match congestion.\"It's definitely a jigsaw,\" she says. \"And it's about sort of putting all the pieces together.\"But once we have all the pieces, we don't necessarily know which factor is going to play a bigger role on any given day. So it's not like all of the pieces are the same size. Some days, a particular factor that might influence this type of injury might be amplified, whereas on another day, it might be turned down.\"Biology remains a large part of the answerBut even then the difference between female and male body types - which in the past led to some dismissing women as too \"fragile\" to play traditionally male sports - may not be as much of a factor as previously thought.Because in some sports, the ACL injury discrepancy disappears. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you compare sports, where males and females start at the same age, have the same training intensity throughout their sporting life, and perform the same movements during that sport, then actually, the rupture rates equalise,\" Mr Jones, the surgeon, says.\"And a very good example for that is elite dancers. So elite dance athletes, where the males and females start their training at the same age, they perform the same pivoting, jumping, twisting movements, and they have the same intensity of training and the same conditions. If you compare their rupture rates, they're actually equalised.\"\"And what that suggests is the impact of your training and your conditioning is really essential and avoiding this injury.\"Every expert I spoke to stressed the role of strength and conditioning in preventing injury. Here, nurture influences nature.\"We have that attitude of, you know, women do yoga, and pilates and men lift heavy things in the gym,\" Ms Kryger says.\"But the reality is everyone needs to lift heavy things occasionally to prevent injuries and have a healthy body.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nEngland's Beth Mead has also been ruled out due to injuries.

He spoke to me from the men's under 23s camp there.Football Australia introduced a programme called 'Perform+', which can be worked into warm ups, that has reduced injuries, including ACLs, by 40%.And crucially, it's not just for elite players.\"This is designed so that mom and dad coaches can just go online, take down the programme, all the videos are there, there's information about how you can deliver it with your athletes, and from under-sevens through to 55-year-olds, 95-year-olds, if you want to, you can do these exercises,\" Mr Whalan says.\"The benefit of that for us at the higher end level, working with national teams, is if we have players that have been doing that, since they're 12,13,14 years old, it makes our lives a lot easier.\"That remains in the future. When the World Cup starts next week, it will do so without a host of stars.As England forward Chloe Kelly tells Sky News: \"Having suffered the ACL injury myself, it's so sad when you see so many players suffering that injury. Hopefully, we get the research that we need to stop these injuries happening so often.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64b544c251ac332720b2e5e6", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/all-the-tv-shows-and-films-affected-by-the-hollywood-writers-strike-12881315", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "All the TV shows and films affected by Hollywood actors' and writers' strike", "lead": "American actors have started \"indefinite\" strike action, joining film and television writers on the picket lines.", "author": "\nJosephine Franks\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 12:23:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:40:18.102552", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/22/12/70x70/skynews-stranger-things-netflix_5997486.jpg?20221215143052", "body": "\nAmerican actors have started \"indefinite\" strike action, joining film and television writers on the picket lines.About 160,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) have walked out, while 15,000 screenwriters who are members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) have been on strike since 2 May.\n\n\n\nFran Drescher, president of the US actors' union has said its walkout will impact \"thousands if not millions of people\".It is unclear how long this strike will last.

who had been a favourite to win in 2012 - suddenly quit the show during its live rounds, with programme-makers telling the public her departure was due to \"illness\".\n\n\n\nBut the 31-year-old has now waived her legal right to anonymity, which is granted to all rape victims, to speak out about her ordeal.Spraggan was 20 years old at the time of the attack, which she said was carried out by a hotel porter following a night out with fellow contestants.In the aftermath, she was advised to take medication to prevent HIV infection - but it made her so ill she was forced to leave the X Factor, which was won that year by James Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe singer said she had wanted to go public at the time, but was warned it might affect her future career.Spraggan later went on to have success in the music industry with two top-10 albums. Her release Join The Club reached seven in the charts in 2013, while Choices peaked at number five in 2021.But she said she was tired of not being honest with fans and wanted to speak out now because \"in order for me to rebuild myself and move on, I needed to tell the truth\".Detailing the rape in her new memoir, Process: Finding My Way Through, the singer said she had earlier been on a night out in London celebrating fellow contestant Rylan Clark's 25th birthday at Mayfair nightclub Mahiki. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more:Hollywood stars strike as productions in UK are suspendedLisa Marie Presley 'died of complications from weight loss surgery'But, after being given free alcohol, she fell unconscious and was escorted back to her hotel by a member of the production team, where a porter offered to help get her to her room.Clark then came to her room to check she was OK and make sure the room was locked, Spraggan said.However, the porter later returned with a keycard to unlock the door and attack her.She wrote: \"I woke up the next day with this sense of sheer dread. I don't think I've ever felt that level of confusion since.\"I knew that I'd been raped, but I could not process that. So I put my clothes on and went into autopilot.\"The production team quickly called the police and an arrest was made within hours.The hotel staffer later pleaded guilty and was jailed.'No one ever asked if I was OK'Spraggan said she felt let down by programme-makers and accused them of being \"unprepared\" to deal with what happened.She received both financial and medical support in the immediate aftermath, but said she was not given any further support after her attacker was convicted.Writing in her memoir, Spraggan said: \"No one ever contacted me to ask if I was OK.\"No one called or emailed when the trial was over and he was convicted. No one offered me rehabilitation or ongoing mental health treatment. I was on my own.\"She also told the Guardian: \"It was inappropriate for anybody - including contestants - to be drunk.\"How can you fulfil your duty of care when free alcohol is involved?\"Spraggan is the latest in a string of ex-reality TV stars, including former X Factor singer Rebecca Ferguson, to express concern about the treatment of contestants.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSimon Cowell said what happened to Spraggan was 'horrific and heartbreaking'\n        \n\n\n\nX Factor creator Simon Cowell, who was absent from 2012 series because he was filming America's Got Talent in the US, said in a statement: \"What happened to Lucy was horrific and heartbreaking.\"When I was given the opportunity to speak to Lucy, I was able to personally tell her how sorry I was about everything she has been through.\"Although we met under tragic circumstances, a genuine friendship and a mutual respect has developed between us.
